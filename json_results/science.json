            "Stressing, in Dr. Killian's phrase, ''the importance of civilian exploration of space for scientific purposes,'' the subcommittee, as he wrote in his memoirs, gave General Eisenhower, ''without waffling or alternatives, a recommendation for one organization that in the wrap-up was the organization, with some appropriate modifications, that won approval from him and the Congress and that has managed our space program brilliantly'' - NASA.", 
            "In July 1959, Dr. Killian resigned as science adviser, convinced, as he wrote later, ''that I had pretty well done the job that I, as a science administrator, had agreed to undertake.",
