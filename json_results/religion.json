            " Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, who led the Reform movement of American Judaism through 23 years of growth in which it opened its congregations to unaffiliated Jews, non-Jews and those born of intermarriage, and made room in its pulpits for women and gays, died early yesterday at his home in Westport, Conn.", 
            "A heavyset man of grandfatherly warmth and occasionally ribald wit, Rabbi Schindler played two major roles in American Jewish life, one religious, the other secular; either would have made him one of the most influential American Jewish leaders of the latter half of the 20th century.", 
            "In addition to serving from 1973 to 1996 as president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the governing body of Reform Judaism, Rabbi Schindler acted as the chief spokesman on behalf of the wide spectrum of American Jewry on matters relating to Israel in the late 1970's.", 
            "He wielded that megaphone as chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, a coalition of leading religious and secular groups.", 
            "In assuming the chairmanship of the coalition of Jewish organizations, he was widely assumed to be a dove, given his leadership of the more liberal Reform movement.", 
            "Among those leaders of Conservative Judaism who jousted with Rabbi Schindler was Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, a former president of the American Jewish Congress who disagreed with him fiercely on the promise of Begin's leadership and on Rabbi Schindler's explosive notion that patrilineal descent -- the Jewish lineage of one's father -- was sufficient to consider someone a Jew, even if the person's mother was non-Jewish.", 
            "'' ''There was something of the British House of Commons at international Jewish meetings, after hours,'' Rabbi Hertzberg added.", 
            "'' Rabbi Schindler's own background and distinguished bearing -- his hair had long ago turned a silvery white -- challenged the very notion of Reform Judaism as a heavily diluted version of the real thing.", 
            "He had this Jewish soul.", 
            "In 1978, Rabbi Schindler touched off a spirited and often angry debate within American Judaism when he called on Judaism to undertake an ''outreach'' program.", 
            "Responding to the increasing concern among American Jews about defections through assimilation and intermarriage, he called on American synagogues to integrate into Jewish life intermarried couples, their children, Jews unattached to congregations and non-Jews interested in converting.", 
            "''The mission of Reform Jewish outreach is not preventive, but restorative,'' Rabbi Schindler wrote in 1995, in an ''ethical will'' that he posted on the Web site of the union (www.uahc.org/conv/alex.html).", 
            "''Its purpose is to draw the intermarried back into Jewish life in the hope that the non-Jewish partners will ultimately opt for Judaism, and above all that the children of these marriages will be reared as Jews.", 
            "''But do not all these strangers in our midst tend to dilute Judaism, to water it down?", 
            "And if our standards are high and our programs are substantive, those who come from the periphery to the center, from the outside to the inside, invariably are among the first to laud and cultivate a flowering of Jewish literacy and spirituality.", 
            "'' Indeed, while the Reform Movement, the most liberal within Judaism, has emphasized the need to adapt classical Jewish beliefs to modern circumstances, Rabbi Schindler told a Reform convention in 1983 that its members should set a better example of religious commitment.", 
            "''Reform Judaism by its very nature has accorded a good deal of authority to the individual,'' he said.", 
            "Rabbi Schindler did not shy away from controversy in his public remarks directed at other branches of Judaism, or toward the country as a whole.", 
            "In the early 1980's, he lamented that evangelical Christians, including those in Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, were forging ties with Jewish leaders in New York and elsewhere, after years of mutual distrust.",
