        The man with a dangerous form of tuberculosis who flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon was identified yesterday as a 31-year-old Atlanta lawyer. Department of Homeland Security officials said he re-entered the country from Canada when a customs agent let him pass despite knowing that the man was being sought by health authorities.
        Congressional investigators, who will be holding hearings on the way the case of the man, Andrew Speaker, has been handled, say that the border agent at the Plattsburgh, N.Y., border crossing with Canada decided that Mr. Speaker did not look sick and so let him go.
        Russ Knocke, press secretary for the Homeland Security Department, would not confirm the agent's rationale for releasing the man, saying only that the case was under investigation by its internal affairs and inspector general's offices.
        And in yet another twist to a story that seems to grow murkier with each new revelation, Mr. Speaker's father-in-law, Robert C. Cooksey, is a tuberculosis researcher who has worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
        Dr. Cooksey said he ''was not involved in any decisions my son-in-law made regarding his travel.'' He also said that he was often tested for tuberculosis and had never been found to be infected.
        The centers said that the strain of tuberculosis that Mr. Speaker has does not match any of the strains in its laboratories. And Dr. Cooksey said, ''My son-in-law's TB did not originate from myself or the C.D.C.'s labs, which operate under the highest levels of biosecurity.''
        The form of tuberculosis Mr. Speaker has is extremely resistant to standard antibiotics.
        Although health officials said there was a low risk of Mr. Speaker's transmitting tuberculosis to his fellow passengers, the case raised troubling new questions about the nation's ability to defend its borders against the entry of dangerous infectious diseases and about the C.D.C.'s ability to handle such threats, despite extensive training exercises. Mr. Speaker's odyssey has also set off an international hunt for his fellow passengers.
        Mr. Speaker came back into the United States at Plattsburgh, N.Y., at 6:18 p.m. on May 24 in a car he had rented at Pierre Trudeau International Airport in Montreal after flying there from Prague on Czech Air.
        A day earlier, on May 23, the disease control centers alerted the Atlanta office of Customs and Border Protection, a part of the Homeland Security Department, that a man with a serious medical condition might try to enter the United States and the information was entered in the department's computer system.
        The department instructed any border control agents who encountered the man to ''isolate, detain and contact the Public Health Service,'' Mr. Knocke said.
        If Canadian officials had known about the detention order, a quarantine officer would have isolated Mr. Speaker, escorted him to a hospital and arranged his secure transport back to the United States, said Jean Riverin, a spokesman for the Public Health Agency of Canada.
        Also, Italian officials said that they did not learn about the case until Mr. Speaker had left Italy. Cesare Fasari, a spokesman for Italy's Health Ministry, said that had the Italian health officials been notified in time, they would have ''intercepted the man and invited him to be treated in a hospital'' with his permission.
        Early yesterday morning, the disease control centers flew Mr. Speaker, who wore a mask, in a chartered plane to Denver, where he was taken by ambulance to National Jewish Medical and Research Center for definitive treatment of his infection.
        Dr. Gwen A. Huitt, an infectious-disease expert at the centers, described Mr. Speaker as tired, cooperative, emotional and concerned about the publicity his case was receiving. He was not coughing, had no fever and was ''very relieved to be in Denver'' for definitive treatment. If tests determine that the infection is confined to one area of a lung, doctors may perform major surgery to remove a part or lobe.
        Whatever drug treatment Mr. Speaker receives is expected to continue for years and will involve risks of side effects that could damage his kidneys and liver, Dr. Huitt said.
        Mr. Speaker is being confined to a standard two-bed hospital room that is equipped with special ventilation to suck out air and then pass it through ultraviolet light and a filter that kills microbes. He is likely to be confined to the room for several weeks.
        After examining Mr. Speaker yesterday, Dr. Huitt said she was ''very optimistic'' about his future because he was young and athletic.
        At a news conference, Dr. Huitt said her initial impression was that Mr. Speaker contracted the dangerous strain from someone else and did not develop resistance from anti-tuberculosis treatment that C.D.C. officials said he took earlier. Treatment in Denver will probably start today, she said.
        Dr. Huitt said Mr. Speaker had traveled extensively over the last six years to countries where tuberculosis is more common than in this country, but she declined to say where.
        At the time of the news conference early afternoon, Denver time, she said few tests had been performed.
        One key test was encouraging. It indicated that Mr. Speaker was at low risk of transmitting the infection to others. The test involved collecting sputum from induced coughing. Dr. Huitt and others added chemical stains to a smear of the sputum on a glass slide and examined it under a microscope. They saw no tuberculosis bacteria. The same findings came from tests performed in Atlanta earlier in the year and at Bellevue Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital in recent days.
        Dr. Huitt said her team would repeat the test over the next two days, for a total of three times, as is standard practice.
        In 17 percent of tuberculosis cases the source is a patient whose smear is negative, according to studies from Vancouver, British Columbia, and San Francisco.
        Mr. Speaker's wife is with him. A skin test performed earlier in the year showed that she was not infected.
        ''We have not done any new tests on her,'' Dr. Huitt said. Exactly what Mr. Speaker was told about traveling, and when, remains uncertain.
        Mr. Speaker's father, Ted, told CNN that Fulton County health officials knew of the travel plans for the wedding. The groom-to-be asked if he was barred from going. Health officials said that they told him they ''preferred'' that he not go, but did not tell him not to go.
        Ted Speaker said he and his family had tested negative for tuberculosis.
        Andrew Speaker flew to Paris from Atlanta on Air France Flight 285 (Delta co-share 8517) on May 12 for his wedding in Greece, and planned to return from a honeymoon on June 5.
        Jason Vik, 21, a passenger on the outgoing flight who just graduated from the University of South Carolina, Aiken, is now waiting for results of a TB skin test.
        Mr. Vik spoke angrily about Mr. Speaker's behavior. ''He stepped on a plane with 487 people, one of the largest aircraft that Boeing makes, and he put us all at risk, just so he could go get married,'' he said.
        Dr. Mario Raviglione, who directs the World Health Organization tuberculosis department, said that despite technology and communication technology ''we're not there yet, and there is the possibility for infectious people to cross borders without the knowledge of authorities.''
        Correction:  June 5, 2007, Tuesday  An article on Friday about the travels of a patient with a dangerous form of tuberculosis misidentified the flight that the patient, Andrew Speaker, took from Atlanta to Paris on May 12. It was Air France Flight 385, not 285. (As the article noted, the flight was also designated Delta 8517.) Because of an editing error, the article misidentified the point where Mr. Speaker crossed the border from Canada when he re-entered the country on May 24. It was Champlain, N.Y., not Plattsburgh, which is just south of Champlain.
