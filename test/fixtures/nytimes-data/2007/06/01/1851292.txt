        To the Editor:
        In ''Small Incidents Are Creating a Big Problem With the N.Y.P.D.'' (column, May 29), Bob Herbert writes that police harassment of black and Hispanic young people is ''often the norm'' rather than ''unusual police behavior.''
        Such behavior is extremely disturbing, but it should not be considered in a vacuum.
        What is also disturbing are police policies that have criminalized the exercise of First Amendment activities in New York City, including the unjustified arrests and excessive detention of nearly 2,000 people during the Republican Convention in 2004; the questionable surveillance of individuals and groups before that convention; and the continuing police harassment of bicyclists during monthly Critical Mass bike rides.
