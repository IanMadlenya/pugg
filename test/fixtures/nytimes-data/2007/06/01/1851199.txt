        Before heading off on your summer vacation, beach reading in tow, you have another chance to join Lawrence Wright, above, on his disturbing voyage into the netherworld of international terrorism. Mr. Wright brings ''My Trip to Al-Qaeda,'' his illuminating monologue about the rise of the Islamist movement, to Town Hall for two more performances next week, a follow-up to its popular Off Broadway run at the Culture Project this spring. A staff writer for The New Yorker, Mr. Wright is an expert on Mr. bin Laden and friends. His deeply researched book ''The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,'' from which this show is adapted, just won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction. Directed by Gregory Mosher, Mr. Wright's friendly lecture (with slides and video) mixes contemporary history with his personal observations about the widening schism between Western values and the rigid tenets of Islamic fundamentalism. It provides a gripping, intimate and informed account of the web of social, economic and political factors that gave rise to the conflicts now inflaming the Middle East. (Tuesday and Wednesday at 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, 212-307-4100; $25 and $40.)
