        Re ''Treating the Awkward Years'' (April 24): As a teenager and patient, I was interested to read the recent article on adolescent medicine. However, while the article suggested that adolescents need specially trained doctors who can discuss ''teenagers' issues,'' I find that the problem lies not in what doctors discuss with us but in how they discuss it.
        I don't expect my doctor to be my therapist, as this article seemed to suggest. I simply expect him to meet my eyes when he speaks to me, explain why I must take certain medications or have certain tests done, and to listen my concerns. All of this is well within the ability, indeed, the responsibility, of a pediatrician or family practitioner.
