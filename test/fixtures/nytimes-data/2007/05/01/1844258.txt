        Re ''M.I.T.'s Admissions Dean Resigns; Ends 28-Year Lie About Degrees'' (front page, April 27):
        One should not lie about one's formal qualifications. But on the other hand, as your article made clear, Marilee Jones had been doing the job well for a decade.
        She was a known quantity at M.I.T. when she was hired as its dean of admissions, having already worked at the institution for many years.
        If she could, and did, do this job well without a degree, why should she -- or anyone -- need a degree to be hired for it?
