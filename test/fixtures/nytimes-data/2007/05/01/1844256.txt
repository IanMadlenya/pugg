        Re ''Diplomacy at Its Worst'' (column, April 29):
        Bravo to Nicholas D. Kristof for publishing a document showing Iranian willingness to reach a ''grand bargain'' with the United States in 2003. It shows what is missing in the current debate about Iran.
        Even moderates like Senator Barack Obama say that the United States should ''never take the military option off the table'' but that ''our first line of offense'' against Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program should be ''ratcheting up the economic pressure.''
        But this coercive diplomacy will fail, because countries like Iran seek nuclear weapons to counter insecurity and isolation. Then we will be left with a disastrous war.
        All Americans have heard accusations that Iran supports terrorism, but few have heard Iranian concerns that we protect the Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, a group the State Department itself has listed as a terrorist organization.
        It is past time to end the Bush administration's failed policy of regime change and its nuclear double standard. Meanwhile, Congress must pass legislation forbidding the president to attack Iran without specific Congressional authorization.
