        Alexander Haagen III is an unfamiliar figure to the tens of thousands of music fans who converged in the California desert this past weekend for the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. But more than any rock hero, he wields profound influence here: he is the real estate developer who owns the Empire Polo Club, the gilt-edged grounds where the festival is staged.
        Bands like Rage Against the Machine and the Red Hot Chili Peppers may provide the talent, but the subtle star of the festival is the location itself: more than 70 acres of verdant polo fields, where fans watch the show while lounging on the lawn, which is framed by rows of palm trees and surveys the mountains beyond. As many as 60,000 fans converged here each day, with roughly one-fourth of them camping nearby.
        If Coachella is their modern Woodstock -- and for many it is -- then Mr. Haagen is their Max Yasgur, the dairy farmer who allowed his fields to be used for that festival in 1969. But Mr. Haagen, who built the polo grounds two decades ago, is a very different sort of benefactor. Coachella has become big business: the festival, which expanded from two days to three this year, had box office sales of over $10 million last year.
        Yet even as the event has built an international reputation with its eclectic lineup -- and the sense of community it creates among fans trekking into the desert -- the organizers remain dependent on the venue. As a result, they are betting on the willingness of Mr. Haagen to play host to it while forgoing potentially lucrative land development deals.
        Paul Tollett, head of Goldenvoice, the concert promoter who created the festival in 1999, said that last year he signed a new long-term deal to ensure that Coachella remains at the polo grounds, though he declined to detail the agreement. Mr. Tollett, who is staging a new event -- the Stagecoach country music festival -- on the same grounds next weekend said one motivation was to create new revenue for Mr. Haagen and foster his continued support for running mass events there instead of building condominiums.
        ''Obviously, that's very prime real estate,'' Mr. Tollett said. ''What I wanted to do was come through for him for a couple of shows to make it worth his while.''
        Mr. Haagen, who is in his 60s and who rarely grants interviews, said in a brief encounter Saturday night that ''I like to see people have a good time,'' and that his commitment to the festival was ''long range.''
        For Mr. Haagen, Coachella has also come to represent an annual chance to entertain friends and business associates, who watch the proceedings from white folding chairs on a canopied terrace overlooking the main stage area. His family participates, too: one of Mr. Haagen's sons, Andrew, is the event's resident photographer, receiving greater access than press photographers and maintaining his own portrait studio amid the private artist encampment.
        But several people who have conducted business with the festival's organizers said the relationship between Mr. Haagen and the promoters has been a trying one. Mr. Haagen ''usually has these guys tearing their hair out trying to appease him,'' said Tim Vail, a veterinarian who owns an equine hospital nearby, and who rented some of his property to organizers for parking this year.
        Coachella has been credited with reviving large-scale music festivals in America. Mr. Tollett has said the model for the event is the European festivals like Glastonbury (which is controlled by Michael Eavis, a farmer who runs both the land and the festival). But since such events often require big, unconventional sites, concert organizers may find themselves dealing more regularly with property owners who lack experience or interest in the live-entertainment business.
        Some promoters are tempted to sidestep that hurdle. Earlier this year, organizers of the annual Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tenn., purchased 500 acres of land from the farmer who owned the property that housed the event. Ashley Capps, one of the concert organizers, said they sought direct control of the land to install water and electrical lines -- and to remove any doubts about the farm as a venue.
        Mr. Capps said the producers' relations with the landowner ''was not peaches and cream.'' Though he adds that ''it never got terrible,'' he said that ''farmers who own large pieces of land tend to be very individualistic in their thinking.''
        Mr. Haagen's first encounter with accommodating a big rock concert was in 1993, when Goldenvoice helped arrange a performance on the polo grounds by Pearl Jam. Six years later, Mr. Tollett sought out Mr. Haagen again when he needed a locale for Coachella. But the first festival posted a loss, forcing Goldenvoice to the edge of financial ruin.
        AEG Live, a bigger concert promoter, acquired the company in 2001 by absorbing its debt, which exceeded $1 million, according to executives involved in the deal. Goldenvoice had been unable to mount a festival in 2000, but returned to the polo fields with Coachella in 2001 and has every year since.
        Mr. Haagen has earned a reputation as a hard-nosed deal-maker in the real estate world -- and as a politically connected one. In years past, his family has contributed generously to the campaigns of local and statewide political candidates, and Mr. Haagen has become a regular, though modest, donor to the Republican Party.
        He spent much of his career working at the commercial real estate company started by his father, a former welder and merchant marine who after World War II started buying up corner lots to be resold to oil companies and turned into service stations. But the Haagens ultimately made their reputation by building retail shopping centers in the inner city.
        By the late 1990s, though, the company was laden with debt. An affiliate of the investment bank Lazard agreed to purchase a stake in the Haagens' company for $235 million in 1997, and then bought the family out.
        As alternative rock fans swarmed over his property this weekend, Mr. Haagen seemed to play the silent patron contentedly enough. On Saturday night, Mr. Haagen, wearing a white cowboy hat and a black Coachella T-shirt, held court on his private terrace, surrounded by his guests, palm trees and a pond filled with lily pads.
        On Sunday night, during Rage Against the Machine's festival-closing set, a couple of young fans from the V.I.P. section scaled the fence into Mr. Haagen's domain. While they were quickly ejected, some of his panicked guests hurriedly made for the exits.
