        James E. Bristol, a former Lutheran minister and longtime activist for the American Friends Service Committee in the United States and overseas, died Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 80 years old.
        The committee said the cause of death was heart disease.
        Mr. Bristol, a graduate of Gettysburg College and the Philadelphia Lutheran Theological Seminary, spent five decades working for pacifist causes. He was the pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in Camden, N.J., from 1935 to 1943. While he was pastor he spent 18 months in Federal prison for refusing to be drafted.
        Mr. Bristol worked with the Friends Service Committee for 30 years, retiring in 1977, and continued to do work for the committee until 1986.
        He was the director of the Quaker International Center in New Delhi when he accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta, on a monthlong tour of the Indian subcontinent in 1959. Mr. Bristol later worked in Africa, including Zambia after it became an independent republic in 1964.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Miller; two daughters, Leigh Bristol-Kagan of St. Paul and Tina Bristol of Germantown, Pa., and three grandchildren.
