        Dr. William Edward Bunney Sr., a biochemist who was formerly a director and vice president of E. R. Squibb and Sons in charge of worldwide manufacturing, died Jan. 8 at the University of California-Irvine Medical Center while on a family visit to Southern California. He was 89 years old and lived in Surry, Me.
        His family said he died of heart failure.
        Dr. Bunney, who held a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois, took part as a researcher in the discovery of an essential amino acid in humans, worked to stabilize diphtheria toxin for use as a vaccine and helped develop DPT, a single-shot vaccine still used to immunize children against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus.
        During World War II, he received an award on behalf of Squibb from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who cited the company's role in developing methods for the large-scale production of penicillin, which was beginning to save countless lives. Years later, President John F. Kennedy asked him to head one of the first scientific exchange missions to the Soviet Union.
        Dr. Bunney, who was born in Tacoma, Wash., started his career in the antitoxin and vaccine laboratories of the Massachusetts State Department of Public Health in 1927, moved to the laboratories of the Michigan Health Department in 1931 and joined Squibb in 1938 as director of biological products. He became a vice president in 1952 and retired in 1965.
        Dr. Bunney, an accomplished baritone, was a soloist in several church choirs. Having spent his summers in Surry for many years, he also sang with a local opera society, the Surry Opera Company, and joined it on a Russian tour two years ago at the age of 87.
        Dr. Bunney is survived by his two sons, Dr. William E. Bunney Jr. of Laguna Beach, Calif., and Dr. Benjamin S. Bunney of Guilford, Conn., and six grandchildren.
