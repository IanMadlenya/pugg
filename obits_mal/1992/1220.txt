        Newman T. Halvorson, a former partner of the Ernst & Young accounting firm, died on Oct. 19 at University Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio. He was 84 years old.
        His death was reported yesterday by a spokesman for Ernst & Young, Marc Eiger, who said the cause of death was congestive heart failure.
        Born in Blair, Wis., Mr. Halvorson joined the Detroit office of Ernst & Ernst, a predecessor to Ernst & Young, as a certified public accountant in 1930 after graduating that year from the University of Wisconsin. He moved to the firm's Cleveland office in 1954 and retired in 1972. Mr. Halvorson was a consultant to the firm after his retirement.
        He was also a board member and former president of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Virginia; a son, Newman T. Jr., of Washington; two daughters, Sigfrid Freese and Karen Hillhouse, both of Denver, and seven grandchildren.
