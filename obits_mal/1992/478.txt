        The Rev. Marshall Moran, an American-born priest regarded as the pioneer of modern education in Nepal, has died at the age of 85, his school announced today.
        Father Moran, a Jesuit who spent more than 40 years in the Himalayan Hindu kingdom, died in a New Delhi hospital on Tuesday night, several weeks after learning he had cancer, the school said.
        In 1951 he became one of the first foreigners to move to Nepal, then a remote and little-known land that let in very few foreigners. He became a Nepali citizen in 1956.
        Father Moran set up a boys school at Godavari, just outside Katmandu. It was the first modern educational institution in the country and among its graduates are many members of the Nepali elite, including the husbands of King Birendra's three sisters.
