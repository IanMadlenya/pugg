        Aldo Clement Podesta, a retired fund-raising executive and former member of the Rye, N.Y., Board of Education, died on Saturday at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 72 years old and lived in Rye.
        He died suddenly as a result of adverse reactions to medication, his family said.
        Mr. Podesta spent more than 45 years as a fund-raising executive, most recently as senior vice president with the consulting firm of Brakeley John Price Jones Inc. in Stamford, Conn. He was the author of the 1984 book "Raising Funds From America's 2,000,000 Overlooked Corporations."
        He served on the school board from 1969 to 1974, was a past chairman of the Rye Recreation Commission and a founding board member of the Rye Performing Arts Center.
        He is survived by three daughters, Sandra P. MacDougall of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., Lauren Podesta of Marston Mills, Mass., and Susan Podesta of the Bronx, and a sister, Theodora Farrell, also of the Bronx.
