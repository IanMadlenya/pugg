        Arthur Karasz, who headed the World Bank's European office from 1968 until his retirement in 1973, died on Wednesday at his home in Paris. He was 84 years old.
        His family said he died of respiratory failure.
        Mr. Karasz, a native of what is now Cluj, Romania, earned a law degree from the University of Budapest and served in World War II as a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Hungary, charged with trying to safeguard the country's Jewish population. After the postwar Communist takeover of Hungary, he immigrated to the United States, where he taught finance at the New School for Social Research in New York in 1949 and 1950 and at De Paul University in Chicago from 1950 to 1953.
        In 1955 he joined the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Washington and was posted to Bangkok before becoming director of the European office in Paris. He was a former president of the Hungarian League for Human Rights, also based in Paris.
        Mr. Karasz is survived by his wife, Eva; his daughters, Szuszanna Lipsky of London and Fruszina Marsh of Clinton, Conn.; his son, Peter, of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
