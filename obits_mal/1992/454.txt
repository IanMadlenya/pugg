        Jean-Francois Daigre, the surviving partner in the Valerian Rybar & Daigre Design Corporation of New York and Paris, once one of the world's most expensive decorating and architectural design firms, died on Saturday in a hospital in Paris. He was 56 years old and lived in Paris.
        Mr. Daigre, a former Manhattan resident, died after a long AIDS-related illness, a director of the firm, Jorge A. Ferrari, said in Paris.
        The French-born Mr. Daigre was looking forward to a career in art when, at the age of 19, he was hired to work for Christian Dior. Mr. Dior recognized his talent for decor and had him design window displays as well as textiles and packaging.
        Mr. Daigre and Mr. Rybar joined forces in 1968 when they were asked to stage a spectacular ball. They spent a year preparing for the party, given for 1,000 guests by Mr. and Mrs. Antenor Patino at Quinta Patino, their 200-acre estate in Cascais, Portugal.
        The partnership catered to some of the world's wealthiest clients, designing lavish houses and gardens as well as decor for luxury commercial properties. While functioning mainly as the businessman in the firm, Mr. Daigre also continued to have a hand in the preparation of gala parties.
        Mr. Rybar died two years ago, and Mr. Ferrari said the company was being dissolved.
        Mr. Daigre left no immediate survivors.
