        Anthony Astrachan, a writer, editor and former foreign correspondent for The Washington Post, died on Monday at New York University Medical Center. He was 59 years old and lived in Hoboken, N.J.
        He died of a heart attack, said his son Joshua, of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Astrachan was the author of the 1986 book "How Men Feel: Their Responses to Women's Demands for Equality and Power." The book, for which he conducted nearly 400 interviews over 9 years, examined men's attitudes toward women and their changing roles in the work place and the family.
        Mr. Astrachan, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Yale University in 1952. Before joining The Washington Post in 1965, he was an information officer in Africa with the Agency for International Development. He became The Post's African correspondent in 1967, and two years later was named to head its Moscow bureau. He was also the newspaper's bureau chief at the United Nations from 1971-73. Most recently, he was a medical writer and a senior editor at Maclean-Hunter Medical Publications, where he was responsible for Hospital Practice and MD magazines.
        In addition to his son Joshua, he is survived by his wife, Rhea Gaisner, and another son, Owen, of Durham, N.C. His previous marriages to Gail Lovejoy, the mother of his sons, and the writer Susan Jacoby ended in divorce.
