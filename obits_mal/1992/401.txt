        Dr. Charles Howard Kline, an international consultant to manufacturers of chemicals and related products, died on Thursday at his home in Kinnelon, N.J. He was 73 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        A marketing consultant specializing in product strategy, Dr. Kline founded Kline & Company in 1959. The company is based in Fairfield, N.J. with a subsidiary in Brussels and affiliates in Japan, Canada, Australia and Singapore. He was president of the company until six years ago, when he became an adviser to the board of directors. He remained in that role informally after a management buy-out in 1990.
        He came to New York in 1952 to join the Climax Molybdenum Company. In 1956 he became scientific director of Shulton Inc., the toiletries maker, in Clifton, N.J. There, he developed the expertise in specialty chemicals that prompted him to set out on his own three years later.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Emily Porter; three sons, Philip, of Downington, Pa., John, of Montreal, and Thomas, of Kinnelon; a daughter, Caroline Kline Sassone of Belvidere, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
