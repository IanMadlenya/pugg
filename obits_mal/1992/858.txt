        Theophil C. Kammholz, a Chicago lawyer who argued before the United States Supreme Court as general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board in the 1950's, died on Saturday in Houston. He was 83 years old and lived in Winnetka, Ill.
        He was in declining health recently, but the immediate cause of his death was unclear, said one of his partners, James S. Petrie. He was staying with his daughter when he died.
        At his death, Mr. Kammholz was a longtime partner in the Chicago-based law firm of Vedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, which he helped found in 1952. He was also a member of its management committee. The firm now has 170 lawyers and offices in New York and Washington. Before the High Court
        His clients over the years included General Electric Company, the Campbell Soup Company, Carrier Corporation and R. R. Donnelly & Sons.
        It was from 1955 to 1957, in the Eisenhower Adminstration, that Mr. Kammholz was the N.L.R.B.'s general counsel. One legal victory for the board came in a case he argued before the Supreme Court in 1957. The Court found that employees who went on strike while a contract was in effect did not necessarily lose the protection of the Taft-Hartley Act. The Court thereby upheld an N.L.R.B. finding.
        Mr. Kammholz argued unsuccessfully for the board in another notable case in which the Supreme Court, in 1956, ruled that a non-Communist oath taken falsely by a union officer did not expose the union to penalty even if the union members were aware of it. In so ruling, the Court reversed the N.L.R.B.
        A native of Wisconsin and a graduate of the University of Wisconsin Law School, Mr. Kammholz was married in 1935 to Lura Walker, who died several years ago.
        He is survived by a sister, Ruth Burger of Galesburg, Ill.; his daughter, Dr. Carolyn Hudson of Houston; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
