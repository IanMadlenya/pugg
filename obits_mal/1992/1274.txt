        William Cole, a freelance writer whose articles appeared in many popular magazines, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and had lived in Manhattan for 60 years.
        Mr. Cole died of heart failure, said Maxine J. Lewis, a friend.
        Mr. Cole was born in Manhattan. He was a graduate of Lehigh University.
        He was an anthologist who collected poetry into more than 60 books and an author who wrote short stories and numerous articles on health, family relations and other social issues for Good Housekeeping, Family Circle and The Ladies' Home Journal.
        He also wrote reports for the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies and wrote the scripts for documentary films for the United States Information Service.
        There are no immediate survivors.
        Correction:  November 3, 1992, Tuesday
        An obituary on Friday about William Cole, a freelance writer, credited some work to him erroneously. Mr. Cole wrote short stories and magazine articles, but he was not a poetry anthologist.
