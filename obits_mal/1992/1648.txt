        George R. Hughes, an Egyptologist and a former director of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, died on Dec. 21 at the university's Medical Center. He was 85 and lived in Chicago.
        He died of complications of a bladder infection, said William Harms, a spokesman for the university.
        At his death, Dr. Hughes was an adviser for the university's development of a Demotic dictionary, which will deal with the widely used form of Egyptian writing used from the 7th century B.C. to nearly A.D. 500.
        Dr. Hughes was particularly known for his 1965 translation of a Coptic prayer book that was found at a monastery that was to be flooded by waters behind the Aswan High Dam. The book, 17 pages of parchment in almost perfect condition, is believed to date from the 10th or 11th centuries.
        He was also field director for the Oriental Institute's survey of the ancient temples at Luxor from 1949 to 1964.
        Starting at the institute in 1934 as a research assistant, he was named a professor of Egyptology in 1961 and was director of the institute from 1968 to 1972. He retired in 1973.
        Born in Wymore, Neb., Dr. Hughes graduated from the University of Nebraska and from McCormick Theological Seminary, in Chicago. He received a doctorate in Egyptology from the University of Chicago in 1939.
        He is author of many articles and seven books, including, "Reliefs and Inscriptions at Karnak, Volume 3," (1954) and "The Beit el-Wali Temple of Ramesses II" (1967), both published by Oriental Institute Publications.
        He is survived by his wife, Maurine.
