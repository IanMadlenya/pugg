        Jorge Donn, a longtime lead dancer for Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the 20th Century, died on Monday in Lausanne, Switzerland. He was 45 years old.
        He died after a long illness, a statement to the press from the Bejart company said. It did not identify the cause of death.
        Mr. Donn was a dancer of lithe sensuousness and dramatic intensity. He was born in Buenos Aires, and began studying dance at the age of 4, receiving his professional training at the Teatro Colon Ballet School there. After an apprenticeship with the Colon company, he joined the Bejart troupe in 1963 and soon became a foremost interpreter of its style.
        He originated many roles in Mr. Bejart's ballets, from "Ninth Symphony," created in 1964, to "1789 . . . et Nous," created in 1989. In 1990, he appeared in the title role in a revival of Mr. Bejart's 1971 "Nijinsky, Clown of God," appearing opposite the Argentine actress Cipe Lincovsky. Mr. Donn was also a noted Romeo in Mr. Bejart's dance version of the Shakespeare classic.
        Mr. Donn served as partner to Suzanne Farrell both in the Bejart company and when he joined the New York City Ballet as a guest artist in 1977. He also performed in the Claude Lelouch film "Les Uns et les Autres" in 1981, and appeared in the Raul Garello musical "Danza del Fueye" this year.
        Mr. Donn was the subject of a 1972 Belgian television film, "Le Danseur." He received the Critics Prize of Buenos Aires in 1968 and the Dancemagazine Award in 1979, when he was honored for his "magnetic star quality and his total dedication to Bejart."
