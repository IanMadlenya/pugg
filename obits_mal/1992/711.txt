        Martin Goodman, who as founder and publisher for many years of Marvel Comics invented such popular characters as Captain America and Spiderman, died on June 6 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 84 years old. He also lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Goodman died of natural causes, said his son, Charles.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Goodman finished high school and then used his talent for drawing and animation to establish himself as a comic artist. During the 1930's he supplied comic strips to other publishers.
        As the Nazi regime in Germany began to threaten Europe and Japan began to pursue an expansionist course in Asia, Mr. Goodman founded Marvel Comics in the late 1930's with Captain America as his first character "to express his feelings about what the United States stood for," Charles Goodman said.
        In 1968 Mr. Goodman sold Marvel Comics and retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; three children, Iden, of Berkeley, Calif., Charles, of Manhattan, and Amy Sullivan, of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 17, 1992, Wednesday
        An obituary on Thursday about Martin Goodman, the founder and longtime publisher of Marvel Comics, misidentified the creator of Captain America. The comic-book character was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, not by Mr. Goodman.
