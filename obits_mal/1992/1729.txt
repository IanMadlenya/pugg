        John R. Connolly, a professional fund-raiser for charitable causes and educational institutions, died on Friday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of AIDS, said his companion, Richard Clausen.
        Mr. Connolly was a consultant to the Melanoma Vaccine Project at New York University Medical Center. In 1989-90 he was the development director of God's Love We Deliver, an AIDS service organization, when its fund-raising doubled to $1.5 million a year.
        Earlier he was the development director of the Skin Cancer Foundation from 1987-89, associate director of foundation and corporate relations at Rockefeller University from 1983-86, associate director of development at Yale Medical School in 1983 and director of corporate relations and senior development officer at New York University from 1979-83.
        Mr. Connolly was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and grew up there and in Yonkers and Kent, Conn. He was a graduate of Illinois Wesleyan University. A conscientious objector, he fulfilled his military service as a volunteer for the World Health Organization working on contraceptive programs in China.
        Besides his companion, Mr. Connolly's survivors include his mother, Grace of Boynton Beach, Fla., and two sisters, Maureen Connolly of Boynton Beach and Betty Kelman of Danbury, Conn.
