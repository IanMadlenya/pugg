        Desmond Winter Hall, an author and former magazine editor and owner, died Wednesday at the Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 82 years old and lived in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.
        He died of pneumonia, said his daughter, Katherine Hall Ryan of Park Slope.
        Mr. Hall's writings included "I Give You Oscar Wilde" (New American Library, 1965), a novel about the 19th-century poet, wit and dramatist.
        Mr. Hall contributed articles and fiction, including science fiction, to The Atlantic, Esquire, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines. He also worked as a literary agent.
        He was an early editor of Mademoiselle magazine, and in the 1970's he acquired 16 Magazine, a monthly for teen-agers. It was sold to McFadden Publications earlier this year.
        Mr. Hall was born in Sydney, Australia, the son of two New Zealanders: Winter Hall, an actor, and Katherine Young, a concert pianist. The family later moved to Hollywood, and Desmond Hall spent most of his adult life in New York.
        He served in the Army Air Force in World War II. His 1935 marriage to Violet Pillault ended in divorce in 1943.
        In addition to Mrs. Ryan, who was formerly the publisher of 16 Magazine, Mr. Hall is survived by another daughter, Suzanne Cooper of London, and three grandchildren.
