        Martin Gregg, a producer of entertainments and theater for children, died on Sunday at Mercy Hospital in San Diego. He was 51 years old and lived in San Diego.
        He died of AIDS-related causes, said his companion, Milton Arroyo.
        Mr. Gregg was the president of the North Park Theater Foundation, which he established in 1990 to renovate and reopen that San Diego theater. The theater is now a state historic building.
        After graduating from high school in San Diego, Mr. Gregg moved to New York City to pursue a career in theater. He began to stage shows for children in 1965, and a few years later he became a co-founder and the executive director of the Robert F. Kennedy Theater for Children in Manhattan, which closed in 1976.
        Starting out with a converted boat trailer, he toured the five boroughs to entertain poor children. His troupe also performed in children's hospital wards and eventually took over a building on West 48th Street in Manhattan where pornographic films had previously been shown.
        He returned to San Diego in the early 1980's to establish the California Performing Arts Center for Children.
        In addition to Mr. Arroyo, Mr. Gregg is survived by his mother, Eunice Peterson-Swan, and two sisters, Dr. Patricia Cummins and Hazel Isom, all of San Diego, and a brother, Michael Griggs of Santee, Calif.
