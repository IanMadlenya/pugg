        The Rev. Thomas A. McGrath, a psychologist and professor emeritus of psychology at Fairfield University, died last Sunday in a one-car accident in Westport, Conn., a university announcement said. He was 73 years old and lived on campus in Fairfield, Conn.
        Father McGrath, a native of Quincy, Mass., entered the Society of Jesus in 1937, was ordained a priest in 1950 and held a Ph.D. in psychology from Fordham University. He joined the Fairfield faculty in 1957 and headed the psychology department for 11 years in the 1960's and 1970's. He became a full professor in 1969 and retired three years ago.
        Father McGrath is survived by four sisters, Margaret Boyle and Elizabeth Bowler, of Braintree, Mass., Mary McMahon, of Wellesley, Mass., and Rita Carroll, of Elberson, N.J., and a brother, John, of Clearwater, Fla.
