        James Mark, a talent agent who was a prototype of the colorful agents celebrated in Woody Allen's film "Broadway Danny Rose," died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his son, Laurence, a film producer in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Mark was born in Brooklyn and got his start in show business as a vaudeville dancer. After returning to New York from military service in World War II, he became an agent and concentrated on booking entertainers to Catskill Mountain resorts. From the late 1940's through the early 70's, he represented performers like Zero Mostel, Myron Cohen, Buddy Hackett, Red Buttons, Jan Murray, Alan King, Pat Cooper and Leslie Uggams.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Lucy, of Manhattan.
