        Ernest R. Acker, a utility executive who retired as head of the Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corporation in 1964 after 45 years with the company, died on Friday in the Caleb Hitchcock nursing home in Bloomfield, Conn. A former resident of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., he was 96 years old.
        A company spokesman said he died of pneumonia.
        The utility he led provides natural gas and electricity to communities along the Hudson from north of Westchester to just south of Albany. The cities of Poughkeepsie, Beacon, Newburgh and Kingston lie in its service area.
        Mr. Acker joined the engineering department of Central Hudson in 1919 when its longtime president, Thaddeus R. Beal, offered him a $100-a-month job.
        Mr. Acker was made a director in 1926 and succeeded Mr. Beal in 1932 as president and general manager. He was elected chairman in 1960, retaining the post of chief executive officer until his retirement four years later.
        A native of East Orange, N.J., Mr. Acker received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Cornell University in 1917. He enlisted in the Army Engineering Corps that year and was discharged as a first lieutenant at the end of World War I.
        He was a past president of both the Edison Electric Institute and the American Gas Association. He served as a member of the Federal Gas Industry Advisory Council, being appointed by a succession of Secretaries of the Interior in the 1950's.
        Mr. Acker is survived by a son, Ernest Jr., of Manhattan; a sister, Mary Elizabeth Lyman of San Rafael, Calif., and a daughter-in-law, Kay Acker of North Granby, Conn.
