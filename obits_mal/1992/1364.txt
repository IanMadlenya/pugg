        Leonard Zissu, an authority on copyright law and a founding member of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A., died on Sunday at the Green Manor Nursing Home in Ghent, N.Y. He was 83 years old and lived in Ancramdale, N.Y.
        Mr. Zissu died of cancer, his wife, Joyce said.
        Mr. Zissu was a founder of the Manhattan law firm of Zissu, Stein & Mosher. He specialized in copyright and entertainment law.
        In a landmark 1954 case in Federal court, Warner Brothers Pictures v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Mr. Zissu argued successfully that Dashiell Hammett, the mystery writer, should retain the rights to his detective character, Sam Spade. This, he said, was true even though Mr. Hammett had sold one novel of Spade's exploits, "The Maltese Falcon," to Warner Brothers for the acclaimed 1941 movie.
        During his career, Mr. Zissu represented many figures in the entertainment industry, including the singer Gordon McRae and the band leader Tommy Dorsey.
        Mr. Zissu graduated in 1929 from New York University as valedictorian and Phi Beta Kappa, and from Columbia Law School in 1932.
        His marriage to the late Ruth Katz ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, Joyce Scott-Paine Zissu, Mr. Zissu is survived by two sons, Michael and Roger, both of Manhattan; a brother, Frederick of Garfield, N.J., and five grandchildren.
