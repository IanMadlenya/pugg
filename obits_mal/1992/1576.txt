        William Almon Wood, a broadcast journalist and professor emeritus at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, died on Tuesday in Chapel Hill, N.C. A former resident of New Canaan, Conn., and Savannah, Ga., he was 80.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Louisa.
        He was born in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from Stanford University in 1934. He worked for commercial broadcasters as an announcer and reporter until World War II, when he served in the Navy as a spokesman.
        He joined the Columbia faculty in 1957 and directed the university's Office of Radio and Television for several years. His book, "Electronic Journalism," published by Columbia University Press in 1967, assessed the news operations of 44 television stations in 25 cities and their impact on those communities. He became a professor emeritus in 1978.
        In 1970, Professor Wood began his radio commentary on CBS Radio, "Report on the Press," which was heard three times a week. The broadcasts, carried in the New York area by WCBS Radio, analyzed the treatment of events by the news media and the ethical issues involved. He remained on the air for more than 21 years until he became ill with cancer.
        In addition to his wife of 44 years, the former Louisa Wilson Farrand, Professor Wood is survived by two sisters, Janet Hanford of Glen Ellen, Calif., and Margaret Azevido of Tiberon, Calif.
