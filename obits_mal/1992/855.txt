        Ted Einstein, a founding partner in Einstein Moomjy, the carpet-store chain, died on Sunday at his home in Morristown, N.J. He was 68 years old.
        He died of Parkinson's disease and cancer, his family said.
        Born in Frankfurt, Mr. Einstein fled Germany in 1933 with the advent of the Nazi regime in Berlin. He survived the war in France and came to the United States in 1947.
        Mr. Einstein started a carpet business in Bloomfield, N.J. In 1955, he teamed up with Albert Moomjy, a partnership that grew two years later to take on Walter Moomjy and Mr. Einstein's twin brother, Ernst. The chain has since expanded to five stores, four in New Jersey and one on the east side of Manhattan. The Man Behind Those Ads
        Ted Einstein remained active in the four-man partnership until his death, although he had worked mostly out of his home since January. With each of the partners in charge of a department, Mr. Einstein looked after wall-to-wall broadloom. He also took a special interest in the 12-year-old Manhattan store.
        Versed in fashion and consumer trends, he helped shape the chain's advertising campaigns in print and on the air, which often did their selling with a touch of humor. "It's important not to bore people to death with advertising," Mr. Einstein explained.
        "Outa Space Sale on the Moom" was a characteristic line. And the store on East 58th Street, an opening he had long hoped for, was heralded with, "Now There's a Moomies Down the Block From Bloomie's."
        In addition to his brother, a resident of Mountainside, N.J., Mr. Einstein is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Kopp; three daughters, Vivian Einstein of Weehawken, N.J., Karen Einstein of Emeryville, Calif., and Lauren Day of Elysburg, Pa.; a son, Alan, of Westfield, N.J., and one grandson.
