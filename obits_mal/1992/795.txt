        E. Ross Buckley, chairman of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission for most of the Reagan Administration, died on Tuesday in Memorial Medical Center in Las Cruces, N.M. He was 71 years old and had lived in Las Cruces since retiring from the panel in 1989.
        Mr. Buckley died of leukemia, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Buckley won a Bronze Star for his Army service in the Pacific in World War II. He returned to graduate from the Tulane University School of Law in 1949.
        Mr. Buckley then joined the legal staff of the Gulf Oil Corporation, eventually settling in New Orleans. He was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1962.
        Mr. Buckley joined the Department of Justice in 1969 in the Nixon Administration, serving in the criminal division. A resident of Vienna, Va., at the time, he served on the Vienna Town Council for 10 years, starting in 1976.
        He left the Justice Department in 1982 to become general counsel of the Review Commission, created by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to review disputes arising from health and safety inspections. President Ronald Reagan appointed him chairman of the three-member panel the next year.
        Mr. Buckley, a first cousin of William F. Buckley Jr., the writer and editor, is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Mary Smallpage; four sons, E. Ross Jr., of New Orleans, John, of Vienna, Va., Brian, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Sterling, Va.; a daughter, Margaret Doll of Bogota, Colombia; two brothers, Anthony and Edmund, both of Houston; a sister, Beryl Milburn of Austin, Tex., and five grandchildren.
