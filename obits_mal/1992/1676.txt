        Alex Armendaris, an aide to three Presidents on minority business development and an expert on Hispanic affairs, died on Thursday in McLean, Va. He was 62 years old.
        His family said the cause of death was a brain tumor.
        Having served as Hispanic political director of President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, Mr. Armendaris was appointed by Mr. Nixon in 1973 as director of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise in the Department of Commerce. He continued in that post under President Gerald R. Ford as the Administration's spokesman for Federal minority programs.
        In 1980, Mr. Armendaris joined Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign as political director for Hispanic affairs. He later served Mr. Reagan as associate director of White House personnel.
        At his death, Mr. Armendaris was special assistant for public affairs to the executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce Stretter of McLean; nine children from a previous marriage, Mark, Kathy, Michael, Nancy, Stephanie, David, Jane, Susan and Robert; his mother, Sara, of Chicago; three sisters, Mary Fernandez, Rachel Pedroza and Elvia Frostick Kantor, all of Chicago; two brothers, William, of Dayton, Ohio, and Richard, of South Plymouth, Mass., and six grandchildren.
