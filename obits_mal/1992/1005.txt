        Tony Williams, a former parking-lot attendant who crooned the 1950's hit songs "Only You" and "The Great Pretender" as the lead singer of the Platters, died yesterday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 64 years old.
        He had been suffering from diabetes and emphysema and died in his sleep, said his wife, Helen.
        Mr. Williams, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., was working at a Los Angeles parking lot in 1953 when he was recruited by Buck Ram, a songwriter, to front a new rhythm-and-blues group, the Platters.
        With the other members of the quintet -- David Lynch, Herbert Reed, Paul Robi and Zola Taylor -- Mr. Williams soon recorded "Only You," which garnered a gold record and led to a long-term contract with Mercury Records. Other Platters hits included "Harbor Lights," "Twilight Time" and "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." Mr. Williams left the group in 1960, but continued to sing. Early this year he and his wife and their son Ricky did six weeks of performances in Thailand and Japan.
        In addition to his wife and son, Mr. Williams is survived by another son, Derek, of Tokyo; a brother, Herman Bouden of Manhattan; five sisters, Linda Hayes of South Orange, N.J.; Dolly Williams of Newark; Florence White of Elizabeth; Mary Williams of Philadelphia, and Clara Williams of Virginia, and three grandchildren.
