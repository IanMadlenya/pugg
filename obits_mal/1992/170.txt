        John W. Queenan, a retired leader in the accounting profession and a former member of the Federal Wage and Price Control Board, died on Friday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn.
        He was 86 years old and was a resident of Greenwich and of Tequesta, Fla. He died after surgery for a broken hip, his family said.
        For 14 years Mr. Queenan headed a leading international accounting firm as the managing partner of Haskins & Sells in an era of expansion. The firm became Deloitte, Haskins & Sells and is now Deloitte & Touche. Among its thousands of clients were an eighth of all companies on the New York Stock Exchange, including General Motors, Coca-Cola and Merrill Lynch.
        He was also president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which helped set accounting standards. He was a co-chairman of the National Conference of Lawyers and Certified Public Accountants and served on the first Financial Accounting Standards Board, which wrote the rules governing corporate reports.
        President Richard M. Nixon appointed him in 1971 to the Wage and Price Control Board, which was created to rein in inflation.
        Mr. Queenan was born in Aurora, Ill. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1927 and scored the highest mark in that state's examination for accountants. He joined Haskins and Sells in Manhattan in 1927. In his 43-year career there, he became a partner in 1939, resident partner in 1946 and managing partner in 1956. He retired in 1970.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Alice Thomas; two daughters, Joan Q. McClellan of Greenwich, and Jane C. Gallagher of New Canaan, Conn.; two sons, John T., of Washington, and Charles W., of Glencoe, Ill.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
