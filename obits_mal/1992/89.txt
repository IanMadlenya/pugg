        Carl Bridenbaugh, an authority on Colonial America, died last Monday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was 88 years old and lived in Providence, where he had taught at Brown University.
        The cause of death was cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Bridenbaugh was the first director of the Institute of Early American History and Culture at Williamsburg, Va., from 1945 to 1950. He served as president of the American Historical Association in 1962 and stirred a debate with a speech to the organization contending that urbanites were ill-suited to analyze Colonial history because they did not understand rural culture.
        He wrote 15 books and numerous articles for journals and newspapers.  His books included "Cities in the Wilderness" (1938), "Rebels and Gentlemen" (1942), "Seat of Empire" (1950), "Cities in Revolt" (1955), "Mitre and Sceptre" (1962), "Vexed and Troubled Englishmen" (1968), "No Peace Beyond the Line" (1971), "The Spirit of '76" (1975) and "Jamestown 1544-1699" (1980).
        He taught history for 11 years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 12 years at the University of California at Berkeley and 11 years at Brown, where he retired in 1969. He held a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and was a Guggenheim fellow three times.
        He was on the committee that led to the formation of the National Humanities Foundation and also served on the Historic American Buildings Survey.
        He was born in Philadelphia and earned a bachelor's degree at Dartmouth College and master's and doctoral degrees at Harvard University. He served in the Navy in World War II.
        His first wife, the former Jessica Hill, died in 1943. His only immediate survivor is his second wife, the former Roberta Haines Herriott, who was co-author of "Vexed and Troubled Englishmen."
