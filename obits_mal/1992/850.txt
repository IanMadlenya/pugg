        Frederick A. Jungmann, an advocate for poverty-stricken youths, died on Saturday at University Hospital in Boston. He was 55 years old and lived in South Wellfleet, Mass.
        He died after an 18-year fight with cancer, said Kathy Shorr, spokeswoman for the Center for Coastal Studies, a sea-mammal research center in Provincetown, Mass., where Mr. Jungmann was a board member and former executive director.
        Mr. Jungmann, a business consultant by profession, became active in the 1970's in several nonprofit projects for young people living in poverty, most notably the Jobs for Youth Inc. programs in Boston, New York and Chicago. He was a member of many panels, including the National Youth Employment Coalition and Boys' Clubs of America's youth employment study.  Mr. Jungmann's companion was A. Warren LeNoir.
