        Len Giovannitti, an award-winning writer and television film maker, died on March 27 at his home in Manhattan. He was 71 years old.
        He died of heart disease, said his fiancee, Dr. Vera Miller.
        Mr. Giovannitti won a Peabody award for his television work. He wrote, directed and produced documentaries.
        For NBC he produced "The American Alcoholic," "The Hill Country: LBJ's Texas," "In White-Collar America," "The Energy Crisis" and "And Who Shall Feed This World." With Fred Freed, he was co-producer of "The Decision To Drop the Bomb," and they wrote a book with the same title. For ABC, he produced "Black Business in White America" and "Walking Hard: On Juvenile Delinquency."
        Born in the Bronx, he earned a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in 1942. He then joined the Army Air Corps, serving as a navigator. On his 50th mission, his plane was shot down in Austria, and he was held prisoner for a year. That experience led to his first novel, "The Prisoners of Combine D" (Holt, 1957), which won an award from the American Library Association.
        He was divorced.
        He is survived by a son, David, of the Bronx, and a daughter, Nina, of Los Angeles; a sister, Roma Rieger of Walnut Creek, Calif., and a granddaughter.
