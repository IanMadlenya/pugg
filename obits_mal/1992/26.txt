        The Rev. Dr. George E. Sweazey, a senior official of the Presbyterian Church and professor emeritus of homiletics at Princeton Theological Seminary, died on Thursday at the Monroe Village Health Care Center in Jamesburg, N.J., where he lived. He was 86 years old.
        He died of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the theological seminary, Barbara A. Chaapel, said.
        He joined the seminary faculty in 1971, retiring in 1975 to become professor emeritus. Subsequently, he served many interim pastorates in Presbyterian churches across the country.
        In 1969, he was elected moderator of the United Presbyterian Church U.S.A., or titular head of the denomination. He served as secretary for evangelism of the Board of National Missions of the Presbyterian Church from 1945 to 1953.
        Dr. Sweazey, who was born in Salt Lake City, graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1930, earning a master's degree from Princeton University the same year and a Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1931.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Handy Ensminger of Jamesburg; two daughters, Anne, of Pelham, N.Y., and Mary Sweazey Cowles of East Providence, R.I.; a son, George Jr., of Greensboro, N.C.; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
