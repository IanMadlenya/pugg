        John Marshall Weir, an expert on tropical diseases and an official with the Rockefeller Foundation, died on April 27 at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        He died of complications from cancer, said a son, Michael.
        Dr. Weir, born in Bonneterre, Mo., earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Chicago in the early 1930's and a joint M.D. and Ph.D. from Chicago in 1936. He immediately joined the Rockefeller Foundation, developing treatment programs in Jamaica and Colombia before World War II and, after serving in the Pacific during the war, in Egypt.
        Upon his retirement from the foundation in the early 1970's, he was awarded Colombia's highest civilian medal.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Alice Spensely; two sons, John Marshall 3d, of Saratoga, Calif., and Michael of Manhattan, and a daughter, Adrienne, of Sacramento, Calif.
