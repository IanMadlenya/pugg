        William G. Weart, the Philadelphia correspondent of The New York Times for 21 years until his retirement in 1966, died on Saturday at the Lehigh Valley Medical Center in Allentown, Pa. He was 85 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Weart, the son of William O. Weart, a Philadelphia journalist, attended St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, Md., and started his career as a reporter for The Philadelphia Record. He then worked for The Associated Press and the International News Service, where he was the Pennsylvania state manager when he joined The Times in 1945.
        Mr. Weart is survived by his son, William F. Weart of Allentown.
