        Dr. Zalmen A. Arlin, a specialist in the treatment of leukemia and lymphoma, died on Monday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 47 years old and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
        A spokeswoman at New York Medical College in Valhalla, where Dr. Arlin was a professor of medicine, said he died of a brain tumor.
        Dr. Arlin was an attending physician and chief of neoplastic diseases at the medical center.
        He helped to organize the division of neoplastic diseases at New York Medical College in 1983. A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue, like a tumor, and the new unit was set up to search for new treatments.
        Dr. Arlin is survived by his wife, the former Ann Kielty; two children, Ezekiel and Sara; and his mother, Rose Arlin, and sisters, Judith Swirsky and Ruth Willinsky, all of Toronto.
