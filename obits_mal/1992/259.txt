        Albert Ketcham Murray, a portraitist who did many official paintings of United States naval officers as well as many prominent civilians, died on Tuesday in Gainesville, Fla., where he had been visiting friends. He was 85 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died of cancer, said Marion Galliland, a friend.
        As a Navy combat artist during World War II, Mr. Murray often sketched in the heat of battle, and was later awarded the Bronze Star for bravery. After the war, Mr. Murray was assigned to paint official portraits of Navy war heroes. One was a full-length likeness of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz signing the Japanese surrender documents aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. The portrait, among many other of Mr. Murray's paintings, is in the Pentagon.
        For several years after the war, he also served as the director of the Navy Combat Art Collection and its Operation Palette, a series of Navy art shows that traveled throughout the country. Mr. Murray also painted many people prominent in civilian life, among them Thomas J. Watson of International Business Machines, the philanthropist Laurance S. Rockefeller, and Arthur Hays Sulzberger, former publisher of The New York Times.
        Mr. Murray was born in Emporia, Kan., on Dec. 29, 1906. He studied at Cornell University and graduated from the College of Fine Arts at Syracuse University. After further study in England and France, he began to exhibit. His work appeared in such prestigious shows as the Carnegie Institute International and the Corcoran Gallery of Art Biennial.
        His work is also represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Art, the National Portrait Gallery and the National Museum of American Art in Washington, along with the U.S. Departments of Defense, Commerce, Treasury and Justice.
        He is survived by his sister, Louise Murray of New York City.
