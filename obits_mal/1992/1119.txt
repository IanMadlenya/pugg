        Donald Dryfoos, a rare-book collector and former stockbroker, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
        Mr. Dryfoos had suffered from a degenerative heart condition and died of heart failure, said a nephew, Jeffrey Dryfoos.
        Mr. Dryfoos was a brother of Orvil E. Dryfoos, the publisher of The New York Times from 1961 to 1963. Orvil Dryfoos died in 1963. Their brother Hugh died in 1983.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Dryfoos graduated from the Horace Mann School and, in 1936, from Cornell University. He studied at the Sorbonne and then joined Random House, the publishing company.
        From the 1940's to the 1960's, Mr. Dryfoos was a stockbroker with several Wall Street investment houses. He left Wall Street to devote himself to rare-book collecting, and for the last decade he owned a rare-book store in Manhattan.
        Mr. Dryfoos's wife, Nancy Proskauer Dryfoos, the sculptor, died last year. They had no children.
