        Philip Kolb, a scholar of Marcel Proust, died on Friday at the Covenant Medical Center in Urbana, Ill. He was 85 years old and lived in Urbana.
        He died of leukemia, said his wife, Dorothy.
        A professor of French at the University of Illinois from 1946 to 1975, Professor Kolb lectured on Proust, the author of "Remembrance of Things Past," at universities throughout the world. His major work was the editing and publication of Proust's letters, undertaken at the request of Proust's niece. The first volume, published in 1970, was awarded a Grand Prix by the French Academy.
        Subsequently, Professor Kolb published 20 volumes in French of Proust's letters. The most recent volume appeared in April. He was proofreading the 21st and final volume until a week before his death.
        That volume, Professor Kolb's wife said, is to be published in Paris by Plon Publishers in 1993.
        Professor Kolb also selected some letters from the Proust collection for two volumes in English, the first translated by Ralph Manheim and published by Doubleday in 1983, and the second translated by Terence Kilmartin and published by Oxford University Press in 1989.
        In addition to his wife, Professor Kolb is survived by two daughters, Katherine Reeve of Minneapolis and Jocelyne Kolb of Hanover, N.H., and a son, Richard, of New York City.
