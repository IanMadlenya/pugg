        Robert A. McCardell, a former dean of faculty and teacher at the Horace Mann School for 35 years, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 63 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Before his appointment as dean of faculty in 1990, Mr. McCardell was the chairman of the English department at Horace Mann, a coeducational preparatory school in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He retired in June.
        He was a president of the Association of Teachers in Independent Schools of New York and Vicinity and a member of the National Association of Independent Schools Coordinating Committee.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; two sons, Grant, of Clinton, Conn., and Frederick, of Manchester, N.H.; a sister, Shirley Lyons of Hamilton Square, N.J., and three grandchildren.
