        Roger Colloff, vice president and general manager of the CBS network flagship, WCBS-TV, Channel 2 in New York, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer of the colon, the hospital said.
        Mr. Colloff assumed control of Channel 2 in 1984 after spending most of his career as an executive with CBS News. As the manager, Mr. Colloff supervised a local news division that won more Emmy Awards for its news coverage than any other station in New York in recent years.
        Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said yesterday that Mr. Colloff had carried Channel 2 through "some very dark days for the company" and had made it into "the best performing station in recent years, both financially and in ratings."
        Mr. Colloff joined CBS in 1975 as a director of government affairs after serving for three years as legislative assistant to Senator Walter F. Mondale, Democrat of Minnesota. He left CBS in 1976 to work as a senior staff member in Mr. Mondale's successful campaign for the vice presidency. After the election he worked in the Federal Office of Energy as special assistant to the Energy Secretary, James M. Schlesinger.
        He rejoined CBS in 1979 as vice president of CBS News and became director of the network's public affairs broadcasts, which included "60 Minutes."
        Mr. Colloff was born in Asbury Park, N.J., and was educated at Brown University and Yale, where he received both a doctorate in law and a master's in history. He was also a recipient of a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.
        He is survived by his wife, Margery, a daughter, Pamela, and a son, David, all of Manhattan; his parents, Isadore and Shirley Colloff of Teaneck, N.J.; a brother, Bernard, of Riverdale, N.J.; a sister, Tamara, of Washington, and a grandfather, Morris Dessen, of Chicago.
