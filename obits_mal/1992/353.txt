        Chat Paterson, a Denver businessman who led the American Veterans Committee in its formative years, died March 5 at his home in Golden, Colo. He was 72 years old.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Paterson, who was born in Ottumwa, Iowa, and grew up in Cleveland, attended Antioch College and in the late 1930's worked for the Quaker Fellowship in Mexico, where he helped resettle European refugees. In World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services in Europe and carried out missions behind enemy lines.
        The American Veterans Committee, which was formed after World War II, pressed a liberal agenda calling for adequate housing and racial integration. After completing a term as national chairman in 1948, Mr. Paterson lobbied unsuccessfully for a national health insurance plan sought by President Harry S. Truman.
        When Truman left office Mr. Paterson returned to Cleveland, where he helped develop programs to build affordable housing in the inner city. He then became a real estate developer in Denver, where he was active in Democratic politics. He served on the Colorado Tourism Board and the Denver Metro Convention Visitors Bureau.
        Mr. Paterson is survived by his wife, the former Joanne Kuth; two sons, Timothy Paterson of College Park, Md., and Kim Paterson of Delhi, N.Y.; four daughters, Mallory Paterson-Helland and Erika Paterson, both of Denver, Jennifer Weisenthal of Syracuse, and Andrea Paterson of Washington, and five grandchildren.
