        Tony Tamburello, a jazz pianist and a vocal coach whose clients included Tony Bennett, Judy Garland and Juliet Prowse, died on Tuesday at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in the Bronx, near his home. He was 72 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said Mary Chiappa, a family friend.
        As a pianist, Mr. Tamburello was noted for his imaginative arrangements and extensive repertory. John S. Wilson wrote of him in The New York Times in 1985 that "he seems to have at his fingertips almost every song written in the last 65 years."
        Jerry Vale, Tommy Leonetti and Florence Henderson also received coaching from him.
        He is survived by his wife, Donella, and three daughters, Mary Jane Ellis of North Arlington, N.J., Sondra Begerow of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Nina Tamburello of the Bronx.
