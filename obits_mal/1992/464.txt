        Mr. Russell, known professionally as Arthur Russell, performed experimental music widely as a soloist and with other musicians and choreographers at places like the Kitchen, where he had been a director, La Mama and Experimental Intermedia Foundation.

In 1981 he began his own record label, Sleeping Bag Records, and produced some hit dance singles, including "Go Bang!" and "Wax the Van." He also released two albums of orchestral music, "Instrumentals" and "Tower of Meaning," and a solo album, "World of Echo."
        He is survived by his parents, Charles and Emily Russell of Oskaloosa, and two sisters, Kate Henry and Julie, both of Mount Desert Island, Me.
