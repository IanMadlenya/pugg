        Dr. Wilfred Dorfman, a Brooklyn physician who helped found the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, died April 12 at the Brooklyn Hospital Center. He was 82 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, a daughter, Jane Dorfman, said.
        Dr. Dorfman, who was born in Manhattan and grew up on the Lower East Side, earned his bachelor's and medical degrees from New York University in 1930 and 1934, respectively. After graduation he joined the staff at Maimonides Hospital, now Maimonides Medical Center, where he served as chief of its endocrinology clinic.
        Dr. Dorfman, who was board-certified in internal medicine, neurology and psychology, maintained a private practice until his death. He was also affiliated with several other Brooklyn hospitals and active in many medical associations during his more than 50-year career.
        In 1953, Dr. Dorfman helped organize the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine, and he was editor in chief of its journal for 26 years. The Academy awarded him its Prestigious Achievement Award in 1982.
        In addition to his daughter Jane, Dr. Dorfman is survived by another daughter, Marjorie of Manhattan.
