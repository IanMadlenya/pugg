        Thomas G. S. Christensen, a labor law expert and arbitrator who taught labor law at New York University for the last three decades, died on Sunday during a family visit in Lancaster, Pa. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Andrea.
        A member of the bars of Iowa and New York, Professor Christensen was named to Presidential Emergency Dispute Panels under the Railway Labor Act by four Presidents: Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. He was appointed to the N.Y.U. Law School faculty in 1962 and served as executive director of the N.Y.U. Institute of Labor Relations from 1962 to 1972.
        In addition to impasses in rail-labor disputes, he arbitrated for the New York City school system, New York's municipal hospitals and the city's newspaper industry.
        Professor Christensen was born in Iowa City. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Iowa and received a law degree from its School of Law in 1947.
        For the next seven years he served on the staffs of the Federal Power Commission and the National Labor Relations Board. From 1955 until he joined the N.Y.U. faculty he was associated with the New York law firm of Cravath Swaine & Moore.
        Besides his wife, the former Andrea Svanoe, Professor Christensen is survived by five sons, Dr. Gordon D. of Columbia, Mo., and Andrew H., Timothy T., H. Tor, and Kel W., all of Manhattan; a daughter, Lise Marie King of Port Washington, L.I.; four sisters, Agneta Heldt of Miami, Theresa Christensen of Evanston, Ill., Herdis Snyder of Iowa City and Edith Woodcock of Nyack, N.Y.; a brother, C.
