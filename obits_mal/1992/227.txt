        Eldon Cessna, who designed airplanes that saved the Cessna Aircraft Company in the 1930's, died Saturday in a hospital. He was 84.
        Mr. Cessna was the son of the company's founder, Clyde Cessna. Cessna Aircraft, of Wichita, Kan., specializes in making small planes.
        In 1930, Eldon Cessna's CG-2 glider helped pull the company out of financial straits. He also designed the Cessna Air Master, the World War II-era P-51 Mustang and the F-86 fighter jet used in the Korean War.
        He left Cessna Aircraft in 1934 and joined the Douglas Aircraft Company as a design engineer. In 1938, he went to North American Aviation -- later Rockwell International -- where he remained until his retirement in 1969.
        He is survived by his wife, two children and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 6, 1992, Friday
        An obituary by The Associated Press on Feb. 25 about Eldon Cessna, an aircraft design engineer, misstated his role in the design of three aircraft. He was a member of the design teams that worked on the Cessna Air Master, the P-51 Mustang and the F-86 jet fighter; he was not the chief designer.
