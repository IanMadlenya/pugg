        Thompson G. Marsh, a professor of law at the University of Denver for 60 years, died on Saturday at his home in Denver. He was 89 years old.
        Professor Marsh, who joined the faculty at the University of Denver after graduating from its law school, was its first full-time professor of law and over the next six decades became an institution both at the school and in the Denver legal community.
        When Professor Marsh retired in 1987, the school's officials estimated that 70 percent of the lawyers practicing in the Denver area had taken at least one course with him. His specialties included property and mining law and legal philosophy.
        A native of Lacon, Ill., Professor Marsh earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in history at the University of Denver, a master's in law from Northwestern University in 1931, and a doctorate in law from Yale University in 1935.
        He was an expert bird-watcher, having a life-list of more than 800 species. He was ranked first in Colorado and within the top 20 nationally.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Susan Raymond Marsh; four daughters, Mary Marsh Zulack of Brooklyn, Nancy Banks of Fort Collins, Colo., Alice Abbott of London and Lucy Marsh of Denver; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
