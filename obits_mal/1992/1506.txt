        Alex Ullmann, whose novel "Afghanistan" won this year's Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, died on Friday evening at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. He was 34 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of leukemia, his father said.
        Mr. Ullmann was born in New York City, the son of John Stewart Ullmann, a photographer and writer known professionally as John Stewart, and Natacha Dorfman Stewart, a longtime writer for The New Yorker, who died in 1986. He studied at Le Rosey in Switzerland and at Yale University.
        He was one of the original editors at Elle magazine and worked as a translator from French to English. His fiction appeared in Grand Street, Shenandoah and GQ.
        Mr. Ullmann is survived by his father, who lives in London, and a brother, Nicolas, of Beverly Hills, Calif.
