        Gregory J. Markopoulos, an avant-garde film maker, died last Friday in Freiburg, Germany. He was 64 years old.
        He died after a long illness, said Robert Haller, a spokesman for Anthology Film Archives in New York City, who announced his death yesterday.
        Mr. Markopoulos's first major film, made in 1947-48, was a trilogy, "Du Sang de la Volupte et de la Mort" ("Of Blood, of Desire and of Death"), a 70-minute feature based in part on a novel by Pierre Louys. Among his other credits are "Swain" (1950), "Twice a Man" (1963), "The Iliac Passion" (1966), featuring Andy Warhol, and "Galaxie" (1966), a collection of brief film portraits of artists, writers and film makers.
        After teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1960's, Mr. Markopoulos moved to Switzerland, where he continued to make films. His work is in the collections of the Art Institute, the Museum of Modern Art, the Cinematheque Francaise and Anthology Film Archives.
        There are no survivors.
