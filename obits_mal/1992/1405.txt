        Ed Franco, the all-America left tackle on Fordham's legendary Seven Blocks of Granite in 1936 and 1937, died on Wednesday near his home in Bayonne, N.J. He was 77 years old and suffered a heart attack while walking his dog, according to his daughter Margaret Nostrame.
        It was the Fordham publicist, Tim Cohane, who initially coined the name for the linemen who led Fordham to a 15-1-2 won-lost-tied record in 1929 and 1930. But it was the 1936 and 1937 group that made the Seven Blocks of Granite an enduring legend.
        That is partly because those blocks were coached by one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, Jim Crowley, and they had a two-year 12-1-3 record that included eight shutouts. Mr. Franco's teammate at right end was Vince Lombardi, who achieved further glory in the 1960's as head coach of the Green Bay Packers.
        There were actually nine linemen over the 1936-37 seasons, four of whom are still living. Mr. Franco was one of five who played both years, and one of two Fordham players ever named a consensus all-American. The other was center Alex Wojciechowicz, who died in July.
        After graduation, Mr. Franco, who had attended Dickinson High School in Jersey City, became the first football coach at St. Michael's High School in Jersey City and later served as assistant coach for Fordham teams that went to the Cotton Bowl in 1941 and the Sugar Bowl in 1942.
        He later operated a sporting goods store in Jersey City, played a year with the professional Boston Yanks, coached the semiprofessional Jersey City Giants and ended his coaching career as an assistant to Mr. Lombardi in Green Bay and with the Washington Redskins.
        In addition to Mrs. Nostrame, Mr. Franco is survived by another daughter, Rosemary Muscolino, and a son, Edmund, both of Rockaway, N.J., and six grandchildren.
