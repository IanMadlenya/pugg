        Lewis Michael Friedman, a leading cabaret impresario in New York City in the 1970's and 80's, died on Friday at his home in Cazadero, Calif. He was 47 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said his mother, Kit Friedman of Dayton, Ohio.
        An accomplished pianist and composer, Mr. Friedman created the trend-setting New York cabaret Reno Sweeney, which he owned and operated from 1972 to 1978. There he introduced and presented a wide range of performers, including Melissa Manchester, Peter Allen, Ellen Greene, Patti Smith, Diane Keaton, the Manhattan Transfer and Blossom Dearie.
        In 1980, he opened the rock club Snafu, also in Manhattan, which he operated for four years. In 1984 he moved to California, where he owned and operated the Sweet Life Cafe in Santa Rosa.
        Mr. Friedman was born in Dayton and graduated from Columbia University in 1967.
        His companion was Bruce W. Aukerman.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by a sister, Sarann Friedman Rice of Dayton.
