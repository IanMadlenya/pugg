        Richard Fontana, a star of the Comedie Francaise and a leading stage actor in France, died here on Friday. He was 40 years old and lived in Paris.
        The Comedie Francaise administrator, Jacques Lassalle, gave no details on Mr. Fontana's illness.
        In 1979, Mr. Fontana made his first appearance with the Comedie Francaise in "Tartuffe."
        Mr. Fontana appeared on television, often in Comedie Francaise productions, but never worked in films. He insisted that his first love was the stage.
        Mr. Lassalle declined to give information about survivors.
