        Constantine Shapiro, a cellist, composer, writer and teacher, died on Monday at his home in Hollywood. He was 95 years old.
        He died in his sleep, said his son, Isaac, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Shapiro, born in Saratov, Russia, fled the country with his family after the 1917 revolution. Before moving to the United States, he lived in Germany, where he was the first cellist in the Frankfurt Opera Orchestra, and in Palestine, becoming the first cellist of the Symphony Orchestra in Tel Aviv.
        From 1928 to 1952, Mr. Shapiro lived in Japan, where he was among a small group of European Jewish refugees who pioneered the establishment of Western classical music there. He had an active career in Japan as a soloist, conductor and teacher.
        In 1952, Mr. Shapiro settled in Los Angeles, where he continued his performing career, commuting to Indianapolis to play in the Symphony Orchestra there. A volume of his essays and poems was published in 1977 and he taught cello, piano and theory until shortly before his death.
        In addition to his son Isaac, he is survived by four other sons: Joseph, of Podolsk, Russia; Michael, of Manchester, Vt.; Ariel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; Jacob, of Los Angeles; nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
