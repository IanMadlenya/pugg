        Gabe Kruks, chief operating officer of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, died Nov. 11 at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 42 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Kruks died of complications from AIDS, said Brad Laughlin, a spokesman for the center.
        Mr. Kruks was born in London. He was a volunteer truck driver and salvage worker for the Israeli Army in 1967 and 1968. He emigrated to the United States and from 1971 to 1985 worked in the film industry, primarily as a key grip, supervising many technical aspects of production in more than a thousand television commercials and industrial, documentary and feature films.
        He joined the center in the mid-1980's and drew attention as an advocate of improved services for gay men and lesbians, particularly the young who were homeless because they had become estranged from their families.
        Mr. Kruks is survived by his parents, Leo and Sima Kruks of London, and a sister, Sonia Kruks-Wisner of Amherst, Mass.
