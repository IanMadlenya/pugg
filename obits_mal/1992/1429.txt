        Antoni Hoffman, a Polish biologist whose scholarly work at Columbia University disputed theories about the regular extinction of species, died Nov. 14 in Warsaw. He was 42.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said Peter Osnos, his cousin.
        Mr. Hoffman, who was born in Warsaw but who lived for many years in the United States, was an adviser to the Minister of Education in Poland's post-Communist governments at the time of his death. He was also a professor of paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences.
        Before his return to Poland in 1990, Mr. Hoffman worked at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. His work dealt with the study of ancient life forms and the use of modern techniques to determine both the age of remains and the manner in which they were preserved.
        Dr. Hoffman's most recent book, "Arguments on Evolution, a Paleontologist's Perspective," was published in the United States by Oxford University Press in 1989. He was the author or editor of at least two other books in English and several more books in Polish.
        He is survived by his wife, Nina, a son, Piotr; a daughter, Marta, all of Warsaw; and a brother, Piotr, of Reno.
