        Charles de Bretteville, a leading businessman who became chairman of the Bank of California, died Friday at Community Hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 79 years old and lived in nearby Pebble Beach.
        Charles Locke de Bretteville, one of two sons, said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        For more than two decades Mr. de Bretteville was a senior officer with the Bank of California, serving successively as a director, president, chief executive and chairman. He retired in 1976 but remained on the board for two more years.
        In 1983 he helped found the Pacific Bank in San Francisco and was on its board at his death.
        Before his career in banking, Mr. de Bretteville was president of the Spreckels Sugar Company, a major sugar producer. Spreckels, a company town near Salinas, Calif., was founded at the turn of the century by Claus Spreckels, known as the "Sugar King" of Hawaiian cane.
        A member of the board of the Shell Oil Company beginning in the mid-1960's, Mr. de Bretteville was chairman of Shell's special committee of independent directors in 1985-86. He was also a director of Amfac, a Honolulu-based holding company, from 1975 to 1985. Among his other directorships were those with Western Union, Safeway, Ridder Publications and Pacific Gas and Electric.
        Born in San Francisco, he graduated from Stanford University in 1934 and attended Harvard Business School. In World War II he served aboard the aircraft carrier Bunker Hill with the rank of lieutenant commander.
        In addition to his son Charles, who lives in San Jose, Calif., Mr. de Bretteville is survived by his wife of 54 years, Frances Mein; another son, Peter de Bretteville of New Haven; two daughters, Leslie de Bretteville of San Francisco and Frances Blair of Chicago, and eight grandchildren.
