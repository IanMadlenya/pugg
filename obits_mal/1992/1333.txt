        Joseph Toy Curtiss, a member of the Yale University English faculty for nearly four decades, died Sunday at his home in Simsbury, Conn. He was 91 years old.
        Professor Curtiss, who suffered a stroke recently, died of heart failure, said Prof. David Calleo of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, a former student and longtime friend.
        A native of Simsbury, Professor Curtiss was educated in the public schools there and at The Hotchkiss School and graduated from Yale College in 1923. He earned a doctorate in English at Yale University in the late 1920's.  Work for Government
        Professor Curtiss was an original Fellow of Jonathan Edwards College, one of Yale's residential colleges, and later was dean of the college. He was a co-founder of the Jonathan Edwards Trust, which helped to support the college's activities.
        During World War II, Professor Curtiss was one of several Yale professors who played a significant role in the Office of Strategic Services operations, rising to become head of American counter-intelligence in Turkey.
        Professor Curtiss, a specialist in medieval and 17th-century English literature, returned to Yale after the war. He founded and directed for many years the university's interdisciplinary program in the Humanities.
        He retired in 1964.
        There are no immediate survivors.
