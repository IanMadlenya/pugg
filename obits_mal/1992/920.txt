        Paul Winter, a violinist and music teacher, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 78 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Margaret.
        A native of New York, Mr. Winter was active in the city's musical life from the early 1930's until his death. In 1937 he became the youngest member of the NBC Symphony Orchestra, under Arturo Toscanini, and played in the live radio broadcasts from the network's famous Studio 8H. He was the concertmaster of the NBC television orchestra and played on "Your Show of Shows" and other programs in television's early days. He left NBC in 1957 to work as a freelance.
        Mr. Winter was a founding member of the American String Quartet, an offshoot of Toscanini's orchestra. He also performed in recital and did recording work for popular artists and motion-picture soundtracks. In recent years he was an active teacher of both the violin and the viola.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Jack, of Manhattan; two daughters, Elizabeth Wolpaw of Delmar, N.Y., and Sat Tara Kaur Khalsa of Boulder, Colo., and four grandchildren.
