        Dr. Robert Anthony Martinez, an associate professor of black and Hispanic studies at Baruch College, the City University of New York, died on Friday at New York University Medical Center. He was 49 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        A statement from Baruch said his death was AIDS related.
        A graduate of City College with a Ph.D. in urban education from Fordham University, Dr. Martinez joined the Baruch faculty in 1972 as an instructor. He was chairman of his department from 1989 until illness forced him to step down early this year. He was also a past chairman of the black and Hispanic caucus at Baruch and the author of many articles on the dual-cultural world of Puerto Ricans living in urban centers of North America.
        His companion was Michael Davidson.
