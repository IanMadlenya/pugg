        Herminio Portell Vila, a Cuban historian of Cuban-United States relations who taught Fidel Castro, gave him some unheeded advice and left Cuba after the rebel leader seized power, died on Monday at his home in Miami. He was 90 years old.
        The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.
        Dr. Portell Vila taught at the University of Havana and was on the city's municipal council. His many writings in Spanish included a four-volume work, "History of Cuba in Its Relations With the United States and Spain," published in Havana in 1938, and "The 'Other Foreigners' in the North American Revolution," which came out in Miami in 1978.
        The British historian Hugh Thomas wrote in his 1971 book "Cuba: or The Pursuit of Freedom" that "in the early summer of 1953 the historian Portell Vila was sitting in a bar in Havana when a young ex-pupil of his at the university, passing by, told him that he was planning an attack" on a military installation of the Batista Government.
        Professor Thomas wrote that "Portell Vila tried to dissuade the conspirator" -- Mr. Castro -- "but he was adamant, explaining how the attack would be a great moral blow against the regime." He led the assault soon afterward, it failed, and he was imprisoned until 1955.
        After Mr. Castro took power in 1959, he worked to end the freedom of the University of Havana, and Dr. Portell Vila moved to the United States, where he worked for the Voice of America and did more writing.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria Teresa, and a brother, Alejandro, of Miami.
