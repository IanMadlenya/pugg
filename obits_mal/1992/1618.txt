        The Rev. Howard G. Hageman, a former national leader of the Reformed Church in America and a retired seminary president, died on Sunday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. He was 71 and lived in New Baltimore, N.Y.
        He died of esophageal cancer, his family said.
        At the age of 39, Mr. Hageman headed his denomination as the president of the general synod in 1959-60. He also participated in national and international ecumenical organizations.
        From 1973-85 he served as president of New Brunswick Seminary. Before that he was the minister of the North Reformed Church in Newark for 18 years.
        Mr. Hageman was a visiting lecturer and adjunct professor at Princeton and Union Seminary.
        He was also a co-founder and president of the Friends of New Netherlands, an organization helping the New York State Library in translating early Dutch Colonial manuscripts and documents.
        For his efforts fostering Dutch-American relations, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands in 1982 decorated him as a Knight Commander in the order of Orange, Nassau.
        Born in Lynn, Mass., Mr. Hageman grew up in Albany. After graduating from Harvard in 1941, he earned his divinity degree from New Brunswick in 1945. That year he was ordained and began his ministry in Newark.
        Surviving are his wife of 47 years, the former Carol Wenneis, and a sister, Betty Houghtaling of Delmar, N.Y.
