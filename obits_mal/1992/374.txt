        Richard A. Ruskay, a restaurateur on Manhattan's Upper West Side, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Ruskay was a founding partner, with Jack Doenias and Carl Laanas, in the Empire Diner, the Art Deco restaurant that they refurbished in 1976. Open 24 hours, its trendy stainless-steel, chrome and black-glass presence on 10th Avenue at 22d Street has since become a Chelsea landmark.
        The partners first started Ruskay's on Columbus Avenue in 1976. They also operated Rick's Lounge, which opened downtown on Eighth Avenue in 1981. Both are now closed.
        His companion was Murray Paster of Manhattan.
        Mr. Ruskay is survived by his mother, Rita Ruskay of Port Chester, N.Y., and a brother, Robert, of Rye Brook, N.Y.
