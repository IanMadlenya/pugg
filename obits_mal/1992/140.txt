        Herschel B. Chipp, an art historian and authority on the work of Pablo Picasso, died on Feb. 8 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 78 years old and lived in San Francisco.
        He had been hospitalized several weeks earlier after a stroke, a spokesman for the University of California at Berkeley said.
        Mr. Chipp, who was professor emeritus of art history at the university, wrote two acclaimed books: "Theories of Modern Art," a best-selling art history text published in 1968, and "Picasso's Guernica: History, Transformations, Meanings," a study of Picasso's famous antiwar painting and public response to it, published in 1988. A Visiting Lecturer
        Mr. Chipp was acting director of Berkeley's University Art Gallery from 1960 to 1965. He was also a visiting lecturer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the University of British Columbia and the University of Southern California. In 1989, he was invited to Guernica to participate in the dedication of Eduardo Chillida's monument to peace and liberty.
        He was born in New Hampton, Mo., and served as a naval lieutenant in World War II. In Paris not long after the liberation of France, he met Picasso, and decided to devote himself to studying the artist's work.
        He received a bachelor's degree at Berkeley in 1947 and a master's degree in 1948, and in 1953 received a Ph.D. in art history from Columbia University. That same year, he joined the faculty at Berkeley. In addition to his Picasso studies, he followed the work of contemporary California artists and organized exhibitions in the field.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Chipp was working on a documentary film based on his "Guernica" book.
        He is survived by his wife, Heide, of San Francisco, and a son, Dennis, of Redwood City, Calif.
