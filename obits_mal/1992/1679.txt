        The Rev. Morris F. Arnold, the retired assistant bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts and an advocate on housing, poverty and other social issues, died Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 77 years old and lived in nearby Belmont.
        He died of heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. Arnold held posts in national Episcopal bodies and was chairman of the the Episcopal Publishing Company, which issues The Witness, a magazine on social issues.
        He co-founded and led the Church and City Conference to help urban rectors focus on the problems of the poor. He started an urban program in southern Ohio that became a national model for Episcopal churches.
        Mr. Arnold was the assistant bishop from 1972-82. Earlier he served 22 years as rector of Christ Church in Cincinnati. There he was president of the local Council of Churches.
        Mr. Arnold, nicknamed Ben, was born in Minneapolis. His marriage to Margaret Bradley ended in divorce.
        Surviving are his wife of 14 years, the former Harriet Borda Schmidgall; a daughter, Jacqueline Arnold Crocker of Walnut Creek, Calif.; a son, William M. Arnold of Randolph, N.H.; a sister, Jane Sketchly of San Francisco; a stepdaughter, Judy Wilcox of Arlington, Mass., and three grandchildren.
