        Malvin P. Sevin, a leader in the home-heating oil industry, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
        He died of lymphoma, said Joseph P. Cavanaugh, a senior vice president of the Petroleum Heat and Power Company.
        Mr. Sevin was chairman and co-chief executive of Petroleum Heat and Power, whose operations are centered in the Northeast. He was a spokesman for the oil heating industry and an advocate of petroleum conservation.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Sevin earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the Cornell University School of Engineering in 1938 and 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a son, Irik; and a daughter, Jaar-mel Sloan, both of Manhattan; and two sisters, Edith Cohen and Sylvia Dwork, whose places of residence were unavailable.
