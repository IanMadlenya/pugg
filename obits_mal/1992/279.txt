        Hugh McDaid, director of the special task force in the State Department of Labor that polices child labor and other sweatshop conditions in the New York garment industry, died on Friday at the Barbara Cheung Memorial Hospice in Metuchen, N.J. He was 53 years old and lived in Harrison, N.J.
        He died of cancer, a department spokesman said.
        Mr. McDaid, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey, where he taught before joining the department in 1966 as a senior investigator in its Division of Labor Standards. The division formed a garment-industry enforcement unit in 1985 and appointed Mr. McDaid as its head.
        The unit's work led to State legislation that established the Apparel Industry Task Force in 1987, along with a registration system for manufacturers and contractors in the industry. Its purpose was to root out the use of children as workers, cheating on wages and benefits and subjecting workers to hazardous conditions. Helped Win Payment
        Last year, according to Labor Department, Mr. McDaid and his unit won the payment of more than $1 million for garment workers who had been underpaid. Another million in penalties was assessed against companies that had violated the state's child labor law or registration and record-keeping requirements, the department said.
        Mr. McDaid was the author of the State's portion of a 1980 State-Federal study of industrial homework, which is illegal in New York. He said such work was not, as many people seemed to think, somebody sitting in Vermont by a cozy stove knitting a sweater. Rather, he said, "It's like an assembly line that comes crashing through your living room window, dispensing stuff at you that you have to run like hell to keep up with."
        He was also influential in improving the Federal-state effort against crime in the garment industry.
        Mr. McDaid is survived by a brother, David, of Milford, N.J.
