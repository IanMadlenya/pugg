        Hugh Thomson Kerr Jr., author and emeritus professor of theology at Princeton Theological Seminary, died on Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. He was 82 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He died of acute respiratory distress syndrome, a spokesman at the medical center said.
        Joining the Princeton Seminary faculty in 1940, Dr. Kerr was named Benjamin B. Warfield Professor of Theology in 1950 and held the position until his retirement in 1974.
        Dr. Kerr was associated with the ecumenical religious quarterly Theology Today from its first issue in 1944 until his death. He became senior editor in 1950.
        Dr. Kerr, who was born in Chicago, graduated from Princeton University and received master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh and Western Theological Seminary in 1934. After studies at Tubingen University in Germany, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh in 1936.
        A Guggenheim Fellow in 1960, Dr. Kerr belonged to numerous academic and church committees, including the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, the National Council of Churches' Committee on Church Architecture and the American Academy of Religion. A champion of women's rights, he was also a member of the World Council of Churches' Commission on Women.
        Dr. Kerr, author of many articles and a dozen books, is best known for his collected essays, "Our Life in God's Light," published in 1979 by Westminster, and for his annual devotion manual, "A Year with the Bible," by Westminster/John Knox.
        He is survived by a son, Stephen T. of Seattle; a sister, Anna Kerr Young of Sarasota, Fla., and a brother, Donald C., also of Sarasota.
