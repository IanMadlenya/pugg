        Bernard R. Kant, a former president and chairman of the Gimbel Brothers Philadelphia division, died Sept. 15 at his home in Elkins Park, Pa. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Kant died of congestive pulmonary disease, said his daughter, Carole K. Rosenthal of Jenkintown, Pa.
        Mr. Kant was president of Gimbel Brothers' six-store division in the Greater Philadelphia area from 1968 to 1973 and chairman from 1974 to 1976. He played a leading role in the commercial revitalization of downtown Philadelphia during that period.
        A native of McKeesport, Pa., he was reared in Pittsburgh and as an adolescent began working in local department stores. After earning a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Pittsburgh in 1930, he went to work as a sales clerk in a Pittsburgh department store.
        In 1934 he joined Gimbel Brothers in Pittsburgh and held several executive positions before leaving in 1951 to work for another department store in the city. He returned to Gimbel Brothers in 1957 and joined the Philadelphia division the next year as general merchandise manager.
        He left Gimbels in 1976 when the company was acquired by B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. of Britain, and became president of Silo Inc., an electronics store chain. He retired in 1981.
        Mr. Kant's first wife, Sara Broldo, died in 1982. His second wife, Zelda Meyer, died last year. He is survived by his daughter and two grandchildren.
