        Capt. Gerald P. O'Driscoll, president, chief executive and part owner of the Circle Line-Statue of Liberty Ferry Inc., died Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 84 years old.
        The company said he died of a heart attack.
        He usually ran the ferry line from an office at the Brooklyn Navy Yard where he could oversee the maintenance of the six ferries that carry visitors to the statue and to Ellis Island.
        He kept his ferry captain's license up to date so he could take over and show new helmsmen how to manage the tricky currents in New York Harbor. He also was a licensed marine-electrical engineer.
        Captain O'Driscoll was the last surviving founder of the Circle Line Sightseeing Yachts. A native of Ireland, he kept a home in Bantry, County Cork, Ireland. He emigrated to the United States as a young man. After serving in the Coast Guard in World War II, he and four partners bought boats and started Circle Line Sightseeing Yachts to carry tourists around Manhattan Island, a venture that grew into a major tourist attraction.
        The partnership sold that part of the operation in 1981 but kept the Statue of Liberty Ferry. The boats around Manhattan and to Liberty Island and back have carried more than 60 million riders to date.
        Captain O'Driscoll is survived by his wife, Delia; a son, Gerald P. Jr. of Dallas, and two brothers, Denis of County Cork, and Jeremiah of New York City.
        Correction:  November 18, 1993
        An obituary on Nov. 18 about Capt. Gerald P. O'Driscoll, who was president, chief executive and part owner of the Circle Line-Statue of Liberty Ferry Inc. and who died on Nov. 14, misstated his relationship to the original ferry line. He was the second-to-last surviving founder of the line, the Circle Line Sightseeing Yachts; a brother, Jeremiah, of New York City, is the last surviving founder. This correction was delayed through an editing lapse.
