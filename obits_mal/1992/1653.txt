        Mr. Shearer created the comic strip "Quincy," about an inner-city boy. The cartoon was syndicated for 16 years by King Features. Mr. Shearer also collaborated with his son on the "Billy Jo Jive" book series, which became the basis of an animated feature for the children's television show "Sesame Street."
        Mr. Shearer was born in Jamaica and grew up in Harlem. At 16, he sold his first cartoon to The Amsterdam News, and later he studied art at the Pratt Institute. In World War II he served in the Army's 92d Division and was an illustrator for the newspaper Stars and Stripes. He later freelanced, selling drawings to The Ladies' Home Journal, The Saturday Evening Post and other publications.
        Mr. Shearer was an art director for 15 years at the advertising agency BBDO. In his later years, he turned to painting and had a number of shows.  He was a founding member of the Westchester Clubmen, a civic group for black professionals, and a member of the National Cartoonists Society and the Society of Professional Journalists, Sigma Delta Chi.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Phyllis, the deputy commissioner of social services for Westchester County; a daughter, Kathleen Shepherd of Stamford, Conn., and three grandchildren.
