        Eugene Boe, an author and a former columnist for Cue magazine, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan and Fergus Falls, Minn.
        He died of liver failure, said an associate, Jerome Agel.
        Mr. Boe, a graduate of Harvard University, worked for several advertising agencies before he started writing his nightclub Broadway column for Cue in the 1960's and 70's. The weekly later was folded into New York magazine by the publisher Rupert Murdoch when he bought Cue in 1980.
        Mr. Boe wrote several diet books, among them "The Rutgers Guide to Lowering Your Cholesterol," with Hans Fisher as co-author in 1985 (Rutgers University Press). He and Mr. Agel published "Test Your Word Power" in 1984 (Ballantine Books). Mr. Agel said Mr. Boe's last book, "Why in the World: Adventures in Geography," written with George J. Demko of Dartmouth College, is scheduled for publication by Anchor-Doubleday in May.
        Mr. Boe is survived by his mother, Mary T. Boe of Fergus Falls.
