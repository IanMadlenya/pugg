        Champion Jack Dupree, a New Orleans-born jazz pianist whose barrelhouse style influenced rock musicians like Eric Clapton and John Mayall, died of cancer on Tuesday at his home in Hanover, Germany. He was 82 years old and had lived in Hanover since 1975.
        He had been living in Europe since 1958, said Karsten Jahnke, his agent. He often performed in clubs in Britain, where Mr. Clapton and other young musicians learned from his rollicking blues styling.
        Mr. Dupree was orphaned when his parents died in a fire. He earned his nickname from boxing as a youth.
