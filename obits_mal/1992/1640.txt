        Carlos Querejeta, vice president and controller of Serino Coyne, an advertising agency specializing in theatrical accounts, died on Friday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        He had been with the agency for about 10 years before retiring recently because of ill health.
        Born in Cuba, he received his early education at the Academia De La Salle in Havana and later graduated from Belmont Abbey College in Belmont, N.C., and from the University of Havana, where he studied accounting.
        He left Cuba as an exile in 1960 and over the years, worked for Paramount Pictures, Encyclopedia Britannica, and Praeger Publishers in New York, and for Publicaciones Britannica in Madrid.
