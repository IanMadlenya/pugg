        Alfred Spellman Moss, a retired advertising and publishing executive, died on Dec. 19 at his home in Manhattan. He was 79 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Moss, who had an M.B.A. degree from Harvard University, retired three years ago as business manager of the Thomas Publishing Company in Manhattan. He remained a consultant for the company until last year.
        As an Army colonel in World War II, he worked in counterintelligence for the Manhattan Project. He then had a career in advertising, eventually producing television commercials for American and international companies. He also produced a Beatles cartoon series for King Features in Liverpool, using the singers' voices on the soundtrack. It was broadcast in this country in the 1960's.
        Mr. Moss later was a marketing executive at the Chock Full o'Nuts Corporation and joined Thomas Publishing in the mid-1970's. He was an active member of the Friars Club.
        He is survived by his wife, Rhoda Sande.
