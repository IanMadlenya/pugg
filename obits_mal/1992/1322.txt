        Larry Pond, a founder and the first chairman of the Design Industry Foundation for AIDS in New York City, died yesterday in St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was 42 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Pond died of AIDS, said Muriel Chess, a friend.
        In 1984 Mr. Pond helped to organize the foundation, which now has offices in 13 cities across the country and has raised more than $10 million for AIDS education, prevention and support services across the country. A native of Indianapolis, Mr. Pond received a bachelor's degree from the University of Cincinnati. His professional career was spent with three architectural and design firms. He was a director of sales and marketing for Herman Miller of Canada, vice president of Environmental Planning and Research in San Francisco and senior vice president of Stendig International in New York City.
        Mr. Pond was also a board member of two organizations of interior design and architectural professionals: the Resources Council and Designer's Saturday.
        He is survived by his parents, William and Lois Pond of Indianapolis; a sister, Barbara Ann Richard of Greenwood, Ind., and his companion, Stephen Gooch of Manhattan.
