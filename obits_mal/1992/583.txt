        Don H. Brown, a retired weekly newspaper publisher and former New York State Assemblyman, died on Tuesday at Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Fla.
        He was 85 years old and lived in Fort Myers. He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Brown and a brother purchased a paper in Baldwinsville, near Syracuse, in 1929. Soon he bought out his brother and expanded Brown Newspapers to include eight weeklies in the Syracuse area and another paper near Buffalo. He also served as president of the New York Press Association, an industry organization of several hundred community papers. He sold the company in 1966 and retired.
        A Republican Assemblyman from 1959 to 1962, he was among a handful of conservatives who dissented from Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller by voting against a gasoline tax increase in 1959.
        In his retirement, Mr. Brown pursued his hobby of bridge and became a life master.
        Mr. Brown was born in Syracuse, the son of the Rev. Wallace E. Brown, a Methodist bishop, and graduated from Syracuse University.
        His wife of more than 40 years, the former Beatrice Bazata, died in 1976. He is survived by three daughters, Judith Brown of Bradenton, Fla., Deborah Boots of Noxon, Mont., and Prudence Lev of North Salem, N.Y., and by four grandchildren.
