        Moe Ginsburg, whose store offering quality men's clothing at inexpensive prices is a fixture of the New York retailing industry, died on Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 76 years old and lived in Lawrence, N.Y.
        Mr. Ginsburg died of heart failure after a brief illness, said his son, Paul.
        Mr. Ginsburg was a third-generation clothier. His grandfather sold clothes and other items from a wagon in Russia, and his father, Jacob, owned a clothing store in East New York, Brooklyn, where Mr. Ginsburg began working at age 11. Paul Ginsburg said that his father had told of being late for his bar mitzvah because he was waiting on a customer at the store. He graduated from high school, but did not go to college, preferring, as he often said, to get his education on the retail floor.  Active in Many Charities
        Mr. Ginsburg operated his own store in East New York and then spent 15 years manufacturing men's clothing before he opened Moe Ginsburg, Men's Better Clothing, as a "no-frills, pipe rack" operation in the mid-1960's, offering fashionable men's wear at lower prices than department stores. He moved the store to its present location on Fifth Avenue at 21st Street in the early 1970's.
        Mr. Ginsburg was active in numerous charities, but preferred to make his contributions anonymously. In 1988, when New York City school officials briefly considered dressing students at some public school students in uniforms, Mr. Ginsburg was one of two garment industry figures who donated clothing for the effort.
        Mr. Ginsburg's wife, Sydel, died in 1979. In addition to his son, Paul, of Manhattan, he is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Horowitz and Alice Feltheimer, both of Lawrence, N.Y.; two sisters, Rachel Weissfuse, of Garden City, L.I., and Eleanor Saxe, of Hempstead, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
