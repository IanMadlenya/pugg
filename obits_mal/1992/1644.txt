        Dr. Max Gruenewald, international president of the Leo Baeck Institutes and Rabbi Emeritus of Congregation B'nai Israel of Millburn, N.J., died yesterday at his home in Millburn. He was 93.
        He died of cancer, said Jenks Schachter, a friend of the family.
        For a quarter of a century, Dr. Gruenewald served as spiritual leader of B'nai Israel, conducting Bible classes and Jewish studies groups, counseling congregants and serving as liaison with the larger Millburn community.
        After retirement in 1970, he conducted auxiliary services and continued to publish monthly editorials and essays in the congregation's bulletin, which were collected in his book, "Here, There, and Above," published by Ktav of New York in 1979.
        Besides his activities as rabbi, Dr. Gruenewald, a scholar and bibliophile, ran the Leo Baeck Institute in New York and sister institutions in London and Jerusalem, which publish and preserve historical and cultural documents of Jews who lived in German-speaking countries.
        Born in Upper Silesia, Germany, he served in the German artillery, stationed in East Prussia, in 1917-18. He received a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Breslau in 1925 and at the same time was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau.
        After leaving with his family for Palestine in 1938, Rabbi Gruenwald was invited to do research at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York. He also worked with the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe, an organization he later headed.
        He received an honorary doctorate in philosophy in 1970 from Bar Ilan University in Israel.
        He is survived by a son, Dr. Ruben Gruenewald of Manhattan, and a sister, Betty Hinden of Israel.
