        He died of meningitis, said his office, Salvato & Company.
        Mr. Salvato was born in San Francisco on June 3, 1952. He was educated at the University of California at Berkeley, receiving his B.A. in 1974 and his Master of Architecture degree in 1977.  After graduation, Mr. Salvato worked for the architectural firms of Esherick, Homsey, Dodge & Davis in San Francisco and Mitchell/Giurgola in New York City.
        He moved to New Orleans in 1981 to work with Charles W. Moore and William Turnbull on the design of the 1984 World Exposition, including the fair's "Wonderwall" theme building.
        Mr. Salvato opened his own office in New Orleans in 1984 and soon established his reputation for imaginative conversions of historic warehouse buildings to residential use. His bright, contemporary designs for apartment buildings, shops and restaurants are widely credited with giving new life to the city's warehouse district and waterfront. Mr. Salvato was also the principal designer for the Aquarium of the Americas, the Audubon Zoo Learning Center and the Louisiana Children's Museum, all in New Orleans.
        His work has been honored with awards from the American Institute of Architects and the New Orleans Historic District Landmarks Commission.
