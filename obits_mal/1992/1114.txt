        Henry Jaffe, a former show-business lawyer who became an award-winning television producer, died on Sept. 11 at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 85 years old.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Jaffe received diplomas from Columbia University and its law school. He was a founder of the American Guild of Musical Artists and of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, for which he served as national counsel in its first 20 years. He resigned in 1957.
        After years as a partner with his brother, Saul, in Showcase Productions, Mr. Jaffe became an independent producer in 1957. His shows, which frequently won Emmy and Peabody citations, included such favorites of the 1950's and 60's as "The Bell Telephone Hour," "Shirley Temple's Storybook," "Goodyear Playhouse' and "The Dinah Shore Show."
        His company also produced specials for television, including a profile of the Tanglewood Music Festival, "Peter Pan" starring Mary Martin, the Old Vic's "Romeo and Juliet" with Claire Bloom, the Sadler's Wells Ballet, "Cyrano de Bergerac" with Jose Ferrer, and "Festival of Music" with Arthur Rubinstein, Gregor Piatagorsky and Marian Anderson.
        Mr. Jaffe's marriage to the actress Jean Muir ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the former Florence Davidson; a daughter, Margaret Ann, and two sons, Michael and David, from his first marriage; two daughters, Rebecca and Rachel, from his second marriage, and four grandchildren.
