        Dr. Saul S. Weinberg, professor emeritus of art history and archeology at the University of Missouri at Columbia and the founding director of the university's Museum of Art and Archeology, died Saturday at his home in Columbia. He was 80 years old.
        The museum said he died after a brief illness and had been doing research for the university's excavations at Tel Anafa, Israel.
        Born in Chicago, Dr. Weinberg received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in architecture from the University of Illinois and a Ph.D. in classical archeology from Johns Hopkins University. He took part in archeological digs in Greece before World War II, served with the Army in Europe in the war and returned to excavations in Cyprus and on Crete after the war.
        In 1948, Dr. Weinberg joined the University of Missouri's faculty as an assistant professor of classical languages and archeology. He founded the museum in 1957 and saw it grow into the third largest art museum in Missouri. He revived the university's department of art history and archeology in 1960 and was its first chairman.
        In the late 1960's he also held leading positions in Jerusalem at the Hebrew Union College and the Archeological Museums. Then, until 1973, he directed the Tel Anafa excavations. He reached emeritus status at the university and its museum in 1977.
        Dr. Weinberg is survived by his wife, Dr. Gladys D. Weinberg; a daughter, Miriam Dyak of Seattle, and his brother, Norman, of Chicago.
