        Dr. Paul V. Lemkau, a psychiatrist and health administrator who was a leading advocate of treating mental health problems in community settings, died on Sunday at his home in the Chesapeake Bay town of Lusby, Md. He was 82 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Lemkau promoted the concept of community walk-in mental health clinics, in contrast to large state-run residential institutions. He also urged that mental disorders be viewed as public health problems and treated in the context of social issues and trends; for example, with programs to combat drug abuse.  Mental Health Positions
        In 1961 Dr. Lemkau was appointed founding chairman of the mental hygiene department at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, where he was on the faculty until his retirement in 1978. He also served as chief of the Maryland State Health Department's mental hygiene division from 1949 to 1953 and was the first director of New York City's Community Mental Health Board, a post he held from 1955 to 1957.
        Dr. Lemkau outlined his concept of community mental health in his text, "Mental Hygiene in Public Health" (McGraw-Hill, 1949). He was a consultant to the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. He worked on public health projects in Japan, Yugoslavia, Venezuela and Italy and taught in Mexico and other Latin American countries.
        Born in Springfield, Ill., he grew up there and in Ohio. After graduating from Baldwin-Wallace College, he earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins in 1935. In World War II he served as an Army psychiatrist at Walter Reed Hospital and in Europe.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Ruth Roehm; a son, Philip Lemkau of Yellow Springs, Ohio; four daughters, Carolyn Steiner of Baltimore, Ann Haupt of Summit, N.J., Mary Horn of Micanopy, Fla., and Elizabeth Wheeler of Fayetteville, Ark.; 10 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.
