        Herman (Junior) Cook, a tenor saxophonist, was found dead on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 57 years old.
        The cause of death has not been determined, said Beatrice Henellin, his companion.
        Mr. Cook, a prominent figure in New York jazz ensembles since the mid-1950's, was a hard-toned and unsentimental instrumentalist steeped in mainstream jazz. He was noted for his intelligent and lucid improvisations.
        He joined Dizzy Gillespie's group in 1958. That same year, he became a member of an ensemble headed by the pianist Horace Silver, replacing Clifford Jordan. His association with Mr. Silver's group, which continued until 1964, helped make his reputation.
        Until 1973, when he joined the trumpeter Freddie Hubbard for several years, he worked and recorded with a variety of musicians, including Barry Harris, Blue Mitchell, John Patton and Don Patterson. He also spent a year teaching at Berklee College of Music in Boston.
        In the mid-1970's, he and the trumpeter Bill Hardman formed the Bill Hardman/Junior Cook Quintet, which made a name for itself with its fiery and intense shows. During that time, he worked and recorded with Mickey Tucker and Louis Hayes.
        Mr. Cook had recently been performing with Clifford Jordan's orchestra at Condon's on Monday nights and leading his own band.
        He is survived by two brothers, Robert and John, of Pensacola, Fla.
