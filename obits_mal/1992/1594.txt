        The Rev. Marvin V. Frey, an evangelical minister who wrote many well-known songs of faith, died on Saturday at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 74 years old and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure, his wife, Helen, said.
        Mr. Frey, a native of Sherwood, Ore., was active in evangelical ministry work for the nondenominational Independent Assemblies of God at an early age. During the 1930's, he played piano on many occasions for the evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. In 1956, he founded the Children's Fund of New York, which ministers to needy children throughout the city.
        He wrote more than 2,000 songs, many of them during evangelistic gatherings. His best-known song is "Kum Ba Yah," which he wrote at 17 while attending a Christian Crusade camp.  He wrote the song as "Come By Here," but a youth at the camp took it to his parents, who used it in their missionary work in Angola, where it acquired its more popular title. Other songs he wrote include "He Is Lord," "This Is My Commandment," "I've Got Peace Like a River" and "Do, Lord."
        Besides his wife, Mr. Frey is survived by five brothers, James, of Lincoln City, Ore., Howard, of Portland, Ore., Gerald, of White City, Ore., Gilbert, of Milwaukie, Ore., and John, who lives in California, and three sisters, Henrietta Sorenson of Canton, Ohio, Gladys Gortner of Portland and Geraldine Thompson of Severna Park, Md.
