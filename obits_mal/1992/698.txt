        Alexander W. Faber, a certified public accountant in Manhattan for the last 50 years, died on Sunday at New York University Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived on the Upper East Side.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan and graduate of City College, Mr. Faber practiced for an international clientele, doing general tax work. The practice he operated under his own name merged into another Manhattan firm, Phillips Gold & Company, early this year, but he remained active there until his health began to fail about two months ago.
        Mr. Faber is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, the former Anne Levy; two sons, Peter, of Manhattan, and Andrew, of Monte Sereno, Calif.; a daughter, Ellen Wright of Evanston, Ill.; a brother, Harold, of Ancram, N.Y.; a sister, Rowena Barrett of Redding, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
