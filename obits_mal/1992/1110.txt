        Walter H. Hindle, an authority on the manufacture and marketing of textiles and man-made fibers, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a long illness, said a niece, Judith Riegle.
        Mr. Hindle was president of Walter H. Hindle Inc. and Hargreaves-Hindle Inc. The companies, which he founded in 1958, serve as consultants to many leading textile and chemical companies.
        He held or was co-holder of more than 20 American and foreign patents in fiber, yarn and fabric colorations and wrote extensively for textile industry journals.
        Before founding the companies, Mr. Hindle was director of textile research and development for the Chemstrand Corporation, predecessor to the Monsanto Company, and previously had worked for several other textile and chemical companies in England, Canada and the United States, including Burlington Industries and the Celanese Corporation.
        Born in England, Mr. Hindle graduated from the Manchester College of Science and Technology in 1934. He emigrated that year to Canada, where he worked six years for a textile company, then emigrated to the United States.
        Mr. Hindle is survived by his wife of 58 years, Doreen, and a brother, C. Norman, of Otley, England.
