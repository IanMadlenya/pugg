        John J. Bagatta, whose 44-year career at R. H. Macy & Company took him from stockman to senior vice president, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Huntington Station, L.I.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Bagatta, a native of New York City, studied engineering at Syracuse University and merchandising at New York University. He went to work in a Macy's stockroom in 1939 at the age of 18, but World War II put his career on hold for three years while he served as a bomber pilot.
        He was promoted to deputy branch manager in 1953 and branch manager in Flatbush in 1959. Moving up the corporate ladder, he became a vice president in 1964. He was a merchandise vice president responsible for misses' and women's sportswear and coats and fashion fabrics in 1971, when Macy's named him senior vice president and director of its Long Island branches. Later, he took charge of the Cellar Marketplace and Macy's restaurants. He retired in 1986.
        Active in the Roman Catholic Church, he was a decorated Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and a member of the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity for the Archdiocese of New York. He also held lay positions in the Long Island Diocese.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Angela; a daughter, Maria Odum of Charlottesville, Va.; a sister, Catherine, of Mineola, L.I., and a brother, Frank, of Stony Brook, L.I.
