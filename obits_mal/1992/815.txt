        Martin L. H. Reymert, a theater director and a founder of the Shepherd Gallery on Madison Avenue, died on Wednesday at his home in Paris. He was 56 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his sister, Randi Olsen, of Platteville, Wis.
        An expert in 19th-century drawings, Mr. Reymert co-founded the Shepherd Gallery in 1966 and was its co-director until 1986. The gallery is esteemed for its shows of lesser-known 19th-century artists and a series of accompanying catalogues.
        Mr. Reymert was born in Aurora, Ill., and attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. He moved to New York in 1961 and established the Drawing Shop, a gallery in Greenwich Village. In the late 1960's and 70's, he acted in, directed and designed sets for many Off Off Broadway productions for the Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater and other companies.
        As an owner of Gallery Productions, a theater group, he produced the premiere of Robert Patrick's "Haunted Host" and presented "Desire Caught by the Tail," a Surrealist play written by the artist Picasso in the 1940's.
        In addition to Mrs. Olsen, he is survived by another sister, Karen J. Morlock of Lansing, Ill.
