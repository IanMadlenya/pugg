        Dr. Joseph George Druss, an ear, nose and throat specialist associated with Mount Sinai School of Medicine for more than six decades, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Druss, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Columbia College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. His ties to Mount Sinai date to 1925, when he began his residency in otolaryngology there. He then spent a year of advanced studies in Vienna and upon his return in 1928 organized the country's first temporal-bone laboratory at Mount Sinai.
        Dr. Druss was an authority on the histopathology of the ear, the study of the microscopic changes in tissues caused by disease. He identified petrositis, an inflammation of the petrous -- or stony -- portion of the temporal bone, the skull bone that encases and protects the inner ear.
        He was the author of many articles on his subject. He remained on the attending staff at Mount Sinai until 1972 and then continued as a consultant to its otolaryngology department until his retirement 10 years ago.
        Dr. Druss is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Ruth Luwish; a daughter, Susan Alan of San Francisco; a son, Dr. Richard Druss of Manhattan; a brother, Abe Druss of Roslyn, L.I., and four grandchildren.
