        Vice Adm. John C. Daniel, retired, who played an important role in the negotiations that led to the exchange of wounded and ill Korean War prisoners and to the end of the war itself, died Monday at North Beach Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he lived. He was 93 years old.
        He died of complications of pneumonia and heart problems, his family said.
        A career Navy officer, Admiral Daniel served with the United Nations command during the Korean War and became one of the truce negotiators whose efforts led to the signing of the armistice agreement at Panmunjom on July 27, 1953.
        And in April of that year it was Admiral Daniel, as head of a body called the Allied Liaison Group, who put his signature to the document by which United Nations and North Korean negotiators agreed to the repatriation of disabled prisoners.
        The admiral later served as commander of the Atlantic Fleet and as commandant of the Sixth Naval District, based in Charleston, S.C. He retired in 1960.
        Admiral Daniel was born in Philadelphia, grew up there and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1924. He served his first tour of duty on a destroyer.
        In World War II, he fought in major engagements like the Battle of Midway, where American forces destroyed three enemy aircraft carriers, essentially crippling the Japanese Navy.
        In September 1945, Admiral Daniel was present at the surrender ceremony in Tokyo Bay aboard the U.S.S. Missouri.
        Admiral Daniel was married three times. His last wife, Gervaise, died in 1981. He is survived by two sons, John C. Daniel Jr. of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Tim D. Daniel of Pleasant Hill, Calif.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
