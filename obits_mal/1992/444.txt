        Joseph Patelson, the owner of the Joseph Patelson Music House, died on Friday at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan, where he was being treated after a stroke. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Patelson's is known to musicians around the world, and for decades has been the source of sheet music, books and recordings for countless performers and music lovers, including Arthur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, James Levine and Frank Sinatra.
        In 1940, Mr. Patelson inherited the store, then called the Half-Price Music Shop, after the death of its owner, Ernest Cook, for whom he worked. He renamed it the Joseph Patelson Music House and in 1947 moved it to an 1879 carriage house directly behind Carnegie Hall.
        Mr. Patelson, an amateur composer and pianist, met his wife, Nell, in 1934 when he sold her a book of manuscript paper for 12 cents.
        He is survived by a son, Daniel, of Bayside, Queens; a brother, Henry, of Southbury, Conn., and a grandson, Michael.
