        Jerry Jontry, a former president of the publishing group of Esquire Inc., died on Sunday at his Manhattan home. He was 81 years old.
        He died after a long illness, said Fred Ferguson, a family friend.
        Mr. Jontry, a native of Chenoa, Ill., and graduate of the University of Chicago, spent four decades in newspaper and magazine publishing. At Esquire, which is now a Hearst publication, he was the magazine's advertising director from 1964 to 1970.
        He then became the first president of the publishing group, then made up of Esquire and Gentlemen's Quarterly magazines. He left in 1975 to start his own advertising research firm in New York and remained active in the business until about two years ago.
        He served in the Navy as a lieutenant commander in World War II.
        Mr. Jontry is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Jonathan, of Akron, Ohio; and a sister, Alberdine Smith of Galesburg, Ill.
