        Cosmo Sirchio, a fashion industry executive and former fashion designer, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Mr. Sirchio was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Newtown, Conn.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his companion and business partner, Donald Friese.
        Mr. Sirchio, who was born in Norristown, Pa., and graduated from Lafayette University, worked for a securities firm on Wall Street for two years before turning to fashion. He studied at the Parsons School of Design for two years, then went to Paris to work with another designer, Bob Bugnand, on a fashion collection.
        Returning to New York in 1963, he opened a custom clothing salon on East 58th Street, designing glamorous evening wear for women in the theater and society including Diahann Carroll, Carol Burnett, Gloria Swanson, Mary Lou Whitney, Anne Slater and Lady Sarah Churchill.
        After closing his custom business, he became an executive in the ready-to-wear industry, serving as president of Gloria Vanderbilt's company and later of John Anthony's company. In 1980, he founded Cosmo Sirchio Inc., a showroom for representing young designers to retail stores. In 1986, Mr. Friese became his partner in Sirchio Friese.
        Mr. Sirchio is survived by three sons, Jeffrey, of Trumbull, Conn., Kris, of Germany, and the Rev. Bryan, of Three Lakes, Wis.; a sister, Theresa, of Norristown, and three grandchildren.
        A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, 348 East 55th Street.
