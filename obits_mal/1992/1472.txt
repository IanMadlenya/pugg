        Dr. William Fields Harrington, the Henry Walters professor of biology at Johns Hopkins University since 1975, died at his home in Baltimore Saturday. He was 72 years old.
        The university announced his death yesterday. His family said the cause was heart failure.
        Dr. Harrington, a physical biochemist, was best known for his research on the structure and function of two very large molecules of life. They are collagens, a fibrous protein found in connective tissue, bone and cartilage; and myosins, which are responsible for muscle contraction in all living creatures.
        His work advanced scientific knowledge about how the flexing force of muscle originates and how the chemical energy of the body is converted into the mechanical energy of muscle flexing. He was the author or co-author of more than 125 articles in scientific journals.
        Dr. Harrington was born in Seattle and received both his bachelor of science degree and Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley after serving with the United States Marine Corps in World War II. He did his post-doctoral studies at Cambridge University in England and Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen.
        At various times he held visiting professorships at the Weizman Institute in Rehevot, Israel, at Oxford University and at the University of Washington.
        He joined the faculty at Johns Hopkins in 1960 as a professor of biology. From 1973 to 1983 he was chairman of the university's department of biology and director of its McCollum-Pratt Institute of research. The National Institutes of Health recently honored him with a meritorious award for research.
        Dr. Harrington is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Ingeborg Leuschner; a daughter, Susan Harrington of Fort Worth; four sons, David and Robert, both of Baltimore, Peter, who lives in Oregon, and Eric, a Massachusetts resident, and four grandchildren.
