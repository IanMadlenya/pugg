        Marshall Sklare, a leading authority on the sociology of American Jewry, died on March 1 at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass. He was 70 years old and lived in Newton Centre, Mass.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Sklare (the name rhymes with lair) was the Klutznick Family Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies and Sociology emeritus at Brandeis University and a driving force behind the creation of the university's Cohen Center for Modern Jewish Studies, the first research center on Jewish life in America. He was the director of the center from 1980 to 1986, a period in which it became a focal point for new scholarship on the history and sociology of American Jews. Author and Essayist
        "Marshall really was the founding father of American Jewish sociology," said Jonathan Sarna, Braun Professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis.
        Dr. Sklare joined the Brandeis faculty as a professor of Jewish sociology in 1969. He was chairman of the university's Near Eastern and Judaic department in 1982 and 1983. He retired from Brandeis in December 1990.
        His many books and essays gave new insights into the American Jewish identity. Among his most influential writings were "America's Jews" (Random House, 1971); "Conservative Judaism: An American Religious Movement" (Free Press, 1955), and "Understanding American Jewry" (Transaction Books, New Brunswick, 1982).
        Surviving are his wife, Rose Bernards; two sons, Daniel Sklare of Baltimore and Joshua Sklare of Seattle; a daughter, Judith Sklare of Newton Centre; two brothers, Allen Sklare of Indianapolis and Robert Sklare of Chicago, and eight grandchildren.
