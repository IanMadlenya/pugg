        Col. Alva L. Harvey, a pioneer military aviator who survived 10 days in Alaska's wilderness after crashing on an around-the-world flight attempt in 1924, died on Monday at Mount Vernon Hospital in Arlington, Va. He was 92 years old and lived in Arlington.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Colonel Harvey was the mechanic in the two-member crew that survived more than a week in freezing temperatures before finding a cannery settlement. Undaunted by the experience, Colonel Harvey became a pilot himself.
        In 1941 he commanded an around-the-world flight of 24,600 miles that set a record of 121 hours and 55 minutes.
        In World War II, he helped produce B-29 bombers and took the first of them into service.
        His decorations included the Congressional Distinguished Service Medal, three Distinguished Flying Crosses and a Silver Star.
        He joined the Army in 1919 and retired in 1957.
        He is survived by two daughters, Helen Ahrens of Alexandria and Vivian Boling of Woodbridge, Va.; a stepdaughter, Harriet Brown of San Antonio; two sisters, Lela Morgan of Anchorage and Maud Vidler of Cleburne, Tex., six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
