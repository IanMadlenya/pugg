        Charles M. Grigg, an expert on the civil rights movement and a professor emeritus of sociology at Florida State University, died on Oct. 14 at his home in Tallahassee, Fla. He was 73 years old.
        A family friend, John Griffin, said the professor died of cancer.
        Dr. Grigg wrote or was the co-author of 15 books, including "Racial Crisis in America," published in 1964 by Prentice-Hall. The book, which he wrote with a colleague at Florida State, Lewis M. Killian, was praised by a reviewer in The New York Times in 1964 for its "excellent reappraisal" of the civil rights movement, which was then sweeping the nation.
        He retired from Florida State in 1989 and was later appointed to the Pepper Commission on Aging, named for the late Representative Claude Pepper, Democrat of Florida.
        Dr. Grigg is survived by his wife, Virginia Caffee Grigg, the former chief of the Florida Bureau of Library Development; two sons, Meade and John Grigg, both of Tallahassee; a daughter, Ruth, of Fort Myers, Fla., and six grandchildren.
