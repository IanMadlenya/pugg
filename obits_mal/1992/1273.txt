        Ted Thomas, a Broadway and Hollywood producer, died on Wednesday at his home in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 88 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his son, Michael Tilson Thomas, the conductor.
        Mr. Thomas, whose name was originally Theodore Hertzl Thomashefsky, was the youngest son of Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky, pioneers of American Yiddish theater. He began his career at age 19 as assistant stage manager for Max Reinhardt's production of "The Miracle." As a production stage manager he worked closely with Alexander Smallens, Abe Feder and Virgil Thomson on the production of Mr. Thomson's 1934 opera "Four Saints in Three Acts."
        He was an associate producer in the Federal Theater Project and cast and staged the original production of Marc Blitzstein's 1937 musical "The Cradle Will Rock."
        He moved to California in the late 1930's as Paul Muni's personal producer. He became a story editor and screen-test director for several motion-picture studios and also wrote for television.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Roberta Thomas, and a brother, Harry, of North Hollywood, Calif.
