        Albert X. Bader Jr., a partner in the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 59 years old and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
        He died of complications from cancer, said Gabriel Belson, a spokeswoman for Simpson Thacher.
        Mr. Bader, a native of Brooklyn, earned a bachelor's degree from Georgetown University in 1953 and a law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1956. At the law school he was a Harlan Fiske Stone scholar and an editor of The Columbia Law Review.
        He served in the Army after graduation and joined Simpson Thacher in 1958, specializing in labor law. He represented many nonprofit hospitals in New York. He was a member of the City Bar Association in New York, of the Labor and Employment Law Committee of the American Hospital Association, and of the New York State Management Attorneys Conference.
        At Simpson Thacher he handled the pro bono representation of a Mississippi man, Willie Albert Smith, convicted of robbery and murder and sentenced to die who contended that he had not received a fair trial. The man's sentence was recently vacated by the Supreme Court and the case returned to a lower court for further consideration.
        Mr. Bader is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Keller; four sons, Albert X. 3d, of Doylestown, Pa., Christopher F., of Brookfield, Conn., Dr. Thomas J., of Oaklyn, N.J., and Paul L., of Bronxville; a sister, Elizabeth Conway, of Chatham, N.J., and two grandchildren.
