        Dr. Harry G. Burks Jr., a retired executive of the old Standard Oil Company in New Jersey, died on Wednesday at the Meadow Lakes Retirement Community in Hightstown, N.J. A longtime resident of Hillside, N.J., and Madison, Conn., he was 92 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Burks retired as coordinator of worldwide refining operations in 1964 after 40 years with the Standard Oil Company, now the Exxon Corporation. He joined the company in 1924 as a development engineer at the Bayway, N.J., refinery, and became general manager for East Coast manufacturing operations in 1943 and executive vice president in 1949, before being promoted to the refining coordinator's post in 1954.
        A native of Bedford, Va., he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Virginia and earned a doctorate in physical chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the year he went to work for Standard Oil.
        In World War II, the Petroleum Administration for War appointed him chairman of the Aviation Gasoline Advisory Committee, which was responsible for increasing the production of high-octane fuel for the Allied air forces.
        Dr. Burks is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Catherine Parnelle; three sons, Harry 3d of Montgomery, Tex., William of Princeton, N.J., and Robert of Chatham, N.J.; a sister, Rebekah Burks of Lynchburg, Va.; nine grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
