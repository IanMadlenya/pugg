        Charles A. Blessing, an architect and city planner, died Thursday at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. He was 80.
        He died of respiratory failure, his family said.
        Mr. Blessing was born in Montrose, Colo., and lived in Detroit. He was one of the first American urban planners to have been trained as such. After serving as Director of City Planning in Detroit from 1953 to 1977, he was appointed professor of architecture at the University of Detroit. He retired from the university in 1985.
        Mr. Blessing was noted for his thousands of sketches of ancient and modern cities, many of which he did while traveling through North America, Europe, the Middle East and India.
        He was an architectural engineering graduate of the University of Colorado and received a bachelor's degree in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he also received a master's degree in city planning in 1939. He then worked as a city planner in New Hampshire and Chicago.
        Mr. Blessing served with the Army Corps of Engineers in World War II and afterward was a city-planning officer at Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Curtis Long; two sons, Bayard W. Blessing of Boulder, Colo., and Curtis B. Blessing of Pleasant Ridge, Mich.; a sister, Elizabeth B. Haines of Phoenix, and two grandchildren.
