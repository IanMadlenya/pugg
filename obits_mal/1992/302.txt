        Dr. Samuel Victor Abraham, a prominent ophthalmologist who practiced in Los Angeles for more than 50 years, died on Feb. 20 at his home in Encino, Calif. He was 92 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Abraham, a Chicago native who received his medical degree from the University of Illinois in 1928, wrote and taught extensively on ophthalmology.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; three sons, Jerrold, of Syracuse, and William and Thomas, both of Los Angeles; a daughter, Rochelle Abraham Dick, also of Los Angeles, and nine grandchildren.
