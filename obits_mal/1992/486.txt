        Stanley H. Klein, an architect who specialized in housing developments, died on Sunday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I. He was 83 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of a stroke, said his wife, Audrey.
        Mr. Klein had his own architecture firm and designed houses for developments in towns around Long Island and the metropolitan area. Among his most noted designs was one for the one-family, six-room house that was shown at a 1959 American exhibition in Moscow, where Richard Nixon and the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev held their "kitchen debate."
        He also designed the Hillcrest Jewish Center, the Queensboro Jewish Center and Temple Beth Sholom, all in Queens, and the clubhouse for the Pine Hollow Country Club in East Norwich, L.I.
        Mr. Klein was a graduate of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art and of New York University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Michael, of Memphis, and David, of Ithaca, N.Y.; a daughter, Roberta Sprong of San Diego, and five grandchildren.
