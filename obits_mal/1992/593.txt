        William S. Hirschberg, who helped found the Charles A. Dana Foundation for higher education and medicine and was its secretary-treasurer and a board member for many years, died of cardiac arrest last Sunday at his home in Greenwich, Conn., a son, William R. Hirschberg, said. He was 102 years old.
        Born in Glenbrook, Conn., and educated at Colgate University and New York Law School, Mr. Hirschberg combined a distinguished legal career with a broad involvement in public service.
        He was a senior partner of the law firm of Hirschberg, Pettengill, Strong & Nagle, of Greenwich, until its merger in 1978 with the firm of Whitman & Ranson, and he remained of counsel to that firm until his death. He was also active in the Greenwich, the Connecticut and the American bar associations, and the Association of the Bar of the City of New York.
        During the 1920's and 1930's, Mr. Hirschberg was a member of the Greenwich school board and the town's Board of Estimate, a Connecticut state senator and a judge, and he continued throughout his life to serve on the boards of numerous schools and civic institutions there.
        His wife, the former Margaret Louise Roberts, died a few years ago. He is survived by two daughters, Margaret Courage and Mary Louise Parry, and two sons, William and John R. Hirschberg, all of Greenwich; 10 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
