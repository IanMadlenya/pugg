        Arthur Babbitt, an animator who created many memorable scenes and characters for Walt Disney, Hanna-Barbera and other studios, died on Wednesday at the Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 85 years old.
        He died of kidney failure, said his wife, Barbara.
        In a career spanning six decades, Mr. Babbitt gave Walt Disney's Goofy his character, created the dancing mushrooms in "Fantasia," gave form to the stork who announced Dumbo's arrival and enabled Fred Flintstone to sell vitamins on television.
        Mr. Babbitt was born in Omaha and began his professional career in animation in 1929 when he joined Terrytoons, Paul Terry's studio on Long Island, which created some of the earliest sound cartoons.
        Three years later he moved to California to work for the Walt Disney studio, then nine years old. He remained with Disney until 1941, when, citing union activities, the studio dismissed him.
        A strike resulted and the Cartoonists Guild became bargaining agent for the studio's workers. Disney was ordered to rehire Mr. Babbitt, who, after service in the Marines, worked there until 1947.
        Mr. Babbitt worked for several other studios, including Hanna-Barbera, where he was director of the commercial department and won more than 80 awards for his television advertisements. He also taught classes at Richard Williams Animation in London, the studio that won Oscars for the 1971 animated version of Dickens's "Christmas Carol" and the 1988 film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." His last animation is in Williams's "Thief and the Cobbler," to be released by Warner Brothers later this year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Karin, of Felton, Calif., and Michele, of Las Vegas, Nev., and a stepdaughter, Laurel James, of Los Angeles.
