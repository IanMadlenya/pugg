        Harry Gottlieb, a social realist painter and printmaker who depicted working people, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98 years old.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter, Amy, of Toronto.
        Working in the graphics division of the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, Mr. Gottlieb participated in a pilot endeavor to develop silk-screen printing as a fine-art medium. The prints he made by this process in the 1930's and 40's are among his best-known works.
        In 1977, Mr. Gottlieb helped organize a show of W.P.A. artists at the Parsons School of Design. In 1983 his contributions to the W.P.A. and the silk-screen method were seen in a solo exhibition at at Rutgers University. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan, Brooklyn and Whitney museums.
        Mr. Gottlieb was born in Romania and arrived in Minneapolis with his family in 1906. He studied at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, moved to New York in 1918, and settled in the artist's colony at Woodstock, N.Y., in 1923. He worked there for 12 years, until a Guggenheim Fellowship enabled him to study in Europe. He worked with the Federal Art Project from 1935 to 1940, became a leader and active member of the Artists Union and the Artists Congress, and joined the Communist Party, remaining a lifelong member.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a stepdaughter, Judy Tytell of New York City; a brother, Tully Gottlieb of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Eva Gottlieb of Minneapolis, and Bess Fleisher of Park Forest, Ill.
