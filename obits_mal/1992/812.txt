        William Sabella, coordinator of AIDS counseling and education at Yale-New Haven Hospital, died on Saturday at his home in North Haven, Conn. He was 47 years old.
        Mr. Sabella died of complications from AIDS, said Prof. Alvin Novick, his companion.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Sabella received his bachelor's degree from Charter Oak College in Hartford and a master's degree in public health from the Yale University School of Epidemiology and Public Health in 1983. That year Mr. Sabella joined the Connecticut Department of Health Services as the state's first AIDS coordinator, helping to develop a comprehensive school-level curriculum on AIDS.
        Mr. Sabella was also a co-founder of the AIDS Project in New Haven and served on the Connecticut Governor's Permanent Task Force on AIDS and the AIDS Task Force of the Archdiocese of Hartford. In 1989 the State Department of Health Services awarded him its AIDS Leadership Award, and in 1992 he received the Outstanding Alumni Award from Charter Oak College.
        In addition to Mr. Novick, Mr. Sabella is survived by his mother, Rose Simone, of Brooklyn.
