        Ephim Fogel, a professor of English emeritus at Cornell University and a poet, died on Friday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 71 years old and lived in Ithaca.
        Professor Fogel died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said a son, Daniel Fogel.
        He immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union with his parents in 1923. He graduated from the City College of New York in 1941, and after service in the United States Army from 1942 to 1946, earned master's and doctoral degrees in English literature from New York University and Ohio State University.
        Professor Fogel was an authority on literature of the English Renaissance. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1949 and served as chairman of the English department from 1966 to 1970. He was co-editor with David Erdman of "Evidence for Authorship," published in 1966 by Cornell University Press, and he was co-author with Mario A. di Chesare of "A Concordance to the Poems of Ben Jonson," published in 1978, also by Cornell University Press.
        Professor Fogel was also a poet whose work appeared in The Atlantic Monthly, Poetry and other journals. His poem, "Shipment to Maidanek," was one of the earliest literary responses to the Holocaust and has been included in many anthologies.
        Mr. Fogel is survived by his wife, Charlotte; two sons, Daniel, of Baton Rouge, La., and David, of Ithaca; two daughters, Rebecca Fogel Downs of Durham, Conn., and Jessica, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a brother, Robert, of Chicago, and four grandchildren.
