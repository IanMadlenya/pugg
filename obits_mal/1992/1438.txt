        Robert L. Harkay, president of the American Foundation for Hungarian Literature and Education, died on Thursday at his home in Queens. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Harkay died of cancer, his daughter, Agnes, said yesterday.
        He was a 1992 recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which is awarded to American citizens who "exemplify the ideal of life dedicated to the American way while preserving the values of a particular heritage group."
        Mr. Harkay was born in Hungary, and fled in 1945 when Soviet troops overran the eastern part of the country.
        Mr. Harkay spent the late 1940's as an interpreter and resettlement officer for United Nations refugee organizations in Germany. He emigrated to the United States in 1950.
        Mr. Harkay had long been involved in Hungarian-American affairs. He was a former president of the Szechenyi Istvan Society and a former chairman of the Coordinating Committee of Hungarian Organizations in North America.
        Mr. Harkay was the author of a book, "St. Stephen of Hungary Church, 1901-1978: A Chapter to the Ethnic History of New York," published by the Catholic Publishing Company.
        He is survived by his wife, Josephine; four children, Peter, Agnes, Kathy and Eva Kovassy, and three grandchildren.
