        Edward Hymoff, an award-winning journalist who became a media executive and security consultant, died on Thursday at his home in Belmont, Mass. He was 67 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Hymoff was the vice president of communications and marketing for the National Security Institute, a defense industry security firm.
        Earlier, as the communications and public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, he developed the satellite broadcasting system used by 500 radio and television stations.
        As an NBC news manager, he helped create "Monitor," the Peabody Award-winning radio program. He was also a consultant to the United States Information Agency, the Voice of America, the Department of Defense and the League of Women Voters, for which he helped produce the 1980 Presidential debates.
        Mr. Hymoff was born in Boston. He began his career as a reporter at The World-Telegram and Sun in New York City. He covered the Korean War for 15 New England newspapers and for the International News Service, and later worked for CBS.
        During World War II, Mr. Hymoff served in the Office of Strategic Services, which he made the subject of one of his several books.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Hymoff of the Canary Islands; a son, Kurt, of Belmont; a sister, Pauline Jacobsen of New Seabury, Mass., and a granddaughter.
