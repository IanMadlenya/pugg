        John Lund, a leading man who appeared in films opposite Olivia de Havilland, Marlene Dietrich and Grace Kelly in the 1940's and 50's, was found dead on Sunday in his home in Los Angeles. He was 81 years old.
        The cause of death was not imediately known, but the police said the actor had a history of heart trouble, and Allan Dixon, a friend, said Mr. Lund had been ill since December.
        Mr. Lund was born in Rochester, N.Y., the son of an immigrant Norwegian glassblower. A restless and troublesome student, he quit school at the age of 14 and held a series of menial jobs before trying to set up his own business. His early efforts included a program to quit smoking and a mail-order mind-reading course.
        His acting career began when a friend persuaded him to take a role in a local production of "Waiting for Lefty." After appearing in small roles in summer stock, he moved to New York City hoping to find work at an advertising agency but, while looking, took a job in an industrial show at the 1939 World's Fair. After alternating between advertising work and small parts in theater and television, he established himself as a writer and actor on radio. Wrote 'New Faces of 1943'
        Mr. Lund wrote the book and lyrics for the Broadway revue "New Faces of 1943." Two years later, he took the lead role in the Broadway play "The Hasty Heart." His performance led to a long-term film contract with Paramount.
        In 1946 Mr. Lund appeared as a flying ace opposite Miss de Havilland in "To Each His Own." A string of leading roles followed, including "Night Has a Thousand Eyes" (1948), with Edward G. Robinson; "Miss Tatlock's Millions" (1948), with Wanda Hendrix, and "A Foreign Affair" (1948), with Jean Arthur and Miss Dietrich. He also appeared in two films with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, "My Friend Irma"(1949) and "My Friend Irma Goes West" (1950).
        In the 1950's, Mr. Lund appeared in numerous Westerns, including "The Battle at Apache Pass" (1952) and "Chief Crazy Horse" (1955), as well as in "High Society" (1956), with Miss Kelly, and "The Wackiest Ship in the Army" (1960). His last film was "If a Man Answers," with Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin, in 1962.
        Mr. Lund was a vice president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1950 to 1959.
        There was no immediate word on survivors.
