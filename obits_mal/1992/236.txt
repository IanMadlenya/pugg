        Sheldon H. Gorlick, a lawyer, an editor and an authority on taxes and professional incorporation, died on Monday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 63 years old and lived in Ridgewood.
        He died of complications resulting from leukemia, his wife, Herthe, said.
        Specializing in physicians' personal and professional finances, Mr. Gorlick joined the staff of Medical Economics magazine in 1961, becoming a senior editor. Resigning in 1986 to practice law full time, he remained with the magazine as an editorial consultant until his death.
        A native of East Orange, N.J., he worked part time for The Newark Star-Ledger while attending Rutgers School of Journalism. After graduation, he worked as a reporter for The Jersey Journal and received a law degree from New York University in 1959.
        In 1961, Mr. Gorlick was a member of a small group of lawyers who lobbied successfully for Congress to provide special tax treatment for professional corporations. Subsequently, he became a founding member of the Group, an association of lawyers representing professional corporations.
        He was author of two books: "Now That You're Incorporated: Coping With Changing Tax Laws" and "The Whys and Wherefores of Corporate Practice," both published by Medical Economics Books.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Warren, of Washington, and Ronald, of Brooklyn, and a brother, Eugene, of Englishtown, N.J.
