        Samuel S. Walker, the founder and president of the New York publishing house that brought John le Carre's first three novels to America, has died in a boating accident near his home in Stonington, Conn. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Walker disappeared while kayaking alone in Long Island Sound on May 29. His body, washed ashore, was discovered several miles away by a fisherman on June 7.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Walker founded the Walker Publishing Company in 1959, and it got its start publishing popular British mysteries in America. Over the years, the family-run company branched out into publishing children's and nonfiction books, including scientific works by Isaac Asimov and reportage by Harrison Salisbury.
        From 1951 until starting Walker Publishing, he was director of Free Europe Press, which was affiliated with Radio Free Europe. Under Mr. Walker, the agency used helium-filled balloons to dump newsprint editions of George Orwell's "Animal Farm," the Declaration of Independence and other banned works in Poland, Hungary and other Communist countries.
        He is survived by his wife, Beath Bready of Stonington and Manhattan; three sons, Sloan, of San Francisco, and Ramsey and Timothy, both of Manhattan; a sister, Audrey Perkins, of Rumson, N.J., and a brother, Dr. Michael Walker, of Bethesda, Md.
