        J. Van Ness Philip, a Hudson Valley fruit grower and editor of a manufacturing newsletter, died on Tuesday at his home in Claverack, N.Y. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Philip, who had emphysema, died of a heart attack, said a daughter, Leila S. Philip of Cambridge, Mass.
        In 1967, Mr. Philip, then an editor at McGraw-Hill Company, and his wife, Julia Willis Philip, founded Modern Distribution Management, a leading newsletter on the supply of machinery parts to manufacturing companies. After inheriting extensive apple orchards in Columbia County, he opened them in the 1960's to picking by the public.
        In addition to his wife and his daughter Leila, he is survived by another daughter, Katherine P. Chansky of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; three sons, John 3d, and Thomas W., both of Manhattan, and William, of South Deerfield, Mass.; and three grandchildren.
