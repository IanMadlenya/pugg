        Stanley Woodward Sr., the American Ambassador to Canada in the Truman Administration, died on Monday at his home in Washington. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Woodward died of natural causes, his son, Stanley Jr., said.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Woodward graduated from Yale University in 1922 after serving in the Army in World War I and attended the Ecoles de Sciences Politiques in Paris in 1923-24.
        He was a Foreign Service officer in Europe and Haiti from the mid-1920's to the mid-1930's before returning to Philadelphia as commissioner of Fairmount Park. He returned to the Foreign Service in 1937, serving first as Assistant Chief of Protocol and then as Chief of Protocol at the State Department until his appointment as Ambassador in 1950.
        After leaving the Foreign Service in 1953, he founded the Woodward Foundation, which was involved in expanding educational opportunities and offering college scholarships to students in the Washington public schools. He was also a charter member of the State Department's Fine Arts Committee, which bought contemporary American art to be placed in embassies around the world.
        He was a governor of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and founder of Simeon Vineyards in Charlottesville, Va.
        In addition to his son, of Philadelphia, Mr. Woodward is survived by five grandchildren.
