        Bob Bowyer, a choreographer and dancer, died on Monday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 45 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, said Walter Maas, his companion.
        Mr. Bowyer was best known for his humorous parodies of conventional dance. He was the founder of the American Ballet Comedy, whose shows include such numbers as "The Black Cockroach Pas de Deux" and "Faux Pas de Trois."
        Mr. Bowyer was born in Los Angeles. He studied at the Harkness School of Ballet and was a member of the Lotte Goslar Pantomime Theater and the Norman Walker Dance Company before establishing the American Ballet Comedy with JoAnn Bruggeman, a dancing partner.
        In 1987, Mr. Bowyer conceived, directed and choreographed the Off Broadway show "Funny Feet." At the time of his death he was working on a three-act ballet, "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."
        In addition to Mr. Maas, Mr. Bowyer is survived by his mother, Merle Hofschire of Los Angeles.
