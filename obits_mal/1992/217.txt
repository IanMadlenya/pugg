        H. Gregg Lewis, a leader in modern labor economics, died on Jan. 25 at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C., after a long illness. He was 77 years old.
        For 36 years beginning in 1939, Dr. Lewis taught at the University of Chicago, where he directed the graduate program in economics for many years. He was considered a principal member of the monetarist, free-market-oriented Chicago school of economics and was known among other things for his writings on labor supply and the impact of unions.
        Dr. Lewis left the University of Chicago in 1975 for Duke University, where he taught until his retirement in 1984 and was a professor emeritus.  He is survived by his wife, the former Julia Catherine Elliott; three sons, Peter E. Lewis, a computer programmer in Milwaukee, John G. Lewis, a computer programmer in Seattle, and Scott P. Lewis, a trial lawyer in Cambridge, Mass.; two brothers, Richard A. Lewis of Long Beach, Calif., and Roger L. Lewis of Lansing, Mich., and five grandchildren.
