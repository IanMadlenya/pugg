        Kevin Kennedy, a former advertising executive in Manhattan and a longtime resident of Princeton, N.J., and Vineyard Haven, Mass., died of a heart attack last Thursday while working in the garden of his home on Martha's Vineyard. He was 67 years old.
        A native of Buffalo, Mr. Kennedy graduated from the Hill School in Pottstown, Pa., in 1943. He deferred his entrance into Princeton University to serve in the South Pacific with the United States Navy during World War II and then returned to graduate from Princeton.
        Mr. Kennedy worked with several Manhattan-based firms during his career, including Batten, Barten, Durstine & Osborne; Kenyon & Eckardt, and Lennen & Newell. After leaving advertising, he became a business consultant and at the time of his death, he was affiliated with Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Mass.
        He is survived by his wife, Clara; four sons, Kevin, of Ridgewood, N.J., Charles and Alexander, of New York City, and Shaun, of Cross River, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
