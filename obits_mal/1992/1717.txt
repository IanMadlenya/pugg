        Nicholas LeRoy King, the managing director of the Federal Government's New York Foreign Press Center since 1981, died on Wednesday in his Manhattan office. He was 68.
        He died of what was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
        He was a resident of Manhattan and a native of New York City.
        Mr. King, a 1946 graduate of Harvard College, was a former editorial writer for The New York Herald Tribune and a foreign correspondent for United Press International in London and Paris. He served as press attache in the American Embassy in Paris from 1963 to 1969 and then held the same position as spokesman for the United States Mission to the United Nations when it was led by George Bush.
        In the following years, he worked as a freelance journalist until the Reagan Administration appointed him to head the information center, now at 110 East 59th Street, which is run by the United States Information Agency for foreign journalists.
        Mr. King, who was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, wrote "George Bush: A Biography" (Dodd, Mead, 1980).
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Hone Auerbach; three children, Sarah, Bayard 2d and Ledyard; a brother, Bayard L., and one grandson.
