        Hyman Bravin, a lawyer and former Liberal Party official and civic leader, died on Wednesday at his home in Queens. He was 79 years old.
        He died of heart disease, his family said.
        For more than 50 years, Mr. Bravin was a criminal and civil trial lawyer based in Manhattan. In one of his more notable cases, he represented Community School District 21 in Brooklyn in one of New York City's early racial desegregation cases in the 1970's.
        During the 1960's, he was the chairman of the Bronx Liberal Party and ran several times for public office. As head of a mass transit riders' advocacy group in the 1950's, he frequently testified at public hearings.
        Gov. Nelson Rockefeller appointed him as the state's Commissioner of Veterans Affairs, and he was the state commander of the Jewish War Veterans. He also served on the board of the Fifth Avenue Synagogue.
        Mr. Bravin was born in Newburgh and earned his law degree from St. John's University in 1936. He practiced law until his death, except for four years during World War II. He served in the Army, training combat troops and reaching the rank of major.
        As a lawyer, he also assisted Japanese-American internees in regaining their rights, and was honored for his work in their behalf.
        Surviving are his wife of 46 years, the former Saradean Smith; a daughter, Barbara Bravin of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and a brother, Alexander of Fort Lee, N.J.
