        Saul Z. Cohen, a labor lawyer who was active in Jewish philanthropies, died yesterday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. He was 65 years old and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, his daughter, Helen Cohen of San Francisco, said.
        Mr. Cohen, a native of Rochester, graduated from the University of Rochester in 1948 and earned his law degree at Harvard University in 1951. He was a partner with 61 Associates, a Manhattan-based investment company. In the early 1970's, he served on the Committee on Labor Law and Social Legislation of the City Bar Association in New York.
        For the last three years, he was vice president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. From 1977 to 1981, he was president of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services.
        With his wife, Amy Scheuer Cohen, Mr. Cohen established a family foundation that supports educational and charitable organizations.
        Besides his wife and his daughter, Helen, Mr. Cohen is survived by three sons, Thomas, of Washington, Daniel, of San Francisco, and David, of Steamboat Springs, Colo.; two other daughters, Gail Schorsch of Berkeley, Calif., and Carolyn Cohen of Jerusalem, and one granddaughter.
