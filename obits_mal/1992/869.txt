        Walter Blair, a professor emeritus of English at the University of Chicago and an authority on American humor and folklore, died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 92 years old.
        Jeff Makos, a spokesman for the university, said he did not know the cause of death.
        Professor Blair, who taught at Chicago for 35 years, was a pioneer in the academic study of humor and was regarded as the pre-eminent authority on Mark Twain. In May he received the first Distinguished Scholar Award of the Mark Twain Circle, an association of Twain scholars.
        He wrote and edited more than 30 books, anthologies and textbooks on subjects ranging from the mythical characters of Paul Bunyan and Davy Crockett to the "Doonesbury" cartoons of Garry Trudeau. His students included the novelist Philip Roth and four other Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Saul Bellow, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
        He is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Erie of Spokane.
