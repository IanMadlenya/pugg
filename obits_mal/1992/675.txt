        Melvin C. Steen, a corporate and securities lawyer in New York, died at his home in Bronxville, N.Y., on Sunday. He was 85 years old.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        A son of Norwegian immigrant parents, Mr. Steen was born in Minneapolis and graduated first in his class from the University of Minnesota Law School in 1929.
        After he graduated, he joined the New York law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner & Howland and became a partner in 1944. He and three other Root, Clark partners left two years later to form the firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Friendly & Cox.
        It has since grown into Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, with offices in New York, Washington, Paris, Brussels, London, Hong Kong and Tokyo. Mr. Steen's death leaves George W. Ball, the former Under Secretary of State, as the firm's only surviving founding partner.
        Mr. Steen was an early expert on the Securities Act of 1933. He represented corporate clients in the aviation, banking, mining and pharmaceutical industries, among them Pan American World Airways, the Fiduciary Trust Company of New York, the American Smelting and Refining Company, the United States Plywood Corporation and several companies controlled by Sherman Fairchild.
        He also represented the French Government, which made him a knight of the Legion of Honor. In 1990, Cleary, Gottlieb honored him by making a $500,000 gift to set up the Melvin C. Steen Fellowship Fund of the Legal Aid Society to provide financial support for selected law graduates who join the society's legal staff.
        Mr. Steen is survived by his wife, Florence; two sons, Gordon R., of Owings Mills, Md., and Erick R., of Manhattan; two daughters, Leslie A. of Washington, and Deborah R. of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a stepson, William F. Wagner of Anderson, S.C., and two grandchildren.
