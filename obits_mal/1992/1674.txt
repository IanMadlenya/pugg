        Lawrence G. Derthick Sr., a former United States Commissioner of Education, died yesterday at his home in Signal Mountain, Tenn. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Derthick had suffered for several years from Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Alan W. Derthick, of Signal Mountain.
        Mr. Derthick was the Education Commissioner from 1956 to 1961, a period of great turmoil over public school desegregation and over the sharp growth in college enrollments.
        Mr. Derthick directed two studies that laid the groundwork for the enrollment increases.
        He graduated from Milligan College in Tennessee in 1927, earned a master's degree at the George Peabody College for Teachers at the University of Tennesseee and earned a doctorate from Teachers College at Columbia University. Mr. Derthick was a teacher, principal, college professor and superintendent of schools in Nashville before President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him Education Commissioner, the nation's top education post at the time.
        Mr. Derthick is also survived by his wife of 55 years, Helda; a daughter, Louann Holland of Charleston, W. Va.; seven granhdchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
