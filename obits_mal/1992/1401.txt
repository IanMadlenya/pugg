        Victor H. Bernstein, a retired editor and writer who covered Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg trials, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven. He was 87 years old and lived in New Milford, Conn.
        He died of heart disease, said Maurice A. Goldstein, his lawyer.
        In the 1940's, he was the foreign editor of PM, a daily newspaper in New York City. He became managing editor of The Nation in 1952 and retired from the magazine in 1963. He also wrote for Redbook and served as the public relations director of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.
        From 1937 to 1939, he was a Berlin correspondent for the Jewish Telegraph Agency. Once, the Nazi SS detained him for hours of questioning.
        Returning to Berlin in 1945 for PM, he covered the liberation of concentration camps and the war-crimes trials. Then he explored thousands of captured documents for a book, "Final Judgment" (Boni & Gaer, 1947).
        His wife of more than 50 years, the former Selma Krumgold, died a few years ago. He has no immediate survivors.
