        Frederick G. Eaton, a retired publisher of newspapers in three states and a leader in the creation of performing arts centers in Saratoga Springs and Binghamton, N.Y., died on Friday after dining with friends in Provincetown, Mass. He was 71 years old and lived in nearby Brewster.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Eaton began his 42-year career with the Gannett newspapers in 1942 as a cub reporter at The Saratogian in his hometown. He became the paper's publisher in 1956, then went on to become the publisher of Gannett papers in Port Huron, Mich., Tarentum, Pa., and Binghamton.
        In the 1960's, he helped lead efforts to create the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, and in the 1970's he took a similar role in developing the Anderson Performing Arts Center in Binghamton.
        Mr. Eaton served as the head of publishers' and editors' professional societies in New York State.
        He retired in 1984. That same year he resigned his membership at the Binghamton Country Club to protest its denial of membership to Susan Clark-Jackson, his successor as publisher. He said he believed she was rejected for being a woman.
        Mr. Eaton was born in Saratoga Springs and graduated from Syracuse University.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 50 years, the former Barbara Graefenecker; three daughters, Sandra Eaton of Lexington, Mass., Bonnie Browne of Austin, Tex., and Adrienne Eaton of Metuchen, N.J.; two sons, Frederick 3d of Wilton, N.Y., and Michael of Burlington, Vt.; three sisters, Ruth Gaffney of Saratoga Springs, Leila Holmes of Mechanicville, N.Y., and Anne Cohan of Lake George, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
