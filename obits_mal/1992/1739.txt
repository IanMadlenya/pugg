        James Cass, a co-author of "Comparative Guide to American Colleges," died Dec. 4 at his home in New Paltz, N.Y. He was 77.
        His daughter, Julia Cass-Liepmann, said that her father died of heart failure after suffering a series of small strokes in the last year.
        Mr. Cass was education editor of The Saturday Review in the 1960's and 1970's.
        A 15th edition of the college guide is now in print from HarperCollins. Cass Canfield Jr., a senior editor at HarperCollins, said yesterday that more than half a million copies of the book had been sold over the years.
        The first edition of the college guide, whose co-author was Max Birnbaum, was published in 1964 by Harper & Row, now HarperCollins. A review in The New York Times said, "Cass and Birnbaum have attempted the backbreaking research task of putting together a literate guide that tells about admissions standards, faculty qualifications and such vital facts and intangibles as intellectual, social, religious and cultural campus atmosphere," and concluded that "the end result deserves high praise."
        Ms. Cass-Liepmann and others have assisted in preparing editions of the book. Mr. Birnbaum died in 1991.
        Mr. Cass was born in Saranac Lake, N.Y., and earned degrees from Ohio Wesleyan and Columbia Universities.
        His wife of 41 years, Barbara Hillman Cass, died in 1987.
        In addition to his daughter, of New Paltz, he is survived by three sons, J. Michael Cass of Modena, N.Y., Frederick Sumner Cass of Hampton Bays, L.I., and A. Williams Cass of New Paltz; and six grandchildren.
