        Josiah W. Bennett, a retired Foreign Service officer who served as political adviser to the last two American ambassadors to South Vietnam, died Saturday at Hillhaven Extended Care, a nursing home in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 75 years old.
        He had had Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Bennett, a China specialist, served in the War Department from 1942 to 1946 and in the American Embassy in Nanjing, China, from 1946 until the Communists seized power in 1949. Mr. Bennett then headed the United States Information Service in Taipei, Taiwan, and in Tel Aviv, and the political section of the American Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria.
        In the late 1950's and early 1960's, he held senior positions in the State Department, first as chief of the political section of the China Affairs Office and later as deputy director for East Asian affairs and country director for Taiwan and Malaysia.
        He was the Minister for Political Affairs in the American Embassy in Saigon, and was the political adviser to Ambassadors Ellsworth Bunker and Graham Martin. Mr. Bennett arrived in South Vietnam just before the Communists' Tet offensive in 1968 and was among the last Americans to leave Saigon in 1975. He was a senior Foreign Service inspector when he retired the next year.
        Born in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Bennett attended Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles and Yenching University in Beijing. He received his bachelor's degree in 1938 from the University of Chicago, where he later did graduate work in Chinese history.
        He is survived by his wife, Chou Nien-tz'u; two daughters, Ann Spence of Palo Alto, Calif., and Jean Bennett of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Jane Shiner of New Albany, Ind.; two brothers, David Bennett of West Palm Beach., Fla., and Clark Bennett of Falmouth, Maine, and five grandchildren.
