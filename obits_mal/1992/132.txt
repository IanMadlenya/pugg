        Paul P. Gewirtz, a retired music-publishing executive, died on Saturday while vacationing in Satellite Beach, Fla. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia at Holmes Hospital in Melbourne, Fla., his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Gewirtz began a sales career at Herman's, the sporting-goods store founded by Herman Steinlauf, his uncle. He struck out on his own by opening the Colony record store on Broadway in 1938.
        Two years later, Warner Brothers sold him the Music Sales Corporation, a chain of music-store concessions. Scattered in five-and-dime stores across the country, the concessions featured pianos and sales clerks who attracted customers by playing the latest in sheet music on request.
        Mr. Gewirtz built the company into a multinational enterprise by acquiring music publishers, including G. Schirmer Inc. and Dorsey Brothers Music. He retired as chairman of the board of Music Sales five years ago but remained as a consultant until his death.
        He is survived by two daughters, Lenore Abrams of Baldwin, L.I., and Dolores Sagerman of Satellite Beach; three stepsons, Robert Wise of London, and Herbert and Donald Wise, both of Manhattan; two brothers, Dr. A. J. Gewirtz of Manhattan, and Leo Gewirtz of Miami, Fla.; 11 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
