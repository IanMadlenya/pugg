        Cyril Chesnut Means Jr., professor emeritus of constitutional law at New York Law School, died yesterday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 73 years old.
        His family said he died after a long illness.
        Professor Means, who also had a home in Gloucester, Mass., was an expert in the laws governing abortion, surrogacy and adoption.
        He joined the faculty at New York Law School in 1965 and was promoted to professor in 1973. He retired from the law school in 1989.
        A native of Philadelphia, he was a 1938 graduate of Harvard University and held a master's degree in law from Harvard and a doctorate in law from Wayne State University. He was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1941.
        He served in the Navy as an officer in World War II and taught at Detroit College of Law and Stanford University in the late 1940's.
        From 1950 to 1954, he was in West Germany as legal adviser to the Office of the United States High Commissioner, which was then administering the American-occupied zone. He then spent two years as arbitration director of the New York Stock Exchange, where he overhauled one of the country's most complicated arbitration systems.
        In 1968, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him to a commission to study the state's abortion law and make recommendations for changes. Professor Means was an outspoken opponent of any narrowing of the 1973 decision, Roe v. Wade, by the United States Supreme Court that upheld a woman's right to choose an abortion. He also supported adoptees' rights to have access to sealed adoption records.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rosaline Limtiuco; two daughters, Elizabeth Rose Thayer Means and Annette Thayer Means, both of Gloucester, and a son, Cyril Chesnut Means 3d of Manhattan.
