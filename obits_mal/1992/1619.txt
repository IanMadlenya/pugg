        Karl Seymour Nash, the editor of The Ridgefield (N.J.) Press for 50 years and president of Acorn Press newspapers, died Tuesday at his winter home in Cocoa Beach, Fla. He was 84 and also lived in Ridgefield.
        Mr. Nash had pancreatic cancer two years ago, said Sally Sanders, a spokeswoman for Acorn Press.
        He was a native of Ridgefield, and his family roots in the town stretched back to the early 18th century. With his brother, John, he bought The Ridgefield Press in 1937, when he was 29, and built it over the years into a seven-newspaper group serving Ridgefield and nearby communities.
        He was a 1930 graduate of Harvard College.
        Mr. Nash served on the Ridgefield Board of Education for 20 years, 17 of them as chairman, and was a member of the Parks and Recreation Commission and a frequent moderator of town meetings.
        Mr. Nash's son, Theodore, died in 1975, and another son, Howard, died in 1990.
        In addition to his brother, John, of Sarasota, Fla., Mr. Nash is survived by his wife of 42 years, the former Elizabeth Boyd; four daughters, Rhoda Oehser of Jacksonville, Fla., Judy Bouton of New Canaan, Conn., Sally Coye of Novato, Calif., and Margaret Heile of Ridgefield; two sons, Brainerd Phillipson of Holliston, Mass., and Thomas, of Ridgefield; two sisters, Esther Kelley and Elizabeth Baxter, both of Ridgefield, and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 25, 1992, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about Karl Seymour Nash, editor of The Ridgefield Press for 50 years and president of Acorn Press newspapers, misstated the location of the newspaper. It is in Connecticut, not New Jersey.
