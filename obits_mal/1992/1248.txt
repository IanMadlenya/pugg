        Norman I. Schvey, a former managing director of Merrill Lynch, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Schvey died of lymphona of the bone marrow, said Marian Bott, a spokeswoman for the family.
        Beginning in the 1960's, Mr. Schvey played a significant role in the development and use on Wall Street of joint investment trusts, which are investment funds comprised of pre-selected stocks or bonds. He retired from Merrill Lynch last year as chairman of the company's unit investment trusts division as well as a managing director.
        Mr. Schvey, who was born in Manhattan, joined Merrill Lynch in 1943 after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania. He left the firm in 1946 and worked for several other Wall Street houses before rejoining Merrill Lynch in 1971.
        He was president and chairman of the Unit Trust Association and a member of the unit trust committee of the Investment Company Institute. He was also a member of the Municipal Bond Club of New York and the Municipal Forum of New York.
        He is survived by two sons, Henry I., of St. Louis, and Robert M., of South Orange, N.J.; a brother, Dr. Malcolm H., of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
