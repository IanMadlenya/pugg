        John Caban, executive vice president of Odyssey House, the drug and alcohol treatment organization in New York, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 43 years old.
        He died of lung cancer and pneumonia, said his brother, Stanley Drop.
        A former drug user, Mr. Caban spent his professional life helping others fight dependency on alcohol or drugs.
        He was born in New York City, and received a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1976, a master's in 1980 and a doctorate in 1989, both from Teachers College of Columbia University.
        Since 1971, Mr. Caban had worked in drug and alcohol treatment programs in New York City and Mexico City.
        Mr. Caban was a board member of the Gay Men's Health Crisis and was recently appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Governor's Task Force on AIDS. In 1990 he began planning a new center, to be known as Caban House Inc., to serve people with AIDS.
        Besides his brother, Stanley Drop of Brooklyn, Mr. Caban is survived by his mother, Teresa Rodriquez of Jackson Heights, Queens, and another brother, Joey, who lives in Sweden.
