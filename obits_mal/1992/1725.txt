        William Sonenshine, a New York criminal defense lawyer until his retirement in 1985, died yesterday at North Ridge Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 63 and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Sonenshine was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1951.
        While working in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office from 1957 to 1961, he wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the National Association of Prosecuting Attorneys. The case, Mapp v. Ohio, dealt with searches and seizures, a topic on which Mr. Sonenshine became an expert.
        He was a founder of the firm of Evseroff, Newman & Sonenshine, which specialized in criminal law.
        Mr. Sonenshine is survived by his wife, Mina; two daughters, Nancy S. Seidner and Tara S. Friend; two sons, Marshall and Michael; a sister, Estelle O'Sullivan, and two grandsons.
