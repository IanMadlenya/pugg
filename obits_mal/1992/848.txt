        Stephen A. Wareck, a New Haven developer and former president of the New Haven Board of Aldermen, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A New Haven resident for nearly 30 years, he was 61 years old.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Wareck was a graduate of Yale University and Syracuse University School of Law. He turned to business in downtown New Haven after practicing law in Manhattan in the early 1960's.
        Mr. Wareck made a bid for Congress 10 years ago but failed to win the Democratic nomination.
        Mr. Wareck is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Barbara Cooley; two sons, John James L. and John C., both of New Haven; a daughter, Anne R., also of New Haven, and a brother, Donald J. of Littleton, Colo.
