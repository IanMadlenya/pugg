        A. Gardner Fox, a retired physicist and inventor who made discoveries in radar, microwave communications and lasers, died Nov. 24 at the Evergreen nursing in Harmony, Pa. He was 80 years old.
        His family reported his death yesterday and said the cause was Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Fox's research has been used in a wide range of fields, from weaponry to overseas telephone calls to airplane communications.
        He worked at Bell Telephone Laboratories for 41 years and held 53 patents in the microwave and quantum electronics fields.
        On his first project, when he was in his 20's, Mr. Fox helped create a compact, high-powered radio for airplanes to communicate with airport control towers.
        During World War II, he helped design the SCR 545 antiaircraft radar. He also invented a microwave beam switcher that enabled submarines to use radar without rotating antennae.
        After the war he helped create American Telephone and Telegraph's first transcontinental microwave relay system for long distance calls.
        Turning to optical research, Mr. Fox and Dr. Tingye Li developed the basic theory of light behavior in laser beams, opening the way to the construction of laser devices.
        Born in Syracuse, Mr. Fox grew up there and in Montclair, N.J. He earned his bachelor's degree and a master's in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        His survivors include his wife of 53 years, the former Ellen Van Winkle, who recently moved to Little Silver, N.J.; two daughters, Louise Usechak of Shrewsbury, N.J., and Dorothy Fox of Hagerstown, Md.; two sons, Arthur L., of Washington, and John G., of Los Angeles; a brother, David, of Seattle; a sister, Jean Sullivan of Seattle, and five grandchildren.
