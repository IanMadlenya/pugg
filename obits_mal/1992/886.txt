        Kelvin Coe, a former principal dancer with the Australian Ballet, died on Thursday at his home in Melbourne, Australia. He was 45 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said a spokesman for the company.
        A silver medalist in the 1973 International Ballet Competition in Moscow, Mr. Coe was a strong technician who danced with a bluff vigor. Early in his career he was singled out as an extremely promising young dancer, and he became one of his country's leading ballet stars.
        Born in Melbourne, Mr. Coe joined the Australian Ballet in 1962 at the age of 15, after training in tap and in ballet. He became a soloist in 1966 and a principal dancer two years later, and was named to the honorary position of premier danseur in 1974. He danced as a guest artist with the Bolshoi Ballet, American Ballet Theater and European companies that included the London Festival Ballet and served as partner to Margot Fonteyn on a tour of the Far East in 1973. Mr. Coe was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1980.
        He was noted for his portrayals of Albrecht in "Giselle" and Basilio in Rudolf Nureyev's production of "Don Quixote." He also starred in "Beyond 12," a dance created about and for him in the early 1980's by Graeme Murphy of the Sydney Dance Company. Mr. Coe retired from the stage in 1990 but was asked to return the following year to dance one of the stepsisters in "Cinderella." He continued to teach at the company school until a few months before his death.
