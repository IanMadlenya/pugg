        Timothy Tyson Ruttenber, a songwriter, poet and performance artist who used the stage name Deacon Lunchbox, died on Sunday in an automobile collision near Greenville, Ala. He was 41 years old and lived in Atlanta.
        Mr. Ruttenber had performed on Saturday night in Pensacola, Fla., with the Atlanta-based rock group Jody Grind. Two members of the group -- the bassist, Robert Hayes, 24, and the drummer, Rob Clayton, 22 -- were also killed in the collision. A spokesman for the State Police in Evergreen, Ala., said that the accident was still under investigation.
        Mr. Ruttenber, a construction worker by day, was well known in the Atlanta area for his flamboyant spoken-word performances. A collection of his monologues, "Some Different Kinds of Songs," was published by Drury Lane, and he had released a cassette, "Rantin' 'n' Railin'," independently. Last year he appeared in "Words in Your Face," a PBS documentary about spoken-word performers.
        He is survived by two brothers, James, of Boulder, Colo., and Jeff, of Bradenton, Fla.
