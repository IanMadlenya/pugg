        Louis Rudisch, a metallurgist who invented a crystal for popular radio kits and adapted a process for casting jewelry parts, died last Saturday at New York Hospital in Manhattan.
        He was 90 years old and lived in Queens. He died of complications of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Rudisch was born in Latvia and grew up in Brooklyn and in Elmira, N.Y. He graduated from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, where he majored in chemical engineering.
        As an outgrowth of his avocation as a ham radio operator, in the 1920's he invented the Rusonite radio crystal, also known as a "cat's whisker" device. His crystal consisted of synthetic galena crystals embedded in a lead matrix. It was patented and widely used in crystal radio kits popular with youngsters and hobbyists.
        He created his own firm, the Louis Rudisch Company, for recovering, refining and casting precious metals and alloys, specializing in gold, platinum and iridium. In the 1930's he adapted the lost-wax vacuum method, previously used in casting sculptures, for making small jewelry parts.
        He retired in 1976. His wife of 57 years, the former Lola Satz, died in 1982. He is survived by his daughter, Gloria Rudisch of Boston, and three grandchildren.
