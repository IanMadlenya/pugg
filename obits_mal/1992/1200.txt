        Paul Taylor, an Australian art critic, journalist and editor known for his championing of popular culture and his critical profiles of art world personalities, died yesterday at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. He was 35 years old and had lived in Manhattan from 1984 until this month, when he returned to Melbourne.
        Mr. Taylor died of AIDS-related lymphoma, said his companion, David E. Johnson of Manhattan.
        A native of Melbourne, Mr. Taylor graduated from Monash University there in 1979, and quickly established himself as a force in Australian art circles, writing on contemporary art for several Australian magazines and newspapers.
        In 1980 he founded the magazine Art & Text, which became the first Australian art journal to achieve an international readership.
        After moving to New York City, he worked primarily as a freelance journalist writing on the art scene for The New York Times, Vanity Fair, New York, Connoisseur, Flash Art and The Village Voice, among others. In 1988 he organized the exhibition "Impresario: Malcolm McLaren and the British New Wave" at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.
        Besides Mr. Johnson, Mr. Taylor is survived by his mother and stepfather, Patricia and Charles Edward Bartels, and two brothers, Gregory and Philip, of Melbourne.
