        T. Girard Wharton, a prominent lawyer in New Jersey and a former president of the New Jersey Bar Association, died Saturday at his home in Somerville, N.J. He was 88.
        Mr. Wharton died of heart failure, said Miles S. Whinder 3d, a partner in the Somerville, N.J., law firm of Ozzard Wharton. Ozzard Wharton is the successor to the law firm Mr. Wharton co-founded in 1930.
        Mr. Wharton had lived in Somerville since his childhood. He earned a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in 1925 and a law degree from the Yale Law School in 1928.
        During summer vacations while at Yale, Mr. Wharton worked for Senator Clarence E. Case of New Jersey, who had a law practice in Somerville. After Mr. Wharton passed the bar in 1929, he joined Senator Case's practice. When Senator Case was shortly thereafter appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court, Mr. Wharton took over the practice as he opened his own firm.
        Beginning in 1931, Mr. Wharton served as an assistant prosecutor for Somerset County, a part-time post, for 10 years. He served as the county's prosecutor from 1946 to 1953.
        Mr. Wharton, president of the state's bar association from 1968 to 1969, was the recipient of numerous honors, including in 1989 the 50-year award of the American Bar Foundation.
        Mr. Wharton is survived by three daughters: Nancy Duryea of Boca Raton, Fla., Constance Nasson of Exmore, Va., and Lucinda Kellam of Franktown, Va.; a sister, Eunice Brasefield of Summit; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
