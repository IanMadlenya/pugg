        After graduating from the University of Southern Californa, he served in the Office of Strategic Services during World War II and made the propaganda film "Ring of Steel." He was awarded a Bronze Star for his work photographing Merchant Marine ships in the Pacific Theater.
        In addition to his wife, who is a professor of romance languages at Queens College, he is survived by a son, Corbin Russell of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Juniper Turner of Boston, both from a previous marriage.
