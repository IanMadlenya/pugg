        Jackson J. Weaver, a radio personality in Washington and for 45 years the voice of Smokey Bear, died there on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Weaver died of complications from diabetes, said a spokesman for WMAL radio, where Mr. Weaver had worked.
        With his partner of 32 years, Frank Harden, Mr. Weaver presided over WMAL's morning programs from 6 to 10 A.M., Monday through Saturday. He broadcast music, news and weather and reported school closings and other daily doings of the Washington area.
        The two referred to their on-air chemistry as "dynamic inaction," and in an interview in 1980 Mr. Weaver said they were careful not to rouse early risers too harshly.
        "We feel when people get up in the morning, it's rough enough," he said.
        Mr. Weaver first gave voice to Smokey Bear in 1947. The character was created by the Advertising Council, the advertising industry's public-service organization. Eventually, Smokey's admonition, "Remember, only
        you
        can prevent forest fires," became indelibly linked to the character.
        Mr. Weaver said he gave Smokey Bear a deep, gruff voice by speaking into an office wastebasket.
        Survivors include his wife, Elsie Weaver of Silver Spring, Md.; three sons, Scott Weaver of Deale, Md., and Eric and Mark Weaver, both of Silver Spring, and four grandchildren.
