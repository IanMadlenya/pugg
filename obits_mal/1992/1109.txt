        Dr. Nelson Clark Walker, a retired family practitioner in Hackensack, N.J., died Saturday at Southampton Hospital. He was 79 years old and a resident of Hackensack and East Hampton, L.I.
        His family said he died of a heart attack.
        Dr. Walker retired two years ago as a founding director of the department of family practice and emergency trauma at Hackensack Medical Center, where he previously served as president of the medical board. He was in private practice in Hackensack from 1945 to 1986 and, for 45 years, was the medical director of the Bendix Corporation's manufacturing plant in Teterboro, N.J.
        He graduated from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., earned his medical degree at the Long Island College of Medicine in Brooklyn -- now SUNY Downstate Medical Center -- and completed his training at the Hackensack hospital before serving in the Navy in World War II. He reached the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve.
