        G. Leonard Cheshire, who was Britain's most decorated pilot in World War II but whose distress over the destruction of war moved him to found an international network of homes for sick people, died Friday in London. He was 74 years old.
        He died of motoneuron disease, a family spokeswoman said.
        During the war, he flew more than 100 bombing missions over Germany and commanded the No. 617 Squadron, known as the Dambusters for their destruction of vital German dams. His ranks included wing commander and group captain. His combat exploits won many decorations, including the Victoria Cross, the nation's highest military honor.
        He was also the Royal Air Force's official observer of America's atomic bombing of Nagasaki -- an experience that he said affected him so deeply that he committed himself to help others. Nursing a Cancer Patient
        After the war, he worked with homeless veterans but suffered from burn-out and went to Canada, where he worked variously as an undertaker, delivery man and firewood cutter.
        Returning to England, he found his veterans' organization collapsed by debt. While casting about for his mission in life, he heard about a veteran dying of cancer. He took the man in and nursed him through his illness.
        Then other impoverished patients began showing up. Donated supplies and money trickled in, and volunteer nurses and doctors joined the cause.
        Eventually those efforts grew into the Cheshire Foundation Homes, which now house disabled people in 50 nations.
        In 1981, Queen Elizabeth appointed him to the Order of Merit, and last year he was made a life peer in the House of Lords. Prime Minister John Major praised him as a national hero for his war record and civilian contributions.
        Lord Cheshire was previously married to Constance Binney, an American actress. His survivors include his wife, Baroness Sue Ryder of Warsaw, a son and a daughter.
