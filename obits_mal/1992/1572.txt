        Nathaniel E. Kossack, a retired Federal official with a nationwide reputation in law enforcement, died last Wednesday at his home in Wilmington, Del. He was 80 years old.
        Chandler Funeral Homes in Wilmington, which reported the death on Monday, said he died of heart failure.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Kossack, who was known as Tully, graduated from Cornell University in 1934 and Cornell Law School in 1937.
        After Army service in World War II, he became a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and then joined the Justice Department in 1952. The following year, he was named chief of the Fraud Section in the Criminal Division and, in 1965, was appointed first assistant and deputy assistant Attorney General in that division.
        Mr. Kossack's survivors include his wife, Gertrude; a daughter, Joyce Lamb of Wilmington, and a brother, Irving, of Floral Park, L.I.
