        Jay F. Sharbutt, a correspondent, theater critic and most recently senior television writer for The Associated Press, died on Wednesday at his apartment in Brooklyn. He was 51 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his former wife, Jeanne Drewsen, said.
        Mr. Sharbutt began his career as a reporter at The Ledger in Lakeland, Fla., and later at The Orlando Sentinel. After joining The A.P. in 1966, he reported from Washington and Vietnam.
        He was the wire service's television writer from 1972 to 1978, before taking over as theater critic. After working as a television reporter for The Los Angeles Times, he returned to The A.P. in 1989 as senior television writer.
        He is survived by his father, Del Sharbutt, the longtime radio announcer for NBC programs like "Amos 'n' Andy," who lives in Palm Desert, Calif.; his brother, William, of Manhattan; his sister, Meri Dell Ridge, of Norfolk, Va., and a daughter, Julie Christine, of Manhattan.
