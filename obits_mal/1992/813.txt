        Erasmo La Marca, an importer and exporter of Italian-made shoes who operated a fashionable store on Manhattan's East 57th Street, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 50 years old and lived in Manhattan and Bridgehampton, L.I.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        A native of Italy, Mr. La Marca studied architecture in Naples. He earned an M.B.A. at New York University and later joined his wife, Arlene, in the shoe business.
        Mr. La Marca was the business partner in the couple's enterprises and Mrs. La Marca the designer. Their store, La Marca Shoes, was on 57th Street for about 20 years until Mr. La Marca's health forced him to limit his activities two years ago.
        In addition to his wife, the former Arlene Zubritzky, Mr. La Marca is survived by two sons, John and Alessandro.
