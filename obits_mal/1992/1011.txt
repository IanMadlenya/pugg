        Alton H. Slagle, a reporter for The Daily News in New York, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        His sister, Jo Stone, also of Manhattan, said he died after a brief illness. The Daily News reported that he had worked for the paper until the day before he was hospitalized two weeks ago.
        A native of Abilene, Tex., Mr. Slagle graduated from Texas Technological College and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism. He spent 30 years at The News, which he joined after brief stints at The Associated Press and United Press International and five years at The Honolulu Star-Bulletin.
        At The News, he covered many historic events, including the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
        Mr. Slagle is survived by Mrs. Stone.
