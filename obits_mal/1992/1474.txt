        Freddie Moore, a jazz drummer whose career spanned seven decades, died on Tuesday at his home in the Bronx. He was 92 years old
        Mr. Moore, whose career began when he was a teen-ager in traveling minstrel shows, performed with such jazz men as Sidney Bechet, King Oliver, Art Hodes, Eubie Blake, Bob Wilber and Roy Eldridge.
        He played drums with a strong, steady beat, accented with sudden cannonlike shots and deliberately placed cymbal accents. For "Tiger Rag" he sometimes blew on his snare drum to create a kittenish "tiger roar." Drumming with one hand while he held a microphone in the other, he sang in a leathery, rhythmic shout while he agitated his face with exaggerated grimaces.
        When he became physically unable to continue drumming a few years ago, Mr. Moore kept on singing and strumming a washboard with Bob Cantwell's band at the Red Blazer Too on West 46th Street in Manhattan. He officially retired last March but made one more appearance, his last, on his 92d birthday in August, once again playing at the club with the Cantwell band.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucille, and a brother, Edward Moore of New Bern, N.C.
