        After leaving Lord & Taylor, he worked as a fashion consultant to Montgomery Ward from 1979 to 1981.
        For the last 10 years he worked as an executive recruiter and vice president for the International Executive Service Corps, a nonprofit organization based in Stamford, Conn., that helps develop foreign businesses and economies. He also served on the Rye Planning Board and was a vestryman and senior warden at Christ's Episcopal Church in Rye.
