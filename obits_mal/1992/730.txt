        Richard Boehm, who created the author's book tour that has become a fixture of sales promotion in the publishing industry, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 57 years old.
        He died of a massive coronary attack, said Michael Mace, a friend and colleague.
        Mr. Boehm was working as an advertising copywriter for Doubleday in the 1960's when the company was searching for ways to single out and publicize some of the 700 titles a year it was publishing.
        He developed cross-country tours for authors, arranging interviews with local newspaper reporters and reviewers, speeches, book signings at bookstores and appearances on radio and television in the early days of talk shows -- Phil Donahue was broadcasting in Dayton, Ohio, at the time.
        Mr. Boehm's approach proved successful and was widely copied. Among the authors he took on the road were Pierre Salinger, Phyllis Diller, Irving Stone, Bob Hope, Hildegarde, Lena Horne, Bennett Cerf, Barbara Walters and Sir Rudolf Bing.
        After developing Doubleday's author promotion department and the tours, he set up a lecture service so authors could earn additional speaking fees as well as gaining publicity.
        In the mid-1970's, he worked briefly for a speakers' agency, then became an independent book promoter and public relations man. Later he was a literary agent whose clients include Martin Bookspan, Rudolf Bing and Christopher d'Amboise.
        Mr. Boehm, who was born in Brooklyn, was known in performing arts and literary circles and for his knowledge of opera, dance and music. He was also was noted for his wit. In a brief autobiography, he wrote that in high school and again at Johns Hopkins University, he had "graduated third in the class -- from the bottom."
        He is survived by his mother, Hilda, of Manhattan.
