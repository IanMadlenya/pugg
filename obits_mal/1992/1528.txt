        Michael R. Gingold, chief executive officer of MRG Associates, a consulting firm in Wall Township, N.J., died Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 70 years old and lived in Fernandino Beach, Fla.
        He died after heart-bypass surgery, his son Dennis said.
        At the time of death, Mr. Gingold was overseeing the commercial real estate and business consulting firm he founded 20 years ago in Newark. Previously, he was an executive vice president of Brown Engineers International, formerly a New York-based engineering and construction company.
        His first wife, Sally Weiss, is deceased. Two later marriages to Myra Lavenhar and Elizabeth Lathrop ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son Dennis, of Potomac, Md., he is survived by his wife, Babette Lovencon; two other sons, Jeffrey, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and Scott, of Easton, Pa.; a sister, Loretta Graubard of Sarasota, Fla.; five grandchildren, and three stepdaughters.
