        John Lakin Bainbridge, an author and longtime staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, died yesterday at the Albany Memorial Hospital. He was 78 years old and lived in Schoharie, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure after a long illness, said his wife, Dorothy Hazlewood.
        For the last two decades, Mr. Bainbridge lived in England, writing articles for The New Yorker and writing the London Journal for Gourmet magazine. He and his wife moved back to the United States in September.
        Mr. Bainbridge was perhaps best known for his book "The Super-Americans," a clinical study of the Texan way of life. Most of his observations appeared as a series in The New Yorker and were published by Doubleday as a book in 1961.
        His editor at The New Yorker, Gardner Botsford, said: "His most astonishing reportorial feat, many people believe, was his reduction of the entire state of Texas into one elegant, funny, perceptive volume."
        Mr. Bainbridge joined the editorial staff of The New Yorker in 1938 and wrote many Profiles, some of which became popular books, including "The Wonderful World of Toots Shor" (1951).
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Jonathan, of Bern, N.Y.; a daughter, Janet Anne, of Bath, England; a brother, Harley, and a sister, LaVon Davidge, both of Minneapolis.
