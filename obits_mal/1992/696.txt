        Irving Laurie, a retired businessman and a philanthropist with many causes in New Jersey, died on Friday at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He had turned 95 years old the day before.
        The nature of his illness was not specified.
        Mr. Laurie founded the Laurie Rubber Reclaiming Company in East Millstone, N.J., and was its chief executive for many years. He helped devise a process to re-use old tires and other rubber material.
        He and his wife contributed to a variety of medical, cultural, educational, religious and social causes.
        Their donations created the Neuro-Developmental Institute of the Johnson Hospital and the Imaging Institute for medical diagnoses, both in New Brunswick, the Music Library at Rutgers University, the Arts Center at the Far Brook School in Summit, the garden at the Daughters of Israel Geriatric Center in West Orange, the Monroe office of the Southern Middlesex County Family Service and the center that housed the offices and archives of the Jewish Historical Society of Central Jersey.
        The couple endowed a chair in women's studies at Douglass College and a chair in theater arts at Brandeis University, where they also built the Experimental Theater. They were primary donors for the new Ahavas Achim Synagogue in Highland and the Solomon Schecter School in East Orange. They also financed numerous productions of musicals, operas and concerts.
        Mr. Laurie was a trustee of the Johnson Hospital and its foundation.
        He was born in Somerville, N.J., and lived most of his life in New Brunswick. He was a veteran of World War II.
        His wife, the former Blanche Susskind, and their daughter, Edith, are both deceased. He has no immediate survivors.
