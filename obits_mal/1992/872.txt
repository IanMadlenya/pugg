        Walter L. Kirschenbaum, a former radio producer, Liberal Party leader and New York City official, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 72 years old.
        The apparent cause of death was a heart attack, said William Stern, a friend.
        Mr. Kirschenbaum produced the Barry Gray program on WMCA and Victor Riesel's program on WEVD in the 1950's. He was also the public relations director for the Jewish Labor Committee and public affairs director of the Workmen's Circle, an immigrant organization.
        His political activities started with the socialists. Later he worked for the American Labor Party but left in the split that formed the Liberal Party. For many years he was executive director of the Bronx Liberal organization, which elected a City Councilman. He often served as a party spokesman and ran for office himself.
        An ardent anti-Communist, he often wrote about hate groups and dictatorships. He once exchanged letters with George Bernard Shaw, whose reply proclaimed, in red ink, that he was a Communist but not a party member.
        He served in Mayor Robert F. Wagner's administration as an assistant license commissioner and in John V. Lindsay's administration as executive assistant to the finance commissioner.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Frances.
