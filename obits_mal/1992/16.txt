        Joe Richards, a writer and a painter, died on Sunday at the Bay Pines Veterans Administration Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 83 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said his sister, Ruth Eisenstein of New York City.
        Mr. Richards wrote two books. "Tug of War," published in 1979, was about his experiences as a Merchant Marine captain in World War II. "Princess," published in 1956 and revised in 1973, told of his experiences in rebuilding and sailing a sloop.
        Mr. Richards, born in New York City, was a self-taught artist whose work was shown at several galleries in Manhattan, including the Grace Borgenicht and Grand Central galleries.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by a daughter, Susan McClain of Madeira Beach, Fla.; a son, Seth, of Smyrna, Del., and three grandchildren.
