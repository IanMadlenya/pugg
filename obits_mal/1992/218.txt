        James W. Wagner, longtime director of the National Spelling Bee, died last Sunday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, his hometown. He was 70 years old.
        His family said the cause of death was prostate cancer.
        Mr. Wagner worked for Scripps Howard Newspapers for 39 years, 25 of them as the company's editorial promotion director. In that job he headed the National Spelling Bee, a competition that now involves 10 million children. The number of local sponsors more than doubled during his tenure.
        Mr. Wagner, a native of Chicago, graduated from DePauw University in 1943 and then saw wartime service with the Army in Italy.
        After the war he joined The Houston Press as a reporter and also worked part time as a radio and television sports broadcaster. Eventually he became managing editor of The Press, which has since closed. He was promoted to Scripps Howard headquarters, then in Manhattan, and later in Cincinnati, and retired in 1985.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Barbara Anthis; two sons, James, of Albuquerque, N.M., and William, of Milwaukee; a daughter, Nancy, of Belmont, Mass.; four grandchildren, and three sisters: Barbara Welgos of Decorah, Iowa; Ruth Crawford of Colorado Springs and Gail Butler of Oak Brook, Ill.
        Correction:  March 1, 1992, Sunday
        An obituary headline last Sunday about James W. Wagner, longtime director of the National Spelling Bee, misstated his age in some copies. He was 70 years old.
