        Milton H. Gladstone, a retired publisher of how-to and test-preparation materials in New York, died on Feb. 21 at the Cabrini Medical Center. He was 77 years old and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
        His family said he died of complications after a brief illness.
        Mr. Gladstone graduated from City College and received an master's in chemistry from Columbia University in 1937, the year he founded the Arco Publishing Company. Starting during the Depression, he wrote and distributed pamphlets to help job applicants in Civil Service tests.
        After wartime service with the Signal Corps in Europe, Mr. Gladstone built up his company and published thousands of titles, including books for hobbyists and animal lovers. He sold Arco Publishing Inc. to Prentiss Hall, a Simon & Schuster division, in 1978 but remained Arco's president and chief executive officer until his retirement three years later.
        A former resident of Greenwich, Conn., he moved to Florida after retiring.
        Mr. Gladstone is survived by three sons, Robert, William and Thomas, of Greenwich; a daughter, Margaret; two sisters, Gertrude Levine and Ann Davis, and four grandchildren.
