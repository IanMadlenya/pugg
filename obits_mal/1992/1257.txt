        David K. Eckert, a decorated Air Force pilot who became a minister and an advocate for gay and lesbian military veterans, died Sunday at the David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base near Sacramento, Calif. He was 47 years old and lived in Sacramento.
        He died of non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said Beverly Eckert, his former wife.
        In his 20-year Air Force career, Mr. Eckert won medals flying medical planes in the Vietnam War. Later, he was the commander of a WC-135 jet, a version of the Boeing 707, monitoring atmospheric radioactivity as part of enforcing a nuclear weapons ban. At his death he was a retired lieutenant colonel.
        After retiring with an honorable discharge in 1989, Mr. Eckert acknowledged his homosexuality. He was a founder of the Twin Spirit Veterans Association for gay and lesbian veterans and gave Congressional testimony on veterans with AIDS.
        He then completed seminary school and became the interim pastor of the Delta Harvest Metropolitan Community Church in Stockton, Calif., and was active in the River City Metropolitan Community Church in Sacramento. Both are nondenominational churches, many of whose members are homosexuals and lesbians.
        Mr. Eckert was born in Texas City, Tex.
        His marriage of 22 years to the former Beverly Bishop ended in divorce, but she said they remained close during the changes in his life.
        He is survived by his companion, Bill Weaver of Sacramento, and two daughters, Elisa Anne and Angela Christine, both of Orangevale, Calif.
