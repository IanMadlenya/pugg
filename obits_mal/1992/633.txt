        Ralph Winthrop Erickson, the former athletic director of the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Conn., died on Saturday at the Avery Heights nursing home in Hartford. A longtime resident of Windsor, he was 88 years old.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Erickson got his start in sports as captain of the basketball team at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in physical education. His hope to pitch for the Boston Braves was dashed by an injury, and he spent 10 years coaching boys' and girls' sports in Windsor, Vt., instead.
        In 1937, Mr. Erickson moved on to Trinity College in Hartford to coach and then served as a captain in the Army Air Force in World War II directing physical training.
        He joined the Loomis staff in 1946, coached the baseball, football and basketball teams and built the school's indoor athletics program. Stricken by cancer, he lost a leg and hip in 1965 but kept coaching on crutches until his retirement in 1969.
        Mr. Erickson is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Barbara Wishart, former headmistress of the Chaffee School; a daughter, Betty Ann Ludington of Stamford, Conn.; a sister, Ruth Nash of Williamsburg, Mass.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
