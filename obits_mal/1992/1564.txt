        Peter S. West, an advertising executive and conference manager, died Saturday at the White Plains Medical Center at the age of 66. He was a lifelong resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. West followed in the field of his father, Paul, who was the president of the Association of National Advertisers. The son began as the advertising manager of Quantacolor, then became an account executive at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency.
        Later he worked at Connecticut Life Magazine and as the assistant advertising manager for Cannon Mills. He then became the eastern regional manager and director of meetings and conferences for the National Association of Electrical Distributors. Last year he started a consulting firm.
        Sports were a major focus throughout his life. Drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 1944, he served instead in the Navy, where he toured on its boxing team. He played in national platform tennis tournaments, bowled, coached Little League teams for many years and was a board member and secretary of the Scarsdale Golf Club.
        Mr. West is survived by his wife of nearly 33 years, the former Eleanor Victoria Wendt, and three sons, John Paul of Hartsdale and Christian and Benjamin, both of Scarsdale.
