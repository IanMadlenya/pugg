        Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg, a retired hospital official and an authority on hypertension, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 93 years old.
        He died of respiratory failure and Parkinson's disease, said Felix A. Fishman, co-executor of his estate.
        Dr. Fishberg worked for 40 years at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan, including 24 years as director of its department of medicine. He was also physician-in-chief.
        His wife, Irene, died several years ago. There are no known survivors.
