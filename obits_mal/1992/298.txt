        Alan Kellock, a retired executive of McGraw-Hill in New York, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Seattle.  He was 77 years old and had lived in retirement in Sun City, Ariz., until last fall.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Kellock spent 32 years at the publishing house, retiring in 1978 as vice president of the McGraw-Hill Book Company. He joined the company's text-film division after serving with the Army in the Pacific in World War II and rose to become its general manager. For a time in the early 1970's, he also headed the community college division.
        He devised a hand-held filmstrip viewer, which he patented about 40 years ago. He later took part in the development of videodisk technology, particularly for its use in education.
        Mr. Kellock is survived by two sons, Alan C. of Manhattan and Thomas C. of Seattle; a sister, Jane Setlow of Shoreham, L.I.; and three grandchildren.
