        Peter von Zerneck, a character actor who appeared in 1940's films, including "Notorious" and "13 Rue Madeleine," died on Wednesday in Toluca Lake, Calif., where he lived. He was 84 years old.
        He died of complications after surgery, said his son Michael Zerneck of New York City.
        Mr. von Zerneck was a news photographer in his native Budapest. After immigrating to the United States, he turned to acting. His film credits also include "Berlin Express" and "A Foreign Affair" (both 1948). He also appeared on Broadway in 1945 in Edward Chodorov's "Common Ground" and was a producer for Voice of America.
        He is also survived by two other sons, Francis von Zerneck of Toluca Lake and Richard von Zerneck of New York City.
