        Piotr Jaroszewicz, a former Prime Minister of Poland, and his wife were found dead in their home in a suburb of Warsaw, Polish officials said yesterday, describing the deaths as homicides. Mr. Jaroszewicz was 82 years old; the age of his wife, Alicja Solska, could not be learned yesterday.
        Mr. Jaroszewicz, who was forced to resign in 1980 after 10 years in office, was an architect of the policies that hastened economic collapse and led to the August 1980 strikes that resulted in the creation of the Solidarity trade union movement.
        He and Edward Gierek, the Communist Party leader, were blamed for policies under which they invested huge sums in ultimately unprofitable heavy industry and flooded the country with consumer goods at Government-supported low prices.
        Mr. Jaroszewicz and three other officials were interned under accusations of corruption and abuse of power.
        Polish officials said yesterday that Mr. Jaroszewicz had been tortured before being strangled, and that his wife, who was a journalist for Trybuna Ludu, the newspaper of the Communist Party, had been shot with a hunting rifle.
        The bodies were found early yesterday, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Jaroszewicz was born in the city of Niesweiz in what was then Czarist Russia, and was a schoolteacher and then principal before World War II. He spent much of the war in the Soviet-backed Polish Army, rising to the post of chief of political administration, the army's second-highest post, and began his career in government in the late 1940's. In 1952 he was named Deputy Prime Minister, a post he held until his appointment as Prime Minister.
        Mr. Jaroszewicz's strong ties with Moscow contributed to the deep dislike many Poles had for him.
        Mr. Jaroszewicz was forced to resign in February 1980 in an unsuccessful attempt divert blame from Mr. Gierek. Both men were expelled from the Communist Party in 1981.
