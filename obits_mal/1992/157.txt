        Leo C. Maitland, a prominent surgeon in Harlem, died last Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 64 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        He was known as "doctor to the stars" because his patients ranged from Miles Davis to Geoffrey Holder, as well as his charity patients. In 1958 he was on the medical team at Harlem Hospital that operated on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for a chest stab wound.
        He graduated from City College and Meharry Medical College. He served two years in the Air Force. Back in private practice, he worked at several New York hospitals. At Sydenham Hospital he was chairman and associate director for the surgery department.
        Surviving are his wife, Carolyn Priscilla Swann; two sons, Leo E. and Tracy V., both of Manhattan; a daughter, Anne L., of Philadelphia, and a sister, Sylvia Maitland Duncan of Brooklyn.
