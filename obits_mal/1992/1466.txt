        David Sachs, a retired professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University, died Monday in Stella Maris Hospice outside Baltimore. He was 71 years old and lived in Baltimore.
        Professor Sachs died of lung cancer, said Dennis O'Shea, a spokesman for the university.
        Professor Sachs, who retired in July and who had entered the hospice earlier this month, was recognized in three main areas of expertise: ethics, ancient philosophy and the philosophy of the mind.
        His scholarly writings included the articles "How to Distinguish Self-Respect from Self-Esteem," about ethics, "A Fallacy in Plato's Republic," dealing with ancient philosophy, and "In Fairness to Freud" and "Wittgenstein on Emotion," both on the philosophy of the mind.
        He also served as editor of The Philosophical Review from 1964 to 1967 and as chairman of its book-review board from 1967 to 1969.
        He was born in Chicago, grew up there and went on to earn three degrees in philosophy. He was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1945 from the University of California at Los Angeles, then attended graduate school at Princeton University, where he earned a master's degree in 1948 and a doctorate in 1953.
        He taught at Cornell, Brandeis, Iowa State and Rutgers Universities before joining the Johns Hopkins faculty.
        Professor Sachs is survived by two sisters, Bee Lieberman and Ella Hubschman, both of Sherman Oaks, Calif.
