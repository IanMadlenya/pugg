        Curt Bois, a dapper German actor who performed in nearly 70 films, has died here. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Bois, who went to Hollywood after fleeing the Nazis in 1933, died on Christmas Day, said a statement from the Schiller Theater here. Mr. Bois, a native Berliner, had worked at the Schiller.
        The actor, who was born on April 5, 1901, was a diminutive man who made his first stage appearance at age 7.
        Specializing in comic roles, Mr. Bois had been in 27 movies by the time he left Germany in 1933. He made 40 films in America, mostly in small but memorable roles as head waiters or pompous clerks, and as a pickpocket in "Casablanca."
        In 1950, Mr. Bois returned to Germany, and gained high praise for his theatrical performances.
        He is survived by his wife, Dagmar.
