        Cary Scott Lowenstein, a dancer, singer and actor, died on Sunday at Hospice-by-the-Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 30 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of AIDS, said his parents, Daniel and Toby Lowenstein.
        Mr. Lowenstein played Mike, the character who sang "I Can Do That," in the national company of "A Chorus Line" in 1980 and made his Broadway debut in the same role a year later. His other Broadway credits include "Song and Dance" and "The Tap Dance Kid."
        He was in the national tour of "Sophisticated Ladies," where he met Lynn Gendron, a dancer, choreographer and actress, whom he later married. The couple toured the United States and Europe with Peter Maxwell's Ballroom Dance Theater and appeared in the singer Ute Lemper's live stage show and television special in Germany, France and Sweden.
        Ms. Gendron Lowenstein died of a brain tumor last year. In addition to his parents, who live in Boca Raton, Mr. Lowenstein is survived by three sisters, Wendi Jacobson of Manhattan, Lori Mase of Springfield, N.J., and Gaye, of Los Angeles.
