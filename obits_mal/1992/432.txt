        Doug Roby of Ypsilanti, Mich., a high-ranking American amateur sports official for 50 years and a member of the International Olympic Committee for 32 years, died Tuesday in a nursing home in Ann Arbor, Mich.
        He was 94 years old. He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Douglas Fergusson Roby was a poor youth who worked his way through college by racking balls in a billiards parlor six hours a day. He was a football halfback at Phillips University and the University of Michigan and played professional football for the Cleveland Indians in 1923. He joined the American Metal Products Company, an auto-parts manufacturer in Detroit, in 1926 and retired as board chairman in 1963. Headed the A.A.U.
        From 1951 to 1953, he was the president of the Amateur Athletic Union, then America's governing body for many amateur sports. He was vice president (1953-65) and president (1965-68) of the United States Olympic Committee and one of two American members of the International Olympic Committee (1952-84).
        Mr. Roby was a blunt man who was often the center of controversy. In a Black Power demonstration during the 1968 Mexico City Olympics, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, both black Americans, accepted their medals. Then, when "The Star-Spangled Banner" was played, they raised black-gloved fists and bowed their heads. Mr. Roby and his colleagues removed the two runners from the United States team and sent them home.
        In 1979, Mr. Roby voted against the readmission of China to the Olympics. China prevailed by a vote of 62-17. In 1984, he urged that South Africa, banned from the Olympics since 1960 because of its racial policy of apartheid, be readmitted. South Africa remained banned until this year.
        He is survived by a son, Douglas F. Roby Jr. of Grosse Pointe, Mich.; two daughters, Hermine Roby Klingler of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Ruth Roby Glancy of Grosse Pointe; 10 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
