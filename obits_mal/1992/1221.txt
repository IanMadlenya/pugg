        Louis Simon, a longtime New York union leader who helped to organize the city's laundry workers during the Depression in 1937, died on Wednesday at New York University Hospital. He was 97 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a yearlong illness, said Dr. William Schneider, a family friend.
        Mr. Simon, who was born in Hungary, led the Amalgamated Laundry Workers Joint Board until the 1970's. He also was a past vice president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, with which the laundry-workers union was long affiliated.
        He was a former trustee of the National Urban League and a member of its executive board in New York, the advisory board of Manhattan Community College and the labor committee of the United Negro College Fund.
        Mr. Simon is survived by his wife, Irene.
