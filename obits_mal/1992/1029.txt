        Richard F. Silverman, a computer expert who helped develop the systems used to project winning candidates on election nights, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 50 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of myasthenia gravis, his family said.
        He was a former chairman of the Greater New York Myasthenia Gravis Foundation.
        Mr. Silverman worked for CBS News for 20 years until 1990, and since then worked with Voters Research and Surveys, a pooled operation serving major radio and television networks, newspapers and magazines.
        Before polls close and totals are tabulated, a sample of voters leaving the booths are asked to tell how they voted, and this information is used to project the results. Mr. Silverman worked with computers to help gather, analyze, present and distribute the figures.
        He specialized in computer-generated graphics to display the results on television and in arrangements for the electronic connections to give news organizations across the nation constantly updated results.
        Mr. Silverman was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Queens College and was working on his doctorate in physics when he went to work for CBS.
        His marriage to Sara Mayes ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Gerber; a daughter, Dorea Silverman of Manhattan; a brother, Daniel of Brooklyn, and his stepchildren, Karen Apterbach and William Apterbach, both of Queens.
