        Willard Rhodes, an ethnomusicologist and emeritus professor of music at Columbia University, died on Friday in a nursing home in Sun City, Ariz., where he lived. He was 91 years old.
        He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter, Joy Cooper of Ossining, N.Y.
        Mr. Rhodes, a specialist in American Indian and African music, was a founder and the first president of the Society for Ethnomusicology. His extensive collections of traditional and folk music are in the Library of Congress, the University of California at Los Angeles and other places. In 1968 he became the first North American president of the International Folk Music Council, now called the Council for Traditional Music.
        Mr. Rhodes studied music at the Mannes College of Music and at Columbia University, where he received a master's degree in 1925. From 1937 until his retirement in 1969, he taught music and ethnomusicology at Columbia and was a director of the college's Opera Workshop. Before joining Columbia, he was the conductor of the the American Opera Company, assistant conductor of the Cincinnati Summer Opera and director of music for the public schools in Bronxville, N.Y.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a brother, B. Wendell Rhodes of Shelby, Ohio; two grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
