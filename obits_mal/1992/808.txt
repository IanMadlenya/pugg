        John H. Kornblith, chairman, president and chief executive of the Twenty-First Century Corporation, one of the largest franchise holders of McDonald's fast-food restaurants in the world, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kornblith died of lung cancer, said Joan Lotz, a company spokeswoman.
        He had two distinct careers. In one he was an influential figure in the men's fashion industry from the mid-1950's onward. In 1967, he founded the Intercontinental Apparel Corporation, which held the exclusive license to make and distribute the Pierre Cardin line of men's clothing in the United States. He sold his interest in the company in 1979.
        In 1959, when he was an executive for a Chicago-based men's clothing maker, Mr. Kornblith and a partner created the Twenty-First Century Corporation to buy two McDonald's franchises in the Chicago area, four years after Ray Kroc founded the company and began to develop its franchise system. Mr. Kornblith bought out his partner in 1974.  Headed Advertising Board
        Mr. Kornblith's company grew to own 38 McDonald's franchises in the New York metropolitan area. He served five terms on the McDonald's national advertising board and was elected three times as its chairman.

        He is survived by his wife and business partner, Dorothy; a son, Gary, of Oberlin, Ohio; three daughters, Cathy, of San Francisco, Polly, of Boston, and Lisa Kaminir of Los Angeles; a sister, Jane Hess, of Winnetka, Ill., and four grandchildren.
