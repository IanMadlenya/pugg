        Frederick G. McNally, a former vice president of the Rand McNally map publishing company, died Friday at his home in Cuernavaca, Mexico.
        He was 75 years old and died when he accidentally slipped and struck his head, his family said.
        Mr. McNally worked most of his career at the family-owned company, which publishes maps, atlases and books and produces globes. For many years he was a vice president in charge of manufacturing. He initially worked at the company's headquarters in Skokie, Ill., then headed its Manhattan office and also supervised its operations in Mexico.
        After retiring from McNally about 10 years ago, he moved to Cuernavaca and began anew as an executive in publishing and paper supply businesses in Mexico City.
        He was born in Chicago and was a graduate of Yale University. During World War II he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps as a B-26 pilot on the European front. His first marriage ended in divorce.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Martha Fleming; a daughter, Kate Cote of Manhattan; five stepsons, Addison Berkey of Millbrook, N.Y., David and DeGraff Berkey, both of Seattle, and Charles and Thomas Berkey, both of Denver; a brother, Andrew McNally of Chicago, who is the chairman of Rand McNally, and a sister, Eleanor Bodman of Winnetka, Ill.; and four grandchildren.
