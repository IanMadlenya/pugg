        David Bernstein, a leader in civic, business and Republican circles in Oyster Bay, L.I., and the father-in-law of the State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, died on Friday at his home in Oyster Bay. He was 98 years old.
        He died in his sleep, said his daughter, Ethel Marino of Oyster Bay.
        In his long and varied career, he served as president of the Oyster Bay School Board, president of the Oyster Bay Chamber of Commerce and Commissioner of the Oyster Bay Water District, retiring from the last position at the age of 92. He worked with the United Jewish Appeal on Long Island, founded the Oyster Bay Jewish Center, and served as president of the Congregation Tiferth Israel in Glen Cove, L.I.
        For many years, Mr. Bernstein could be found every day at Dave's Clothing Store, his shop in downtown Oyster Bay, where he held court for a variety of business associates, civic leaders and friends as much as he sold clothes.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by two sons, Jacob, of Oyster Bay, and Abraham, of Manhasset, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
