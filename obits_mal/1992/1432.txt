        Gordon Hill, a former partner with the accounting firm of Haskins & Sells and a golf official, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 99 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Malverne Hill, a nephew.
        Mr. Hill was associated with Haskins & Sells, one of the predecessor firms to Deloitte Haskins & Sells, for more than 50 years. He was also an avid golfer and a former director and president of the U.S. Seniors Golf Association.
        Mr. Hill, a native of Atlanta, attended the Georgia Institute of Technology. He joined Haskins & Sells in 1917 and was assigned to the New York office in 1938. Mr. Hill retired in 1954 but remained available as a consultant for special assignments for many years.
        In addition to his golf interests, Mr. Hill was a director of the Metropolitan Opera Association, a director of the Union League Club, and a former president of the Circumnavigators Club, an organization of those who have circumnavigated the earth.
        There are no immediate survivors.
