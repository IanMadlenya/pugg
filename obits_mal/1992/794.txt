        Lynn Oliver, a band leader and jazz educator who taught several generations of musicians the art of studio performance, died on Thursday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Ann, said.
        Mr. Oliver, a trombonist whose big band performed frequently in the New York metropolitan area, operated a studio for more than 30 years on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The studio was the site of many rehearsals for recordings and concerts by musicians like Duke Ellington, Quincy Jones and Gerry Mulligan.
        He moved his studio to midtown Manhattan in the early 1980's, when the Upper West Side building was razed to make way for an apartment building. He closed the midtown studio when his illness was diagnosed five years ago.  Jazz Workshops
        Mr. Oliver began offering jazz workshops to not-so-famous musicians in the early 1950's. He persuaded many of the band leaders who rented his studio to donate original arrangements for his students to use and he built a large library of big-band music. Mr. Oliver's alumni have performed with Buddy Rich, Art Blakey, Blood, Sweat & Tears and Rahsann Roland Kirk, among others. Many have also played in Broadway show orchestras and for recording sessions.
        Mr. Oliver, a native of Brooklyn, was born John Oliveri and began studying drums at the age of 16. He served in the Army in World War II as a combat radio operator in the Pacific Theater. After the war, he attended the Manhattan School of Music, and went on to play and arrange works for such well-knwon orchestras as those of Bobby Byrne, Art Mooney and Jose Melis, who led the band for the "Tonight" show with Jack Paar.
        Mr. Oliver is survived by his wife of nearly 35 years, the former Ann Donnazita, who was his partner in the studio, and by his sister, Clara Green of Staatsburg, N.Y.
