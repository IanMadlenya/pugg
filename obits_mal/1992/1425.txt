        Arnold K. Davis, a prominent insurance broker in Manhattan, died yesterday at the Palm Beach Hospital in Florida. He was 76 years old and lived in Palm Beach.
        He died of complications of diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Davis was a major broker for the Chubb insurance group and, his family said, had North America's oldest contract with Lloyd's of London.
        His corporate clients included the 21 Club and Sardi's Restaurant. His celebrity clients included Peter Duchin, Joan Rivers, Chita Rivera and Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding.
        He was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Columbia University at the age of 18. During World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the Army.
        His wife of 44 years, Betty, died six years ago.
        He is survived by two sons, Robert, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Stratton, Vt., and John, of Manhattan and Harwinton, Conn., and a sister, Dorita J. Richards of Palm Beach.
