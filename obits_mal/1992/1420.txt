        Ernest Weiss, president of International Marble and Granite, the largest importer of marble and granite in the United States, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95 years old.
        Mr. Weiss established the company in 1945, after he fled his native Austria to escape Nazi persecution. He had been president of his own marble and granite company there.
        He was also the founder of a novelties company called Artistica, and served as president of both Artistica and International Marble.
        Mr. Weiss is survived by his wife, Mimi; a daughter, Edith Kurzweil of Manhattan; a son, John, of Tenafly, N.J.; four grandsons and two granddaughters, and one great-grandson and one great-granddaughter.
