        Ernest Pendrell, a producer of television documentaries and a playwright in television's early years, died yesterday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of throat cancer, said his wife, Dorothy.
        From 1965 to 1978, Mr. Pendrell wrote and produced more than 30 documentaries for ABC News, examining welfare, drug addiction, abortion and the energy crisis. In the prize-winning 1966 documentary "To Save a Soldier," he followed a wounded G.I. from the rice paddies of Vietnam through several military hospitals to his life with his family after returning home.
        His dramas for "United States Steel Hour," "Du Pont Show of the Week," and "Play of the Week" included "Seven Times Monday," the story of a factory supervisor striving for respect from his colleagues, starring Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.
        Mr. Pendrell, who was born in London, worked as a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer and managed a children's clothing factory before entering television. He was also a board member of the Writers Guild of America, East.
        He is survived by his wife.
