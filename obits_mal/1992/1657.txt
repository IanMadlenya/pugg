        Leonard Jacobson, an architect who worked with I. M. Pei on some of the most important museum projects of this century, died on Saturday at his home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. He was 71 years old.
        His office, Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, said he died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Jacobson was instrumental in the planning and execution of the East Wing of the National Gallery in Washington (1978), the West Wing of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston (1981), the Portland Museum of Art in Maine (1982) and the Wiesner Center for Arts and Media Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1985). For the last 10 years, much of his work was devoted to the modernization of the Louvre Museum in Paris. Decorated by France
        Mr. Jacobson combined a pragmatic grasp of architecture's technical requirements with a passion for visual art. At the National Gallery, he was responsible for moving the heating ducts in the East Wing so that the large Calder mobile in the wing's central atrium would subtly move in the air currents, animating the dramatic space. In Paris, Mr. Jacobson was valued for the humor and diplomacy with which he steered the Louvre project through the intricacies of French bureaucracy. In 1989, the French Government honored him with the Order of Arts and Letters.
        Mr. Jacobson was born in Philadelphia on March 7, 1921. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1942 and earned his Master of Architecture degree there in 1947. He began working with I. M. Pei in 1953, when the two architects were employed at the New York firm of Webb & Knapp, and their association continued when Mr. Pei formed his own firm in 1960.
        Mr. Jacobson is survived by his wife, Joan; two sons, Eric and Daniel, both of Brooklyn; his sister, Frances Fader of Philadelphia, and a grandson.
