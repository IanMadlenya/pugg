        Angel Penna Sr., trainer of thoroughbred horses that won more than 250 stakes races in his 50-year career, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Garden City, L.I. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Penna, born in Buenos Aires, was the eldest son of one of Argentina's leading trainers. He saddled his first winner there in 1945.
        His initial effort in the United States came in 1953 at the D.C. International in Laurel, Md., where his horse, Mister Black, the top Argentine turf horse, did not do well. But a stablemate, Ben Cover, brought Mr. Penna to the winner's circle. Trained Allez France
        In 1968, Mr. Penna began his career in the United States as the trainer for horses owned by Gustave Ring and William Levin. One of the best was Bold Reason, winner of the Travers Stakes at Saratoga in 1971.
        For five years, in the 1970's, Mr. Penna was in charge of the stables of Countess Margit Batthyany and Daniel Wildenstein, the art dealer, in France.
        The best horse he ever trained, said Mr. Penna, was Allez France, the Wildenstein filly who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe during an undefeated campaign in 1974. She was the first filly to earn $1 million. Elected to Racing Hall of Fame
        Mr. Penna returned to the United States in 1978 to train for Ogden Phipps and his family. From that association, which ended in 1985, came more than a dozen stakes winners. Mr. Penna, who later ran a public stable, was inducted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1988.
        His last stakes victor was Montubio, winner of the Stuyvesant Handicap at Aqueduct last Nov. 11. Other stakes winners conditioned by Mr. Penna were Czar Alexander, Dance Number, Flying Water, Pawneese, Private Account, Relaxing, San San, Time for a Change and Waya.
        Mr. Penna is survived by his wife, Elinor, and his son, Angel Jr., who is also a trainer.
