        James J. Herron, a retired executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation in New York, died on Friday at North Florida Regional Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He was 83 years old and lived in Edison and Gillette, N.J., before moving to Gainesville four years ago.
        He died of respiratory failure, the hospital said.
        Mr. Herron was senior vice president and corporate secretary of Dun & Bradstreet, when he retired in 1974 after 38 years with the business-information services company. He had joined it in 1934, shortly after R. G. Dun & Company took over the Bradstreet Company, and spent his career there except for two years of service as a Navy lieutenant aboard a destroyer in World War II.
        Mr. Herron is survived by a son, James B. of Old Forge, N.Y.; a daughter, Constance H. Gravina of Greentown, Pa.; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
