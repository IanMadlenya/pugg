        The Rev. Gabor Csordas, a retired leader of Hungarian Protestants in America and a spokesman for Hungarian religious and political causes, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan with a second home in New City, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        As a longtime dean in the Hungarian Reformed Church of America, he was a leader in a denomination with about 60 churches and 10,000 members in the United States. He founded the Hungarian Reformed Church on 229 East 82d Street in Manhattan in 1958 and served as that congregation's pastor until he retired last fall.
        For years he broadcast religious and political messages over Radio Free Europe to Hungary and was a staunch foe of the Communist takeover of his native country. In the United States, he helped many Hungarian refugees and other emigres resettle.
        Born in Szekesfehervar near Budapest, Mr. Csordas came to the United States in 1947 to study at the Union Theological Seminary. After earning a master's degree in 1948, he became the pastor of the Hungarian Reformed Church in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
        Surviving are his wife, Irene; two sons, Gabor, and John, both of Wilton, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Erika Ujvari of Manhattan; a brother, Bela, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
