        William E. Hurley, an Oregon lawyer and former criminal court judge who played a role in a landmark civil rights case in Mississippi in 1968, died on Monday at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Portland. Known as Pat, he was 61 years old and lived in Portland.
        He died of a stroke, according to a daughter, Anne Hurley, who lives in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hurley was one of more than a dozen Oregon lawyers who heeded the call for volunteers to handle civil rights suits in Mississippi in the 1960's. The case he successfully argued ended in the first monetary judgment against the Ku Klux Klan by a Mississippi jury -- a $1 million wrongful-death award in Vicksburg following the slaying of a 67-year-old black handyman, Ben Chester White.
        A native of Pettibone, N.D., Mr. Hurley graduated from the University of Oregon and its Law School. He served on the Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland but retired in 1984 and returned to the private practice of law.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Metcalf; three other daughters, Jean Hurley of Manchester, England, Mary Hurley and Sarah Reed, both of Portland, and one grandson.
