        Pieter A. Fisher, a partner in the Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs & Company, died on Sunday in his home at his vineyard in Rutherford, Calif. He was 61 years old and had a home in New York from 1957 to 1991.
        Mr. Fisher, a former general partner who was a limited partner in the firm at the time of his death, died of prostate cancer, said his wife, the former M. Helen Anderson.
        His business interests over the years also included the Ramco Oil and Gas Company of Oklahoma City, in which he was a partner. He and his wife had recently bought the vineyard, in the Napa Valley, and had built a winery, Clos du Montagne, on the property.  After working as an executive in advertising agencies, Mr. Fisher joined Goldman, Sachs in 1964. He became a general partner in 1975 and a limited partner in 1986.
        In addition to his wife, whom he married in 1978, he is survived by two children from his marriage to Harriet Cooper, which ended in divorce. They are a son, Pieter A. Jr., of Coral Gables, Fla.,; a daughter, Ellen of Marblehead, Mass.; a brother, Dr. John R. S. Fisher of Coatesville, Pa., and one grandchild.
