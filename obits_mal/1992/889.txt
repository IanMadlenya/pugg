        William H. Warfield, who was first vice president for security of the Republic National Bank of New York and the former chief of counterintelligence for the F.B.I. in New York City, died on Monday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 54 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Marynell.
        Mr. Warfield, who graduated from Miami University of Ohio in 1966, joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1967 and was an agent in F.B.I. offices in St. Louis, Los Angeles and Washington before becoming special agent in charge of the counterintelligence division for the New York region.
        After retiring from the F.B.I. in 1988, he took the Republic Bank post.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Constance Warfield-Nishi of Boston and Sandra Warfield-Dobies of Stamford.
