        Morrie Elis, one of America's foremost bridge players, died on Sunday at his home in Lauderhill, Fla. He was 84 years old.
        He died after a series of heart problems, said his daughter, Judith Tucker of Manhattan.
        Mr. Elis won the Vanderbilt Knockout Team Championship in 1949 and the Life Master Pairs in 1938 and 1940. He was also the Masters Individual Champion in 1940 and 1950, and won the Master Mixed Teams in 1937. In addition, he was second in 13 national championships, including the Spingold Knockout and the Vanderbilt, twice each. In 1938 and 1940 he won the McKenney Trophy, awarded to the most successful tournament player in a calendar year.
        Mr. Elis played a major role in establishing the American Contract Bridge League's Charity Foundation between 1933 and 1937. He wrote a column for The Bridge World magazine between 1936 and 1940, and constructed deals for Autobridge, a noted self-teaching device.
        Mr. Elis was nationally ranked in table tennis, winning the New York City title in 1932. He graduated from New York University in 1928, and eventually became president of his family's hat company in Manhattan.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his brother, Irving Elishewitz of Lauderhill, Fla.
