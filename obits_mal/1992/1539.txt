        Jeffrey S. Tanaka, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana, died in an automobile accident on Nov. 3 near Bondville, Ill. He was 34 years old.
        The university reported his death yesterday and said the authorities had been looking for him since he was reported missing last week. His body and car were found on Tuesday submerged in a pond in a rural area just west of Urbana in east-central Illinois. An autopsy was to be performed.
        Dr. Tanaka, the author of five books, was known for his work on statistical models gleaned from psychological studies. His research gave scientists insights into how people think and behave. His work led to studies about how jurors reach decisions, the causes of aggression against women and the effects of stress, among others.
        Dr. Tanaka was born in Los Angeles and received his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of California at Berkeley. From 1983 to 1990 he taught at New York University, where he also directed the university's Minority Opportunity Scholars Training program.
        He is survived by his parents, Margaret and Shoji Tanaka of Los Angeles, and a sister, Stacy, a doctoral candidate at Berkeley.
