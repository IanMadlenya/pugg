        Kim Chung Yul, a former Prime Minister of South Korea who helped prepare the country for its first general elections, died on Monday. He was 75 years old and lived in Seoul.
        Mr. Kim died after a lengthy illness, an announcement by the South Korean Embassy said. The immediate cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Kim served as Prime Minister from July 1987 through February 1988 under former President Chun Doo Hwan as the country was preparing for general elections.
        Mr. Kim, a native of Seoul, was an officer in the South Korean Air Force after World War II and served as its chief of staff during the late 1940's and early 1950's. He was Chief of the Korean Armed Forces during the Korean War and Minister of National Defense from 1957 to 1962.
        From 1963 to 1966 Mr. Kim was South Korea's Ambassador to the United States. Upon his return he became a member of the National Assembly and later held several other public and corporate posts before becoming prime minister. After leaving that office, Mr. Kim was named chairman of the Korea-Japan Corporation Council.
        Mr. Kim is survived by his wife, Hee Jae Lee; three sons, Duk Ki, Hyung Ki, and Jung Ki, all of Korea; two daughters, Kyung Soon Hong, also of Korea, and Taeja Kim Lee, of Watchung, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
