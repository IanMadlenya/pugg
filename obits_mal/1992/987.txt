        Max W. Salvadori, an anti-Fascist resistance fighter in Italy who became a professor of modern European history at Smith College, died Thursday at his home in Northampton, Mass. He was 84 years old.
        He died of cancer, the college said yesterday.
        Born in London to British and Italian parents, he was reared and educated in Italy until 1924, when clashes with Mussolini's Black Shirts drove him into exile in Switzerland for five years. He graduated from the University of Geneva in 1929 and joined a resistance group, Justice and Liberty, to serve as liaison between its clandestine operations in central Italy and anti-Fascist exiles in France.
        Arrested in Italy and then released under British pressure, he fled into exile again for 10 years, working and writing in Europe, Kenya and the United States, where he taught at St. Lawrence University. It was during those years that he began to write extensively on political history, with books published in Europe and the United States.
        Rejoining the struggle against Fascism, he became a decorated officer in the British Special Forces and a liaison to the Italian underground after the Allied invasion of Italy in 1943. Parachuting behind enemy lines, he helped to organize the insurrection against Mussolini in northern Italy in 1945.
        In 1947, Professor Salvadori joined the departments of history and sociology at Smith. He was the Dwight W. Morrow Professor of History from 1964 to 1973 and director of the junior year in Geneva from 1973 to 1975.
        Professor Salvadori is survived by his wife of 58 years, Joyce Pawle Salvadori; a son, Clement Salvadori of Atascadero, Calif.; a daughter, Cynthia Salvadori of Kenya, and two sisters, Gladys and Joyce, both of Italy.
