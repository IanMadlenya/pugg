        Richard A. Armstrong, former executive editor of Fortune magazine, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Armstrong died of respiratory failure, said his wife, Nancy.
        Mr. Armstrong, who joined Fortune in 1969, was executive editor from 1977 until his retirement in 1989. He joined the magazine as a writer, but after writing just two stories, was made an editor. In 1977, he was the chairman of a task force, which recommended, over the objections of most of the magazine's staff, that Fortune change from a monthly to a biweekly publication. The change resulted in substantially greater profits.
        Marshall Loeb, Fortune's managing editor, said that as a writer Mr. Armstrong "embodied wit and grace" and that his deftness as an editor always preserved the author's viewpoint and sensibility.
        A native of D'lo, Miss., Mr. Armstrong graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1950 and joined The Gadsden (Ala.) Times. He was awarded a Bronze Star while serving as a first lieutenant in the United States Army during the Korean conflict. He returned briefly to the Gadsden paper before pursuing a master's degree in English literature at Columbia University. Mr. Armstrong was a correspondent at Time magazine from 1956 to 1961, and then a writer at the Saturday Evening Post from 1961 to 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy, and daughter, Lucy Kidd of Oxford, England.
