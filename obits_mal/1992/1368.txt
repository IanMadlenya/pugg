        W. Arthur Cullman, a retired educator and executive who was a marketing expert, died on Sunday during a visit to Manhattan. He was 77 years old and lived in Columbus, Ohio.
        He died of a heart attack, his family reported yesterday.
        Dr. Cullman was president of the American Marketing Association in 1977-78. He taught for 35 years at Ohio State University and headed its graduate business programs and marketing faculty.
        He served as a consultant and board member for several companies, including The Limited, whose head, Leslie H. Wexner, had been his student.
        Dr. Cullman was a benefactor of several organizations, including the Buckeye Boys Ranch for disturbed boys, which he headed. He served on many boards, including the Northwest Council for Human Relations and the Columbus Symphony.
        His family owned a cigar tobacco leaf company in Connecticut, and Mr. Cullman initially went into that industry. He worked for four years in sales at the Philip Morris Companies, and four years at Benson & Hedges, where he became executive vice president. One brother, Joseph F. 3d, is chairman emeritus of Philip Morris, and another, Edgar M., headed Culbro, a cigar company.
        Mr. Cullman was born in Manhattan. He earned a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1927, a master's in business administration at Harvard in 1939 and a doctorate at Ohio State in 1951.
        In addition to his brothers, both of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Cecilia Stein; a daughter, Beatrice C. Egger of Madison, Wis.; three sons, W. Arthur Jr., of Columbus, Peter A., of Birmingham, Mich., and Richard L., of Bowling Green, Ohio; another brother, Lewis B., and a sister, Frances Boas, both of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
