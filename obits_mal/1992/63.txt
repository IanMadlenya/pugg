        Jesse C. Goodwin, co-founder of Mother's Food Products, which packaged kosher foods, died on Dec. 30 at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 76 years old and lived in Verona, N.J.
        He died of heart failure caused by a variety of pulmonary conditions, his son Richard said.
        Mr. Goodwin and his brother Bernard were the first to prepare and package gefilte fish and borscht in 1947, when they formed Mother's Food Products, said Richard Goodwin. The company was so named because the Goodwins used the gefilte fish recipe of their mother, Emma. In 1959 Mother's Food Products was acquired by Vita Foods as one of its divisions, and Mr. Goodwin was made executive vice president of Vita Foods. He remained with Vita until 1965, when he left to spend a year with Detecto Scales Inc., which was owned by the family of his first wife, Harriet, who died in 1973.
        After his year with Detecto, where he was a director, Mr. Goodwin joined what is now Shearson Lehman Brothers as a stockbroker. He was a senior vice president with Shearson at the time of his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Sondra; three sons, Richard Nathaniel, of Manhattan, Ralph Alan, of Berkeley, Calif., Jonathan Adam, of Eaton, N.H.; a stepson, Michael Glynn of Los Angeles, and two grandsons.
