        John Van Buren Sullivan, a broadcast industry executive whose stewardship of the radio station WNEW-AM in New York City in the 1960's made it one of the most influential and profitable in the country, died on Monday at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 78.
        Mr. Sullivan died of a heart attack, said a spokesman for the John J. Fox Funeral Home of Larchmont.
        During Mr. Sullivan's tenure as general manager and then president, WNEW combined popular music programs with coverage of news and sports.
        The combination was highly profitable. WNEW's gross income of $7,155,967 for 1962, for example, was reported to be the largest in the nation. WNEW now also broadcasts in the FM band. Most of Adult Life at WNEW
        Born in Omaha, Neb. and raised in Evanston, Ill., Mr. Sullivan joined WNEW and, except for service in the Army in World War II, worked there continuously until 1968.
        "We don't attempt to overpower the listener," Mr. Sullivan said in an interview in the 1960's in discussing what he looked for in a program announcer. "We seek a human, adult, vital sort of comment, not a ponderous world-shaking attitude."
        In 1968, after WNEW was bought by Metromedia Inc., Mr. Sullivan became Metromedia Radio's first president and then president of the parent company, Metromedia Inc. Publishing Division, whose publications included Playbill, the theater magazine.
        Mr. Sullivan was later president of the WHN radio station and executive director of the New York State Broadcasters' Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan Dillon Sullivan; four children, Rosemary W., of Quebec, Canada, Amanda D. and Sheila L., of New York City, and John F., of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
