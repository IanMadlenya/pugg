        Dan Erkkila, a flutist and composer, died on Sunday at the home of a friend in Manhattan. He was 51 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said the friend, Judith Michael.
        Mr. Erkkila was a founding member of Jean Erdman and Joseph Campbell's Theater of the Open Eye and collaborated with the composer Teiji Ito on the music for "Moon Mysteries," "Fire and Ice" and other of its productions. They also collaborated on Jerome Robbins's "Watermill" for the New York City Ballet. Mr. Erkkila's other theater works include "Danton's Death" at La Mama, for which he won an Ascap award, and "A Yeats Trio" for the Open Space Theater, which won a Villager Award for outstanding score. He was the music director of Elizabeth Swados's "Alice," "Three Travels of Aladdin" and "Jerusalem," in which he also performed.
        His interest in world music won him a residency with the Lakota Sioux Nation in 1976, a Rockefeller/La Mama E.T.C. cultural residency with the Baminga Pygmies of Central Africa in 1984 and a tour of Japan in 1987 with the Tibetan Singing Bowl Ensemble, for which he was a soloist and composer. The music of these various cultures is reflected in the works he composed for Relache, First Avenue and other new-music groups.
        Surviving are his parents, Mauritz and Lorraine Erkkila; a brother, Charles, of Fairfax, Va., and a sister, Lenelle Newell of McLean, Va.
