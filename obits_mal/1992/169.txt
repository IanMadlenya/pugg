        Henderson Supplee Jr., the former president and chairman of the Atlantic Refining Company, died on Monday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 88 years old and lived in Radnor, Pa.
        He died of complications from cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Supplee was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Princeton University in 1926. He started work delivering milk from horse-drawn wagons for the family business, the Supplee-Wills-John Milk Company, a leading local dairy. He rose to president in 1938, succeeding his father.
        In 1947 he became vice president and domestic sales manager for Atlantic Refining. He was promoted to president in 1952, then chairman in 1964. He retired from that post in 1965 but remained on the board, helping with the formation of the present Atlantic Richfield Company.
        He was a charter trustee of Princeton for 24 years. He headed the Federal Reserve Board of Philadelphia and the boards of the Philadelphia 1976 Bicentennial Corporation, Babies Hospital of Philadelphia and the Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia.
        He also served on the boards of the American Petroleum Institute, the Greater Philadelphia Movement, the Old Philadelphia Development Corporation, the National Dairy Products Corporation, the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, the United Gas Improvement Company and the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Mary Osborne Baker; two daughters, Anne Carroll of South Sutton, N.H., and Betty di Valmarana of Charlottesville, Va.; two sons, Henderson 3d of Bryn Mawr and Andrew of North Sutton, N.H.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
