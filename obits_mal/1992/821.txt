        Marion Trozzolo, whose manufacture of Teflon-coated frying pans helped change the way America cooks, died here on Wednesday. He was 66 years old and lived in Kansas City.
        Mr. Trozzolo suffered from leukemia for several years, his family said.
        Through a company that Mr. Trozzolo founded in 1957, Laboratory Plasticware Fabricators, he was the first producer in the United States of the Teflon-coated pan, which he called the "happy pan" because it is easy to clean. He sold the company in 1972.
        Mr. Trozzolo was a graduate of the University of Chicago. He came to the United States from Italy with his parents when he was a boy.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and seven children.
