        The Rev. Timothy G. Sheehan, a Federal drug enforcement agent who became a priest and later managed the finances of the Diocese of Brooklyn, died on Saturday at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica, Queens. He was 53 years old and lived in the diocesan chancery residence in Brooklyn.
        He died of lung cancer, said Msgr. Austin P. Bennett of the Diocese of Brooklyn.
        Born in Manhattan, Father Sheehan began his career in 1965 as an agent with the Bureau of Narcotics, the Federal agency that later became the Drug Enforcement Administration. In 1970, he was among 40 agents named to the first New York Joint Task Force, which combined Federal, state and city agents to combat drug trafficking.
        In 1972, he quit the bureau to enter the seminary and was ordained in 1976. He served as chaplain for the New York D.E.A. office and was assigned to various parishes in Brooklyn and Queens before he was named pastor at St. Joseph's Church on Pacific Street in Brooklyn in 1981.
        In 1984, he was appointed to the diocese's financial office, and in 1989 became its financial administrator. He supervised a budget of $16 million, oversaw church investments and reviewed the finances for the diocese's 200 parishes.
        Father Sheehan attended parish schools in Manhattan and held degrees from St. Peter's College in Jersey City and St. John's University in Queens.
        He is survived by a brother-in-law, Donald Reilly; two nephews, Christopher and Colin Reilly, and a niece, Carolyn Reilly, all of Medfield, Mass.
