        He died of complications of lymphoma, his family said.

He worked for the British War Ministry and then enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, serving from 1942 to 1962. He worked for the State Department from 1962 to 1980 in posts including Mali, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand and Ethiopia.
        In 1975 he was the coordinator of a Presidential task force charged with placing Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees who were taken to Camp Pendleton, Calif., after the war in Southeast Asia.
        In 1976-77 he directed the American mission monitoring a 1,700-square-mile buffer zone between Egyptian and Israeli forces in Sinai, an effort for which he received a Presidential commendation.
