        David Schaffer Epstein, a film director and screenwriter, died on Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. He was 73 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Epstein wrote and directed educational films and documentaries on many political and public-affairs issues, including atomic energy, the creation of Israel as a state and the postwar reconstruction of Eastern Europe. Among his projects were a film about the New York State Legislature, which was shown at the 1964 World's Fair, and documentaries on topics including alcoholism, space travel and immigration.
        As the liaison between the Ford Foundation and the "Omnibus" series on CBS television, he directed and produced films on Frank Lloyd Wright, the Quincy Adams family and other subjects. He also directed televised presentations by the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.
        His companion was Norma S. Lesser.
        He is survived by a son, Rafael, of Schenectady, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
