        Myron S. (Johnny) Falk Jr., an investment banker, philanthropist and prominent collector of Asian art, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        His first trip to China in 1937 prompted Mr. Falk to start his collection. He lent his artworks to museums, advised art institutions in the United States and abroad, and fostered the training of a new generation of curators, scholars and other professionals in the field of Asian art.
        He was a longtime trustee of the Asia Society and helped found the Friends of the Asia Society Galleries, Friends of the China Institute in America Gallery, Oriental Art Council, Roebling Society of the Brooklyn Museum and Japan Society Gallery. He also served as a director of the New York Foundation and Hebrew Technical Institute, a board member of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and chairman of the Bennington College board of trustees.
        Mr. Falk is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Pauline Baerwald; two daughters, Patricia, of Manhattan, and Nancy, of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Michael, of Oakland, Calif; a sister, Eleanor F. Lenzner of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
