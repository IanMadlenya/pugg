        G. Archibald Douglas, a retired chairman of Saab-Scania of America Inc. and of the Swedish-American Chamber of Commerce in New York, died last Wednesday at the family manor, Ekensholm, just outside Stockholm. He was 81 years old and also lived at Rivanna Farm near Charlottesville, Va.
        He died in his sleep of a heart attack, his family said.
        Count Douglas, a Swedish nobleman and a former investment banker, headed the Sweda Cash Register Company when Litton Industries bought it. He came to New York as a Litton vice president in 1968. After he retired from Litton in 1975, he became chairman of the American subsidiary of Saab, the Swedish auto maker, as well as chairman of the commerce office. He held both posts until 1981.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Baroness Margareta Lagerfelt; two sons, Archibald, of Ekensholm, and Richard, of Manhattan; a daughter, Saroja Louise Douglas, also of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.
