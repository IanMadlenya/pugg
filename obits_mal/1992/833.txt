        Stephen A. Peduto, who astonished his fellow students in the graduating class of New York Law School last month by saying he had AIDS, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 36 years old and lived in Jersey City.
        He died of pneumonia and other AIDS-related complications, according to a friend, William Diskin.
        A graduate of the University of Chicago, Mr. Peduto was doing graduate work at Columbia University when he was diagnosed with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1983. He entered law school in 1988 and, in addressing the graduating class, said he had been battling AIDS since then but was determined to get his law degree.
        Mr. Peduto is survived by his parents, Anthony and Susan Peduto of Belmar, N.J., and a sister, Nicoletta Ferraiola of Manasquan, N.J. His companion was Richard Skinner of Jersey City.
