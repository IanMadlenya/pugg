        John Bogart, a longtime labor relations executive at New York City newspapers, died on Friday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Bogart began his career in 1934 at The New York Herald Tribune, where he was a reporter and editor and later promoted into management. He became the paper's manager of industrial relations in 1955 and director of industrial relations in 1963.
        In 1966 he helped negotiate The Herald Tribune's merger into the World Journal Tribune and became the industrial relations manager of the new company. But a months-long strike delayed the new paper's debut, and after that rocky start it folded in 1967.
        Mr. Bogart then joined The New York Times, where he worked until his retirement in 1977. In 1981 he resumed work as consultant to The Times, and continued in that capacity until his death.
        Mr. Bogart was married for 37 years to the former Marjorie Goodell. After she died he married the former Jacqueline Branaman.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Nutter of Needham, Mass., and Cordelia Malouin of Mesa, Ariz.
