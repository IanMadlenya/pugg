        Hanan J. Ayalti, author of many Yiddish and Hebrew works, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Chester, Conn.
        He died of lung cancer, said his son, Daniel Klenbort, of Atlanta.
        Mr. Ayalti, whose real name was Chonel Klenbort, wrote several novels, among them "The Hotel That Doesn't Exist," "No Escape From Brooklyn" and "Father and Son."
        Born in Soposkien, a Russian town that later became part of Poland, Mr. Ayalti emigrated in 1929 to Palestine, where his first book was published. After living briefly in Paris and then in Uruguay during World War II, he came to the United States in 1946.
        In addition to his stories and novels, some of which first appeared as serializations in the Yiddish newspaper The Forward, he was a regular contributor to magazines and journals like Commentary and Midstream. He also edited a collection of quotations and sayings called "Yiddish Proverbs."
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Charlotte, and three grandchildren.
