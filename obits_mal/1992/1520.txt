        Charles Baltin, who retired in 1988 after more than six decades in broadcasting, died on Monday at the Central New Jersey Jewish Home for the Aged in Somerset, N.J. He was 81 years old.
        He had a cerebral hemorrhage four years ago, his family said.
        Mr. Baltin made his radio debut as a vocalist on Jimmy Manley's "Melody" program in 1927. In the early 1930's, he was the co-host of a program giving advice to the lovelorn, "The Torch of Wisdom," over WAAW in Newark, now WNEW in New York City.
        In 1940, he moved to WHOM, a station with studios in New York City, where he worked as program director, assistant manager and, from 1950 to 1971, vice president and sales manager. At one time, the station broadcast in several languages from morning to night, but an influx of Latin-American listeners led the station to stay mostly with Spanish.
        Later, Mr. Baltin worked as director of special projects for WADO in New York City. He returned to the airwaves in 1974 as the host of "The Jewish American Hour" on WCTC in New Brunswick, N.J., continuing until failing health forced him to retire in 1988.
        He is survived by two sons, Bruce of Montpelier, Vt., and Steven of Fair Lawn, N.J., and one grandson.
