        Henry Hurwitz Jr., a research physicist who worked on plans for the hydrogen bomb and later helped develop nuclear power plants, died on Tuesday at his home in Schenectady, N.Y. He was 73 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Hurwitz worked on the bomb at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico from 1943 to 1946, then helped design power plants and set safety standards that were adopted worldwide. Fortune magazine in 1954 called him "probably the most brilliant student of nuclear reactor theory in industry."
        In 1946 he joined the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory run by the General Electric Company for the Federal Government. He helped design an early large reactor in West Milton, N.Y., and the Seawolf, the nuclear submarine.  Held 15 Patents
        At G.E. he was director of high-temperature plasma physics, manager of nucleonics and radiation and manager of theory and systems. He also researched laser fusion at the University of Rochester and worked on microprocessors for automation and indoor radon pollution.
        He held 15 patents and was honored by the Atomic Energy Commission and the American Nuclear Society. After leaving G.E. in 1984, he became a consultant as president of Hurbits Associates.
        Dr. Hurwitz, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Cornell University in 1938, earned a master's degree in physics at Harvard in 1939 and a doctorate there in 1941.
        His first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Alma Rosenbaum; two daughters, Robin Inwald of Queens and Julia Coleclough of Memphis; two sons, Barry Dayton of Park Ridge, Ill., and Wayne Hurwitz of Los Angeles; a brother, David, of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
