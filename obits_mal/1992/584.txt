        Herbert Kolsky, a noted researcher and educator in applied physics, mathematics and engineering, died last Saturday at his home in Providence, R.I., where he had been a longtime member of the Brown University faculty. He was 75 years old.
        A family spokesman said the cause of death was prostate cancer.
        Dr. Kolsky developed a device called the split-Hopkinson bar, which measures permanent deformations in objects placed under sudden, intense pressure. The device is now used in laboratories on projects ranging from aircraft design to weapons and armor.
        He wrote "Stress Waves in Solids" (Dover, 1963), a major work on the subject, and published 90 papers on topics like the formation of cracks in brittle material, the effect of dynamic conditions on metals and polymers, and the nature of fiber-reinforced material.
        Dr. Kolsky, nicknamed Harry, was born in London and in 1937 graduated from Imperial College there. He earned a doctorate in philosophy in 1940 and a doctorate in science in 1957, both at the University of London.
        In his early career in England, he did wartime military research at Imperial College, headed the physics department at the Imperial Chemical Industries laboratories for nine years and was the senior principal scientific officer at the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment for two years.
        He joined Brown University's faculty in 1960 and retired there in 1983 but continued his research until recently.
        Surviving are his wife of about 50 years, the former Mary G. Morton, and three sons: David J. Kolsky of Oakland, Calif., Peter J. Kolsky of London and Allan B. Kolsky of New Orleans.
