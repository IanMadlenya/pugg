        Mr. Shemel, a graduate of Columbia College and Columbia Law School, was the co-author with M. William Krasilovsky of "This Business of Music," first published by Billboard Books imprint in 1964. A widely used guidebook and ready reference, it delves into the legal aspects of music as big business, including copyright law, contracts with minors and invasion of privacy.
        Billboard Books also published the authors' "More About This Music Business," whose fourth edition went to print in 1989.
        After graduating from law school, Mr. Shemel worked as an assistant corporation counsel for New York City in the late 1940's and then as a lawyer for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
        He joined the United Artists Corporation in 1953. As a vice president of MGM-U.A. and legal counsel to United Artists, Mr. Shemel worked in the company's New York office providing legal assistance to its record companies and subsidiaries. He retired in 1983.
        He is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, the former Shirley Reis; two daughters, Barbara Cushing of Berkeley, Calif., and Halimah McGee of Costa Mesa, Calif., and six grandchildren.
