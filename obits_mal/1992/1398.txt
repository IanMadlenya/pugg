        Joseph Kaliff, a caricaturist and syndicated Broadway columnist, died on Friday at the Veterans Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kaliff died of heart failure, said a nephew, George Hashim.
        Over the years Mr. Kaliff sketched from live sittings hundreds of politicians, including Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson, and performers like Grace Kelly, Edward G. Robinson, Tyrone Power, Marilyn Monroe, Gregory Peck and John Wayne.
        Mr. Kaliff was born in Fall River, Mass. He moved to New York in the 1930's and attended the Brown Art School and Pratt Institute, intending to be a portrait artist.
        While serving as an Army sergeant and editor of a daily newspaper for front-line troops in France during World War II, Mr. Kaliff developed his talent for caricature.
        During the 1950's and 1960's Mr. Kaliff wrote a syndicated column, "Magic Carpet Over Broadway," which appeared in over 90 weeklies across the country. He was also the founder, first president and director of the Caricaturists Society of America.
        Mr. Kaliff's wife, Jean, died in 1979.
        There are no immediate survivors.
