        Lewis B. Funke, a retired drama editor and critic for The New York Times, died on Friday at Horton Memorial Hospital in Middletown, N.Y. He was 80 years old and lived in Blooming Grove, N.Y., and Delray Beach, Fla.
        He died of a heart attack and complications of pneumonia and kidney failure, his family said.
        For many years Mr. Funke wrote the Sunday theater column, News of the Rialto. "Inherit the Wind" and "Damn Yankees" were among the many shows he reviewed. He wrote a prescient magazine piece on "South Pacific," based on its Boston preview, before it became one of Broadway's all-time hits.
        As drama editor and assistant culture editor, he wrote about and supervised coverage of emerging performers and authors, Off Broadway's early days, Joseph Papp's Shakespeare series in Central Park and the Shakespeare Festival at Stratford, Conn. He interviewed legendary figures like the Lunts, Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. Eyewitness Account of Collision
        In 1959 he called in by radio an exclusive Page 1 account of a collision between the Queen Elizabeth and a freighter, which he witnessed as a passenger.
        Mr. Funke also wrote several books, including the best-selling "Gift of Joy" (Lippincott, 1965), written with Helen Hayes. Another of his books, "Actors Talk About Acting" (Random House, 1961), became a standard reference work.
        He began his 46-year at The Times as a sports correspondent for his Bronx high school for $1 a game. He later covered sporting events at New York University, where he graduated in 1932.
        After becoming a staff reporter, he switched from sports to movies and then to theater. He retired in 1973.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 54 years, the former Blanche Bier; a son, Michael, of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter, Phyllis Funke of Manhattan; a sister, Eleanor Goldman of Southbury, Conn., and Delray Beach, and two grandsons.
