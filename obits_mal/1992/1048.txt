        George Cherr, a longtime New York State housing official who supervised the construction of Co-op City, the nation's largest subsidized housing project, died on Thursday at the Masonic Nursing Home in Utica, N.Y. He was 97 years old and until recently lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a series of strokes, his family said.
        In 1942 Mr. Cherr was appointed the chief of the Construction and Engineering Department in the State Division of Housing. Years later Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller promoted him to Assistant Commissioner of Housing, the position he held until his retirement in 1968.
        His state service was extended three years beyond the mandatory retirement age of 70 so he could oversee the first phase of Co-op City in the Bronx. Among the many other projects he supervised over the years were Starrett City, Rochdale Village and the Warbasse Houses.
        Mr. Cherr was born in Manhattan. He was on the Morris High School tennis doubles team that won the citywide championship in 1912.
        He earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, now Polytechnic University, in 1918. But he missed the graduation ceremony to join the Navy, where he served as an officer on trans-Atlantic ships at the end of World War I. Years later his alma mater honored him as a distinguished alumnus.
        After leaving the Navy, he started his own general construction company, based in Manhattan.
        Mr. Cherr was a longtime member and officer in the Masons.
        His wife of 69 years, the former Clara Friedman, died in 1990.
        He is survived by two daughters, Arline Friedman of Clifton, N.J., and Ellen Samuels of New Hartford, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
