        Gerald A. Gura, the president and chief executive of CWT Specialty Stores in New England, died on June 19 at Sturdy Memorial Hospital in Attleboro, Mass. He was 57 years old and lived in Sharon, Mass.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Gura formed CWT in 1982 by leading a management buyout of the Cherry & Webb and Touraine store divisions of the Outlet Company. He then merged the divisions and turned the new CWT into a rapidly growing chain of women's specialty shops that now has 54 stores.
        He was born in Detroit and graduated from the Walsh Institute there.
        Surviving are his wife of 37 years, the former Arlene Binder; two daughters, Gabrielle Gura-Gold of Hopkinton, Mass., and Ila Gura of Boston; a son, Jason Gura of Boston, and two grandchildren.
