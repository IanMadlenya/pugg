        Harry L. Hansen, a retired professor at Harvard Business School who was a major figure in the development of advanced business programs throughout the world, died on Monday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 80 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        Professor Hansen died of cancer, said James Aisner, a Harvard Business School spokesman.
        A member of the Harvard faculty for more than four decades, Professor Hansen helped develop management seminars and business schools in the Far East, the Asian subcontinent and Europe. His work also led to the establishment of schools of business at both Oxford and Cambridge universities in the 1980's.
        Professor Hansen was born in Manhattan and graduated from Haverford College in 1933. He earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard in 1935 and a doctorate in 1939.
        He became a full professor at Harvard in 1949 and was named the school's first Malcolm P. McNair Professor of Marketing in 1965.
        Professor Hansen retired from Harvard in 1977 and became dean of the Institut pour l'Etude des Methodes de Direction de l'Entreprise in Lausanne, Switzerland until 1981. He then taught marketing for five years as a distinguished professor at the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de la Empresa, in Barcelona, Spain.
        He received many honors, including the Distinguished Service Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Harvard Business School.
        Professor Hansen is survived by his wife, Carolyn; a son, Jeffrey, of Bedford Village, N.Y; a daughter, Carolyn Doughtie, of Sharpsburg, Ga., and two grandsons.
