        Correction:  October 12, 1992, Monday
        An obituary last Monday about William L. McGuire, a Long Island lawyer, misstated the name of a law firm where he worked and his relationship to it. In 1965, he was a founding partner of Graham & McGuire in New York City. In 1973, he left the firm to join Garcia Sporting Goods in Teaneck, N.J., where he became president in 1978. When he returned to the law firm in the early 1980's, its name was Graham, Campaign & McCarthy.
