        Maximilian Becker, a literary agent who produced several Broadway plays in the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of kidney failure, said his wife, Yvonne.
        Mr. Becker was born in Cairo and immigrated to the United States in 1929, intending to become a concert pianist. But he broke his wrists in an automobile accident shortly after arriving in New York City and decided to become a literary agent. He represented such writers as Ladislas Farago and Georges Simenon.
        In 1947 Mr. Becker, as a co-producer of the Jacques Deval play "Bathsheba," enticed James Mason, the English film star, and his wife, the actress Pamela Kellino, to make their American debuts as King David and Bathsheba.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Royce, of Manhattan.
