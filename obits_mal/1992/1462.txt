        Taggart Whipple, an antitrust lawyer who was a longtime partner in the Manhattan-based firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, died on Thursday at his home in Oyster Bay, L.I. He was 80 years old.
        He died of cancer of the prostate, said Margaret Whipple, his daughter-in-law of St. Charles, Ill.
        Taggart Whipple joined the Davis, Polk firm in 1938, became a partner in 1950, after a stint in the Army in Italy in World War II, and was a partner at the time of his death. He continued going to work, in the firm's midtown Manhattan headquarters, until two months ago.
        Over the years, he regularly advised many corporations, including Exxon, Texas Instruments and United Shoe Machinery, on antitrust questions.
        Mr. Whipple argued cases in court and before the Federal Trade Commission and wrote numerous memorandums on aspects of antitrust law. In 1942, he helped represent Standard Oil of New Jersey, which is now Exxon, in hearings held by Harry S. Truman, then a Democratic Senator from Missouri, who was looking into accusations of industrial mismanagement in the war effort.
        He was a director of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Vassar College, a trustee of New York University, the New York Institute of Fine Arts and the New York University Law Center Foundation, and vice chairman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
        Mr. Whipple, who was born in Manchester, N.H., graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, N.H., earned a bachelors' degree from Harvard College in 1934 and a law degree from New York University in 1938.
        Mr. Whipple is survived by his wife, the former Katharine G. Brewster, to whom he was married in 1941; two sons, Hugh W. of St. Charles and George S. of Aspen, Colo.; a daughter, Christine Farrington of Portland, Ore., and four grandchildren.
