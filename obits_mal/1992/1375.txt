        William E. P. Doelger, the last president of Peter Doelger Inc., died at his home on Thursday in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 91 years old.
        He died of natural causes, family members said.
        A graduate of Princeton University, Mr. Doelger ran Peter Doelger Inc., which was named for his grandfather, until its liquidation in 1961. The business began as a brewing company in the 1850's, and Mr. Doelger developed the original brewery property in Manhattan, the block bounded by Sutton Place, East 55th and East 56th Streets, and First Avenue, into luxury apartment buildings and the Town Tennis Club.
        Two years after the family brewery was liquidated in 1961, Mr. Doelger retired to Palm Beach.
        He is survived by his wife, Josephine Warren Cole Doelger, of West Palm Beach; three sons, Peter and William of Boston and Thomas of Seattle; one daughter, Charlotte Bonmartini of Wilmington, Del., and six grandchildren. Mr. Doelger's first wife, Margaret Taylor, died in 1986.
