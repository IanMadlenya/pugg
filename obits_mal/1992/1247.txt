        Koca Popovic, a former Chief of the General Staff, Foreign Minister and Vice President of Yugoslavia under Tito, died Thursday at the military hospital in Belgrade. He was 84 years old and lived in Belgrade and in Dubrovnik, Croatia.
        His death was reported yesterday in the United States. The scion of a wealthy Serbian banking family, Mr. Popovic turned to Communism early, became a hero of the Partisan fighters in World War II and rose to enter Tito's inner circle. Student unrest and demands for reform prompted him to resign in 1972 in disagreement with Tito's refusal to change his authoritarian ways.
        He was educated in Switzerland and France and graduated from the Sorbonne. As a young man, he showed an interest in Surrealist poetry. He went to Spain as an artillery captain in the Republican army during the Spanish Civil War, an experience that trained him for guerrilla warfare under Tito.
        He was Chief of Staff from 1945 to 1953 when he became Foreign Minister. As Vice President, he was nominally the No. 2 official of the Tito Government that ruled federated Yugoslavia.
        After his falling out with Tito, he steered clear of politics and wrote his memoirs, to be published only after his death. His reputation and popularity was such that he remained generally immune from criticism even after breaking with his former comrades.
