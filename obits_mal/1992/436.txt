        He died after a brief illness, his family said.

        Mr. McMorris practiced briefly in New York and then in Philadelphia. He returned to New York in 1941 to join the Manhattan firm of Reavis & McGrath, a forerunner of Fulbright & Jaworski. He retired as a senior partner in 1966 because of impaired vision. He became blind six years later.
        After his retirement, he served as a trustee and secretary of the board of the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, of which he was a trustee emeritus.
        Mr. McMorris is survived by a daughter, Mary Amelia McMorris of Princeton and London; a son, Howard McMorris 2d of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
