        Rick Sklar, whose programming made WABC in New York the most popular radio station in North America, died at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan on Monday. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Sklar died from complications after minor surgery but the exact cause of death is not known, a spokesman from his company said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Sklar was a vice president of the Interep Radio Store in New York, a national media-consulting concern that brings together the advertising inudstry and radio stations around the country. Top 40's Early Days
        Mr. Sklar was a leading force in the early days of rock-and-roll Top 40 radio. He was a native of Brooklyn and began his career as a disk jockey at WPAC-AM in Patchogue, L.I., shortly after graduating from New York University.
        From 1955 through 1962, he handled promotion and programming at two New York AM stations that began Top 40 radio: WINS, now an all-news station, and WMGM, which later became WHN; WEVD has that spot on the dial today.
        He was recruited as program director for WABC's Top 40 show in 1962. He nurtured radio personalities -- Bruce (Cousin Brucie) Morrow among them -- who became legendary.
        Mr. Sklar remained as WABC's program director until 1977, when he became vice president of programming for ABC Radio. He was an adjunct professor at St. John's University in Jamaica, Queens, and the author of an autobiography, "Rocking America: How the All-Hit Radio Stations Took Over America" (St. Martin's Press, 1984).
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sydelle Helfgott; his mother, Cecille, of Manhattan; a son, Scott, of Sausalito, Calif.; a daughter, Holly, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Ruth Sklar of Manhattan.
