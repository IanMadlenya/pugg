        John R. Platt, a physicist and biophysicist, died Wednesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 74 years old and had homes in Cambridge and Woods Hole, Mass.
        He died of complications from a brain tumor, said a son, Dr. Terry Platt.
        From 1965 until his retirement in 1977, he was professor of physics and associate director of the Mental Health Research Institute at the University of Michigan. From 1945 to 1965, he taught at the University of Chicago.
        His areas of research included molecular biophysics, the biophysics of vision and perception, and social trends. Pondering the future, he once argued that "the world has become too dangerous for anything less than utopias." Drew Wide Attention
        In 1971 he drew wide attention with an analysis of advances in social science. The study, conducted with two political scientists, concluded that the most important social research in the preceding four decades had tended to emerge from large groups of scholars working in major intellectual centers. The authors contended that future financing for social research should therefore be concentrated in a small number of regional centers.
        Professor Platt's books included "Step to Man" (John Wiley & Sons, 1966) and "The Excitement of Science" (Houghton Mifflin, 1962).
        Professor Platt was born in Jacksonville, Fla. He earned a bachelor of science from Northwestern University in 1936, when he was 18, and a doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1941.
        He was married to Ann Tammela in 1941. She died in 1973.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Elizabeth King Balliett, to whom he was married in 1979; two sons from his first marriage, Terry of Rochester and Christopher of Bethesda, Md.; two stepdaughters, Julie L. Balliett of Accord, N.Y., and Blue Balliett Klein of Chicago; a stepson, Will K. Balliett of Manhattan, and nine grandchildren.
