        Stanley C. Myers, founder of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation and a prominent civic figure in South Florida for more than 60 years, died Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach. He was 87 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        Mr. Myers died of cancer, said his daughter, Judy Gilbert-Gould of Miami.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Myers moved to Miami in 1925 after graduating from Fordham Law School. Soon afterward, he helped found the law firm Myers, Kaplan, Kenin, Levinson & Richards, which was among the most prominent in South Florida for many years. He was also a founder of the Dade County Bar Association.
        In 1938 he brought together representatives of several local Jewish organizations to found the Greater Miami Federation, which raises money for all Jewish groups in the area.
        Mr. Myers was a four-time president and longtime board member of the Federation and served as president of the National Council of Jewish Federations from 1946 to 1950. He was active with the American Red Cross and in 1946 was the first president of the Community Chest, the precursor of the United Way.
        In addition to his daughter, Mr. Myers is survived by his wife of 63 years, Martha; a son, Kenneth M. Myers of Miami; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
