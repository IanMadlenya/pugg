        Armando Balloffet, who had a career ranging over five decades as a hydraulics engineer, teacher and consultant on three continents, died on Thursday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 74 years old and had lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., since 1955.
        His family said he died of a heart illness.
        A native of Argentina, Mr. Balloffet came to this country in 1955 and had since been associated with TAMS Consultants Inc. in Manhattan.
        Mr. Balloffet taught hydraulics as an adjunct professor at the Columbia University School of Engineering from shortly after his arrival in New York until until five years ago.
        Mr. Balloffet was one of the international experts assisting the Yacireta Water Resources Project between Argentina and Paraguay. Taking shape in a vast drainage system in the northern reaches of the Parana River, it involves major dam construction. Mr. Balloffet was reviewing the hydraulic designs for the project.
        His projects for TAMS Consultants in this country covered hurricane protection for Jamaica Bay in New York and flood-control and tidal studies for the Hackensack River in New Jersey.
        Mr. Balloffet was born in Mendoza and received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in civil engineering from the University of Buenos Aires. Before he came to this country, he was a partner in a local consulting concern and an associate professor of hydraulics at his alma mater.
        Mr. Balloffet is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Circe Nelida de Rioja; four daughters, Nelly, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., Cristina B. Carr of Manhattan, Ines B. Brown of Tucson, Ariz., and Ana B. Hofmann of Bedford Hills, N.Y.; three sons, Armando F. of Fort Collins, Colo., Javier, of Belmont, Mass., and Claudio, of New Castle, N.Y., and 15 grandchildren.
