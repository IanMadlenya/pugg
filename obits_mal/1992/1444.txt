        Luis Salazar, a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Public Health, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 27 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Salazar died of leukemia, according to the School of Public Health, which announced his death yesterday.
        Mr. Salazar had been a field-work coordinator and research assistant in the AIDS Research Unit of the School of Public Health since 1990. He was part of a team of researchers doing an eight-year study of the effects of AIDS on gay men and lesbians in New York.
        A native of San Francisco, Mr. Salazar was a professional dancer before, during, and after he earned a bachelor's degree from California State University at Long Beach in 1988.
        Two years ago he retired from dance to devote himself to AIDS research. He was a member of Act-Up.
        Mr. Salazar is survived by his parents, Jose and Yolanda Salazar, of San Francisco, and his companion, Jon Kinnally, of Manhattan.
