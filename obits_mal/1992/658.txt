        Eugene S. Johnson, a leading spokesman for the oil industry in New York for 30 years, died at his home in New York on Friday. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Johnson died after surgery for a malignant brain tumor, said his wife, Sarah Wallace Johnson.
        From 1976 until earlier this month when he became ill, Mr. Johnson ran a public relations agency that bore his name. He was the New York representative of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association, and was a prominent spokesman for the industry through the two oil crises of the 1970's. He also represented a number of individual oil companies and other corporations.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Johnson is survived by three sisters, Beverly Goldstein of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Suzzanne O'Connell and Patricia Bamford, both of Alexandria, Va., and a brother, Peter, of New York City.
