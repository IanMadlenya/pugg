        H. Paul Warwick, a retired advertising executive, died on Sunday at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida. He was 98 and lived in Boca Raton.
        He died after surgery on a fractured hip, his son, John, said.
        Mr. Warwick founded the Warwick & Legler advertising agency in Manhattan in 1939 and was chief executive until his retirement in 1964. He was succeeded by his son, who headed the firm, now known as Warwick Baker & Fiore, until 1985.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Warwick moved to Boca Raton in 1965. In his later years, Mr. Warwick, whose hearing was impaired, worked with Audrey Greenwald, a speech pathologist, on her book "Lip Reading Made Easy," which was published by the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf in Washington in 1984.
        In addition to his son, John, of Quogue, L.I., Mr. Warwick is survived by a daughter, Mary Louise Eaton of Pleasantville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
