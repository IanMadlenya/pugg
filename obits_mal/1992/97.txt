        Dr. Anthony N. B. Garvan, an architectural historian, died on Friday at Chestnut Hill Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 74 years old and lived in Spring House, Pa.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Beatrice.
        Dr. Garvan was born in Raquette Lake, N.Y., and earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Yale University. He was the first chairman of the historic preservation department at the University of Pennsylvania. Later, he was president of the New York State Preservation League.
        His book "Architecture and Town Planning in Colonial Connecticut," which pioneered the use of aerial surveys, was awarded the annual gold medal of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1952.
        In 1965, Dr. Garvan planned the restoration of Morven Park in Leesburg, Va., a Greek Revival house on 1,200 acres of formal gardens, farmland and woods. Opened to the public in 1967, Morven Park was the home of Westmoreland Davis, who was governor of Virginia from 1918 to 1922.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Garvan is survived by a son, Anthony N. B. Garvan Jr. of Ambler, Pa.; five daughters, Kathleen Franks of Petaluma, Calif., Brady Brown of Ambler, Nichola Garvan of Ardmore, Pa., Christina Bonn of Stevenson, Md., and Blake Monath of Frederick, Md.; four stepdaughters, Louise W. Lippincott of Pittsburgh, Deborah L. Mattsson of London, Frances Thompson of Ringoes, N.J., and Elizabeth Rosen of Los Angeles, and 19 grandchildren.
