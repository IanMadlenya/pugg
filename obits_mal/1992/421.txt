        Tom Kahn, former international affairs director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and a longtime civil rights advocate, died on Saturday at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Kahn died of complications resulting from AIDS, said a statement issued by the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        Mr. Kahn was a central figure in organizing the aid that the labor federation channeled to the Polish trade union Solidarity in 1981. The union was being suppressed by the Polish Government at the time, and money and equipment were being smuggled to it. He also worked closely with leaders of other free unions as they sprang up in the nations of the deteriorating Soviet bloc in the late 1980's. Planned 1963 March
        Mr. Kahn, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Howard University in 1961. He became an aide to the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin and drafted the plan for the 1963 March on Washington.
        He also helped develop the 1960's theme "From Protest to Politics," which emphasized a need for labor and civil rights groups to achieve an integrated society together. It brought him and Mr. Rustin into conflict with black-power advocates, whom they shunned as separatists.
        Mr. Kahn became an assistant to the labor federation's president, George Meany, in 1973 and then served Mr. Meany's successor, Lane Kirkland, in the same role. He began to act as the federation's envoy to unions abroad and in 1986 was formally appointed international affairs director, a position from which he retired on disability in March.
        Mr. Kahn is survived by a sister, Rosemary Colville of San Luis Obispo, Calif. His companion was Alain Fournier of Silver Spring.
