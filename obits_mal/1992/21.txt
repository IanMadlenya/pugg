        Martin L. Scheiner, an inventor of electronic medical devices, entrepreneur and supporter of social causes, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
        He was 69 years old and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y. He died of leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Scheiner founded Electronics for Medicine in 1950, and as its president and research director he developed many sophisticated instruments. They included the first cardiac monitor for operations, a recovery-room patient monitor that was the precursor of today's intensive care equipment and a physiological recording system used in Nobel-Prize-winning work in cardiac catheterization.
        He wrote and lectured on medical uses of electronics and received an honorary doctorate from New York Medical College.
        His company, in Pleasantville, grew to 700 employees. When Honeywell Inc. bought it in 1979, he shared more than $1 million of his profit with the workers.
        In his retirement, he combined his interests in technology, scuba diving and travel to develop devices for underwater photography and took pictures to illustrate children's books written by his wife, Ann McGovern.
        Born in the Bronx, he grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and graduated from Columbia University.
        His first wife, the former Jane Barsky, died in 1968. He is survived by his second wife; a daughter, Ann of Silver Spring, Md.; three sons, Charles of White Plains, Peter of Portland, Ore., and Jim of Tortola, British Virgin Islands; two sisters, Olga Coren of Fort Lee, N.J., and Barbara Hooper of Philadelphia, and three grandchildren.
