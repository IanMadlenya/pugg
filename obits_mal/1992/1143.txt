        Timothy Egan Lenahan, an architect who had practiced with Robert A. M. Stern, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 34 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.
        He died of complications from AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Lenahan was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Yale University. From 1984 to 1989, he worked for Mr. Stern on projects like the 222 Berkeley Street office tower in Boston, Kol Israel Synagogue in Brooklyn and the Ohrstrom Library at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. Later, he practiced independently.
        He is survived by his mother, Lois of Locust Valley, L.I., and three sisters, Elizabeth of Manhattan, Nancy Gourley of Bryn Mawr and Kathryn L. Perkins of Millerton, N.Y. His father, Edward P., who died four years ago, had been the publisher of Fortune magazine.
