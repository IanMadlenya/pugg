        Max Miller, an award-winning director of network television programs and documentary films, died on Saturday at the North Hollywood Medical Center in Studio City, Calif. He was 74 years old and lived in Studio City.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        In television's early days, Mr. Miller worked as a staff director for NBC in New York for a dozen years. He directed the original "Today" show, starring Dave Garroway, and "Wide, Wide World." After leaving NBC, he worked on shows for CBS and ABC, including "Camera 2."
        He developed the early programming on Channel 13 in New York before it became part of PBS. He won an Emmy Award for directing a program on teen-age suicide narrated by Milton Berle.
        Mr. Miller began his career as the director and producer of a summer tent theater in Rockaway, Queens. Among his actors was Sidney Lumet, who later became a film maker.
        In 1964, Mr. Miller moved to California, where he directed summer theater in Venice, then started Avanti Films and Motivational Media to produce documentary and educational films.
        His films focused on social and political issues, including racism, drug abuse, alcoholism and smoking. He recruited such stars as Robert Culp, Sal Mineo, Dick Van Dyke and Sonny Bono to donate their services.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Sylvia Latterman; a son, Jeffrey, of Studio City, and a daughter, Susan Miller London of Manhattan.
