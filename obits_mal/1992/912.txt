        Bishop Thomas F. Reilly, a Boston-born Roman Catholic prelate who defied the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic, died on Tuesday in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He was 83 years old and had lived at a residence for priests for more than a year.
        He died of cancer, his brother said in Washington.
        Until about 10 years ago, Bishop Reilly, a member of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, served in San Juan, an agricultural center in the western part of the Dominican Republic. He had studied at the Redemptorist seminary at Esopus, N.Y., and was ordained in 1933. A specialist in papal encyclicals on social issues, he also had a doctorate in canon law.
        He was an army chaplain in Alaska and the Philippines in World War II and then in Japan before joining a Redemptorist community in the Dominican Republic in 1947. He was consecrated bishop in San Juan nine years later. Condemned Arrests
        In 1960, Gen. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina, who had exercised virtually total control of the Dominican Republic for nearly 30 years, cracked down on insurgents. Bishop Reilly joined the country's other five bishops in reading a pastoral letter in all churches condemning the arrest and imprisonment of thousands of people.
        The gesture angered the Trujillo Government. As the confrontation grew, a mob wrecked Bishop Reilly's residence on April 9, 1961, and the Government accused him of leading a terrorist conspiracy. The Bishop sought refuge in the capital with priests and nuns from his diocese but was placed under house arrest.
        When General Trujillo was assassinated in May 1961, the police jailed the Bishop. He was soon freed -- with apologies -- and he resumed his duties in San Juan.
        Surviving is his brother, Judge Gerard Reilly of Washington, a former Chief Judge and now a Senior Judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
