        C. Victor Raiser 2d, finance co-chairman of Gov. Bill Clinton's Presidential campaign, was killed Thursday when a small plane carrying him on a fishing vacation crashed in Alaska. He was 52 years old and lived in Washington.
        The aircraft, a de Havilland Beaver floatplane, went down near the town of Dillingham, 300 miles southwest of Anchorage, killing Mr. Raiser as well as his 22-year-old son, R. Montgomery Raiser, and three other passengers. A sixth passenger and the pilot were injured.
        Mr. Raiser (pronounced RAY-zer), a lawyer, business executive and former finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was the Clinton campaign's finance chairman for the Middle Atlantic States and one of its 12 national finance co-chairmen. On learning Friday of his death, the campaign's press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, described him as "a major player" in the Clinton organization.
        Mr. Raiser was born in Indianapolis and earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton University in 1962 and a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1965.
        He was affiliated with the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue and was chairman of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation of Washington and vice chairman of the Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corporation of Jackson, Miss.
        Mr. Raiser is survived by his wife, the former Mary Eleanor Millonzi; a daughter, Mary Van Schuyler Raiser of Washington; his parents, Sheldon A. and Alta Mae Raiser of Tryon, N.C., and a brother, Robert E. Raiser of Burlington, Vt.
