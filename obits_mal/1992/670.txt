        Jerrold S. Maxmen, a psychiatrist, author and associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 50 years old.
        He died of a digestive disorder, said Carl D. Brandt, his agent and a friend of the family.
        Among Dr. Maxmen's books were "Post-Physician Era: Medicine in the 21st Century" (John Wiley & Sons, 1976), "A Good Night's Sleep" (Norton, 1981), "The New Psychiatry" (Morrow, 1985) and "Essential Psychopathology" (Norton, 1986).
        Dr. Maxmen received his medical training at Wayne State University in Detroit and did his residency at Yale University. He had also taught at Dartmouth College and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary B. Maxmen, a costume designer; his parents, Harold and Ethel Maxmen of Detroit, and a brother, Robert L. Maxmen of Longmeadow, Mass.
