        Norman C. Stack, a leading international numismatic expert and a managing partner of the oldest and largest rare-coin dealer in the United States, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 64 years old and lived in Shelter Island, L.I.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Stack was a fourth-generation member of Stack's Rare Coins in Manhattan. The family firm began as a foreign currency exchange in 1858, and by 1934, it was appraising and auctioning rare coins, medals and paper money.
        Among the major transactions that Mr. Stack and his firm arranged were the sales of Yale University's legendary gold Brasher Doubloon for $650,000 in 1981, Amon G. Carter Jr.'s collection for $8.5 million in 1985 and a set from the King of Siam's collection for more than $2 million.
        Stack's built the J. K. Lilly collection, eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution under an act of Congress. The firm also handled the Louis E. Eliasberg Collection, which is known as the only complete collection of United States coins.
        Mr. Stack wrote three books, numerous articles and nearly 300 auction catalogues on coins.
        Mr. Stack, who was born in Wheeling, W. Va., grew up in Brooklyn. After completing high school in 1945, he entered the family business.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Elaine Jackson; a son, Ronald, of Hoboken; three daughters, Brenda Freed of Pepper Pike, Ohio; Diana Unger of East Meadow, L.I., and Claudia Strobing of East Hills, L.I.; his mother, Rose of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.
