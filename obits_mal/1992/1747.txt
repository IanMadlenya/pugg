        Dr. David M. Maeir, a former professor of pathology at Yeshiva University in New York and director general of Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem, died on Monday at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. He was 66 and had been a resident of Jerusalem since 1968.
        He died from injuries sustained when a car struck him on a Jerusalem street, said a spokesman for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in New York.
        Dr. Maeir, a native of New York City, was a chemistry graduate of Yeshiva University with a medical degree from the University of Ottawa School of Medicine. He joined the newly formed faculty of Yeshiva's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1958 and directed a teaching program in pathology.
        He was appointed director general of the Jerusalem institution in 1968. There, he oversaw a five-year development program and the construction of the new Shaare Zedek Medical Center. He retired as director general in 1982.
        In Israel, Dr. Maeir was a director of Bar Ilan University and a founding member of the Society of Law and Medicine. He also taught pathology at Hebrew University School of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sheila Stillman; a daughter, Alyssa Maeir; two sons, Aron, and Joshua, all of Jerusalem, and two grandchildren.
