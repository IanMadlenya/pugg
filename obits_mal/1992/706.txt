        John J. Martin, a senior vice president at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company and a national spokesman for the insurance industry, died on Sunday at his home in Suffield, Conn. He was 57 years old.
        He died after a 13-month battle with brain cancer, said Elizabeth Krupnick, a spokeswoman for Aetna.
        Mr. Martin spent virtually his entire professional career with Aetna. After graduating from the University of Massachusetts in 1958, he joined the company as an underwriter and went on to serve in various positions at the corporate headquarters in Hartford and in Aetna's field office in Denver. He served as vice president of corporate communications and was appointed president of the Personal Financial Security Division in 1988. He became senior vice president for marketing in 1990.
        Mr. Martin also served two terms as chairman of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade association, and was a member of numerous other organizations, including the American Insurance Association and the Insurance Association of Connecticut.
        Ronald E. Compton, the chairman of Aetna, said on Monday that Mr. Martin "regularly -- and almost gleefully -- took on all challengers among critics who misrepresented Aetna's views."
        He is survived by his wife, Carol; his mother, Marguerite of Middletown, R.I.; three children, John Jr. of Suffield, Christopher of Marshfield, Mass., and Laurie of Manhattan; a brother, the Rev. Charles of Boston, and a sister, Ellen Keller of Fridley, Minn.
