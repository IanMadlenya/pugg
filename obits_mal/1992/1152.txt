        David Hyatt, a former president of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, died on Tuesday at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco, his hometown. He was 76 years old.
        He died of complications of throat cancer, his wife, Lillian, said.
        Mr. Hyatt, who as a youth had witnessed cross burnings by the Ku Klux Klan in his native Ohio, joined the National Conference in 1954 as national director of public relations. He was promoted to vice president for public information in 1958, executive vice president in 1965 and president in 1973. He retired 10 years ago.
        He was also the first American to become president of the International Council of Christians and Jews, a post he assumed in 1978, and served two terms as a member of the United States Commission for Unesco. He was a founding sponsor of the Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry and a board member of the America-Israel Friendship League.
        Mr. Hyatt was born in Cleveland, where his great-grandfather William Gray Rose had been Mayor. He earned a bachelor's degree at Northwestern University and master's and doctoral degrees at Teachers College of Columbia University.
        He enlisted as an ambulance driver with the British Eighth Army in North Africa before the United States entered World War II and served there from 1941 to 1943. From 1943 to 1945 he was a lieutenant with the United States naval air corps.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by four daughters, Carol Hyatt-Parkhurst of Carmel Valley, Calif.; Ann Hyatt-Smith of White Plains; Ellen Hyatt of Sacramento, Calif., and Ellen Miriam of Pleasantville, N.Y.; a son, Larry Hyatt of Newark, Calif.; a brother, Hudson Hyatt of Cleveland, and five grandchildren.
