        Paul J. Hartman, professor emeritus at the Vanderbilt School of Law, died on Monday at the Helen Pate-Bain Health Care Center in Nashville. A resident of Nashville, he was 81 years old.
        The announcement from Vanderbilt said he had died after a lengthy illness brought on by two strokes and a heart attack.
        Professor Hartman was known nationally for his expertise on state taxation.
        He served for four years in the 1960's on an advisory group for a special judiciary subcommittee looking into state taxation of interstate commerce. The Congressional panel was known as the Willis committee after its chairman, Representative Edwin E. Willis, Democrat of Louisiana.
        A native of Circleville, W.Va., Professor Hartman earned his master's and doctorate degrees in the law at Columbia University. He joined the law faculty at Vanderbilt University in 1949 and served as acting dean of law in 1964-65. In 1968 he received the Thomas Jefferson Award for "extraordinary contributions" to the university and its faculty.
        The Vanderbilt student bar association cited him as "Outstanding Professor of the Year" in 1975, the year before he reached emeritus status.
        Professor Hartman is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Meta Marshall, and two sisters, Mary Hartman Judy and Levi Hartman Lance, both of Franklin, W.Va.
