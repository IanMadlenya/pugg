        Prof. Selden Daskam Bacon, former director of the Center of Alcohol Studies at Rutgers University, died Sunday in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where he had retired. He was 84.
        He died of a heart attack, the center said.
        Dr. Bacon was an expert on alcohol abuse, writing many studies on it. He directed the center at Rutgers from 1962 to 1975, after which he continued there as a professor of sociology.
        A native of Pleasantville, N.Y., Dr. Bacon received his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Yale University. He taught in the department of sociology at Pennsylvania State College before returning to Yale as an instructor in 1939. By 1956, at the age of 47, he was appointed a full professor.
        He worked at the Laboratory of Applied Physiology, later the Center of Alcohol Studies, and was its director from 1950 to 1962. During those years, he also directed Yale University's Summer School of Alcohol Studies, the first of its kind.
        Under his guidance, the center opened the Yale Plan Clinics, the first public clinics for alcoholics. Dr. Bacon developed the idea of opening such clinics after doing a survey as a young sociologist in which he found that most of the people in jail were there for drunkenness.
        In 1962 he moved to the center at Rutgers, which he helped become a leader in alcohol research, obtaining considerable Federal support to enlarge the scope of the programs there. Dr. Bacon retired from the faculty in 1980 but remained a strong presence in the field.
        His father, Selden Bacon, was a prominent New York lawyer. His mother, Josephine Dodge Daskam Bacon, was the author of many novels and short stories.
        Dr. Bacon is survived by his wife, Margaret Keller Bacon; a daughter, Anna Bacon Robinson; two sons, Selden D. Bacon Jr. and Michael McA. Bacon; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
