        William J. Weatherby, a British journalist and novelist who spent much of his career in the United States, died on Wednesday at Saint Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 62 years old and lived in Poughkeepsie.
        He died of cancer, an associate, Robert Silverstein, said.
        During a long career in the United States, Mr. Weatherby was a columnist and feature writer for The Guardian and several other publications, including The Sunday Times of London. He was also a senior editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux in the 1970's and American editor for Penguin Books in the late 1960's.
        Born in a suburb of Manchester, England, Mr. Weatherby was hired by The Guardian in the early 1960's and sent to the United States to cover the civil rights movement. Mr. Weatherby developed lifelong friendships with James Baldwin, Bayard Rustin and other major figures of the time.
        Mr. Weatherby's books included a novel, "Love in the Shadows"; "Conversations With Marilyn," about Marilyn Monroe; "James Baldwin, Artist on Fire" and "Salmon Rushdie, Sentenced to Death."
        Mr. Weatherby also edited "The Negro in New York: An Informal Social History," a 1930's research project under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration published in 1967 by the New York Public Library and Oceana Publications.
        He is survived by a brother, Thomas, who lives in England.
