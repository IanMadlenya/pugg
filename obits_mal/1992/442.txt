        Earl Bernard Doolin, a co-founder of the Frito Company, died April 1 at the South Place nursing home in Athens, Tex. He was 86 years old and lived in on his ranch near Montalba in East Texas.
        He died of a stroke and a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Doolin, his brother Elmer and their parents, Charles Bernard and Daisy Dean Doolin, popularized corn chips, which they adapted from a recipe they had bought from a restaurant worker for $100. Their first factory was their San Antonio home, where in 1932 they started deep-frying strips of corn dough formed with a hand-operated device made from a potato ricer.
        The snack caught on, and as demand rose Mr. Doolin designed machinery for mass production and obtained several patents for the equipment. He was a board member of the company, its executive secretary and vice president in charge of engineering and production.
        The company expanded into international markets. Its stock was offered to the public in 1952, and the next year he sold his shares. He took up dairy farming and later switched to raising beef cattle, which he continued until his death. The company later became Frito-Lay and is currently a subsidiary of Pepsico.
        Mr. Doolin was born in Kansas City, Mo., and grew up in San Antonio.
        Surviving are his wife of 41 years, the former Carrol B. Bourland, and a daughter, Colleen J. Doolin of Dallas.
