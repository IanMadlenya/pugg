        Thomas B. Nolan, who is credited with shaping the modern missions of the United States Geologic Survey in his 68-year career at the Federal agency, died on Sunday at the George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 91 years old and lived in Washington.
        He died of a pulmonary embolism, the agency said yesterday.
        Dr. Nolan started working at the Geologic Survey in 1924 as a junior geologist studying the Mother Lode gold region in California. He served as the agency's assistant director from 1944 to 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower promoted him to director. As director, he led such ambitious and sophisticated projects as evaluating the effects of underground nuclear tests and the photographic mapping of the moon.
        He stepped down from that post in 1965 but continued doing research for the survey until his death.
        Dr. Nolan established programs to train astronauts in geology, study public health dangers from naturally occurring chemicals and research earthquakes and volcanoes. He also created a network to collect data on water resources and the evaluation of offshore mineral deposits and mineral resources in wilderness areas.
        Mountains, minerals and fossils were named for Dr. Nolan. His honors included a prize from the International Geologic Congress, a medal from Columbia University, a commendation from President Ronald Reagan and awards from Princeton University, the Tokyo Geographical Society and Department of the Interior.
        Dr. Nolan was born in Greenfield, Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in metallurgy at Yale University in 1921 and a doctorate in geology there in 1924.
        His wife, the former Mabelle Orleman, died in 1983. He is survived by his son, Thomas Jr., of Escondido, Calif., and two grandsons.
