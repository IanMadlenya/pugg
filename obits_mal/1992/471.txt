        After naval service in World War II, Mr. Davis returned to television with programs including "The Actors Studio Show," "The Play's the Thing" and "The Prudential Family Playhouse." In the early 1950's, he was named the executive producer for dramatic productions for CBS and became the supervisor of NBC's "Producer's Showcase."
        He is survived by his wife.
