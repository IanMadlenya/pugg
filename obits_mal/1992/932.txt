        Juan Suarez Botas, an illustrator, graphic designer and film maker, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 34 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said his doctor, Paul Belman.
        Mr. Botas's illustrations appeared on the covers of Time, Fortune, U.S. News and World Report and other magazines. His drawings appeared in The New York Times, Vogue and other publications.
        Mr. Botas moved to the United States from Spain in 1977. He studied at Syracuse University and studied and worked with the graphic designer Milton Glaser. He had recently been directing a documentary about his AIDS treatment group, and its producer, Jonathan Demme, said he planned to complete it.
        He is survived by his companion, Billy Cole; his parents, Jose Juan Suarez and Marimen Botas of Gijon, Spain; and five sisters, Alacia, of Rome, and Gracia, Carmen, Maria and Ana, all of Gijon.
