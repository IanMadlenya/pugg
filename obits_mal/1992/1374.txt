        Richard Smart, a onetime Broadway performer who became the owner of the Parker Ranch on the island of Hawaii, one of the largest cattle ranches in the United States, died Thursday at his home on Oahu. He was 79 years old.
        A statement issued by the ranch said he had died of cancer, which had been discovered only in recent weeks.
        Mr. Smart's net worth, including his 235,000-acre ranch, was estimated at $400 million. One of his lawyers, Howard R. Green, said yesterday that "a great part" of the assets had been left to charities serving Hawaii. 2-Century Legacy
        Mr. Smart's ranch was founded by his great-great-great grandfather John Palmer Parker, an American who sailed to Hawaii in 1790 and was commissioned by King Kamehameha to round up wild cattle. As a reward, Mr. Parker was able to buy two acres of land for $10.
        From there the ranch expanded steadily, and at one time totaled 550,000 acres. Today it has more than 50,000 head of cattle and an annual production of at least 10 million pounds of beef.
        Mr. Smart was born in Hawaii and was reared both there and in California. As a young man he became a nightclub singer and later performed in Broadway plays, including "Two for the Show," "All for Love" and "The Merry Widow." In the 1940's he starred with Nanette Fabray in the Broadway production of "Bloomer Girl."
        Later in life he built a community theater in the town of Kamuela, on Hawaii Island, where until recently he performed in occasional productions. His most recent performance was in a one-man musical entitled, "Richard Smart Remembers."
        Mr. Smart's marriage in 1936 to Patricia Valerie Havens-Monteagle, a screen actress, ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons, Anthony Smart of Honolulu and Gilliard Smart, who lives in Oregon, and three grandchildren.
