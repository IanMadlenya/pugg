        Prof. Kurt H. Weil, a figure in early German aviation history and professor emeritus at Stevens Institute of Technology, died last Thursday at his home in Montclair, N.J. He was 96 years old.
        He was long associated with Prof. Hugo Junkers, the aircraft designer, and the Junkers Aviation Corporation in Dessau. There he worked, among other things, on the transport Ju-52, the all-metal, multi-engine aircraft incorporating the design concept of the modern, economical airliner.
        A pilot in World War I, he founded Junkers Iran airline in 1927 while a consultant to the Shah of Iran. In the late 1930's, he collaborated in England and Germany in the first successful efforts to convert internal-combustion engines to run on hydrogen as fuel.
        He came to this country in 1938 and worked with General Motors in World War II in redesigning the Grumman Wildcat fighter for mass production. After the war, he helped the Defense Department organize the Berlin Airlift.
        He joined Stevens in Hoboken, N.J., in 1957 as head of the mechanical engineering department and also was a visiting professor at the Technical University of Berlin. He received Stevens emeritus status in 1957 but continued to write and lecture until as recently as 1989, when he gave the General Electric Aviation Lecture at the National Air Space Museum in Washington.
        He is survived by a daughter, Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt of Manhattan, a professor of fine arts at New York University.
