        Walker Woods Stevenson, a retired investment banker and Wall Street broker, died on March 2 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 78 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J., and Nantucket, Mass.
        His family said he died after a brief illness.
        Mr. Stevenson, a native of Montclair, N.J., graduated from Princeton University in 1935. He then joined the investment banking and brokerage firm of Hemphill, Noyes, Graham, Parsons & Company, later Hemphill Noyes, a family business. In 1965, the firm became one of the units that eventually merged into Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking arm of American Express. He retired as a senior vice president and director in 1981 but remained a consultant at Shearson until last Christmas.
        He was a past president of Princeton's class of '35 and the Princeton National Alumni Association. He was a direct descendant of John Witherspoon, a signer of the Declaration of Independence who was a Princeton University president.
        He is survived by three daughters, Susan Badder of Baltimore, Sharon Griffith of Bedford, N.Y., and Lisa-Margaret Stevenson of Washington, and three grandchildren.
