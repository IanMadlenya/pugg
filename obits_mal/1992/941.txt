        Samuel F. Riskin, a retired chairman and chief executive of the Valley National Bancorp of Wayne, N.J., died Wednesday at Passaic General Hospital. A lifelong resident of Passaic, N.J., he was 85 years old.
        Mr. Riskin had been in a coma since he suffered a stroke in December, said Gerald H. Lipkin, the bank's current chairman and chief executive.
        Mr. Riskin's retirement in 1989 ended a 41-year association with the bank that began with his service as a director in 1948. He was named president of the bank in 1953. Under Mr. Riskin the bank grew from an institution with assets of $40 million into a bank holding company with $3 billion in assets.
        In 1989 Business Week magazine placed Valley National first in a comparison of return on assets of the nation's 200 largest commercial banks.
        Mr. Riskin attended Passaic High School, where in the 1920's he won several state tennis championships and was a member of the famed Passaic "wonder team," the school's basketball squad. The team won 159 consecutive games from 1919 to 1925, a record that has not been broken, and earned the teams a place in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield, Mass.
        Mr. Riskin earned bachelor's and law degrees at Rutgers University. He was a past president of the Passaic County Bar Association, the Passaic County Parks Commission, the Boys Club and the American Cancer Center. During his career Mr. Riskin was honored by the Passaic County chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for promoting equal employment opportunities in banking, and he was awarded the Prime Minister Golda Meir Medal for initiating bank purchases of Israel Bonds in the United States.
        Mr. Riskin is survived by his wife, Sylvia; a daughter, Louise of Manhattan; a son, Fredric of Warwick, N.Y.; a brother, Philip of Nutley, N.J., and one granddaughter.
