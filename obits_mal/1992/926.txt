        Simon Rosenzweig, a Manhattan lawyer who specialized in mental health and housing law, died on Sunday at White Plains Hospital. He was 86 years old and lived in White Plains.
        The immediate cause of his death was heart failure, and he had been suffering from heart and spine ailments, said his wife of 51 years, the former Margaret Lybolt.
        Mr. Rosenzweig spent much of his career practicing law on his own. He was born on the Lower East Side, grew up in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn and earned an A.B. degree from Cornell University in 1927 and a law degree from its law school.
        He was a former chairman of the Citizens Union Committee on City Rent Control, president of the Westchester Association of Hebrew Schools and member of the board of directors of the Westchester Association of Retarded Citizens.
        He is also survived by two children, Anne Singer of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Paul Rosenzweig of St. Louis, and four grandchildren.
