        Raphael Totah, a retired international rice trader and former executive of the Continental Grain Company in New York, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        A native of Egypt, Mr. Totah worked at his father's rice mill in Alexandria before settling in this country in the 1950's. He then spent 38 years with Continental Grain, retiring in 1987 as senior vice president and general manager of its rice division.
        Mr. Totah is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, the former Denise Hakim; a daughter, Sylvia Calabrese of Manhattan; two sons, Robert, of Stamford, Conn., and Philip, of Middletown, N.Y.; two brothers, Victor, of Paris, and Edouard, of Geneva, and three grandchildren.
