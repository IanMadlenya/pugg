        Correction:  February 8, 1992, Saturday
        An obituary on Jan. 24 about Edward Yorio, a professor at the Fordham University Law School, misidentified the firm where he once worked as a tax lawyer. It is White & Case. The obituary also misstated the location of the law school. It is in Manhattan.
