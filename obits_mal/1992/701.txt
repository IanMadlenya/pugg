        Born in Atlantic City of Russian immigrant parents, Mr. Green established the Motor Club of America and its subsidiary, the Motor Club of America Insurance Company, in the late 1920's after a brief stint as an accountant. Aided by his brothers, David and Samuel, Mr. Green built the company into a major insurer and auto-service agency in New Jersey and across the country. It branched out into the hospital-services industry in the late 1960's, building the New Jersey Rehabilitation Hospital in East Orange, N.J.
        In 1986, Mr. Green and his family sold their controlling interest in the Motor Club of America and the hospital.
        Mr. Green received numerous awards for his participation in charitable and civic associations.

He is survived by his daughter, Carol King, of Fort Lauderdale; his son, Robert, of Ocean Grove, N.J.; two brothers, David, of West Orange, and Samuel, of South Orange; a sister, Pauline Kenrick, of Philadelphia; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
