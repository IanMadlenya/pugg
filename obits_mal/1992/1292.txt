        William S. Chapin, a former general manager of the New York State Power Authority, died on Friday at the Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue, L.I. He was 88 years old and lived in Mastic Beach, L.I.
        He died of heart failure, his son Richard said.
        Mr. Chapin was a protege of the planner Robert Moses and, except for a short period in the 1940's, spent most of his career working for agencies that Mr. Moses headed. Mr. Chapin, who was the general manager of the Power Authority from 1954 to 1971 and for many years was also the chief engineer, supervised construction of the St. Lawrence and Niagara power projects.
        Mr. Chapin, a native of Chicopee, Mass., graduated from Northeastern University and held honorary degrees from Northeastern and Niagara Universities.
        He was named general manager of the Power Authority following Mr. Moses's appointment as chairman. Before that, he was a consulting engineer for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and an assistant director of the Office of New York City Construction Coordinator, where he was Mr. Moses's chief aide in planning expressways and parkways in the New York region.
        Mr. Chapin served as an officer in the Corps of Engineers during World War II and as chief of operations in the construction service in the China-Burma-India theater. Before going into the service, he spent two years as chief engineer of the Pittsburgh Regional Planning Association, working on the program that led to the rebuilding of the Golden Triangle, the central business district there. Mr. Chapin was also a consultant on highway projects in cities around the country and in South America.
        In addition to his son Richard, who lives in Blue Point, L.I., he is survived by his wife, Dorothy Powell Chapin; a daughter, Caroline Lash, of West Islip, L.I.; a son, Robert, of North Babylon, L.I.; 12 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
