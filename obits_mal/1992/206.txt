        Dr. Christopher P. Kales, a physician and a former professional ballet dancer and national figure skating competitor, died Jan. 23 at New York University Medical Center. He was 35 years old and was a resident of Manhattan.
        He died of encephalitis resulting from complications from AIDS, said Patrick M. Webb, his companion of 14 years.
        Dr. Kales was born in Chicago and grew up there and in Rockton, Ill. He learned ice skating as a teen-ager and became a gold medalist in competitions sponsored by the United States Figure Skating Association. He ranked eighth among senior men when he last competed in 1976.
        While teaching skating part time, he earned his bachelor's degree at Yale.  He then studied ballet for a year at the David Howard school, a prominent studio in Manhattan, before enrolling at Rush Medical College in Chicago.
        He took a break from his medical studies to perform with the Theater Ballet of Canada, based in Ottawa, in 1981 and 1982. He returned to Rush to finish his medical degree in 1984.
        He is survived by his parents, Mildred and Rudolph, of Chicago.
