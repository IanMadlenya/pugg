        Howard P. Krieger, a prominent New York City neurologist, died on Friday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Montauk.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Krieger, a medical teacher, researcher and clinician, was affiliated with Mount Sinai for more than 40 years. He trained there, did research, practiced medicine and since 1975 was a professor at its medical school.
        He also worked at Beth Israel Medical Center, serving as its chief of neurology from 1960-78 and since then as a consultant. He also had a private practice.
        In his 30's he did research on vision and eye movement, and in his 40's he worked on the neurological aspects of endocrinology, especially hypothalamic and pituitary function. He was the author or co-author of more than 70 published papers.
        Some of his research was in collaboration with his wife, the former Dorothy Terrace Marks. She was a leading medical scientist who headed Mount Sinai's endocrinology division and whose work won a prestigious Lasker award.
        Dr. Krieger was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Harvard in 1940, he earned a medical degree from the Long Island College of Medicine in 1944. He did his residency with the military, serving in World War II as a Navy ship doctor in the Pacific.
        His 25-year marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by a son, Dr. James Krieger of Seattle; a daughter, Dr. Nancy Krieger of Berkeley, Calif., and a sister, Ruth Holland of Miami.
