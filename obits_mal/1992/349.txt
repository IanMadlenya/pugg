        James R. Westman, a retired Rutgers University professor and biological and environmental scientist, died Feb. 25 at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 81 years old and lived in Marco Island, Fla.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Westman retired in 1974 after 24 years on the Rutgers faculty. Previously he was an aquatic biologist for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and studied fish in Chile. He was a senior marine biologist for New York State's Conservation Department in Freeport, L.I., and also served on the National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council.
        He was a consultant for Consolidated Edison and the Toms River Chemical Company, and studied the environmental effects of a power plant near Barnegat Bay, N.J., and of lagoon dredging and filling on the New Jersey coast.
        In recent years he wrote on the role of birds and mosquitoes in transmitting Eastern equine encephalitis, which can strike human beings. He also wrote a weekly outdoors column in The Plainfield Courier-News, now The Courier-News in Bridgewater, N.J., and also wrote "Why Fish Bite and Why They Don't" (Prentice-Hall, 1961).
        He was born in Pasadena, Calif., graduated from Brown University in 1932 and received a doctorate in biology and zoology from Cornell in 1941.
        His survivors include his wife of 52 years, the former Charlotte B. Jenney; two daughters, Elizabeth Mark of San Francisco and Virginia Snyder of Dartmouth, Mass., and a grandson.
