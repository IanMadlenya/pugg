        Eugene Kinkead, a staff writer and editor at The New Yorker magazine for 58 years, died on Saturday at the Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 86 years old and lived in Nyack, N.Y.
        Mr. Kinkead died of cancer, said a daughter, Gwen.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Kinkead grew up in Washington, and graduated from the University of Wisconsin. Harold Ross, the founder and first editor of the magazine, hired Mr. Kinkead as a writer in 1932. There, he shared an office with another junior member of the staff, William Shawn, who was later to succeed Mr. Ross as editor. Wrote Seven Books
        Mr. Kinkead wrote many articles for The Talk of The Town and also contributed profiles, fiction, light verse, poetry and other articles.
        Mr. Shawn recalled yesterday that Mr. Kinkead's great interest was nature and natural history, which led to many articles on those subjects in The New Yorker and other publications. It also inspired several of his seven books, including "Wilderness Is All Around Us: Notes of An Urban Naturalist," published in 1978 by E. P. Dutton, and "Central Park," published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1990.
        Mr. Kinkead, who was a Navy war correspondent during World War II, also wrote a study of the brainwashing of some American prisoners of war in the Korean War, "In Every War but One," published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1959. Numerous Writing Awards
        Mr. Kinkead won numerous writing awards, including the Benjamin Franklin Award of the University of Illinois for freelance magazine writing and the Christopher Literary Award for "In Every War but One."
        He is survived by his wife, Katharine; a son, Duncan, of Bloomington, Ind.; two daughters, Maeve and Gwen, both of Nyack, and seven grandchildren.
