        Elie Kedourie, a professor at the London School of Economics and an authority on the Middle East and nationalism, died on Monday at Washington Adventist Hospital, in Washington. He was 66 years old and lived in London.
        Professor Kedourie died of heart failure, said Charles Blitzer, director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. He had been a visiting fellow at the center since last fall.
        A naturalized British citizen who was born in Baghdad, Iraq, he wrote 12 books and numerous essays for journals and edited seven more books including five with his wife, Sylvia G. Haim.
        Professor Kedourie's books include two published this year, "Democracy and Arab Political Culture," by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and "Politics in the Middle East," by Oxford University Press. In addition, a ninth edition of his book "Nationalism" was reprinted in 1985 by Hutchinson Press.
        He is survived by his wife; three children, George, of Palma, Majorca; Michael and Helen, both of London, and four grandchildren.
