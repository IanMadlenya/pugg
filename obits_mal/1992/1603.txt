        Rosel H. Hyde, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, died Saturday at the Bethesda Retirement and Nursing Center in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 92 and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Hyde died of complications from a stroke, said a spokeswoman for the Washington law firm of Wilkinson, Barker, Knauer & Quinn, where he had been a partner.
        Mr. Hyde served under four Presidents as F.C.C. chairman. A staff member of the commission from its inception in 1934 and chairman from 1953 to 1969, Mr. Hyde played a significant role in establishing Federal policies on modern communications.
        A native of Downey, Idaho, he graduated from Utah Agricultural College (now Utah State University) and the George Washington University Law School. In 1928 he joined the Federal Radio Commission, the predecessor of the F.C.C.
        A Republican, he was appointed chairman by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. His reappointment by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, was the first time that a chairman of the commission was reappointed and the first time a President named a chairman from a different political party.
        Mr. Hyde retired under President Richard M. Nixon and joined the Washington law firm of Wilkinson, Cragun & Barker (later Wilkinson, Barker, Knauer & Quinn) as a partner.
        He is survived by his wife of 68 years, Mary Henderson Hyde; three sons, Rosel H. Hyde, of San Clemente, Calif., George R. Hyde of Kensington, Md., and William H. Hyde of Dover, Del.; a daughter, Mary Lynn Day of Los Gatos, Calif.; a sister, Erma H. Brim of Downey, Idaho; 13 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 31, 1992, Thursday
        An obituary on Dec. 22 about Rosel H. Hyde, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission who died on Dec. 19, misstated the number of years he headed the commission. He was chairman from 1953 to 1954 and again from 1966 to 1969; the service was not continuous.
