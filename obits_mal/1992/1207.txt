        Roger Wagner, the founder of the Roger Wagner Chorale and the Los Angeles Master Chorale, died on Thursday while traveling in France. He was 78 years old and lived in Westlake, Calif.
        He died of cancer, said Libby Huebner, a publicity agent for the Master Chorale.
        Dr. Wagner created the Master Chorale in 1964 and directed it for the next 21 years. The group has been a training ground for such singers as Marilyn Horne and Carol Neblett. It is the resident choir of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and performs around the world.
        He was born in Le Puy, France, and moved to the United States with his family in 1921. He returned to France in 1932, received a degree in music and studied organ with Marcel Dupre. He also served in the French Army.
        Returning to the United States in 1937, he studied conducting with Bruno Walter and Otto Klemperer before establishing the 32-member Roger Wagner Chorale in 1946. The group earned an international reputation through its many concerts, radio and television appearances, movie soundtracks and more than 70 recordings. Dr. Wagner was its director until his death. He has also been a guest conductor with many American and European orchestras and taught at the University of California at Los Angeles.
        He is survived by his wife, Janice, of West Los Angeles, from whom he had long been separated; a son, Richard, of Van Nuys, Calif.; two daughters, Jeannine, of West Los Angeles, and Jacki Hamilton, of Fillmore, Calif.; a brother, Jack, of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Anne-Marie Volk, of Las Vegas, and Andree Wrench, of Sun City, Calif.; and his manager and companion, Donna Hackley, of Westlake.
