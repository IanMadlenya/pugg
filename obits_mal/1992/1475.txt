        Luigi Provasoli, a biologist who advised the United States Government on nutrition, oil spills and the oceans, died on Friday at his home in Comerio, Italy. He was 84 years old.
        Dr. Provasoli died of a heart attack, said Haskins Laboratories of New Haven, Conn, which reported his death yesterday.
        Dr. Provasoli was affiliated with Haskins, a not-for-profit organization, from 1951 to 1981. He also did research and taught at Yale University from 1970 until he retired in 1987.
        In the 1960's, he served three Presidents on their Science Advisory Committees, dealing with the issues of food resources, oil spills and uses of the seas.
        In 1982 he won a National Academy of Sciences award. He was a past president of the Phycological Society of America and a founding editor of the Journal of Phycology, which reports on algae and protozoa. He wrote 80 articles and reviews, mostly on insect pests, nutrition and ecology of protozoa and crustacea, the genes and growth of algae and symbiosis in marine worms.
        He served on the boards of the American Institute of Biological Science and the American Type Culture Collection and was an advisor to the National Science Foundation and Smithsonian Institution.
        He was born in Busto Arsizio, Italy. After graduating from the University of Milan in 1931, he earned a doctorate in zoology there in 1939. His early research was on pests, silkworms and flagellates.
        Surviving is his wife of 54 years, the former Rose Desemini.
