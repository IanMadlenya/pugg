        Allan J. Gussack, the Mayor of Great Neck Plaza, L.I. for the last 10 years, died yesterday at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. He was 49 years old and died after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Gussack was instrumental in getting state legislation passed that enables towns and villages to create business improvement districts, and his village was the first in the state to exercise that right. In his five terms as Mayor, he helped make improvements in the village's downtown area.
        Before his election as Mayor, as a candidate for the United Residents Party, he was deputy mayor for 10 years.
        Mr. Gussack was a co-chairman of the finance committee of the State Conference of Mayors and a past president of the Great Neck Village Officials Association. He had served on the boards of the Great Neck Water Pollution Control District and Great Neck North Water Authority and was a co-founder of the United Tenants Council.
        Born in Queens, he grew up in Kings Point, L.I. He graduated from New York University in 1964. His full-time job was as a consultant in marketing and retail site location.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Maryellen Goldsmith; two daughters, Stephanie and Betsy, both of Great Neck Plaza; his parents, Claire and Henry of Kings Point, and a brother, Mark of Coral Springs, Fla.
