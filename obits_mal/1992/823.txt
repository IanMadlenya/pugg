        Sidney Meredith, who with his brother Scott founded the Scott Meredith Literary Agency in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville, L.I. He was 73 years old and lived in New Hyde Park, L.I., and Tamarac, Fla.
        Mr. Meredith died of cancer, said his son, Dr. Gary Meredith.
        Scott Meredith said yesterday that he and his brother, both natives of Brooklyn, founded their agency in 1946 after being discharged from the Army. He said his brother was in charge of the company's internal operations, while he concentrated on signing up writers and promoting their work.
        The writers the agency has represented include Norman Mailer and Arthur C. Clarke, and the agency is the United States representative of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
        Sidney Meredith retired from the agency in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne; two sons, Wayne, of Dix Hills, L.I., and Gary, of North Woodmere, L.I.; a daughter, Peggy, of Westport, Conn.; his brother, Scott, of Kings Point, L.I.; a sister, Alma Weller of Brooklyn, and six grandchildren.
