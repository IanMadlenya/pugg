        Joe Sapora, the wiry collegiate wrestling champion who coached the sport at City College from 1932 to 1968 and helped steer Henry Wittenberg to the heavyweight gold medal in the 1948 Olympics, died Monday at Ormond Beach Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 87 years old and lived in Daytona Beach. His wife, Marguerite, said he died of pneumonia.
        During his 36 years at City College, Mr. Sapora, who was a professor of physical education, turned out his share of champions. Although Mr. Wittenberg was undoubtedly the best, Mr. Sapora's greatest accomplishment as a coach may have been when Jacob Twersky, a blind wrestler, made it to the collegiate finals in 1942.
        Mr. Sapora, who was born in Hazleton, Pa., stood 5 feet 6 inches, weighed 115 pounds and did not take up wrestling until he got to the University of Illinois, where he won two collegiate championships. He later captured two Amateur Athletic Union titles for the New York Athletic Club.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three brothers, George of Brookings, Ore.; Allen, of Champaign, Ill., and Robert of Adelphi, Md.
