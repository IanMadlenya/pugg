        Frank P. Clair, a co-founder of the Circle Line boat excursions for Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island ferry company, died on March 31 at his home in Port Salerno, Fla. He was 90 years old.
        He had been in declining health and had suffered several heart attacks, his family said.
        Mr. Clair, who was born in Manhattan, dropped out of his first year of high school to become a mate on a party fishing boat. After earning a license as a passenger vessel captain at the age of 19, he worked two years as a yacht captain. Then he bought the first of what became a fleet of several party fishing boats based in Sheepshead Bay.
        In the late 1930's, he converted a yacht for sightseeing tours of New York Harbor. In 1945 he and four partners formed the Circle Line, a name adopted from the Circle Line subway in London, where his son, Francis, had visited. In 1953 the company took over the Statue of Liberty ferry. In 1962 it added the Hudson River Day Line to serve Bear Mountain and West Point, and in 1976 began the Ellis Island ferry.
        The company sold its Manhattan tour and Hudson Day Line operations in 1981. From 1986 until his recent illness, Mr. Clair was the chief operating officer of the Circle Line Statue of Liberty Ferry.
        His wife of 60 years, the former Julia Knuth, died in 1983.
        He is survived by a son, Edward, of Brooklyn; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
