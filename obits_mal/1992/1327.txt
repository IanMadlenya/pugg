        William Miller, an author, historian and educator, died on Sunday at the Wicke Health Center in Shelton, Conn. He was 79 years old and lived in Redding, Conn.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Miller wrote and edited many articles and books, several of which became widely used classroom texts.
        Among his better-known works was "A New History of the United States," (Braziller, 1958). A review in The New York Times praised the book's sweep and detail and said it "deserves an appreciative public."
        He taught at Michigan State University, Yale, Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and New York University.
        Born in the Bronx, Mr. Miller grew up in Brooklyn. After graduating from New York University, he earned a master's degree in history there and studied further at Columbia.
        His first job was as a sports reporter for The Brooklyn Eagle, and later he wrote for Fortune magazine.
        In Redding he was a leader in efforts to retain open space as one of five founders of the Redding Land Trust.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Virginia Buckner; a son, Gregory of Bethesda, Md.; a daughter, Patricia Miller Hancock of Fairfield, Iowa; a brother, Tobias of Manhattan and West Palm Beach, Fla.; a sister, Mildred Rose of Tamarac, Fla., and three grandchildren.
