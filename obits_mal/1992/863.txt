        James McKim Symington, chief fund-raiser for the Smithsonian Institution for more than a decade beginning in the mid-1970's, died on Wednesday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 72 years old.
        The cause of death was lung cancer, his wife, Mary Theresa Symington, said.
        In 1976 Mr. Symington, who had been an advertising executive in the New York area for almost three decades, was recruited by S. Dillon Ripley, the Smithsonian's director at the time, to head the institution's office of membership and development. His success at enrolling members and attracting money for Smithsonian programs helped drive the institution's greatest period of expansion.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Symington is survived by two sons, James McKim Symington Jr. of Falls Church, Va., and Alexander S. N. Symington of Cooperstown, N.Y.; and two sisters, Sarah Meyer of Locust Valley, L.I., and Maud Symington of Palm Beach, Fla.
