        Calvin Morgan, a stage, furniture and interior designer, died on Saturday at Cardinal Cook Hospice in New York. He was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said David Ostwald, a friend.
        Mr. Morgan moved to New York in 1976 to be the director of the Stage Division of the Juilliard School. While at Juilliard, Mr. Morgan designed productions for the drama, opera and dance departments.
        Mr. Morgan left Juilliard in 1980 and began his career as a furniture designer in association with Ward Bennett. Mr. Morgan went on to design furniture collections in his own name for such companies as Steelcase, Hickory Business Furniture and Bernhardt. He also designed interiors, including his own Greenwich Village apartment, which appeared on the cover of the English magazine World of Interiors in April 1992.
        A native of Clifton Forge, Va., Mr. Morgan was a professor of theater at Denison University before going to Juilliard.
        Mr. Morgan is survived by his mother, Helen, a sister, Jane, and a brother, Donald, all of Clifton Forge; and another brother, Richard, of Tampa, Fla.
