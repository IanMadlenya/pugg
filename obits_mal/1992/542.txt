        Jilly Rizzo, the onetime restaurateur who became Frank Sinatra's closest associate and was later convicted in a Federal fraud case, was killed in an automobile crash here in his hometown early today, his 75th birthday.
        The police said Mr. Rizzo was driving alone along Gerald Ford Drive when his car was hit by a second vehicle and exploded in flames. Because his body was badly burned, the authorities said positive identification would take at least 24 hours. But Susan Reynolds, a spokesman for Mr. Sinatra, confirmed that Mr. Rizzo had been killed and said the entertainer was in seclusion as a result.
        The driver of the other car was jailed on several charges, including vehicular homicide and drunken driving, and his passenger was arrested on charges of being an accessory to a felony.
        Mr. Rizzo long ran Jilly's saloon, a lounge on West 52d Street in Manhattan that was a favorite gathering spot of celebrities in the 1960's, especially when Mr. Sinatra was in New York. But he was best known as the inseparable companion of Mr. Sinatra, whom he served for many years as chief aide.
        Two years ago a Federal jury in New York convicted Mr. Rizzo and five other men of having participated in a fraudulent loan scheme that drained $8 million from the Flushing Federal Savings and Loan Association. He was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service by Judge Jack B. Weinstein, who said Mr. Rizzo was too old and his health too poor to send him to prison.
        Mr. Rizzo is survived by two sons, a daughter and two grandchildren.
