        Dr. Peter Hobart Knapp, a Massachusetts psychiatrist noted for his research in psychosomatic medicine, died last Tuesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 75 years old.
        The death was caused by a brain tumor, his family said.
        Psychosomatic medicine depicts emotions and personality as contributors to certain physical ailments, suggesting that adjustments in feelings and thoughts might prevent disease or promote recovery.
        A professor of psychiatry, Dr. Knapp was associated with the Boston University School of Medicine for 49 years and reached emeritus status last fall. He remained in private practice in Cambridge until illness forced him to curtail his activities, but up to the time of his death he continued to work on a book dealing with emotion.
        A native of Syracuse, Dr. Knapp was a 1937 graduate of Harvard University. He received his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1941 and served as a major in the United States Army Medical Corps in World War II.
        He was director of the department of psychosomatic medicine in the division of psychiatry at Boston University School of Medicine, a member and training analyst at the Boston Psychiatric Institute, and past president of the American Psychosomatic Society.
        Dr. Knapp was the author of more than 70 professional papers and the editor of four books, including "Expression of the Emotions in Man" (International Universities Press, 1963). He also was a member of the editorial boards of four psychiatric journals.
        Dr. Knapp is survived by his wife, the former Jean Wechsler; two sons, Peter H. of Philadelphia and Andrew G. of Salem, Mass.; three daughters, Penelope Krener of Davis, Calif., Rebecca S. Knapp of Harvard, Mass., and Caroline H. Knapp of Boston; a brother, Robert H. of Cazenovia, N.Y.; two sisters, Sarah Auchincloss, also of Cazenovia, and Judith Johannet of Cambridge, Mass., and seven grandchildren.
