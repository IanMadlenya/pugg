        Robert Dudley, a New York milliner whose hats for women were popular in the 1940's and 1950's, died on Sept. 24. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Dudley died at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan after a series of strokes, said Robert Marcus, a family spokesman.
        Many of Mr. Dudley's designs are in the collection of the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        Born in Rochester, he studied at the Eastman School of Music there and had come to New York City intent on a career in the theater. He decided instead on a career in millinery after he used an old felt hat to create a new one for a friend. His large clientele included many theater and society figures and he designed hats for several films, including "Rebecca."
        During the 1940's and 1950's he operated the Chez Robert salon at Saks Fifth Avenue and his own shop, Robert Dudley Originals, on the East Side of Manhattan. Mr. Dudley then became an interior designer and was active in the field until his death.
        There are no immediate survivors.
