        Edward F. Fagan, a retired detective inspector from New York City, whose final command included the Police Department's crime laboratory, the bomb squad and the daily lineup, died on June 1 at the Bon Secours in Maria Manor nursing home in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 80 years old and had been a St. Petersburg resident since his retirement in 1956.
        He died after a brief illness, said a niece in New York, Linda Finnerty.
        Mr. Fagan, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, attended Brooklyn Technical High School and Cooper Union and worked as an architectural draftsman before being appointed a probationary patrolman in 1936. He put his civilian skills to work to design the police laboratory he later headed.
        His 20-year career in the department advanced rapidly. Scoring high in examinations, he reached the rank of detective captain just 12 years after walking a beat in Brooklyn. He was named deputy inspector in 1952 and promoted to inspector in 1954, when Police Commissioner Francis W. H. Adams put him in charge of a Bureau of Technical Services in a reorganization. The unit also included the criminal-identification bureau, the ballistics squad and the photographic bureau.
        He retired in early 1956 just before Mr. Adams's successor, Stephen P. Kennedy, announced his own choices for some top posts in the department.
        Besides several nieces and nephews, he had no immediate survivors.
