        Benjamin C. Riggs, a psychiatrist and educator who helped introduce psychoanalytic training in South Carolina, died Tuesday at Charleston Hospital in Charleston, S.C. He was 78 years old and lived in nearby Wando.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Riggs had taught psychoanalysis at the Medical University of South Carolina since 1968. Earlier, he taught at the University of Pennsylvania, Tufts, Harvard and Emory, and was the assistant superintendent of Metropolitan State Hospital in Waltham, Mass. He practiced psychoanalysis in Boston, Atlanta and Charleston and founded and headed the Atlanta Psychoanalytic Group, a professional society.
        Dr. Riggs, who was born in Stockbridge, Mass., graduated from Harvard in 1936 and received his medical degree from Columbia in 1940. Finding Prevented Blindness
        In World War II, while studying oxygen for the Navy, he found that the practice of giving pure oxygen to premature babies in incubators caused blindness. His finding led to reduced oxygen levels, preventing new cases of blindness.
        One of Dr. Riggs's avocations was sailing, and he designed and built six boats. He also played the flute in concerts, sang under the direction of Serge Koussevitzky and composed music. He wrote plays, painted landscapes, invented a speedometer for submarines and piloted airplanes.
        His marriage to Norma Campanaro ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of nearly 30 years, Elizabeth Dekle Riggs; four sons, Benjamin C. Riggs Jr. of Bristol, Tenn., Henry L. Riggs of Pacifica, Calif., and Malcolm M. Riggs of Rochester; an adopted son, Rick Pohl of Isle of Palms, S.C.; a stepdaughter, Catherine Riggs Bergesenof Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
