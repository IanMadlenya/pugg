        Dr. Bayrd Still, who spent four decades at New York University as a professor of history and founding director of the N.Y.U. Archives, died on Thursday in Woodstock, Ill., the town of his birth. He was 86 years old.
        N.Y.U. said that it received the news of his death yesterday and that it did not know the cause.
        Dr. Still was an alumnus of the University of Wisconsin, where he earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. He went to N.Y.U. in 1947 from Duke University. Dr. Still served as chairman of the Department of History in the School of Arts and Science from 1955 to 1970. For a time he also was acting dean of both the undergraduate College of Arts and Science and the Graduate School of Arts and Science.
        He reached emeritus status in 1974, the year he took over as head of the newly established Office of University Archives at N.Y.U. He retired as its director five years ago.
        Dr. Still was one of the original members of the Landmarks Commission of New York City, serving from 1962 to 1965. He was a past member of the Mayor's Task Force on Municipal Archives in New York City. In the 1980's he organized and led many walking tours of N.Y.U. and around Greenwich Village.
        He wrote widely on the growth of cities and the westward expansion of the United States. Among his books was "Mirror for Gotham: New York as Seen by Contemporaries From Dutch Days to the Present" (N.Y.U. Press, 1956).
