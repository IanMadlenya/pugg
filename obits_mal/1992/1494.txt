        Prof. Bernard N. Kalinkowitz, a psychologist and psychoanalyst at New York University, died on Wednesday at Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. He was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, the university reported.
        Professor Kalinkowitz founded the N.Y.U. Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis in 1961 and directed it until his death.
        From 1954 to 1975, he was the director of N.Y.U.'s doctoral program in clinical psychology. His postdoctoral program was the first university program to offer comprehensive training in each of the main theoretical psychoanalytic orientations.
        A clinic that was started at his direction has provided psychoanalytic treatment to the community near N.Y.U.
        The university gave him its Great Teacher Award in 1981.
        Professor Kalinkowitz was born in New York City. He graduated from Brooklyn College and received a Ph.D. in psychology from N.Y.U. in 1949. He trained at the William Alanson White Institute, which awarded him its certificate in psychoanalysis in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Teddy Witt, and a daughter, Judy Freiboth of Berkeley, Calif.
