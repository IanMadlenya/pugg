        Reavis Cox, an internationally recognized marketing authority and former chairman of the department of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, died on Saturday at his home in Swarthmore, Pa. He was 91 years old.
        He died of natural causes, his wife, Rachel, said.
        Dr. Cox was born in Mexico of American missionary parents. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Texas and, in 1932, a doctorate in economics from Columbia University. He joined the Wharton School's faculty in 1935 and remained there until his retirement in 1971 as the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing.
        Along with several colleagues, Dr. Cox identified methods for studying the flow of ownership of goods, from the sources of component raw materials to the consumer, and systematically assessing the efficiency, cost and value added at each stage of distribution.
        He wrote or was the co-author of 11 books and numerous articles. At various times he was managing editor and editor in chief of both The American Marketing Journal and The Journal of Marketing.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David Cox of Fort Wayne, Ind.; a daughter, Rosemary C. Masters of New York, and five grandchildren.
