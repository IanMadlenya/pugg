        Alan R. Liss, the founder of the publishing house named after him, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67 years old.
        His family said he died after a long illness.
        Born and raised in New York City, Mr. Liss graduated from the University of Rochester, where he also earned a master's degree in physics. He started his publishing career as an editor at McGraw-Hill, then moved to Academic Press.
        In 1971, after several years as executive vice president at Plenum Publishing, he established Alan R. Liss Inc. Having started as a one-man operation, it grew into an international publisher of scores of medical and scientific journals and books. Mr. Liss sold the firm in 1989 to John Wiley & Sons Inc., also of Manhattan, a large publisher or journals and periodicals, of which Liss Inc. is now a division.
        Mr. Liss is survived by his wife, the former Linda Baldwin; a daughter, Julie Liss of Pasadena, Calif.; a son, Tony Liss of Urbana, Ill., and three granddaughters.
