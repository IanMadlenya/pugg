        Christian Blackwood, who directed or produced more than 95 documentary and feature films, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 50 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said his wife, Carolyn Marks Blackwood, who noted that he was a heavy smoker.
        Mr. Blackwood was born in Berlin in 1942 and was brought to the United States when he was 7. He began his film career soon after graduating from New Lincoln High School in Manhattan.
        In his 30-year career, he won a variety of awards, including the Berlin Film Festival Peace Prize, several Emmy Awards, and the State's Film Prize, a prestigious German award, for an experimental feature film called "San Domingo."
        "Straight, No Chaser," his 90-minute film about the jazz musician Thelonious Monk, was widely acclaimed at the New York Film Festival in 1989. It was based chiefly on 14 hours of black-and-white film shot in the late 1960's by Mr. Blackwood and his brother, Michael.
        Mr. Blackwood's work appeared on the "American Masters" and "Point of View" series on PBS, as well as on Home Box Office and German television and in theatrical release.
        In addition to his wife and brother, also of Manhattan, he is survived by his mother, of Hamburg, Germany, and a stepson, Gabriel Marks-Mulcahy of Manhattan.
