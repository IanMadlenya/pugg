        Vaino Linna, author of "The Unknown Soldier," a novel dealing with Finland's 1941-44 war with the Soviet Union, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Kangasala, a small town in central Finland. He was 71 years old.
        As is customary in Finland, hospital officials would not disclose the cause of death.
        Mr. Linna was working as a mechanic in a textile plant when "The Unknown Soldier" was first published, in 1954. It quickly became a best seller in Finland and was published in the United States in 1957. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, John Barkham commented on the novel's "unrelenting honesty" in its realistic depiction of the suffering of soldiers in a Finnish machine-gun platoon.
        The book was translated into 25 languages.
