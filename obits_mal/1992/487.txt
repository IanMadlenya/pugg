        Wendell Mayes, who wrote the screenplays for "Anatomy of a Murder" and "Advise and Consent," died on Saturday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.  He was 72 years old and lived in Bel Air, Calif.
        He died of bone cancer, said his sister, Judith.
        Mr. Mayes achieved success with his first script, "No Riders," a one-hour drama that he sold to ABC Television's "Pond's Theater" in 1955. The director Billy Wilder read a favorable review and invited Mr. Mayes to Hollywood to work on the script of "The Spirit of St. Louis."
        His specialty was adapting novels for the screen. He did his finest work for Otto Preminger, writing the scripts for "Advise and Consent" (1962), "In Harm's Way" (1965), and "Anatomy of a Murder," which in 1959 won the New York Film Critics Award and an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay.
        Mr. Mayes also wrote the screenplays for "Hotel" (1967), which he produced, "The Poseidon Adventure" (1973), "Go Tell the Spartans" (1977) and "Death Wish" (1974). He co-wrote the screenplays for "From Hell to Texas" (1959) and "Von Ryan's Express" (1965).
        He returned to television writing several years ago. His final project was the script for "Criminal Behavior," a drama starring Farrah Fawcett that will be shown on May 10 on ABC.
        In addition to his sister, of New York City, he is survived by his wife, the former Phyllis Manning.
