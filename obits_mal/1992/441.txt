        Clovis Ruffin, an award-winning fashion designer, died on Tuesday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Ruffin had his first major show of a collection in 1972, and the next year he became the youngest designer to win a Coty award. Early in his career, he went against the prevailing trend of pants for women by designing inexpensive, clingy, T-shirt-like dresses that became his trademark. He also designed a one-shoulder dress and terry-cloth pajamas, and bold stripes were a favorite motif in his clothing.
        He helped focus the fashion industry's attention on young women who had grown up in blue jeans and were looking for youthful, carefree, affordable clothes as they began entering the work force. He was also among the first designers extensively employing black models, whose flair for the runway he praised. Costumes for Dance Company
        By the mid-1970's he was designing pants and loose, flowing dresses. In the 1980's, he produced lounge wear and also slinky, taffeta evening dresses with price tags in the hundreds of dollars. In 1990, he designed costumes for the Alvin Ailey dance company and in recent years branched out to interior design.
        After his initial success, his small company, Ruffinwear, became part of the Kreisler group until it closed in 1979. Later he worked under licensing arrangements for Boutique Industries and Keyloun.
        Born in Clovis, N.M., for which he was named, Mr. Ruffin grew up in Egypt and Europe and returned to the United States as a teen-ager. He studied at the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, Columbia University and the Sorbonne in Paris.
        Surviving is his mother, Harriet Wright Ruffin of Manhattan.
