        Frederic Matys Thursz, an abstract painter of monochromatic canvases, died last Saturday at University Hospital in Cologne, Germany. He was 62 years old and lived in Paris. He also had a studio in Ossining, N.Y.
        He died of complications after heart surgery, said Lilly Wei, an art critic and friend.
        Mr. Thursz's paintings are on view at Galerie Lelong, 20 West 57th Street, Manhattan, and in "Documenta 9," the international exhibition in Kassel, Germany.
        Mr. Thursz's paintings, often large, explore the effects of color and light. A believer in paint itself as the conveyor of meaning, he achieved his deep, luminous colors by applying layer after layer of viscous boiled paint, scraping, glazing and reworking the surface to a prismatic intensity. His artistic development was linked with both the New York School, in particular Mark Rothko, and the postwar School of Paris, especially Jean Fautrier.
        He was born in Casablanca, Morocco, on July 7, 1930, and moved to the United States with his parents in 1941. He was educated at Queens College and Columbia University and taught at the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture until his death.
        He is survived by his third wife, Nina Lunenborg Thursz, of Paris; four children from two previous marriages, Gail, of El Toro, Calif.; Erica, of Cortland, N.Y.; Elizabeth Thursz Ross, of North Long Beach, Calif., and Michele Thursz Tryba, of Chicago, and a brother, Dr. Daniel Thursz, of Bethesda, Md.
