        Walter A. Miller, who practiced law in Brooklyn for 64 years, died on Thursday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 87 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Miller was a 1925 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton University and earned his LL.B. at Brooklyn Law School in 1928.
        He served on state and city panels including the State Health Planning Commission, a state Citizens Advisory Committee on the Care of the Aging, the Welfare Council of New York City and Mayor Robert F. Wagner's Committee on Youth and Work, of which he was chairman in the 1950's.
        He became a founding director in 1934 of the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, a nonsectarian, nonprofit affiliate of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies providing free assistance to job-seekers in need of training and placement. He was its president from 1940 to 1960, a period when it cared for many war veterans.
        Mr. Miller kept on working until earlier this month in general practice as well as in corporate, probate, real-estate and banking law. Among his clients were the Emigrant Savings Bank and Central Brooklyn Medical Group. From 1977 to 1985 he served as general counsel for the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife of 63 years, Betti; three daughters, Judith Childs of Manhattan, Ann Curran of Pleasantville, N.Y., and Elizabeth Dodge of Montpelier, Vt.; a sister, Rosetta M. Adler of Matthews, N.C.; and five grandchildren.
