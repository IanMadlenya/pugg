        Don West, a labor organizer and civil-rights advocate who helped found the Highlander Folk School for poor children of the Tennessee mountains in 1932, died Tuesday at Charleston Area Medical Center in Charleston, W.Va. He was 86 years old and lived in Cabin Creek, W.Va.
        Heart disease forced him into retirement several years ago.
        A sharecropper's son born in 1906 near Ellijay, Ga., Mr. West attended Lincoln Memorial University and graduated from Vanderbilt Divinity School. On a scholarship he studied the Folk School Movement in Scandinavia, then returned at age 26 to join Myles Horton in organizing Highlander in Monteagle, Tenn.
        The racially integrated school sought to teach the Appalachian poor to teach themselves and assume leadership. It has since become the Highlander Research and Education Center, on a 100-acre campus at New Market, Tenn. Its objectives are the same.
        Mr. West left the school in 1933 to help organize miners in Kentucky and textile workers in North Carolina. In the 1940's, he taught at Oglethorpe College in Atlanta but the segregationist state government caused him to be fired. His home was torched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1948, and he was harassed during the McCarthy era as a suspected Communist.
        He then taught in Georgia public schools and wrote poetry widely read in the South and Appalachia. In the 1960's, the Library of Congress awarded him a grant to study the region, after which he established the Appalachian Folk Life Center in Pipestem, W.Va. He dedicated it "to a mountain heritage of freedom, self-respect and independence, with human dignity."
        Mr. West is survived by two daughters, Hedy West of Penn Valley, Pa., and Ann Williams of Charleston; a sister, Belle Logan of Denver; a brother, Charles, of Blairsville, Ga.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
