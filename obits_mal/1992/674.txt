        Dr. Lothar B. Kalinowsky, a psychiatrist who was a teacher and author in the field of electroshock therapy, died on Sunday in his apartment in Manhattan. He was 92 years old.
        Dr. Kalinowsky, who was retired, had been in poor health, and the immediate cause of his death was heart failure, said a daughter, Marion Blakeley, of Ambler, Pa.
        Dr. Kalinowsky was born in Berlin, fled Hitler's Germany for Italy in 1933, came to the United States in 1940, settled in Manhattan and practiced psychiatry and neurology there for more than 40 years.
        For half a century, all told -- in Europe and then in the United States -- he administered electroshock therapy, which is the intentional triggering, by the use of electricity, of generalized seizures. It is known among psychiatrists as electroconvulsive therapy and has also been called shock treatment.
        Dr. Max Fink, a psychiatrist who is the chief editor of the journal Convulsive Therapy and a professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said Dr. Kalinowsky particularly wielded his influence through a textbook of which he was a co-author, "Shock Treatments and Other Somatic Procedures in Psychiatry" (Grune & Stratton, 1946).
        For many years he was affiliated with Gracie Square Hospital, where he was a member of the medical board. He retired from the hospital in 1991, not long after he retired from his practice.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Hilda Pohl, to whom he was married in 1925; another daughter, Ellen Hunersen of Vienna; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
