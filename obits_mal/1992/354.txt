        Elwood Curt Kastner, a retired college administrator and dean emeritus at New York University, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Chatham, Mass., where he moved from Yonkers after he retired.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Kastner became associated with N.Y.U. after he graduated from its University College of Arts and Pure Science in 1928. He initially served as director of the residence bureau and, from 1930 to 1934, as an assistant to the registrar.
        In 1934, he was named assistant registrar and chief aide to Henry G. Arnsdorf, whom he succeeded as registrar and supervisor of admissions in 1942 after Mr. Arnsdorf's death.
        He earned a doctorate of laws from St. Michael's College of Winooski, Vt., in 1950.
        From 1952 to 1957, Mr. Kastner was the dean of admissions and the registrar, after which he was named dean of registration and financial aid. He was named dean emeritus in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eunice Hart; a son, Robert Kastner of Bensalem, Pa., and two brothers, Frederick, of Southampton, L.I., and George Jr., of Bethlehem, Pa.
