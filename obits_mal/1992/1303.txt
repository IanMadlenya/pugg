        George E. Bates, professor emeritus of investment management at the Harvard Business School and an authority on ancient coins, died Sept. 25 at his retirement home in Camden, Me. He was 89 years old.
        Professor Bates was a former editor of the Harvard Business Review and for many years was the senior American adviser to Istanbul University's Institute of Business Administration.
        He was also a member of the Harvard-Cornell Expedition for the Archeological Exploration of Sardis, the prosperous capital of ancient Lydia, where gold and silver coins were first minted. Sardis, in present-day Turkey, had long been in ruins when the Harvard-Cornell excavations got under way there in 1957.
        In 1971, Harvard published Professor Bates's "Byzantine Coins," the first in a multi-volume series entitled "The Archeological Exploration of Sardis." He became honorary curator of Byzantine coins and seals at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum and was a fellow of the American Numismatic Society.
        A native of Kansas City, Professor Bates held bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Missouri and an M.B.A. from Harvard. He joined the Business School faculty as an assistant dean in 1925 and was named professor emeritus in 1965. During World War II, he served as director of instruction at the U.S. Naval Supply Corps Midshipmen-Officers School, at Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise MacMillan; two sons, George F. Bates of Weston, Mass., and Nathaniel B. Bates of Concord, Mass., and six grandchildren.
