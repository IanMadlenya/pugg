        Andrew Fiske, a prominent Long Island figure, died on Sunday at his home on Shelter Island. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Fiske died after a prolonged illness, said Andrew Tansey, a family spokesman.
        Mr. Fiske was a 13th-generation descendant of Nathaniel Sylvester, who settled Shelter Island in 1652. In 1949, upon the death of his father, Augustus, he inherited the Sylvester Manor estate on Shelter Island.
        He was a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Business School. During World War II, he was a manager of a boatyard at Electric Boat Company in Groton, Conn., that built submarines for the Pacific theater.
        After the war, he joined the Boston brokerage house of H. C. Wainwright and later became its Long Island representative.
        Mr. Fiske was a founder, trustee and past president of the Suffolk County Library, and also served for more than 40 years on the board of the Shelter Island Public Library.
        He was a member for nearly two decades of the Shelter Island school board, and was also a member of the board of the Eastern Long Island Hospital and of the Suffolk County Historical Society.
        Mr. Fiske is survived by his wife, Alice; two daughters, Susan Woodworth of Summit, N.J., and Elisabeth Williamson of Severna Park, Md.; a sister, Leila Ostby of Hampton, Conn.; a brother, Augustus Fiske of West Redding, Conn., and four grandchildren.
