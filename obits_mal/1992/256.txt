        Henry Neufeld, a chemical importer and philanthropist, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, his lawyer said.
        Mr. Neufeld started his importing business in his native Austria after World War I. Before World War II he moved his operations to Yugoslavia and then to Italy. In 1950 he immigrated to the United States. The company, Henneux, is now based in Manhattan.
        He sponsored a nursery and kindergarten in Herzlia, Israel, in memory of his parents and brothers, who died in the Holocaust. Last year he donated $250,000 to build a playground in Riverside Park near 74th Street.
        There are no immediate survivors.
