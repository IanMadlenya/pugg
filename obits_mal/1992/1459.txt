        Nathan Appleman, an oilman and philanthropist who was active in the American Jewish Committee and in the Republican Party, died on Thursday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 88 years old.
        He died of skin cancer, said his wife, the former Ann Thomka-Gazdik.
        Mr. Appleman, who was born in Marietta, Ohio, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business in 1925. He lived in Manhattan until 1976.
        He succeeded his father, Herman, as president of the Central Petroleum Company.
        One beneficiary of his philanthropy was the American Jewish Committee. It named its Nathan Appleman Institute for the Advancement of Christian-Jewish Understanding in his honor.
        He was a longtime benefactor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan. He also served on the board of Montefiore Medical Center.
        Mr. Appleman was one of the seven honorary chairmen of the Bush-Quayle re-election campaign in Palm Beach County.
        Mr. Appleman's first wife, Janet Greenebaum, died in 1987.
        He is survived by his second wife, to whom he was married in 1988; two children from his first marriage, Jill Roberts and Susan Unterberg, both of Manhattan; two stepchildren; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
