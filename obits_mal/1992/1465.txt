        David Ross, a composer, lyricist and musical arranger, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 58 years old.
        He died of bone cancer, said a friend, Diana Rosen.
        Among Mr. Ross's specialties was writing songs for cabaret singers. Some of his lyrics were laced with satire and puns. He also arranged music for the pianists George Shearing and Michael Feinstein and for singers including Julie Wilson, Annette Warren, Courtney Burr and Netii Ross, to whom he was married for six years until their divorce in 1977.
        He also wrote special material, often comprising music and lyrics, for performers, and frequently accompanied them on the piano.
        He was born in Columbus, Ohio, and also worked as a writer and editor for the Southern California Association of Governments.
        He is survived by two brothers, Dale William Beery and David Beery of Columbus, and a sister, Linda Mitchell of Wheatland, Wyo.
