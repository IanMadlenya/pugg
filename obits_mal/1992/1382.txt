        Nuncio F. Mondello, a prominent swing-era saxophonist and a composer, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, said his lawyer, Joel Shoobe.
        Mr. Mondello, who was known as Toots, was the principal alto saxophonist in Benny Goodman's band on the national radio show "Let's Dance" in 1934 and 1935 and again in the early 1940's. He was also a well-known studio musician who played on network radio and television for stars including Kate Smith, Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle.
        Mr. Mondello, who was born in Boston, was playing solos in front of his father's dance band by the time he was 8 years old. By the age of 17 he was the assistant band leader in a regional dance orchestra, Mal Hallett's Toast of New England. Mr. Mondello also played lead alto saxophone in the bands of Buddy Rogers, Joe Haymes and others.
        His interest in classical music developed in the late 1930's when he was a staff musician for CBS. He later studied with the composer Paul Creston. Among his vocal, chamber and orchestral works is a Prelude for Cello and Piano, which had its premiere at Town Hall in 1957.
        Most recently, Mr. Mondello played with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for productions of "Lulu" and "Porgy and Bess."
        There are no immediate survivors.
