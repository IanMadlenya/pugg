        William Mellon Eaton, a founder and retired senior partner of the Manhattan law firm of Eaton & Van Winkle, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67 years old.
        His family said he died of a heart attack.
        Specializing in corporate, banking and estate law, Mr. Eaton worked as an associate in the firm of White & Case from 1949 to 1960, and as a member of Hardy, Peal, Rawlings, Werner & Maxwell until 1965. That year he became a founder of what then was Eaton, Van Winkle, Greenspoon & Grutman. He was of counsel to Eaton & Van Winkle since 1986.
        Over the years, Mr. Eaton represented many prominent clients, including Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress; Angier Biddle Duke, the diplomat, and Huntington Hartford, whose family founded the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company.
        He was a past chairman of the American Bar Association's committee on investment securities and of the New York bar's investment committee. He also was a former president of the B T Capital Corporation, an investment subsidiary of the Bankers Trust New York Corporation.
        Mr. Eaton, a native of Manhattan, served as an officer in the Navy in the Pacific before graduating from Duke University with the war-delayed class of 1945. He then received his doctorate in law from Harvard Law School. He was admitted to the bar of New York in 1949 and to the bar of the United States Supreme Court in 1961.
        He was also a trustee of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Skowhegan, Me., and a former officer of the United States Japan Foundation and the Moroccan-American Foundation.
        Mr. Eaton is survived by his wife of 36 years, the former Elizabeth Waring Witsell, three daughters, Carolyn Eaton Taylor, Sarah Elizabeth Eaton and Lisa Hitchinson Eaton, all of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Alexander Mellon Eaton of Durham, N.C., and one granddaughter.
