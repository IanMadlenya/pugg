        Joe B. Cordell, the recently retired head of Walter Industries, died on Thursday at Memorial Hospital in Tampa, Fla. He was 64 years old and lived in Tampa.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        In Mr. Cordell's 33 years at the company and its predecessor, the Jim Walter Corporation, he helped the regional home builder expand and diversify into natural resources, industrial manufacturing, financing and building materials. Walter ranks as a Fortune 500 company, with 8,000 workers and annual sales of $1.3 billion.
        He joined Walter as vice president and chief financial officer in 1958. In 1975 he succeeded the company's founder, James Walter, as president and chief operating officer, then became the chief executive in 1983. He retired from full-time duties last year because of illness but remained vice chairman of the board.
        Mr. Cordell also served as a director of Barnett Banks, the Florida Steel Corporation and the General Instrument Corporation.
        He was chairman of an advisory board to the local Salvation Army and a trustee of the Palma Ceia United Methodist Church. He was also a past chairman of Tampa Bay Area United States Savings Bond Campaign and past president of the University of Florida Foundation.
        Mr. Cordell was born in Daytona Beach, Fla., and after high school served in the Navy. Upon graduating from the University of Florida in 1949, he began work as an accountant for Price Waterhouse in New York and later became the audit manager of its Atlanta office.
        Surviving are his wife of 41 years, the former Joyce Hinton; two sons, Joe Jr. of Tampa and Coleman of Winter Park, Fla.; a daughter, Lauren Stallings of Tampa; a sister, Betty Shiles of Ormond Beach, Fla., and seven grandchildren.
