        Philip Reisman, a Social Realist painter and printmaker known for his views of New York City street life, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 87 years old, and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his wife, Louise.
        Fourteen of Mr. Reisman's etchings of New York life are to be in the show "Recent Gifts: Works on Paper," opening at the Museum of the City of New York on June 24. His work is also represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, among others.  A Day of One's Own
        In 1979 and 1980, a three-month exhibition of Mr. Reisman's work from the 1960's and 1970's appeared at the Museum of the City of New York. In honor of the show, Manhattan Borough President Andrew J. Stein proclaimed Nov. 13, 1979, to be Philip Reisman Day. In 1982, the artist was elected an Academician at the National Academy of Design. A book about him, "Philip Reisman: People Are His Passion," by Dr. Martin H. Bush, was published in 1987 by Wichita State University.
        Mr. Reisman was born in Warsaw in 1904, and came to New York with his family at the age of 4. He studied at the Art Students League in the 1920's, and had his first solo show at the Painters and Sculptors Gallery in New York City in 1931. Later in the 1930's, he worked as a painter and muralist on the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, the Government-sponsored effort to create work for artists during the Depression.
        For many years, Mr. Reisman exhibited at the ACA Gallery in Manhattan, along with other social commentators, including Jack Levine, Robert Gwathmey, Philip Evergood and William Gropper. He also taught art classes at his studio, at the Educational Alliance and at other workshops around New York.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Reisman is survived by a brother, Edward, also of Manhattan.
