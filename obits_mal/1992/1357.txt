        Joseph J. Ferro, a former New York City Buildings Commissioner, died on Saturday at Astoria General Hospital in Queens. He was 90 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ferro began his 45-year career in city government in the Transportation Department, where he was a civil engineer for the subway system. After transferring to the buildings agency, he worked his way up to director of operations and then deputy commissioner. Mayor John V. Lindsay promoted him to Commissioner in 1970, and he retired in late 1971.
        During his tenure, Commissioner Ferro was in charge of investigating several disasters, including a rash of crane and derrick accidents at construction sites and the collapse of an eight-ton load of structural steel that crushed a worker to death.
        He also helped direct an important inquiry into two fatal skyscraper fires that revealed that some automatic elevators are drawn to heat and thus are potentially deadly when used to escape. It became standard safety procedure to recommend that occupants of burning buildings avoid elevators and take stairs instead.
        Born in Sicily, Mr. Ferro came the United States with his family at the age of 4 and grew up in Manhattan.
        After graduating from City College in 1926, he earned a master's degree in engineering there in 1926.
        His wife of almost 50 years, the former Mildred Spong, died in 1980.
        He is survived by a daughter, Pauline Timmerman of Queens, and a sister, Mary Ferro of San Francisco.
