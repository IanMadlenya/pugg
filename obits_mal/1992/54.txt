        Irving B. Kravis, a noted economist and educator who specialized in international price comparisons, died Friday after becoming ill at the Philadelphia airport on his way to receive an award.
        He was 75 years old and lived in Haverford, Pa. His family said he was suffering from lymphoma and Parkinson's disease.
        He was chairman of the economics department at the University of Pennsylvania from 1955 to 1958 and from 1962 to 1967, and he was associate dean of the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the university from 1958 to 1960. Including those posts, he served a total of 37 years on the university's faculty. Mr. Kravis earned his bachelor's and doctorate degrees at the university.
        Sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, he conducted pioneering studies comparing consumer prices in foreign countries and the average number of hours of work required to buy certain items.
        In large part for this work, he was posthumously made a distinguished fellow of the American Economic Association on Saturday at a meeting in New Orleans to which he was traveling when he became ill.
        He received a Ford Foundation fellowship and a Guggenheim fellowship and was a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and a consultant to the Organization for European Common Development.
        He was awarded a Bronze Star for service in World War II as a first lieutenant in China with the Flying Tigers.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Lillian Panzer; a sister, Lillian Zingg of McLean, Va.; two sons, Robert, of Glenside, Pa., and Nathan, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Marcia, of Philadelphia and Ellen Hamberger of Silver Spring, Md., and six grandchidlren.
