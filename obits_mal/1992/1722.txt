        Henry Ives Baldwin, a retired research forester and naturalist who schussed the New England mountains long before skiing became fashionable, died on Thursday at the Medical Center at Princeton, N.J. He was 96.
        He died after a brief illness while on a visit, his family said.
        Dr. Baldwin was the author of 10 books and many scientific papers. A chronicle of his experiences as a trailblazing skier in the Adirondacks and the White Mountains, "The Skiing Life," was published privately last year.
        He was born in Saranac Lake, N.Y., and was a resident of Hillsboro, N.H. He graduated from Yale University, studied forestry in Germany and Scandinavia and returned to Yale to earn a master's degree in forestry and a Ph.D. in botany. He was secretary of his Yale class of 1919 at his death.
        Over the years he served as a consultant to the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, the National Resources Planning Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Officer in Both World Wars
        Dr. Baldwin was a flying officer in World War I and an intelligence officer in World War II, leaving the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel.
        Having begun his career as a forester with the Brown Company in New Hampshire, Dr. Baldwin became a professor of forestry at Penn State University. Then, from 1933 to 1965, he was the first research forester for the State of New Hampshire. After that he returned to teaching as professor of botany and ecology at Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., retiring in 1975.
        Dr. Baldwin's wife of 63 years, the former Birgit Sverdrup, died in 1987. He is survived by two daughters, Barbara B. Knapp of Germantown, Md., and Harriet B. Bryan of Princeton; two sons, Edward R. Baldwin 2d of Toronto and Gunnar I. Baldwin of Thornton, N.H.; 14 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.
