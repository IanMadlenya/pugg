        Harold H. Fisher, a special assistant to the New Jersey Attorney General in the Lindbergh baby murder trial and a partner in one of the state's leading law firms, died on Friday at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge, N.J. He was 92 years old and lived in Upper Montclair, N.J.
        He died of pneumonia, a member of the family said.
        Known for his investigative skills, Mr. Fisher handled the research for the prosecution in the 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, convicted and later executed for the kidnapping and murder of the infant of Charles A. Lindbergh.
        Mr. Fisher also led several major inquiries into state agencies. Gov. Charles Edison asked him to head investigations into the State Highway Department's land acquisition transactions in 1941 and into the State Civil Service Department in 1943.
        He was appointed in 1949 by Chief Justice Arthur T. Vanderbilt to a special 10-man committee to study the administration of criminal justice in New Jersey. As special counsel to Gov. Robert B. Meyner, Mr. Fisher led the 1954 investigation into irregularities in the State Division of Employment Security under Gov. Harold G. Hoffman.
        In 1946, Mr. Fisher joined the Newark law firm Young, Shanley, Foehl & Fisher, which eventually became Shanley & Fisher, with head office in Morristown.
        Born Hratchia Balikan of Armenian parents in Amasya, eastern Turkey, he and his family fled persecution in 1913, settling in Tennent in Monmouth County. A graduate of Rutgers University, he received his law degree from Columbia University in 1924 and changed his name when he began to practice law.
        Surviving are two sons, Dr. Armen G. of Highland, N.Y., and Richard L. of Montclair; a daughter, Diane F. Gibbs of Allamuchy, N.J.; two sisters, Anahid Tashjian and Araxie Balikian of Worcester, Mass.; and four grandchildren.
