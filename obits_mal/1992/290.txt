        John Collier Jr., a documentary photographer and teacher, died on Feb. 25 while on vacation in San Jose, Costa Rica. He was 78 years old and had homes in Muir Beach, Calif., and Talpa, N.M.

        A members of the renowned documentary photographic project of the Farm Security Administration of the Depression era, Mr. Collier was best known for promoting the use of photography in anthropology. His book "Visual Anthropology: Photography as a Research Method" (1967) is widely regarded as a classic treatment of the subject. A revised edition, prepared by Mr. Collier with his son Malcolm, was published in 1986 by the University of New Mexico Press.
        Mr. Collier was born in Sparkill, N.Y., and studied painting in San Francisco before taking up photography in 1935. In 1941 he joined the F.S.A. photographic program under Roy E. Stryker. He later participated in documentary projects at the Office of War Information and after World War II at the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. In 1946 he began his first project using photography as part of an anthropological study, working with Anibal Buitron in Olavalo, Ecuador; the results were published three years later as "The Awakening Valley."
        Since 1955 Mr. Collier had concentrated on anthropological photographic studies, working in New Mexico, Peru and Nova Scotia, among other places.  In addition to his wife, he is survived by four sons, Malcolm, of San Francisco; Robin and Aran, of Muir Beach, and Vian, of Talpa.
