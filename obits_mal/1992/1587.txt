        Jay W. Murphy, a noted labor arbitrator, law professor and civil rights advocate, died Wednesday in Rockwood, Tenn., where he was hearing a labor dispute. He was 81 and lived in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
        The cause of death was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Murphy was considered a leading arbitrator in the South. In 41 years of arbitrating, he heard hundreds of cases in diverse industries, including textiles, agriculture, shipbuilding, health care and transportation.
        For 34 years, starting in 1947, he taught at the Alabama School of Law, where he specialized in the Constitution, labor and jurisprudence.
        Starting in the early 1950's, Mr. Murphy and his wife, Alberta Brown Murphy, also a lawyer and arbitrator, became involved in civil rights causes. He was on the Alabama Advisory Board to the United States Civil Rights Commission, and was an early director of the Tuscaloosa chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
        Mr. Murphy was born in Eldorado, Ill., graduated from the University of Illinois and earned a law degree and a master of law degree at George Washington University.
        He served as an administrator in the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, a New Deal program. In World War II he served in naval intelligence.
        Besides his wife, his survivors include his son, Stanley J. of Tuscaloosa; a brother, Stanley N. of Jackson, Miss.; a sister, Lu Murphy Whitaker of Black Mountain, N.C., and two grandsons.
