        Brother Casimir Gabriel Costello, a professor emeritus at Manhattan College who wrote a two-volume history of the institution, died on Tuesday at the Christian Brothers residence in Lincroft, N.J. He was 82 years old and had lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        He died of complications from a stroke, said Patrice E. Athanasidy, a Manhattan College spokeswoman.
        Brother Gabriel, who was born in Jersey City, entered the novitiate in 1926. He graduated from Manhattan College in 1933 and received a master's degree in history from Manhattan College in 1939. He earned a doctorate in history at Fordham University in 1946.
        He joined the Manhattan faculty permanently in 1949, serving as history department chairman and dean of the college from 1953 to 1959. Manhattan College published his college history, "The Tree Bore Fruit" and "The Arches of the Years," in 1953 and 1980.
        There are no immediate survivors.
