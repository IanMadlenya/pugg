        Werner Dannheisser, a businessman and art collector, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and also had a home in East Hampton, L.I.
        He had been ill for some years with Parkinson's disease, said his wife, the former Elaine Fansling.
        Fleeing Nazi Germany, Mr. Dannheisser came to the United States in 1936. In 1939, with Norbert Schimmel, he founded the New Hermes Corporation, manufacturing portable engraving machines for the jewelry industry.
        During World War II, the company turned from engraving jewelry to producing engraved identification tags for New York City schoolchildren and did contract work for the Government. Mr. Dannheisser served in the United States Army.
        The two partners sold the company in 1981.
        With his wife, Mr. Dannheisser had long collected contemporary art, and their involvement expanded after he retired. Their holdings range from Picasso and Dubuffet to recent work by Bruce Nauman, Brice Marden and Robert Gober. In 1982, the couple established the Dannheisser Foundation, which donates works to museums and maintains a 9,000-square-foot space on Duane Street in lower Manhattan for art displays and on-site performances.
        Mr. Dannheisser's sole survivor is his wife.
