        O. Jack Mitchell, a professor of architecture, died on Tuesday at his home in Houston. He was 60 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Carolyn.
        Mr. Mitchell had been a professor of architecture at Rice University in Houston since 1966, and served both as the director and the dean of its School of Architecture. He had also taught at Texas A & M University, and had been a visiting lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Texas. In 1982-83 he was the president of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and a member of the visiting team of the National Architectural Accrediting Board.
        Mr. Mitchell, born in Little Rock, Ark., received a bachelor's degree from Washington University and two master's degrees, in architecture and city planning, from the University of Pennsylvania. From the 1950's through the 1980's, he was associated with several architectural firms and was active in the Rice Center for Design and Community Research and the South Main Center, both in Houston. He lectured frequently on architecture, and had articles published in Progressive Architecture and Architectural Record.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, James Jackson and Mark Tyler, both of Houston.
