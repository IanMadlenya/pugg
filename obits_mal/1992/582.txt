        Francis X. McQuade, a retired shipping executive and a leader in that industry, died on Sunday at his home in Darien, Conn. He was 68 years old and died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. McQuade was a past president of the General Stevedoring Council, an international organization. He helped reorganize the New York Shipping Association and served on its Labor Grievance Committee, the Mayor's Committee on Port Congestion, the New York Terminal Conference-Tariff and National Association of Stevedores.
        He worked about 15 years for the Manhattan-based John W. McGrath Corporation, one of the world's largest stevedoring companies, where he rose to vice president. When "On the Waterfront" was filmed at the McGrath piers, he taught Marlon Brando to drive a forklift and had a one-line part in the movie. Served on Heisman Committee
        In 1966, Mr. McQuade was appointed president of the International Terminal Operating Company, a subsidiary of the Ogden Corporation. Then he became president of Northeast Marine Terminal for about two years before recently retiring because of illness.
        Mr. McQuade had served as chairman of the Heisman Memorial Trophy Committee, which makes the annual football player award, and as a governor of the Downtown Athletic Club.
        He was born in Brooklyn and attended Grove City College, New York University and the Art Students League.
        In World War II he served three years as a United States Marine, winning two Bronze Stars, two ribbons and a Purple Heart fighting in the Pacific. After the war, he worked as a commercial illustrator and played semi-professional football.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 45 years, the former Mary McGrath; two daughters, Mary Anne of Darien and Eileen of Meriden, Conn.; three sons, Francis X. Jr., of Lenox, Mass., John of Rye, N.Y., and Brian of Norwalk, Conn.; a sister, Denise Sperger of Smoke Rise, N.J., and nine grandchildren.
