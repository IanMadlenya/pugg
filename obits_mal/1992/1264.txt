        Egon H. Ottinger, a former chairman of Frank B. Hall & Company, a leading marine insurance company, died on Monday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 93 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        Mr. Ottinger died of complications from a recent fall, said Carolyn B. Handler, a family spokeswoman.
        A native of Newport, R.I., Mr. Ottinger devoted his career to the marine insurance industry. He began at 16 as a clerk and by 1919 was writing marine cargo contracts for the Hall concern, which is now a division of the Aon Corporation.
        He became a vice president there in 1935, a director in 1940 and president in 1961. He was the company's chairman from 1964 to his retirement in 1969.
        His wife, the former Lilyan Leaders, died in 1983. There are no immediate survivors.
