        Walter Thomas Wells Sr., who was a leading executive in the marine insurance industry, died on Friday at his home in Moraga, Calif. He was 64 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wells retired earlier this year as the senior vice president and longest-serving employee of the Marine Office of America Corporation, a division of Continental Insurance and the largest marine insurance company in North America.
        He was also a charter member and past president of the American Marine Insurance Forum and the first West Coast director of the American Institute of Marine Underwriters.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Wells grew up in Ridgewood, N.J. He started at Marine as an underwriter trainee in 1950 at its Manhattan office. He took a leave to study at the New York State Maritime Academy and after graduation served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy from 1952 to 1954.
        After returning to Marine, he held a series of posts, including senior ocean cargo underwriter, vice president of business production at the home office and director of recruiting and training. In 1970, he moved to Marine's San Francisco office as the head of company operations for the the Pacific region.
        Surviving are his wife of 42 years, the former Jean Lane; three sons, W. Thomas Jr. of Berkeley, Calif., John C. of Lafayette, Calif., and Peter J. of Alameda, Calif.; two daughters, Suzanne M. Wells of Moraga and Nancy W. Beaudreau of Lafayette, and three grandchildren.
