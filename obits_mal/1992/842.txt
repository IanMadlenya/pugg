        Bob Macken, an assistant football coach at Fordham University for the last seven years, died after suffering a heart attack on the Rose Hill campus on Monday. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Macken was a three-time all-city performer at quarterback and linebacker at Power Memorial High School. He spent two years in the United States Navy before he enrolled at Fordham after two weeks at North Carolina State.
        Mr. Macken got his first head coaching position at Brooklyn Prep in 1966 and defeated Monsignor Farrell for the 1968 city championship, ending Farrell's 33-game unbeaten streak.
        Mr. Macken is survived by his three children, Robert Jr., Kevin and Eileen, and a granddaughter.
