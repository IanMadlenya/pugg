        Herbert Cornelius Kenny, a bass-baritone who sang in the original Ink Spots quartet, died on Saturday at his home in Columbia, Md. He was 78 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Minnie McNeal Kenny.
        The Ink Spots were one of the first black singing groups to become popular with a wide audience through their recordings. Founded in the early 1930's, the quartet was known for its smooth pop-harmony sound, achieved in part by contrasting a deep bass with a high tenor lead, which was sung by Mr. Kenny's fraternal twin brother, Bill.
        Herbert Kenny joined the group in 1944 and remained until 1952, when its members split up to form several other groups also calling themselves the Ink Spots. Among the hit songs he recorded with the original quartet were "Gypsy" and "To Each His Own."
        After the quartet disbanded, Mr. Kenny made solo appearances until 1957, when he moved to Washington to become a disk jockey. He worked there at several radio stations and was the program director for WJMD. In the mid-1960's he left the station to resume his singing career. His final appearance was in April when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the United in Group Harmony Association.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Daphne Jackson of Millburn, N.J.; a son, Paul Morris of Baltimore, and seven grandchildren.
