        Jerome Andrews, an American dancer and choreographer who taught modern dance in France after moving there in 1952, died yesterday in Paris. He was 84 years old.
        No cause of death was given.
        Mr. Andrews was born in Plaistow, N.H., and studied at the Cornish School of the Arts in Seattle. Although in France he saw himself as a disciple of Mary Wigman, he had studied earlier with the leaders of American modern dance, including Ruth St. Denis, Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Hanya Holm, who had been a Wigman student.
        Mr. Andrews appeared in both ballet and modern-dance troupes before World War II and danced at Radio City Music Hall from 1931 to 1937.
        He was also the assistant in New York City for many years to Alyse Bentley, who taught children's dance classes with the kind of props and objects as extensions of the body that Mr. Andrews later used in his choreography.
        He settled in Paris at a time when modern dance was not accepted by ballet-oriented French audiences and dancers. "He was one of the first to instill into French dancers the idea that dance and music could have a dialectical relationship," the French choreographer Jacqueline Robinson wrote.
        In 1953, he formed a company, Les Compagnons de la Danse, and in 1964 he established the Jerome Andrews Dance Company.
        Information on survivors was not available.
