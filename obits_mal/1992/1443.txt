        J. Harvey Evans, a naval architect and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died Monday at Mid-Coast Hospital in Brunswick, Me. He was 78 years old.
        A former resident of Lexington, Mass., he moved to a Brunswick retirement community a year ago. He died of a heart condition, the university said.
        An expert in ship structure, Professor Evans specialized in the computer-aided design of marine vessels and the structure of craft to navigate at great depths. He was credited with introducing "gross panel" hull-girder analysis, a full-scale analysis distinct from the traditional section-by-section model.
        More recently he was involved in designing a 925-foot reinforced-concrete vessel for transporting liquefied natural gas cooled to 260 degrees below zero. The project has not gone into production.
        Professor Evans once said his profession was "really engineering rather than architecture."
        Born in Rochester to English immigrant parents, he graduated in 1937 from Liverpool University, renowned for its shipbuilding courses. For the next 10 years he worked in the shipyards of the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy, Mass.
        He joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1947 as an assistant professor, became a full professor of naval architecture in 1961 and reached emeritus status in 1978. After his retirement, he continued to work as a consultant to industry and, until 1988, as a member of several national and international panels.
        Professor Evans is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Edith Miriam Price; a son, H. David, of Anchorage, Alaska; a daughter, Dr. Gail E. H. Evans of Ames, Iowa, and a brother, Frank H., of Lynnfield, Mass.
