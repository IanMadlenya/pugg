        Lieut. Gen. Daniel B. Strickler, retired, who served in three wars and was a former Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, died on Monday in a retirement home in Lancaster, Pa. He was 95 years old.
        A spokeswoman for the family gave no specific cause of death.
        Born in Columbia, Pa., in 1897, he enlisted in the Pennsylvania National Guard and was sent to the Mexican border in 1916 when U.S. troops hunted for Pancho Villa. In World War I he served as a lieutenant with the 28th Division in France, where he was gassed and wounded.
        In 1922 he graduated from Cornell Law School and returned to Pennsylvania to practice law. He served in the State Legislature as a Republican in 1931 and 1932. He was also Commissioner of Police in Lancaster in 1932. Later in that decade he became County Solicitor for Lancaster County as well as for the York-Lancaster Intercounty Bridge Commission and the Lancaster Municipal Airport.
        Discharged from the Army with the rank of captain after World War I, he remained active in the reserves and held several infantry commands during World War II. He served a term as Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, from 1946 to 1951, under Gov. James Duff.
        General Strickler resumed his military career in the Korean War and again commanded the 28th Division, which was part of the NATO force in Europe. He retired from the Army as a lieutenant general in 1957 but continued to practice law.
        He is survived by a daughter, Nancy Strickler of London; a son, Daniel B. Strickler Jr. of New York City; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
