        Frank J. Brennan, a retired New York advertising executive, died on Wednesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 66 years old and lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.
        A friend, William Ivey, said lung cancer caused his death.
        Philadelphia-born, Mr. Brennan graduated from Temple University and earned an M.B.A. from Pace University. He came to New York in 1949 and worked for several advertising agencies in Manhattan before joining the New York headquarters of Times Mirror Magazines nearly 20 years ago. He retired in August 1991 as director of advertising-rate development.
        Mr. Brennan is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Brennan Spuhler of Cherry Hill, N.J.
