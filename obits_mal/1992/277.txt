        Gene Ward, who in 46 years with The Daily News rose from summer copy boy to nationally known sports writer and columnist, died Saturday at the North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 78 years old.
        He died of complications following colon surgery, said his wife, the former Carol Alice Maley.
        Eugene L. Ward Jr. was born in Oneonta, N.Y. He graduated in 1936 from Colgate University and did graduate work at Columbia University. He was best known for his coverage of thoroughbred racing, boxing and college and professional football. He covered 29 consecutive Kentucky Derbies.
        From 1960 to 1979, he wrote a sports column, "Ward to the Wise." He received the 1963 Bill Corum Award from the Thoroughbred Racing Associations. He was a former president of the National Turfwriters Association, the New York Football Writers Association and the New York Hockey Writers Association. He also did sports commentary on radio and television.
        During World War II, Mr. Ward spent three and a half years as a Marine Corps combat correspondent. His reports on the battle for Tarawa were read by Lowell Thomas on network radio and John Wayne on a network television salute to the Armed Forces.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons -- Eugene L. 3d of Quincy, Mass.; Gregg of Edinburgh, Scotland, and Guy of Ogallala, Neb. -- and a grandson.
