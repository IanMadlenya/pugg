        Russell P. Saunders, a leading organist and professor of organ at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, died on Sunday at the Universalist Church in Rochester. He was 71 years old and lived in Rochester.
        He died of a heart attack, said Lawrence A. Martin, a friend and former student.
        During a career that spanned more than four decades, Professor Saunders taught other organ teachers, church musicians and recitalists.
        He was a native of Iowa, and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Drake University in 1947 and 1949 after service in the Coast Guard in World War II. He studied in Frankfurt am Main as a Fulbright scholar in the early 1950's. He taught at Drake for 20 years and joined the faculty at the Eastman School in 1967.
        He is survived by his mother, Hazel Saunders of Montezuma, Iowa.
