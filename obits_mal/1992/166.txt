        Later he played in the backup orchestra for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis on Broadway and for Jackie Gleason in the television show "The Honeymooners." In 1957, he became a financial analyst for the Navy. He spent the last 10 years of his life teaching professional musicians.
        In addition to his son, of Harrison, N.Y., he is survived by his mother, Gertrude Rabinowitz, of Brooklyn, and a grandson.
