        Robert R. R. Brooks, an expert on labor economics who had been the dean and a professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., died yesterday at the house of his sister-in-law, Ruth Brooks, in Nyack, N.Y. He was 86 years old and lived in Williamstown.
        Dean Brooks, who was a deputy administrator of the Office of Price Administration in World War II, died of cancer of the pancreas, his family said.
        When his book "Unions of Their Own Choosing" (Yale University Press), about the National Labor Relations Board, came out in 1938, it was praised by Francis Brown in The New York Times Book Review as a "timely and temperate study." Lewis Gannett, writing in The New York Herald Tribune, called it "a sober, circumstantial and impressive history."
        His 1937 book, "When Labor Organizes" (Yale), was lauded by R. L. Duffus, also in the New York Times Book Review, as a "well-poised study of union labor in the United States."
        Dean Brooks was born in Rome and grew up in Vermont and Florida. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1926 at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., studied from 1926 to 1928 at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, receiving another bachelor's degree, and earned a doctorate in economics at Yale in 1935. He was dean and the Orin Sage Professor of Economics at Williams from 1945 to 1963. He retired in 1971 as a professor of economics there.
        A volume of his memoirs, "A Tumult of Years," came out in 1980. He wrote, co-wrote or edited six other books.
        His wife, the former Mary Elizabeth Storer, died in 1975. They had been married 46 years.
        Dean Brooks is survived by a sister, Helen Coombs of Essex, Conn.; a daughter, Patricia Skidmore of Takoma Park, Md.; two sons, Robin, of Orrs Island, Maine, and Jonathan, of Waterport, N.Y.; nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
