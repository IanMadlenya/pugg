        John Goldsmith Phillips, former chairman of the department of Western European arts at the Metropolitan Museum, died on Monday in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85 years old and had lived in the Palm Beach area since he retired in 1971.
        He died of cancer, said his son Anthony.
        Born in Glens Falls, N.Y., Mr. Phillips joined the Metropolitan Museum as an assistant curator in 1929, immediately after graduating from Harvard. In 1934, he joined the museum's newly formed department of Western European arts. He became its curator in 1957 and was named chairman in 1967.
        In his 42 years at the museum, he was responsible for significant acquisitions in Italian and French sculpture. The marble group of Alpheus and Arethusa by the 16th-century Florentine sculptor Battista Lorenzi, now exhibited in the Blumenthal Patio at the Met, was one of his purchases. Another was the marble Perseus by Antonio Canova, circa 1808, displayed on the balcony of the Great Hall. Among the large works installed at the museum under his supervision are the Blumenthal Patio, a Renaissance courtyard from the Spanish castle of Velez Blanco, and the huge wrought-iron screen from the cathedral in Valladolid, Spain, on view in the Medieval Sculpture Hall.
        A specialist in the art of the Florentine Renaissance, Mr. Phillips published a number of articles and two books, "Early Florentine Designers and Engravers" (1955) and "China Trade Porcelain" (1956). After his retirement, he worked for 10 years as a consultant to Sotheby's in Palm Beach.  At his death, he was working on a memoir, "The Acquisitive Curator."
        Besides his son Anthony, of Setauket, L.I., he is survived by his wife, the former Giovanna Sodi; another son, Guy Laurence Phillips of Kobe, Japan; a daughter, Beatrice Ballard of Winooski Park, Vt., and two grandchildren.
