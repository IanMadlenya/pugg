        Robert F. Kelly, a former state Assemblyman from Brooklyn who became the first head of the New York State Commission on Cable Television, died on Saturday at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 74 years old and had residences in both Bay Ridge, Brooklyn and Breezy Point, Queens.
        He died of cancer, said his daughter, Barbara.
        Mr. Kelly, a graduate of St. John's University School of Law, maintained an active legal practice until his death. A native of Bay Ridge, he represented the neighborhood in the state Assembly from 1960 to 1973.
        A conservative Republican, he was a staunch supporter of the police, encouraging his fellow legislators "to take the handcuffs off the police and let them act like policemen again." In the early 1970's he twice introduced legislation to restore the death penalty in the state for most types of homicide. It never passed.
        Mr. Kelly, who ran unsuccessfully for City Council President in 1969, was chairman of the Assembly's Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee, which established the state commission to regulate cable television in 1973. He was appointed the agency's first commissioner by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. In that capacity, in which he served until 1978, he was responsible for oversight of the state's then-fledgling cable industry.
        His wife of 45 years, the former Ethel Hall, died in 1987.
        Besides his daughter Barbara, of Bay Ridge, Mr. Kelly is survived by another daughter, Patricia, of Port Jefferson, L.I.; a son, Kevin, of Belle Harbor, Queens, a brother, Edward, of Nashua, N.H., and five grandchildren.
