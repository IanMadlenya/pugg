        James A. Goode, an author and a top editor of several major national magazines, died Sunday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, Calif. He was 68 and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of a heart attack, said Harry W. Carey, his companion.
        In the 1970's Mr. Goode was the executive editor of Playboy, Playgirl, Penthouse and Viva. In 1982 he was the publisher of Oui.
        In his first job at Playboy as the articles editor in the 1960's, he helped give the magazine intellectual credibility by creating the Playboy Interview and by arranging for Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court to be an early subject. Playboy's circulation doubled during that period.
        At his death, Mr. Goode was the founding editor of The National Times magazine. Earlier he was the editor of the magazines Film News International, Platinum and The Robb Report, and was the editorial director of Hustler and Chic.
        In the early 1970's he founded Earth magazine and Earth News, an alternative news service for radio. He also produced news films for ABC and wrote for Show Business Illustrated.
        From 1952 to '61 he was a correspondent for Life, then became an editor at Time-Life in charge of several large-format books and as the photography editor for cookbooks.
        His first book, "The Story of the Misfits" (Bobbs Merrill, 1963; Limelight, 1986), was about Marilyn Monroe's and Clark Gable's last movie. The New York Times called it a contender for "the model book on the making of a movie." He also wrote "Wiretap" (Simon and Schuster, 1988) about the Mafia.
        Mr. Goode was born in Indianapolis. He graduated from Wabash College, where he was the editor of the campus newspaper. In World War II he served in Europe as an editor of the Army newspaper Stars and Stripes.
        Besides Mr. Carey, his survivors include his mother, Mary, and brother, Damon, both of Indianapolis.
