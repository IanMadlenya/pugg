        Harold R. Brown Sr., an investment executive and organizer of a church shelter for the homeless, died on Monday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park, L.I. He was 61 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Brown was the vice president for investments at the Dean Witter Reynolds office at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, near 55th Street, in Manhattan. He also helped the company establish individual customer accounts in commodities as a line of business.
        Disturbed by the plight of homeless people he saw in midtown, he and his wife responded to public pleas from Mayor Edward I. Koch and church leaders for volunteers to help.
        In 1981 the Browns organized a shelter in their parish church, the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Church in Glendale. Mr. Brown also became a board member of the Partnership for the Homeless, the citywide organization that promotes and coordinates shelters in churches and synagogues.
        Mr. Brown was born in Brooklyn and attended City College. He served in the Marines in the early 1950's. He worked for Dean Witter for about 35 years.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Virginia Lasher; three sons, Charles, of Old Brookville, L.I., Harold, of Queens, and Steven, of Manhattan; a daughter, Virginia Brown of Queens, and a brother, Robert of Boca Raton, Fla.
