        Andrew J. Kappell, an associate professor of English at Hofstra University, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said Alice Levine, chairwoman of the English department at Hofstra.
        Professor Kappell graduated from Princeton University in 1973 and received a doctorate from Rice University in 1978. He taught at Rice University and Virginia Polytechnic Institute before joining Hofstra in 1982.
        At Hofstra, in addition to teaching, he held a number of administrative posts, including co-director of the Summer Writers Conference. He received a National Endowment for the Humanities fellowship in 1990 and had completed a book, "Sursum Corda: God and Family in the Poetry of Marianne Moore," which has not yet been published.
        He is survived by his parents, Andrew and Christine Kappell, and a brother, James, all of Honolulu.
