        Ezra J. Denerstein, president of Sterling Bancorp, a bank-holding corporation with headquarters in New York, died in New York Hospital on Feb. 22. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died suddenly of an aneurysm, a family member said.

In 1968, he was elected president and chief operating officer of the company, then known as the Standard Prudential Corporation.
        At the time of his death, he was also senior credit officer and vice chairman of Sterling National Bank & Trust Company, a fully owned subsidiary of Sterling Bancorp. Most recently, he was involved in establishing a $10 million line of credit for The Daily News.
        A native New Yorker, he was a graduate of City College. He was a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a trustee of the Jewish Association for Service to the Aged.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita Heller; three daughters, Susan Amster of Manhattan, Loretta Friedman of Dix Hills, L.I., and June Silver of Boca Raton, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Susan Simon of Palm Harbor, Fla.; a stepson, Matthew Polsky of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; a sister, Minnie Schwartz Levin of Manhattan, and nine grandsons.
