        Julian Roth, the retired partner of a New York architectural firm that helped to design the World Trade Center towers and other Manhattan skyscrapers, died on Wednesday at New York University Hospital. He was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Roth and his brother, Richard, were senior partners in Emery Roth & Sons. During their tenure, the firm helped to design more than 200 office towers, apartment buildings and hotels in New York.
        Among them were the Pan Am Building, Citicorp Center, the Regency Hotel and the General Motors Building.
        The firm was founded by their father, Emory, a Hungarian immigrant without formal training who became one of New York's best-known architects. His buildings, characterized by rich Renaissance details, included the Belleclaire, San Remo, Normandy, Ritz Tower, St. Moritz, Drake, Dorset and Oliver Cromwell.
        Mr. Roth, who was not a licensed architect, specialized in building materials, construction methods, cost estimates and the technology of curtain walls.
        He was born in Manhattan and attended Columbia University.
        He joined the firm in 1921, and he and his brother became senior partners in 1938. He continued as a principal until his retirement in 1982, when he was 81.
        In World War II, he helped to design housing for military personnel and their families at bases across the country.
        He was married to the former Denver Frankel, who died in 1989.
        He is survived by three nephews.
        Correction:  December 17, 1992, Thursday
        Because of an editing error, a brief obituary on Friday about Julian Roth, an architectural designer, referred incorrectly to his father. His father was Emery Roth.
