        Thomas J. King, an architect who worked on the renovation of the Museum of Modern Art and other projects in New York and elsewhere, died last Thursday at his home in Nantucket, Mass. He was 35 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his stepfather, Robert J. Harbaugh Sr., said yesterday.
        Mr. King, a 1979 graduate of Pratt Institute, worked on numerous architectural renovations of office buildings and private homes in New York City, San Diego and Nantucket. In 1985 he moved to Nantucket, where he was a member of the Nantucket Historic District Commission.
        Besides his stepfather, he is survived by his mother, Irene King Harbaugh of Yarmouth Port, Mass., and a sister, Pamela K. Riker, of Halifax, Mass.
