        The Rev. Benjamin A. Richardson, an assistant pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in the 1940's who was a clergyman and social worker in Chicago from the 1950's through the 1970's, died on July 8 at his home in Watertown, Mass. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Richardson died of complications following a stroke, said a daughter, Marilyn Richardson Bering, with whom he lived.
        A graduate of Florida A & M University, Mr. Richardson went to Abyssinian Baptist as an assistant to the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. following his graduation from Harvard Divinity School in 1939. Mr. Richardson was involved with numerous liberal political causes in New York, including Mr. Powell's initial, successful campaign for Congress in 1944.
        A trumpet and cornet player, Mr.  Richardson, while in New York, began a lifelong friendship with many prominent entertainers. He later became the host of "Everywhere," a Sunday morning television program in Chicago that covered politics and the arts. In 1971 Mr. Richardson won an Emmy for his writing for the program.
        He moved to Chicago in 1953 as the pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church there and was active in expanding the reach of settlement-house social programs throughout the city's poorer neighborhoods.
        Besides his daughter Marilyn, he is survived by a daughter Leslie, of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
