        Brig. Gen. Martin F. Rockmore, retired, who established the United States Marine Corps Scholarship Program for college-bound children of Marine Corps personnel, died on Saturday at his home in Chesterfield, Mo. He was 74 years old.
        General Rockmore died of emphysema, his wife, Ruth, said.
        He was a native of Brooklyn and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps upon graduating from St. Lawrence University in Canton in 1938.
        He was posted to the Pacific as a captain in 1942, where he led his unit in the assault wave on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands and in the Battle of the Tenaru. His leadership earned him an immediate field promotion to major.
        He retired from the Corps in 1964.
        General Rockmore started the scholarship program in 1962 after reading about a Marine Corps Medal of Honor winner who could not afford to send his son to college. The general and several other retired Marine officers organized the fund as a private nonprofit charity.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two children, Andrea Volte of Ossining and JoAnne Olsen of Forest Hills, Queens; two stepchildren, Juliet Bruce of Washington and Dr. Marc Bregman of Jerusalem, and four grandchildren.
