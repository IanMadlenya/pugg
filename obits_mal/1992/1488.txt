        Stephen S. Sheridan, the retired chief operating officer of the Electrolux vacuum cleaner company, died on Wednesday at White Plains Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Sheridan worked for 30 years at Electrolux, and retired in 1975 as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University in 1934. During World War II, Mr. Sheridan for four years directed the New York City area War Manpower Commission, which determined military service exemptions for people needed for industrial and business jobs.
        After retiring from Electrolux, he worked for a program in which retired executives advise developing countries.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Beatrice Zimmer; two sons, Robert M., of Newport Beach, Calif., and Peter N., of Atlanta; a daughter, Peggy Safren of Lakewood, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
