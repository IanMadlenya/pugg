        Glenn N. Appleyard, a leader in creating "dial it" telephone services, died on Wednesday at his home in Middletown, N.J. He was 70 years old and had also lived in Boca Raton, Fla.
        His son Glenn Jr., of Old Greenwich, Conn., said Mr. Appleyard had died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
        He helped develop dial-it services, allowing people to call for recorded information on topics like sports or weather, in his career at the New York Telephone Company from 1946 to 1977. He left to start Phone Programs Inc., which he headed until retiring in 1990.
        Also surviving are his wife, Audrey; a son, Bruce, of Toms River, N.J.; a daughter, Nancy Golden of Morris Plains, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
