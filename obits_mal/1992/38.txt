        Joseph Kestutis Valiunas, a longtime leader in the independence movement for the Baltic states, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I. He was 68 years old and was a resident of Southampton.
        He died of heart failure after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Valiunas was born in Kaunas, Lithuania. He hid from the Nazis there during World War II and later resisted the Communists in the turmoil of the war's aftermath. He earned a doctorate at the University of Tubingen in the American-occupied zone of Germany and immigrated to the United States in 1951.
        Mr. Valiunas worked in several businesses. He was the founder of Neris International, a Manhattan concern that was a major exporter of American coal to Germany and Italy after the war. He was also the president of the American division of Compania Exportadora de Vinos Marques de Vilallonga, a wine exporting company in Barcelona, Spain.
        As president of the Baltic World Conference, he was arrested in 1975 in Helsinki, Finland, for protesting at a meeting of European foreign ministers. He objected that they were ignoring the Soviet Union's domination of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. He was freed after two days in prison, after demands for his release from the United States and other Governments.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elena Jasaitis; four sons, Dominicus of Charleston, S.C., Andrew of Bishop, Calif., Julius of Manhattan, and Peter of London; three grandchildren, and a brother, Andrew, of Washington.
