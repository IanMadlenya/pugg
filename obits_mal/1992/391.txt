        Dr. Joseph Laval, an ophthalmologist for 63 years and a leader in that specialty, died on Tuesday while walking near his home in Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Laval founded the eye pathology departments at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. He also headed Mount Sinai's ophthalmology department from 1953 to 1965 and was a professor there.
        He was a former chairman of the eye section of the New York Academy of Medicine and past president of the New York Society for Clinical Ophthalmology and the Mount Sinai Alumni Society.
        In 1955, Dr. Laval helped diagnose a tumor in the left eye of Paul Muni, the actor, and assisted in the operation removing the eye.
        Dr. Laval was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from St. John's College and Bellevue Hospital Medical School, now the New York University School of Medicine, and studied eye pathology in London and Vienna.
        Surviving are his wife of 53 years, the former Peggy Steinhardt; two daughters, Linda Brandaleone and Ronnie Ann Herman, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Ethel Moghtader of Palo Alto, Calif., and Helen Miller of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
