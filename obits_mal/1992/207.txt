        Robert L. Levine, a longtime business lawyer and entrepreneur, died Tuesday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in East Patchogue, L.I. He was 86 years old and lived in Brooklyn and Palm Beach, Fla.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        In his 62 years as a lawyer, he was involved in many proxy fights and cases involving stockholder litigation at several companies.
        In 1964 he won a seat on the five-member board of the Peoria and Eastern Railway in a dispute with its majority owner, the Penn Central Railroad. He was also a key figure in litigation contesting RKO's purchase of Pathe Exchange.
        He represented Ethel Colt Miglietta and Samuel Colt, who were the children of Ethel Barrymore and descendants of Samuel Colt, a founder of U.S. Rubber and the Colt firearms company, in a successful suit to break up the Colt estate along 26 miles of ocean front in Bristol, R.I. Founder and Partner
        As a businessman, Mr. Levine and three partners formed Cambridge Shipyards in Maryland to build the Army's version of the P.T. boat. He was also a founder of the Marvel Packaging Company in Georgia, which produced strawberry cartons.
        Mr. Levine was born in Manhattan and graduated from Fordham University and its law school. He worked for the Manhattan law firm of Skinner & Bermant before joining William F. Walsh to form their own firm, Walsh and Levine, in 1929. It merged with Bigham Englar Jones & Houston in 1990.
        Active in the Masons, he was the master of the Franklin Lodge in Manhattan in 1936 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared for the initiation of two of his sons.
        Mr. Levine's wife, Mollie, died six years ago. He is survived by two sons, Laurence W. and Jay H., both of Manhattan; a daughter, Susan Kane of Bayport, L.I., and four grandchildren.
