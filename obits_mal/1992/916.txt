        Alan Burke, the host of a syndicated television talk show in the 1960's who was known for his acerbic put-downs of his audience and guests, died yesterday at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida. He was 69 years old and lived in Boca Raton.
        His family said only that he died after a long illness.
        From 1966 to 1969, Mr. Burke was the host of "The Alan Burke Show" on Channel 5 in New York City and had a second program that was syndicated in more than 20 other cities. His subjects ranged from sex in suburbia to abortion. Among his guests were a nun turned go-go dancer, a transvestite and a Jewish anti-Semite. The American Jewish Committee and the United Church of Christ said his program was a platform for bigots.
        Mr. Burke was born in Richmond, Va., and attended the University of Richmond. He began his career in broadcasting as a sportscaster at a radio station in Petersburg, Va. After Channel 5 discontinued his show, he moved to Boca Raton, where he worked in radio and television.
        He is survived by his wife, Claire Canniff Burke; two sons, David Jonathan, of Los Angeles, and Morris Daniel, of Tamarac, Fla.; two stepchildren, Frank Maner Jr. of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Claire Maner of Albuquerque, N.M., and three grandchildren.
