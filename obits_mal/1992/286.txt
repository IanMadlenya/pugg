        Alan Roth, a pioneer in getting teams to use baseball statistics as a tactic, died on Tuesday at Brotman Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 74 years old and suffered a heart attack, his family said.
        It was in 1947 that Mr. Roth, a native of Montreal who had worked as a statistician for the Canadiens and the National Hockey League, approached Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, with a proposition that would transform somewhat how the game was played.
        Wouldn't it help a manager, Mr. Roth asked, if he knew, for example, that a certain batter hit .220 against right-handed pitchers and .300 against left-handers?
        Mr. Rickey was intrigued, and Mr. Roth became the first full-time statistician hired by a major league club, touching off a trend that has made the personal computer an essential element of clubhouse paraphernalia.
        Interestingly, Mr. Roth, who charted every pitch and did the requisite calculations either in his head or with a simple calculator, insisted on working by hand throughout his career. He often worked from the broadcast booth, feeding pertinent data to Dodger announcers.
        He moved with the Dodgers to Los Angeles in 1958 and remained with the club until 1964, when he left to work with NBC and later ABC in their game broadcasts. Ill health forced him to retire a few years ago.
        Mr. Roth, whose marriage ended in divorce, is survived by a brother, Max; a son, Michael; a daughter, Andrea Western, and one grandchild.
