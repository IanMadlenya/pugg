        Francis L. Broderick, a lawyer and a former chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Boston, died yesterday at his home. He was 69 years old and lived in Stratham, N.H.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Barbara.
        A native of Manhattan and a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy, Princeton University and Harvard University, Mr. Broderick fashioned successive careers out of his interests in history, contemporary American society and the law.
        As chairman of The Daily Princetonian, Princeton's undergraduate newspaper, during the 1942-43 school year, Mr. Broderick helped to lead the movement there to reverse Princeton's unofficial ban on admitting black undergraduates. Princeton admitted its first black undergraduates at the end of World War II.
        After serving in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, Mr. Broderick earned a doctorate in history from Harvard and taught at several institutions, including Princeton. He became the director of the Peace Corps in Ghana in 1964.
        In 1968 he was appointed the first chancellor of the new University of Massachusetts campus in Boston, where he encouraged an emphasis on community service. He returned to teaching in 1972 at the university, and in 1985 retired as Commonwealth Professor.
        He then entered the Boston College Law School, graduating in 1989 after an interruption for treatment of his cancer. At his death he was a lawyer in the Portsmouth office of the New Hampshire Legal Assistance corporation.
        In addition to his wife, the former Barbara Baldridge, Mr. Broderick is survived by three sons, Thomas B. Broderick of Pittsburgh, Joseph B. Broderick of Piscataway, N.J., and James B. Broderick of Peabody, Mass.; a daughter, Ann, of Iowa City; two brothers, Joseph A. Broderick of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Vincent L. Broderick of Pelham Manor, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
