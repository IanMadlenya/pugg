        Theodore M. Edison, an inventor, environmentalist and philanthropist who was the last surviving child of the inventor Thomas Alva Edison, died on Tuesday at his home in West Orange. He was 94 years old.
        He died of Parkinson's disease, said a cousin, Kim Arnn.
        After Thomas Alva Edison died in 1931, Theodore Edison took charge of his father's experimental laboratories in West Orange. His father's more than 1,000 inventions included the microphone, the phonograph and the incandescent electric lamp. His First Patent
        Theodore Edison obtained his first independent patent, for a device used in eliminating vibration in machinery, in 1932, when he was 33 years old.
        Earlier he had obtained several patents for inventions developed under the guidance and advice of his father. The son's inventions also included a stereoscopic mapping instrument that he patented in 1948. He assigned his rights to the American Geographical Society.
        Over the years, Theodore Edison was involved with Thomas A. Edison Inc., a New Jersey-based concern that was formed through the consolidation of various businesses organized by Thomas Alva Edison.
        Mr. Edison was a major supporter, in the 1950's, of efforts to preserve a three-square-mile area in southwest Florida of bald cypress trees that included large rookeries of wood ibises and American egrets.
        He is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Ann Osterhout.
