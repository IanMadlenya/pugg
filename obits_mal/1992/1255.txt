        Edward L. Devlin, the manager of entertainment publicity for CBS television, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 38 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        He joined CBS in 1987, and was promoted last year to his last post, in which he managed national media planning for radio and television.
        Earlier in his career he wrote an episode of "High Feather," a children's educational comedy series on PBS and NBC.
        He is survived by his brother, James P. Devlin of Queens.
