        Morton W. Royse, a scholar who was an expert on international conflict, died Sept. 21 at his summer residence in Old Saybrook, Conn. He was 96 years old and also lived in St. Petersburg, Fla.
        Mr. Royse died of complications resulting from a failure of the digestive system, said Kerry W. Konrad, his grandson-in-law.
        Mr. Royse was born in North Dakota. He fought in both World Wars. During World War I he saw action as a Royal Canadian Marine, a United States Marine and a bombardier pilot.
        At the outbreak of World War II he was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency, trained as a special intelligence officer, and posted to Africa and the Middle East. While under British command there, he took part in commando operations in Crete, Greece and Italy.
        He was appointed director of Refugee Operations in Italy and Greece for what became the International Refugee Organization of the United Nations. In 1950 he taught at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.
        Mr. Royse was married to Mildred Barnes, a composer and musician, for 59 years until her death in 1986. He is survived by his daughter, Lucinda Royse Webb of Manhattan, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
