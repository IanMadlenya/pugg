        Llewellyn L. Callaway Jr., a former publisher of Newsweek, died on Monday at his home in Napa, Calif. He was 84 years old.
        He died of an inoperable brain tumor, Newsweek said in New York.
        Mr. Callaway, who was known as Pete, spent 40 years in the magazine business, starting in the classified advertising department of Conde Nast Publications Inc. in 1932.
        In 1937, he joined Time Inc., where he stayed for the next 25 years. Working out of Chicago, Detroit and New York, he was successively a salesman for Time, Time International's first advertising director, advertising director of Fortune magazine and advertising director of Sports Illustrated.
        In January 1963, Philip L. Graham, president of the Washington Post Company, recruited Mr. Callaway to take over as publisher of Newsweek, which the Post Company had recently acquired.
        Llewellyn Link Callaway Jr. was born in Virginia City, Mont., the son of Lew L. Sr., a state district judge who later served 13 years as Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court.
        Mr. Callaway graduated from Dartmouth College in 1930 and took an M.B.A. at Harvard Business School two years later.
        He is survived by his son, Peter Anderson Callaway of Pojoaque, N.M.; his daughter, Elizabeth Woodson Callaway of Oakland, Calif.; and a sister, Mrs. Bruce Callaway Doering of Helena, Mont. His wife, the former Helene Anderson, died in 1985.
