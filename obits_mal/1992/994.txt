        Melvin A. Cole, a former executive with the Haagen-Dazs ice cream company, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 75 years old and was a lifelong resident of New Rochelle, N.Y.
        Mr. Cole died of lung cancer, said his daughter, Johanna.
        Mr. Cole's entire professional career was spent in the cold-food industry. His father, Arthur, helped to develop the techniques of refrigeration that led to the frozen-food industry. During the 1960's Mr. Cole was a vice president of the Schrafft's restaurant chain.
        In the 1970's Mr. Cole founded and was president of Stouffer's Ice Cream, a division of the Stouffer's food company. An expert in marketing, Mr. Cole was recruited by Haagen-Dazs in the late 1970's when it was still a small family-run enterprise. In the late 1980's he became a consultant to Haagen-Dazs, which now is a division of Grand Metropolitan, a British conglomerate.
        Mr. Cole's wife, Julia, died in 1990. He is survived by two sons, Richard M. of Philadelphia and Peter A. of Burlington, Vt.; a daughter, Joanne M. of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
