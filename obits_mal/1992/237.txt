        Walter J. Loria, a lawyer in Manhattan for 63 years and an inventor of electronic devices, died on Monday in Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
        He died of complications from a stroke suffered a year ago, his family said.
        Mr. Loria had a civil law practice that included real estate, negligence and estates cases, as well as a theater clientele. But inventions consumed nearly half his working time. Of his 12 or so patents, five became commercial successes. Among his inventions were a telegraphic code machine used by the Navy in World War II; an electronic device to measure blood pressure, and oscillators that were forerunners of ultrasonic cleaners.
        He was born and grew up in Manhattan. Mr. Loria attended Columbia University and graduated from the St. Lawrence University Law School in 1928.
        His first wife, the former Ruth Ost, died 12 years ago. Surviving are his second wife, the former Alice Frost; a son, Jeffrey, of Manhattan; a daughter, Harriet Popowitz of Upper Saddle River, N.J.; three stepdaughters, Dawn Frost of Manhattan, Jacalyn Kamenstein of North Salem, N.Y., and Constance Hoppe of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
