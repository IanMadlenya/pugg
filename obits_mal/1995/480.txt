        Alan S. Bridge, a Conceptual artist and magazine publisher, was killed on Saturday when he was struck by a craft, possibly a jet ski, while diving in Shinnecock Inlet off Southampton, L.I. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan.
        In 1980, Mr. Bridge started what he called his Apology Line, a free telephone confessional service, as a Conceptual art project. He posted leaflets and placed advertisements urging wrongdoers of all stripes to "get your misdeeds off your chest" by placing anonymous calls to the apology number, where their words would be recorded. At first Mr. Bridge played the confessions in art museums and galleries, then to other confessors, interspersed with his own commentary. The line eventually drew participants nationwide and at the time of his death was receiving some 100 calls a day.
        Mr. Bridge began publishing Apology magazine, a monthly collection of the best confessions, in 1993. He discontinued his other art projects and devoted himself full time to the confessional project, even giving lectures as "Mr. Apology."
        Mr. Bridge was born in Washington and earned degrees at the University of Chicago and American University in Washington. He began his career as a painter in Washington and in 1977 moved to New York City, where he became interested in Conceptual art.
        He is survived by his wife, Merissa Waichunas, also an artist; his parents, Lawrence and Kate Bridge of Pompano Beach, Fla., and a brother, Raymond, of Falls Church, Va.
