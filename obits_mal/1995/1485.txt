        Maurice Freeman, an authority on antique and modern silver and silver plating, died on Sunday in his Manhattan home. He was 85.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his daughter, Carole Gliedman of Scarsdale.
        In 1929, he brought to Manhattan a branch of the silver business his father had established in London, I. Freeman & Son. Initially the firm dealt in Georgian silver and old Sheffield plate, but under Mr. Freeman, the manufacture of silver and silver-plate items became an increasingly large part of the business..
        An expert on antique silver, he was consulted by auction houses and private collectors.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 62 years, Doris; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
