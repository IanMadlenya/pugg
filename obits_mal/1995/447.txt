        Stephen Roth, a London-based human rights official for the World Jewish Congress, died last Thursday in Royal Free Hospital in London. A London resident, he was 79.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, a spokesman for the American Jewish Congress, Stephen Steiner, said Tuesday.
        Dr. Roth retired in 1988 as director of the World Jewish Congress's Institute of Jewish Affairs, which he established as an international center for research on contemporary affairs of interest to Jews. He remained an international-law consultant to the institute and, at his death, was also a member of the executive body of the World Zionist Organization and chairman of the Standing Council for Central and Eastern European Jewry of the Board of Deputies of British Jews.
        He was born in the northern Hungarian town of Gyongyos and received a doctorate in law from Budapest University. In World War II he worked for the Zionist underground, smuggling Jews out of the country, and while imprisoned by the Gestapo, was narrowly spared deportation to Auschwitz by order of the Regent of Hungary.
        At the invitation of the World Jewish Congress, he joined its European head office in London in 1946 and served as its executive director from 1955 to 1977. He was appointed director of the Institute of Jewish Affairs in 1966 when it moved from New York to London.
        As an international lawyer, he wrote widely on minority rights and legislation against racism. In collaboration with Tel Aviv University, he produced an annual Survey of Legal Developments concerning anti-Semitism. He represented Jewish organizations at most meetings of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe since 1975.
        Dr. Roth is survived by his wife of 49 years, Eva Gondos Roth; a son, Peter of London; and two sisters, Dr. Edith Kepes of Scarborough, N.Y., and Alice Press of Queens.
