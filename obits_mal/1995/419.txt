        B. Dale Davis, a journalist who ended his 45-year newspaper career in 1989 as editor and publisher of The Santa Barbara News-Press in California, died on Thursday at his home in Cape May, N.J. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Davis headed The News-Press from 1984 to 1989. The year after he took the helm, the newspaper was acquired by The New York Times Company, and Mr. Davis agreed to stay on to oversee its conversion from an afternoon to a morning paper. The conversion took place in 1987.
        Before joining The News-Press, he held editorial and executive positions at The Detroit Free Press and The Philadelphia Bulletin.
        Mr. Davis spent 18 years at The Detroit Free Press, rising from reporter to assistant managing editor. He moved to The Philadelphia Bulletin in 1963 and was its executive editor for five years. The paper closed in 1982.
        In retirement he joined the International Executive Service Corps, a volunteer organization through which he trained and advised journalists in Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.
        Mr. Davis was born in Bethesda, Ohio, and graduated from Ohio State University.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia Talbot Davis; three daughters, Claudia Witham of Hampton Falls, N.H., Hillary West of Richmond, and Melissa Richmond of Walton, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
