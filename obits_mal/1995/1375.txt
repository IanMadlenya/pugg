        Frederick Fuller, a singer, writer and teacher, died on Feb. 3 at his home in Eastbourne, England. He was 86.
        Mr. Fuller, a baritone, was known for his sensitive interpretations of lesser-known vocal works, from early troubadour songs to 20th-century Serial works. He gave his first public recital at the National Gallery in London in 1940 and went on to perform and teach in the United States, Europe, Latin America and China.
        Mr. Fuller was born in Kirkham, England, and graduated from Liverpool University in 1930. He went on to study at the Sorbonne in Paris, Munich University and Harvard University. During World War II he served as assistant music officer with the British Council in South America, where he gave recitals and lectures. It was there that he met the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos, who became one of his accompanists and a lifelong friend.
        In 1947 he joined the United Nations as a translator, and in the 1950's he toured Europe, giving concerts with the lutenist and guitarist Julian Bream. He recorded on several major labels, including Decca, EMI and Columbia. In his later years, he gave master classes and developed a singing course called "Delight in Singing." He also translated German lieder.
        He is survived by four daughters, Ann, Susie, Catherine and Patsy; 10 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
