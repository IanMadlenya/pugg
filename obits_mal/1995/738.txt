        William D. Hutchinson, a Federal appellate court judge, died on Sunday at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. He was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said a colleague, Judge Edward R. Becker.
        Judge Hutchinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in 1987, also served 10 years in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and 5 years on the State Supreme Court. He lived in Pottsville, a city in east-central Pennsylvania.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise Meloney; two sons, William D. Jr., of Hummelstown, Pa., and Andrew, of Schuylkill Haven, Pa.; two daughters, Kathryn Barone of Warrington, Pa., and Louise Mara of Ardmore, Pa., and four grandchildren.
