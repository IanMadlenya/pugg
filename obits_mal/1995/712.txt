        Dr. Leon Jacobs, an expert on parasitic disease and former director of the center at the National Institutes of Health that works with foreign scientists, died on Tuesday at his home here. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, the health institutes said.
        Dr. Jacobs, who worked at the institutes for 41 years, was known for his research on blindness caused by toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease. At various times he was chief of the laboratory of parasitic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, scientific director of biologic sciences at the health institutes and associate director for collaborative research.
        He retired as director of the Fogarty International Center, which handles the institutes' dealings with scientists from other countries.
        From 1980 to 1984, he was scientific director of the National Society for Medical Research. From 1983 to 1991, he was president of the Gorgas Memorial Institute of Tropical and Preventive Medicine in Panama.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Eva, of Washington; a son, Jonathan, of Washington; two daughters, Alice, of Washington, and Abby, of Boston, and a brother, George, of Albany.
