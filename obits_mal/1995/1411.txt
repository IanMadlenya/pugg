        Milo Morrow, who headed the costume shop of the New York Shakespeare Festival for more than 20 years, died on March 14 at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Carol Fineman, a spokeswoman for the festival.
        Mr. Morrow grew up in Nebraska and moved to New York City after World War II to study at the Parsons School of Design. After working as a fashion designer for 15 years, he took up theater costuming and began to make clothes for designers including Irene Sharaff and Theoni V. Aldredge. In 1967, he and Ms. Aldredge approached Joseph Papp, head of the Shakespeare Festival, and proposed starting a costume shop for the festival at the Public Theater. Mr. Papp agreed, and the shop grew to become one of the largest theater costume departments in the country.
        No immediate family members survive.
