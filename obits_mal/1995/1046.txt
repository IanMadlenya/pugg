        Jack Maxwell Oliphant, a white supremacist who spent four years in prison for a right-wing bombing plot, died on Saturday. He was 71.
        Mr. Oliphant was an early organizer of the paramilitary movement in Arizona.  In 1987, he was convicted with two members of the Arizona Patriots organization for plotting the robbery of an armored truck carrying money from several casinos in Laughlin, Nev. The cash was intended to help finance Mr. Oliphant's white-supremacist compound at his ranch outside Kingman.
        Earlier this year, he attracted attention because of the right-wing beliefs  he shared with Timothy J. McVeigh, a former Kingman resident who is charged in the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City.
        Mr. Oliphant denied any connection with the bombing -- or Mr. McVeigh -- but  said that if the building had been blown up in the middle of the night, Mr. McVeigh would have been a national hero.
        Mr. Oliphant was born in Highland Park, Mich., and lived in Florida before moving to Arizona 19 years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret, one son, three daughters, one sister, one brother, a stepson and 12 grandchildren.
