        Louis Meyer, the first three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, died Saturday night in a Las Vegas hospital. He was 91.
        Mr. Meyer, who grew up in California, won the Indy 500 in 1928, 1933 and 1936 and was the first driver to drink milk in Victory Lane, a tradition that continues today. Seven other drivers have matched his feat, with A. J. Foyt, Al  Unser Sr. and Rick Mears the only four-time winners.
        His 1928 victory came in his first year as a full-time driver, and he came from the 28th starting position to win the 1936 race.
        In his post-driving days, Mr. Meyer and a partner bought the Offenhauser engine business in 1945. From 1947 to 1964, Offys won every Indianapolis 500.
        In 1964, Mr. Meyer sold his interest in the company so he could become the distributor for the Ford Motor Company's racing engine. Six years later, he turned the operation over to Foyt.
        Mr. Meyer is survived by a son, Louis Meyer Jr., and two daughters, Kay and Yvonne.
