        Joseph H. Mazo, a dance writer and an editor at Dance Magazine, was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on Friday. He was 56.
        The cause was heart disease, the Medical Examiner's Office said.
        Mr. Mazo wrote three books on dance. "Dance Is a Contact Sport," published in 1975, was an account of a season backstage with the New York City Ballet. His other books were "Prime Movers, the Makers of Modern Dance" and "The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater."
        He was known for his clear, vivid reporting and for criticism that was infectiously enthusiastic, though he could be cutting. Mr. Mazo reviewed theater and dance for Women's Wear Daily in the mid-1970's and wrote about dance for The Bergen Record, The New York Times and The Village Voice. He was a founding member of the Dance Critics Association.
        Mr. Mazo was born in New York City, attended the Bronx High School of Science and graduated with a degree in theater from Carnegie Institute of Technology.
        He is survived by his parents, Lou and Ann Mazo, of Miami Beach.
