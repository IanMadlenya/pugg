        Robie Mayhew Macauley, an editor and writer, died on Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 76 and had homes in Boston and South Wellfleet, Mass.
        The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said Anne Bernays, the novelist and a friend of his family.
        Mr. Macauley -- whose first name is pronounced ROE-bee -- was senior editor  and then executive editor at the Boston-based Houghton Mifflin publishing company from 1977 to 1988; senior editor at Playboy magazine, where he edited fiction, from 1966 to 1977, and editor of the Kenyon Review from 1959 to 1966.
        His writings include the novels "The Disguises of Love" (1952) and "A Secret  History of Time to Come" (1979); a book of short stories, "The End of Pity" (1957), and contributions to The New York Times Book Review and to magazines.
        He was also a founder in 1990 and a co-director of the Ploughshares International Writing Seminar, a summer program of the Emerson College European  Center in the Netherlands.
        Mr. Macauley was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., received a bachelor's degree from Kenyon College in Ohio in 1941, served in the Army in World War II, earned  a master's degree in fine arts from the University of Iowa in 1950 and studied at the University of London in 1964 and 1965. From 1946 to 1953 he taught successively at Bard College, the University of Iowa and the University of North Carolina.
        He was awarded Guggenheim and Fulbright fellowships and received an honorary  doctorate from Kenyon College in 1986.
        He married Anne Draper in 1948, and she died in 1973.
        He is survived by his second wife, Pamela Painter; a son, Cameron, of Boston; two stepsons, Wayne Skeen of San Francisco and Derek Painter Skeen of Boston; a  stepdaughter, Kate Painter of Wellfleet, and a brother, Charles Cameron Macauley of El Cerrito, Calif.
