        Steven J. Powsner, a founder and former president of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Greenwich Village, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, a spokesman for the center, Benjamin Stilp, said.
        Besides his work for the center, a hub of lesbian and gay life in New York,  Mr. Powsner left a two-and-a-half-mile mark on the city in the form of the lavender line that is painted along the Fifth Avenue route of the annual Lesbian and Gay Pride March. He paid for much of the painting of the first line in 1985.
        Born in Brooklyn and raised in Oceanside, L.I., he graduated from New York University in 1976 and the New York University School of Law in 1979. After working as an associate at a New York City law firm, he established his own practice in 1982, specializing in real estate.
        Working as a volunteer for the fledgling gay center in 1983, Mr. Powsner guided the organization through a yearlong negotiation with the city to buy the  former Food and Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street, which now houses the center.
        Mr. Powsner was elected president of the center in 1992 and served through 1994. At his death, he was a co-chairman of the center's $4 million fund-raising campaign.
        Mr. Powsner is survived by his partner, Ben Munisteri; his mother, Leanore Goodman, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; his father, Paul Powsner, of Florida, and a sister, Ilene Pachtman of Oceanside.
