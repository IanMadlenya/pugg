        Les Elgart, a trumpet player and leader of a big band, died on Saturday at the home of a relative in Dallas. He was 77 and lived in Dallas.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Lynn Elgart, the wife of his brother, Larry, a saxophonist and band leader.
        Les Elgart, who continued working until his death, began his career in the 1940's as a member of the Charlie Spivak, Woody Herman, Bunny Berigan and Raymond Scott bands. The Elgart brothers founded the Les Elgart Orchestra in 1952, when big bands were practically dead. In 1955, it was renamed the Les and Larry Elgart Orchestra, and recordings on the Columbia label helped make it one of the country's leading dance bands.
        In later years, the brothers would sometimes split up, each leading a band named after himself. The later ensembles played mostly at private functions around the country and on cruises.
        The Elgart style has been called crisp, with clipped phrasing, rich saxophone ensembles and dark, lustrous brass sounds, played at easy, relaxed band tempos. The two bands separated for good in 1967, Lynn Elgart said, and the Les Elgart band will now cease operation.
        Les Elgart was born in New Haven and grew up in Pompton Lakes, N.J.
        In addition to his brother, of Longboat Key, Fla., he is survived by his wife of 18 years, the former Joerene Williams, and three stepchildren, Scott and Paul Ingram and Beth Fountain, all of Dallas.

        An obituary on Monday about Les Elgart, trumpet player and leader of a big band, misstated the band's plans. Joerene Elgart, his wife, who is its longtime manager, said the band would indeed continue to perform.
