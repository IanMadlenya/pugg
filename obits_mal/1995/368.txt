        William T. O'Donnell, who engineered the rise of the Bally Manufacturing Corporation from a manufacturer of pinball games into the world's largest producer of slot machines, died on Tuesday at his home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Jane.
        Mr. O'Donnell, who had a long and stormy career, was forced into retirement in 1980 when New Jersey gambling regulators ordered Bally to disassociate itself from him because they said he had ties to organized crime. He denied the accusations.
        Mr. O'Donnell joined Bally Manufacturing as an amusement machine salesman in 1946, when the company was known as the Lyon Manufacturing Company. In 1963, he and several partners bought Lyon and Mr. O'Donnell was appointed as chief executive.
        The company changed its name to Bally Manufacturing in 1968 and went public a year later. Mr. O'Donnell soon expanded the company's operations from pinball machines into computerized games, a move that paved the way for the development of video poker machines, an operation that the company has since sold.
        But as the company, which is now known as Bally Entertainment, expanded into casino operations, Mr. O'Donnell ran into problems after an inquiry by law-enforcement officials into accusations that he had ties to underworld figures. His resignation as chairman and chief executive of Bally Manufacturing was the price demanded by New Jersey regulators in order for the company to operate a casino in that state.
        Mr. O'Donnell, who also had a home in Winnetka, Ill., is survived by his wife, Elly; three daughters, Kathleen O'Donnell of Wilmette, Ill.; Ann Devlin of Palm Desert, and Jane Lau of Glencoe, Ill.; four sons, William Jr., of Winnetka, Jack, of Colorado Springs, Timothy, of Tucson, Ariz., and Daniel, of San Francisco, and 14 grandchildren.
