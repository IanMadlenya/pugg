        Bruce Duff Hooton, founder of the monthly newspaper Art/World, died on Wednesday at his home in Upper Brookville, L.I. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Hooton was the editor and publisher of Art/World from its inception in 1975 until it folded in 1991. The journal shunned the look of many monthly arts publications and was printed on newsprint in a tabloid format. The diverse roster of writers included the psychologist Julian Jaynes, the theater critic Brendan Gill and the artists Paul Jenkins and Robert De Niro Sr.
        Mr. Hooton was an arts reviewer for Arts Magazine in 1959 and an art critic and editor at The New York Herald Tribune from 1962 through 1965. During those years, he wrote extensively on Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning, recognizing the increasing influence of the American abstract art movement of the 1960's and 1970's.
        Mr. Hooton studied at Southwestern College, the Memphis Arts Academy and Harvard University. Born in Waukegan, Ill., he moved in 1953 to New York City, where he started out as general manager of the Living Theater, a center for experimental theater.
        After editing Drawing magazine, he founded the Drawing Society, an organization aimed at the appreciation of fine-arts drawing, in 1960. He also headed the New York office of the American Archives of Art and was executor director of the Sculptors Guild, a nonprofit educational organization of professional sculptors.
        He was author of "Mother and Child in Modern Art" (Duell, Sloan & Pierce, 1964).
        His first marriage to Claire Hooton ended in divorce in 1960. Mr. Hooton is survived by his wife, Theodora; a son, Hart, of Manhattan; a sister, Betty Little of Reston, Va.; and three stepchildren, Thomas L. Higginson of Rectortown, Va., Elizabeth Higginson Rideman of Cambridge, Mass., and Robert Winthrop Higginson of Santa Fe, N.M.
