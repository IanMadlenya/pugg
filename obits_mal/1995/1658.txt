        Joseph Villa, a pianist who specialized in the Romantic repertory and who was regularly heard in chamber music and as a recital accompanist, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Steven Gray, his companion.
        Mr. Villa was born in Garfield, N.J., on Aug. 9, 1948, and studied at the Juilliard School with Sascha Gorodnitzki. He later studied privately with Claudio Arrau and Olga Barabini, and he made his debut in a recital at Alice Tully Hall in 1972.
        Mr. Villa recorded several albums of works by Liszt. One was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque Liszt in 1978. He also made recordings of works by Scriabin and Saint-Saens. As an accompanist, he gave performances with the sopranos Jessye Norman and Victoria de Los Angeles, the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and the violinists Joseph Fuchs and Eugene Fodor. And he was a frequent participant in chamber music performances at Bargemusic in Brooklyn.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his parents, Joseph F. and Mary Villa, of Garfield.
