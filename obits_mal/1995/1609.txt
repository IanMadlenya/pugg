        Charles Bell, a Photo-Realist painter specializing in still lifes, died on Saturday at New York University Hospital. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lymphoma, and he had AIDS, said Louis K. Meisel, his New York dealer.
        Mr. Bell was born and brought up in Tulsa, Okla., and received a bachelor of business administration degree at the University of Oklahoma in 1957. He then became a lieutenant in the Navy, and served for two years. Mr. Bell worked as an accountant and became the comptroller at International Nickel's New York office; he remained there through 1980.
        Mr. Bell's works were exhibited at the Meisel Gallery and elsewhere, beginning in 1969. Toys, dolls, marbles, gumballs and pinball machines were his subjects. The best of these, the art historian and critic Henry Geldzahler wrote in his book "Charles Bell: The Complete Works 1970-1990" (Abrams, 1990), were in the pinball series. They are "the artist's greatest achievement -- visually, technically and technologically," Mr. Geldzahler said.
        Mr. Bell's paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and many other museums.
        He is survived by his brother, John Bell of Denver.
