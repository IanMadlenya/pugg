        Dr. Glenn Halstead Brown, a chemist at Kent State University who helped advance the use of liquid crystals in watches, calculators and other devices, died on April 18 in a nursing home in Hudson, Ohio. He was 79 and lived in Kent, Ohio.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, a university spokeswoman said.
        In 1965 Dr. Brown founded the university's Liquid Crystal Institute, which now bears his name. It was the nation's first academic center devoted solely to basic and applied research on liquid crystals, which flow as liquids but maintain the ordered structure characteristic of crystals.
        He directed the center until 1983 and then continued his research full time in his own laboratory.
        Dr. Brown is survived by his wife, Jessie Adcock Brown; two sons, Larry H., of Columbus, Ohio, and Donald, of Milford, Ohio; two daughters, Nancy Brown of Beavercreek, Ohio, and Barbara Brown of Stowe, Ohio; a brother, Harold, of Renfrew, Pa.; a sister, Esther Britt of Columbus, and three grandchildren.
