        Dr. Leonard S. Hirschfeld, a periodontist and a longtime associate clinical professor of periodontology at Columbia School of Dental and Oral Surgery, died yesterday at New York Cornell Medical Center. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his son Tom.
        Dr. Hirschfeld had offices in midtown Manhattan, where he treated luminaries from Greta Garbo to Eduard Sheverdnadze.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from Townsend Harris High School, Columbia College and the School of Dental and Oral Surgery. In 1944 he joined the practice of his father, Dr. Isadore Hirschfeld, one of the first periodontists, who treat the structures supporting the teeth.
        In addition to his son Tom, of Manhattan, Dr. Hirschfeld is survived by his wife, Phyllis; his sons Alan and John, of Manhattan; his sister, Harriet Keyserling of Beaufort, S.C., and five grandchildren.
