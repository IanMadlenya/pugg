        William S. Richman, who led what was once the nation's largest maker of upholstered furniture, died on Thursday at his home in Glencoe, Ill. He was 73.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Marilyn.
        Mr. Richman, who was born in New York, was president and chief executive officer of the Stratford Company of Chicago from 1972 to 1986, when it became the nation's largest manufacturer of upholstered furniture. He was also vice chairman of the Mohasco Upholstered Furniture Corporation, Stratford's parent in Fairfax, Va., from 1971 to 1986.
        A leader in his industry, Mr. Richman was co-chairman of the Upholstered Furniture Action Council. He was also a trustee of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        He came to Chicago in 1949 as a buyer for the Mandel Brothers Department Store after graduation from the City College of New York and the Harvard Business School. In 1957, he was named sales manager for the Futurian Corporation, a maker of upholstered furniture, which later became Stratford.
        In 1966, he was appointed executive vice president and chief operating officer of Stratford.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by his son, Daniel, of Clinton, Wash.; two daughters, Elizabeth and Ruth, both of Chicago, and three grandchildren.
