        Wyman Pendleton, an actor in theater, films and television, died last Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from a head injury suffered in a fall at his home, said a friend, Joseph Cali.
        Mr. Pendleton's Off Broadway credits include "The American Dream," "The Zoo Story" "The Child Buyer" and "Happy Days" (in French, opposite Madeleine Renaud) in the 1960's.
        He made his Broadway debut in "Malcolm" in 1966. He also played the title role in the 1968 Broadway production of Edward Albee's "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung." He acted in a number of regional theater productions, including the Hartford Stage Company and the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn.
        He appeared in the film "The Seduction of Joe Tynan" in 1979 and in the television series "Toma."
        He is survived by a brother, Robert, of Wayzata, Minn.
