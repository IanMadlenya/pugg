        Maurice Rosenburg, a professor at Columbia University's School of Law who became a well-known advocate for judicial reforms on the state and Federal levels, died on Friday at his home in White Plains. He was 75.
        The cause was a progressive neurological disease, a son, Dr. Richard Rosenburg, said.
        In his 39-year tenure at Columbia, Mr. Rosenburg wrote and lectured extensively on the legal system, particularly on issues of procedures and access to the courts.
        He deplored the staggering increases in cases clogging the courts and proposed measures to ease the burden, like replacing juries in small-claims cases with arbitrators. "Can it actually be good for a society to be quick to quarrel in court?" he asked in an interview in 1977.
        From 1971 to 1975, he was head of the Advisory Council on Appellate Justice and was later on the Council of the Role of the Courts. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed him Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Office for the Improvements in the Administration of Justice.
        He was also on the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary in New York City from 1962 to 1977 and in 1980 was appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger to the Federal Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure, where he served until 1987.
        He was a graduate of Syracuse University and received his law degree from Columbia.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, David, of Pittsburgh, and Richard, of Morristown, N.J., and five grandchildren.
