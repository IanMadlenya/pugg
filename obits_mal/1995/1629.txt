        Jerry Brown, a Manhattan specialty shop owner who offered couturiers an array of rich natural fabrics for nearly half a century, died on Wednesday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his nephew, Dr. Bertram Brown, said.
        Mr. Brown opened his fabric shop on Hester Street on the Lower East Side in 1948 and it quickly became known to dressmakers, designers and seamstresses from the city's top custom-order houses. In 1974, he moved his shop to West 57th Street, a more convenient setting for his chic clientele.
        A believer in the superiority of natural fibers, Mr. Brown made trips to Europe to select cottons, silks and woollens. Some fabrics came from couture houses, others were made exclusively for him. His suppliers included Gerondeau, Pierre Brivet and Dogni. Smaller bolts of materials came from couturiers like Heim, Ricci, Chanel, Balenciaga and Balmain.
        Born in Lida, Poland, he fled at the outbreak of World War II, traveling across the Soviet Union to Japan. He arrived in Seattle aboard one of the last ships to leave Japan before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
        In addition to his nephew, Mr. Brown is survived by three nieces: Corinne Goodstein and Lydia Dubner of North Miami Beach, Fla., and Harriet Saperstein of Detroit.
