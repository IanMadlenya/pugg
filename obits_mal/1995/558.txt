        Donald J. Byrnes, chief executive of the Spalding and Evenflo Companies, died on Wednesday near his home in Tampa, Fla., while driving to his office. He was 69.
        The cause was a heart attack, a company spokesman said.
        The Spalding and Evenflo Companies, a subsidiary of the Cisneros Group, a private investment firm, makes sporting goods, infant-feeding products and juvenile furniture. In addition to serving as chief executive at that company, Mr. Byrnes was the president and chief executive of another Cisneros Group subsidiary, Pueblo Xtra International, which owns retail property and Blockbuster Video franchises in Puerto Rico.
        Mr. Byrnes joined the Evenflo Juvenile Furniture Company as the marketing manager in 1971. He served as the vice president of both marketing and operations before he became president in 1981. When Evenflo and Spalding Sports Worldwide were acquired by the Cisneros Group in 1984, he was appointed president and chief operating officer of the new joint company. In March 1994, he was named chief executive; in the same month, he assumed the leadership position at Pueblo Xtra.
        Mr. Byrnes graduated from the University of Montana in 1949 with a degree in accounting. He worked for the General Motors Corporation from 1949 through 1957, serving in various sales and promotion capacities. In 1957, he joined the General Electric Company and rose to become the manager of marketing.
        Mr. Brynes is survived by his wife, Carol Jean, of Tampa; his daughter, Karen Byrnes Johnson of Valparaiso, Ind.; three sons, Don, of Marion, Ohio, David, of Surfside, Calif., and Ron, of Greensboro, N.C., and eight grandchildren.
