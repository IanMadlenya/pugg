        Richard A. Donnelly, a former writer and editor for Barron's, died on Monday  at his home in Navesink, N.J. He was 64.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Donnelly joined the staff at Barron's, the financial weekly, in 1968 and for many years wrote its Commodities Corner column, also serving as commodities  editor. He retired four years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Caroline Hansen Donnelly, executive editor of Money magazine; two sons from an earlier marriage, Peter, of Brooklyn, and George, of Belmont, Mass.; three daughters from that marriage, Elizabeth and Helen Donnelly, both of Atlanta, and Sarah Donnelly of Highland, N.Y.; two brothers, Patrick and Dennis, both of Staten Island; four sisters, Geraldine Landgraf, Madeline Connolly and Mary Ellen O'Donovan of Staten Island, and Cornelia Ryan of Point Pleasant, N.J., and six grandchildren.
