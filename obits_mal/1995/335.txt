        Donald Sinclair, an English country veterinarian who was the model for a character in books by James Herriot, including "All Creatures Great and Small," and in the television series of the same title, died on June 28, The Scotsman, an Edinburgh-based newspaper, reported on Monday. He was 84 and lived in Thirlby in Yorkshire.
        Mr. Sinclair was the inspiration for Siegfried Farnon, a character who has been called twinkly, avuncular and a bit absent-minded in his television incarnation.
        James Herriot was the pen name of Mr. Sinclair's former veterinary partner, Alf Wight, who died earlier this year. The best-known Herriot book, "All Creatures Great and Small" came out in Britain in 1971. It is still in print, in the United States from St. Martin's Press, Bantam and G. K. Hall.
        The Herriot stories center on the adventures of three veterinarians in Yorkshire before and during World War II, which is not surprising since Mr. Sinclair, his brother Brian, and Mr. Wight worked together there during that period. Donald Sinclair was said to have disliked the attention the stories drew to him.
        The Scotsman reported that the actor Robert Hardy, who portrayed Siegfried on television, was a close friend and frequent house-guest of Mr. Sinclair and his wife, and that "Herriot fans who knew Mr. Sinclair insisted that Robert Hardy had his character and humor exactly right."
        But Mr. Hardy said he did not meet Mr. Sinclair until after he had settled on his own interpretation of the character. "I always wished I'd known him before," he was quoted as saying. "It would have helped me to perfect a much more interesting character."
        Brian Sinclair died in 1988, and Donald Sinclair's wife of 53 years, Audrey, died last month. He is survived by a daughter, Jan, and a son, Alan.
