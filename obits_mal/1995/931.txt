        Philip Bernstein, a leader in virtually every facet of American Jewish cultural, civic and philanthropic life as chief executive of the Council of Jewish Federations from 1955 to 1979, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital.  He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        A native of Cleveland who graduated from the University of Michigan and received a master's degree from Case Western Reserve University, Mr. Bernstein spent his entire career working with Jewish organizations, initially in Cleveland and after 1943 in New York with the national council. The organization coordinates the activities of about 200 central community groups, which raise $750 million a year for a range of charities in the United States and abroad.
        During his 25 years as the council's chief executive and as a consultant since his retirement, Mr. Bernstein helped establish the National Foundation for Jewish Culture and the National Jewish Community Relations Council, helped reorganize the Jewish Agency for Israel and design Project Renewal to combat poverty in Israel, and provided professional guidance for this year's merger of  the New York Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the New York United Jewish  Appeal, which created the world's largest Jewish communal service.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two sons, Joel, of Beersheba, Israel, and Paul, of Boston; a daughter, Judith Tracy of Boston, and four grandchildren.
