        Albert B. Alkek, an oilman and philanthropist whose $77 million helped expand the nation's largest hospital complex, died on Wednesday in San Antonio. He was 85 and lived in Bandera, Tex., about 40 miles west of San Antonio.
        The cause was a fall in which Mr. Alkek struck his head, said Sheriff James MacMillan of Bandera County.
        Mr. Alkek, a college dropout, turned his attention in the 1930's to the infant Texas oil industry, which eventually brought him wealth and distinction as a patron of the state's health care, education and arts.
        He spent 17 years working for Pierce Petroleum until it was bought by the Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1948. His new boss, Harry Sinclair, helped him form his own oil company, the Sinclair Alkek Company. Together, the two men built the state's first petroleum products pipeline.
        Mr. Alkek bought Mr. Sinclair's interest in 1952, and the company became the Alkek Oil Corporation, now based in Houston. In 1987, Forbes magazine estimated Mr. Alkek's net worth at $310 million.
        Among his donations were ones to expand the nation's largest hospital complex, the Texas Medical Center in Houston, including a $25 million gift to Baylor College of Medicine, $22 million for Texas A&M University's Albert B. Alkek Institute of Biosciences and Technology, and $30 million for the Albert B. and Margaret M. Alkek Hospital, which is scheduled to open next year at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
        Survivors include his wife, Margaret; a daughter, Margaret Williams of Houston; a son, Albert Jr., of Houston, and two sisters, Maggie Cattan and Kathryn Taweeh, both of Victoria, Tex.
