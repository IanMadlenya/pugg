        Benjamin Weintraub, an expert on bankruptcy and corporate reorganization who advised the City Council during New York's fiscal crisis in the 1970's, died on Jan. 14 at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son-in-law, Michael J. Crames of Scarsdale, N.Y.
        In 1975, as the city's financial situation worsened, Mr. Weintraub was appointed by Paul O'Dwyer, the City Council President, to advise on the course the city could follow in the event of default, and what the options of a declaration of bankruptcy would mean to the city.
        He was an author, with Prof. Alan M. Resnick of Hofstra University, of "Bankruptcy Law Manual" (1980), which was revised in 1986 and 1992.
        With Harris Levin, Mr. Weintraub wrote "Practical Guide to Bankruptcy and Debtor Relief" (1964.) His book "What Every Executive Should Know About Chapter 11" was published in its third revision last year.
        He was born in the Bronx, and graduated from City College in 1926 and New York University School of Law in 1929. The firm he co-founded in 1933, Levin & Weintraub, merged in 1990 with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, where he was special counsel. He also held adjunct professorships at New York Law School and Nova University School of Law.
        He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Jeanne; a daughter, Elinor, of Scarsdale; a son, Charles, and a sister, Rose Koerner, both of Manhattan, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
