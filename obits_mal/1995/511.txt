He studied at San Francisco State University, the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music and Art, where he earned a master's degree in composition. He studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco.
        He began his musical career as a jazz pianist before becoming an arranger for many leading vocalists, including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Ray Charles, Mel Torme, Lena Horne, Carly Simon and Aretha Franklin. He was producer and arranger for Barbra Streisand's hit recording of "The Way We Were" and worked with Michael Jackson.
        Mr. Paich also orchestrated many film scores, including those for "Pretty Woman," "The Fugitive" and "Prince of Tides." In television, he was musical director for Glen Campbell, Andy Williams and Sonny and Cher. He received an Emmy award for his music for "Ironside."
        He is survived by his wife, Linda, and a daughter, Lori Cohen, and a son, David, a rock musician, both of Los Angeles.
