        Msgr. John Joseph McClafferty, a Roman Catholic priest long associated with his church's national social and charitable work, died on Monday at the Carmel Richmond Nursing Home in Old Town, S.I. He was 89 and lived at the home and was its chaplain since 1981, after becoming pastor emeritus at St. Francis de Sales Church on East 96th Street in Manhattan.
        A certified social worker, Monsignor McClafferty was close to Francis Cardinal Spellman. In the 1930's and 40's, he was executive secretary of the Legion of Decency, which reviewed and rated films for Catholics. He also served as senior chaplain for the Fifth Regiment of the New York National Guard; he had the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        Born in New York City, Monsignor McClafferty held degrees from Cathedral College, St. Joseph's Seminary and Catholic University of America, as well as a diploma from the New York School of Social Work. He was ordained in 1930.
        Monsignor McClafferty was the assistant director, then the director, of the Division of Social Research of Catholic Charities until 1947, when Catholic University appointed him dean of its National Catholic School of Social Service. From 1955 to 1963, he was assistant to the rector for development at Catholic University.
        In 1963, Cardinal Spellman appointed him pastor of the Church of St. Peter in New Brighton, S.I. He moved to St. Francis de Sales three years later.
        He was elevated to monsignor in 1953 by Pope Pius XII.
