        Ross F. Anderson, a retired San Francisco retail-chain executive, died on Sunday at his home in Menlo Park, Calif. He was 75 and also had a home in Rutherford, Calif.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Anderson retired in 1979 as a director and group president of Federated Department Stores and chairman of the parent company's I. Magnin chain. He then served as an independent corporate director and a consultant for several companies.
        Born in Osceola, Neb., he graduated from Stanford University and received a master's degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1943.
        He started his business career with the Macy's Group in San Francisco and in 1962 was promoted to vice president and general manager of the San Francisco operations of Macy's. He moved to Federated two years later and was elected chairman and chief executive officer of I. Magnin in 1972.
        He was the president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 1977, and was a past director of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
        Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife of 49 years, Patricia Garrett Anderson; two sons, Ross S., of Manhattan, and Bruce G., of Mill Valley, Calif.; a daughter, Lynn A. Poole of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.
