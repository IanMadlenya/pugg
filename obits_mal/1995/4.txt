        Robert F. Buckhorn, a former chief spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, died on Sunday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, L.I. He was 68 and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said. Mr. Buckhorn had traveled to Long Island to attend a family wedding.
        As the F.A.A.'s deputy administrator for public affairs, Mr. Buckhorn briefed journalists on plane crashes, the safety of the airways and other agency business. He had served as a public affairs officer with the National Transportation Safety Board for 10 years before he joined the F.A.A. in 1984. He retired last year.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Buckhorn served in the Navy during World War II as an aviation radioman. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1951 and joined United Press International as a reporter in 1954, becoming aviation editor in Washington in 1962. He left the news agency in 1974.
        He was the author of a biography of Ralph Nader, "Nader, The People's Lawyer," published in 1972.
        Mr. Buckhorn is survived by his wife of 38 years, Rita T.; three sons, Robert Jr., of Tampa, Fla., Dean, of Hopkins, Minn., and Burke, of Washington; a sister, Julia Sparrow of Baldwin, L.I., and two grandchildren.
