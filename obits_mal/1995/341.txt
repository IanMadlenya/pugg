In addition, he was counsel to the Catholic Press Association for 25 years, retiring in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Carolyn Doran Brennan; two daughters, Carol M. Burke of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and Ann G. McRitchie of Bronxville; a son, Thomas A. Jr., of Eastchester, N.Y., and 10 grandchildren.
