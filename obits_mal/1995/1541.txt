        David Nickerson Lawrence, a former marketing executive who had scores of letters and snippets of wry commentary and irreverent verse published in New York City and Westchester County newspapers, died on Tuesday at his home in North Salem, N.Y. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Lawrence seemed to be at his best when poking fun at the foibles of politicians, especially when it came to public finance. In one of a dozen or so published submissions to The New York Times, he called the Federal Government "my left-hand pocket" and the New York State Government "my right-hand pocket."
        In 1986, when he read that New York City school officials were delighted with a new program that had kept 800 potential dropouts in class at a cost of $6 million the first semester, Mr. Lawrence wrote The Times: "Someone who learned math outside New York City should point out that this works out to $7,500 a student." It would be more economical and at least as effective, he suggested, to offer each student a $5,000 prize for graduating.
        Mr. Lawrence, a native of Boston, graduated from Stanford University. He worked in international marketing for the Foredon Company and American Home Products, among other companies. He later was a bilingual eligibility examiner for the Westchester County Department of Social Services. He retired last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Rayn; a son, Jonathon of Newtown, Conn.; three daughters, Susan, of Peekskill, Catherine, of Allegan, Mich., and Grace Stewart of Menomonie, Wis.; a brother, William, of Pottstown, Pa., and five grandchildren.
