        Jacob Rader Marcus, a longtime member of the faculty of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati and a founding director of the American Jewish Archives there, died on Tuesday at his home in Cincinnati. Rabbi Marcus, who was the country's oldest Reform rabbi, was 99.
        A member of the college's faculty from the time of his ordination in 1920, Rabbi Marcus specialized in Jewish history. In the course of a career in which he wrote and edited about 300 books and articles, he also taught and advised about 2,000 rabbinical students.
        In 1959 he was named Adolph S. Ochs professor of American Jewish History, and from 1965 until his death, he occupied Hebrew Union's Milton and Hattie Kurtz Distinguished Service Chair in American Jewish History.
        He was an active member of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the oldest rabbinical organization in the United States, which named him its honorary president in 1978. Rabbi Marcus held a number of honorary degrees and received numerous awards for distinguished service to history and Jewish culture.
        In 1987, the City of Cincinnati commemorated his 50 years at the same address by naming the corner on which he lived Marcus Square.
        Rabbi Marcus, who was born in New Haven, Pa., on March 5, 1896, began his rabbinical training at the age of 15 at the Hebrew Union College. With the exception of two years of military in World War I and graduate studies in the 1920's in Europe, where he earned a doctorate from the University of Berlin, Rabbi Marcus spent his career in Cincinnati.
        His wife, the former Antoinette Brody Marcus, his daughter, two brothers and  a sister died before him.
