        He spent two years with the King Features Syndicate as editor of the Sunday magazine of The New York Mirror before beginning a 25-year run with The New Yorker in 1947.
        As executive editor, Mr. Hofeller served under the magazine's founding editor, Harold Ross, until Mr. Ross'sdeath in 1951, and afterward under William Shawn, Mr. Ross's successor.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hofeller is survived by a son, Gregory, of Erie, Pa., and a grandson.
