        Dr. Richard Ganslen, a pole-vaulter who became the leading author on the technical aspects of the event, died on Friday in Denton, Tex., where he lived. He was 78.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his son Brian.
        Dr. Ganslen's book, "Mechanics of the Pole Vault," is in its ninth edition and has been translated into German and Russian. The Newark native was a 1939 graduate of Columbia and received a Ph.D. in physiology and kinesiology from Illinois in 1952. He taught anatomy, physiology and zoology at Rutgers, Illinois, Arkansas, U.C.L.A. and Texas Woman's University and worked from 1963 to 1967 on the Gemini space project.
        In an era in which the best pole- vaulters had not reached 15 feet, he won the national indoor championship in 1938, the Penn Relays in 1938 and 1939 and the Millrose Games in 1939 and 1940. He last competed at age 63 and won a masters competition at 10 feet 6 inches.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Milnie; two daughters, Vickie Saunders of Birchrunville, Pa., and Wendy Jones of Denton; three sons, Bruce of Lewisville, Tex., and Kim and Brian of Denton, and four grandchildren.
