        Mattityahu Peled, a former Israeli Army major general and member of Parliament who led initial Israeli efforts toward a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization, died yesterday, the Israeli Embassy in Washington said. He was 72 and had suffered from cancer.
        After Israeli's seizure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 war, Mr. Peled became one of the first and strongest advocates of handing over territory to the P.L.O. in return for a peace settlement.
        In 1976 Mr. Peled was chairman of the Israeli Council for Israeli-Palestinian Peace, which called on the Government to open negotiations with the P.L.O. The council linked its appeal to a United Nations Security Council debate on the crisis in the Middle East, and Mr. Peled defied strong Israeli opposition to talks by meeting with the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, in Paris.
        The council's plan called for an independent Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, an Israeli withdrawal to its pre-1967 borders and a joint Israeli-Arab administration of Jerusalem.
        In 1983 Mr. Peled led another attempt to reach a settlement with the P.L.O., meeting with Mr. Arafat again. The result was an unofficial communique calling for "just and lasting peace in the Middle East."
        A year later Mr. Peled was elected to Parliament as a member of the Progressive Party for Peace, which advocated an independent Palestinian state.
        Ten years later a settlement with the P.L.O. was finally reached, but it fell considerably short of the plan advocated by Mr. Peled.
        Mr. Peled was born in Palestine and served in a number of Jewish militias seeking to establish an independent Jewish state. He later joined the Israeli Army, rising through the ranks to become a major general.
