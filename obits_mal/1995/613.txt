        Jack E. Murphy, a publicity director for the New York Philharmonic who also worked at Carnegie Hall, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74 and also had a home in Italy.
        The cause was bone cancer, a Carnegie Hall spokesman said.
        Mr. Murphy served in the Marine Corps during World War II and attended the University of Florence after the war. He was managing director of the Italian Chamber Orchestra from 1951-57 and then returned to New York City, where he worked for the Herbert Barrett Management firm.
        He joined the New York Philharmonic in 1975 as associate director of publicity and was coordinator of the 1976 Celebration of Contemporary Music, co-sponsored by the Philharmonic and the Juilliard School. He retired from the Philharmonic in 1981 and then worked for a period at Carnegie Hall.
        He is survived by his companion, Anthony Carobine, and a brother, Ed, of St. Maries, Idaho.
