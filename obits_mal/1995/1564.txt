        Dr. A. L. Loomis Bell Jr., who developed new diagnostic methods during 46 years as a heart and lung specialist at St. Luke's Hospital, died on Tuesday at his home in Birdsboro, Pa. He was 72.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Dr. Bell was a former director of the pulmonary and critical-care unit at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and chief of its division of pulmonary medicine. He created one of the city's first cardiac catheterization laboratories at St. Luke's.
        He started teaching at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1953 and became a full professor in 1977. When he retired in 1993, he was named a professor emeritus of clinical medicine.
        Dr. Bell was the fourth generation of physicians from his family connected with St. Luke's. In their honor, he raised the funds for a Bell Family Chair in Pulmonary and Critical-Care Medicine at Columbia, established in 1992.
        Alfred Lee Loomis Bell Jr. was born in Englewood, N.J., graduated from Wesleyan University and Harvard Medical School and completed his training at St. Luke's. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the National Heart Institute of the United States Public Health Service and was named director of the cardiopulmonary laboratory at St. Luke's in 1953.
        He developed training programs for staff members to handle cardiac arrests and resuscitation. In 1961, he introduced a new technique to catheterize the left ventricle of the heart for better diagnosis of heart-valve diseases.
        Dr. Bell is survived by his wife of 48 years, Eleanor Batchelder Bell; two sons, Alfred L. L., 3d of Hillsdale, N.J., and Dr. William O., of Winston-Salem, N.C.; two daughters, Sophie B. Kelley of Minneapolis and Mary B. Stemler of Corona Del Mar, Calif., and 10 grandchildren.
