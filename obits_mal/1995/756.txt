        The Rev. Bela Varga, Hungary's first post-war Speaker of Parliament, who left the country as Communist rule approached, died on Friday. He was 92.
        Father Varga was born Feb. 18, 1903. He became a Catholic priest and was a founder of the Independent Smallholders Party. He helped Polish refugees flee the Nazis during World War II.
        He was arrested by advancing Soviet troops in 1945 and sentenced to death but was later released when his captors learned he had also helped Red Army prisoners of war.
        Father Varga was elected to Parliament, where he became speaker in 1946. But  he left the country in 1947 as the Communists took over.
        He emigrated to the United States and served as a priest in New York before returning in 1991.
