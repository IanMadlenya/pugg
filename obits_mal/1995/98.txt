        Jimmy Raney, one of the most gifted and influential postwar jazz guitarists, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Louisville, Ky. He was 67.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Jon.
        Mr. Raney's improvising, at its best, made clear that he had developed a lucid and distinct conception of both the swing and be-bop vocabularies. His lines often resolved on odd, pungent notes, and mid-solo his phrases rolled easily from his guitar as he constructed lengthy passages. His harmonic conception could be bleak and a touch bitter; he rarely relied on obvious or easy note choices. And he always varied his long lines with melodies and riffs.
        Mr. Raney's first important professional work came with the pianist Lou Levy in Chicago in 1944, and for the next two decades he performed with some of the biggest names in jazz. He joined Woody Herman's orchestra in 1948, and after leaving that group he performed with Artie Shaw, Buddy DeFranco, Red Norvo, Les Elgart and Al Haig, among others.
        It was during the late 1940's and early 50's that Mr. Raney began an association with the saxophonist Stan Getz, which produced a series of exceptional recordings and brought Mr. Raney's playing to a wider audience. He maintained a busy recording schedule, also working with the pianists Sonny Clark and Hall Overton.
        In the 1960's Mr. Raney moved to New York and did a substantial amount of playing in recording and television studios. In the 70's, his career picked up, especially in Europe and Japan. He recorded several fine albums for the Xanadu label, and in the 1980's he kept a fairly consistent touring and recording schedule, performing with his son Doug, a guitarist. His last series of recordings, uniformly strong, were made for the Criss Cross label in the Netherlands.
        In addition to his son Jon, of Queens, he is survived by his son Doug, of Copenhagen.
