        Robert Beauchamp, a figurative painter known for a colorful, expressionistic style, died on Wednesday at his home in New York. He was 72 and also had a home in Wellfleet, Mass.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Howard Scott, his dealer.
        Mr. Beauchamp was born in Denver and began his studies at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center under the painter Boardman Robinson. He also studied with Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Mass.
        Mr. Beauchamp moved to New York City in the early 1950's. He had many one-man shows, beginning with the Tanager Gallery in 1953 and including the Monique Knowlton Gallery and, most recently, M-13. He taught at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Illinois and the University of Arizona. For the last 15 years he had taught at the Art Students League in New York.
        His imagery included symbolic figures that were both frightening and amusing: exotic birds, monkeys, wild horses and other beasts appeared over and over in his work. He absorbed from Abstract Expressionism a reverence for robust brushwork and color, splattering paint and often smothering his images with bright patterns. Nonetheless, he remained at heart a figurative artist.
        He is survived by his wife, Nadine.
