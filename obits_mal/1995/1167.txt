        Hans-Otto Steiff, former president of Margarete Steiff G.m.b.H., makers of teddy bears and other animal toys, died on Dec. 31 in his hometown of Giengen in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. He was 75.
        He suffered a long illness after a series of strokes, Rolf H. Honniger, managing director of the Steiff international holding company, said.
        Mr. Steiff earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Stuttgart Technical University in 1950 and then joined the family business, which was founded in 1904 by his great-grandaunt, Margarete Steiff, who was known as Gretel. He became president in 1951 and president of the holding company in 1981. He retired in 1984.
        Gretel Steiff started out making toy elephants from cloth for friends when, in 1880, her brother Fritz discovered customers would sweep them off shop shelves. She added fluffy material almost by chance, and Steiff toy animals were born.
        Teddy bears gained their names from Teddy Roosevelt, and by 1907 Steiff had shipped a million of them to America alone. Now collectors' items, one Steiff bear fetched $171,000 at a Christie's auction in London in December.
        Mr. is survived by his wife of 46 years, Birgit Eitle Steiff; two sons, Joachim and Rainer, and a daughter, Beatrice.
