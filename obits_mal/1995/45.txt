        Raymond A. Meany, Jr., who until recently was Connecticut's Deputy Commissioner of Administrative Services and Director of Personnel and Labor Relations, died yesterday at his home in West Hartford. He was 60.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Meany was Deputy Commissioner from January 1991 through January 1995 under Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. In a letter to Mr. Meany in January, Mr. Weicker thanked him for his work to contain health-care costs for state employees, revise the state personnel act and reduce workers compensation costs.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Meany graduated from Fordham University in 1957 and did graduate work at Harvard University and the Hartford Graduate Institute. From 1962 to 1990, he was with the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company in Hartford, becoming senior vice president for human resources and a member of the senior management committee.
        Mr. Meany is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Crispo; five children, Mary-Liz Lichtenfels of Winnetka, Ill., Kathleen Kerchaert of Arlington, Mass., Brian Meany of Rowayton, Conn., Leah Kristensen of Buenos Aires, and Meagan Meany of Boston; five grandchildren; two brothers, the Rev. Stephen, of Staten Island and James, of Silver Spring, Md., and three sisters, Patricia Rand of New Haven and Joanne Handy and Mary Ann Meany, both of San Francisco.
