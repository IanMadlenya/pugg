        Carl F. J. Overhage, a retired professor of electrical engineering and former director of the Lincoln Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on Aug. 7 at St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 85 and lived in Santa Fe.
        The cause was a stroke, said Arthur Hemmendinger, a friend, who reported the death.
        Born in London, Dr. Overhage divided his career between photography and electronics. He graduated from the California Institute of Technology, where he also earned his master's and doctoral degrees.
        He worked for both the Technicolor Motion Picture Corporation and the color-control department of the Eastman Kodak Company. In 1944 he was issued a patent for a design of eyeglasses that made color movies appear three-dimensional.
        He spent much of World War II at the Radiation Laboratory of M.I.T. and returned to it in 1955 when it had become the Lincoln Laboratory. He was a laboratory division chief in charge of aircraft control when he was named director in 1957.
        He retired in 1973 after overseeing an M.I.T. program to develop a system of information-transfer techniques for libraries.
        Dr. Overhage is survived by his wife of 55 years, Katya G. Overhage.
