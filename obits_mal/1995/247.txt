        Dr. Aaron Karush, a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, died on Monday at New Rochelle Hospital. He was 83 and lived in New Rochelle.
        The cause was a heart attack, a university spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Karush was on the faculty of the university's Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research from 1948 until his retirement as professor emeritus of clinical psychiatry 30 years later.
        He came to professional notice in 1959 when he and two colleagues, Dr. Lionel Ovesey and Dr. Abram Kardiner, published a set of three papers titled "A Methodological Study of Freudian Theory." It was one of the first direct challenges to the central role in human conduct that Freud had assigned to the libido.
        Dr. Karush was also known for his work on the treatment of ulcerative colitis, an ulcerous inflammation of the colon that affects about 40 of every 100,000 Americans. Its cause remains uncertain, and Dr. Karush investigated the possibility that it was partly psychological in origin.
        Dr. Karush is survived by his wife, Lola; two sons, Nathaniel and Robert; a sister, Ruth, and four grandchildren.
