        Paul Bernard Shore, the founder, chairman and chief executive of one of North America's largest carton producers, died on Sunday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 74 and also had homes in Manhasset, L.I., and Manhattan.
        He died in his sleep, said Floyd S. Glinert, executive vice president of the  Shorewood Packaging Corporation.
        Mr. Shore, who was born in Brooklyn and was self-taught, incorporated the company in 1966 and built it into an operation with 2,700 employees and almost $400 million in annual revenue. It specializes in record covers and packaging for videos, toiletries, cigarettes, food and computer software, and its clients  include Sony Music, Procter & Gamble, Estee Lauder and Kodak.
        Shorewood Packaging, which Mr. Shore established in Farmingdale, L.I., moved  its headquarters to Manhattan this year. It has 10 plants in the United States and Canada.
        Mr. Shore was a founder and supporter of the T. J. Martell Foundation for Leukemia, Cancer and AIDS Research, a music-industry charity that raised more than $90 million over the last 20 years.
        Mr. Shore is survived by his wife of 47 years, Ellin Davis Shore; two daughters, Bryan Resnick of Great Neck, L.I., and Mindy Goldman of Roslyn, L.I.; two sons, Andrew, of Brentwood, Calif., and Marc, of Rye Brook, N.Y., Shorewood's president and chief operating officer; a sister, Lillian Shindelman  of Great Neck, and 10 grandchildren.
