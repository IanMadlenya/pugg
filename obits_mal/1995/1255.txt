        Rachid Mimouni, a prominent Algerian writer, died on Feb. 12 in a hospital in Paris. He was 49 and had lived in Morocco for the last two years.
        The cause was acute viral hepatitis, the British newspaper The Independent reported.
        His last novel, "The Misfortune," was published in French in 1993. The publication of his 1982 novel "The Diverted River" in France brought him wide acclaim and helped generate a large French-speaking readership for his work. .
        Born outside Algiers, Mr. Mimouni studied there and in Montreal, worked as a teacher in Algeria and eventually turned to writing full time.
        In a 1992 interview, he defended the nondemocratic means the Algerian Government had resorted to in its conflict with Islamic fundamentalists. And in his fiction and nonfiction, he explained why fundamentalism was flourishing.
        His work includes seven novels and a short-story collection published in 1990, which has been published in English as "The Ogre's Embrace," as well as in French.
