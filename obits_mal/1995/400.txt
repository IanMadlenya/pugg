        Constantin W. Boldyreff, a Russian emigre who fought Soviet Communism as a youth in the Soviet Union and later as a college professor in the United States, died on Tuesday at the Tolstoy Center Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y. He was 85.
        The son of a general in the White Russian Army who was shot by the Communists in 1932, Mr. Boldyreff fled to Yugoslavia, where he received an engineering degree, managed British-American mining operations and, by his later account, joined other young Russian emigres in establishing the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, an underground anti-Communist group.
        After coming to the United States in 1947, Mr. Boldyreff, who had served with the Royal Yugoslav Army until it capitulated in World War II, told a tale of derring-do in which he twice escaped from the Gestapo and worked as an underground operative in Germany, Poland and occupied Russia to fight both the Nazis and the Communists.
        After the war he was credited with organizing thousands of displaced persons and keeping them out of Soviet hands.
        In the United States he served as head of the Russian department at Georgetown University. But he lost his job, his daughter, Helen Semler, said yesterday, because he refused to give up his political work, which included testifying before Congress in support of American intervention in the Soviet Union.
        In addition to his daughter, of Silver Spring, Md., Mr. Boldyreff is survived by his wife, Antonia, of Valley Cottage, three grandchildren and a great-grandson.
