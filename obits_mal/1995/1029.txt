        Arthur Frederic Kip, an expert in solid-state physics and a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley, died on Saturday at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley. He was 85 and lived in Berkeley.
        The cause was a heart attack, the university said.
        Dr. Kip, working in the branch of physics dealing with the fundamental properties of solids like structure, binding forces, electrical, magnetic and optical qualities and their effects, led a Berkeley research team for many years. The team, focusing on the interactions of matter with microwave radiation, conducted experiments that resulted in nearly 100 papers in scientific publications.
        In the 1950's, just after the discovery of transistors, his group used its expertise to take some of the first measurements of the basic properties of semiconductors, detailing the structure of the materials. He also contributed significantly to the study of the atomic structure of metals.
        Born in Los Angeles, Dr. Kip graduated from Berkeley, where he also received  his Ph.D. in physics in 1939. In World War II he served with a Navy group researching antiaircraft and anti-submarine warfare.
        He returned to Berkeley in 1951 to help establish a research group that applied microwave resonance techniques to the investigation of solids. He continued those studies until his retirement in 1976.
        He was the author of a widely used introductory college textbook, "Fundamentals of Electricity and Magnetism" (McGraw-Hill; 2d ed., 1968), which remains in print.
        Dr. Kip is survived by his wife of 51 years, Joan Hill Kip; a daughter, Jennifer K. Bier of Albany, Calif.; a son, Jonathan, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Elizabeth Roach of San Diego, and Margaret Nichols of Monterey, Mass.,  and two grandchildren.
