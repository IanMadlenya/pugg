        Timothy Jenkins, a tenor who sang at the Metropolitan Opera for more than a decade, died on Thursday in Durham, N.C. He was 44 and lived in Amarillo, Tex.
        He died of a heart attack while exercising in preparation for a performance, his manager, Merle Hubbard, said.
        Mr. Jenkins was born in Amarillo, where he began studying voice, German and Italian as a child. He completed his studies at the University of North Texas in 1977 and placed second in the Metropolitan Opera's regional auditions in New Orleans two years later.
        He made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Jacob Schmidt in Kurt Weill's "Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny," and during the 1980's sang in Beethoven's "Fidelio," Wagner's "Tannhauser," "Parsifal" and "Walkure," Mozart's "Idomeneo" and Verdi's "Macbeth."
        Mr. Jenkins was a winner, with Gary Lakes, of the Lauritz Melchior Heldentenor Award in 1981. Apart from his appearances at the Met, he sang at the White House in 1983 in a concert broadcast on television.
        He is survived by his parents, Dale and Sally Jenkins of Amarillo, and a son, Scott, of New York City.
