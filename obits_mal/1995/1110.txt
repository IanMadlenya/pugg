        Dr. Mitchell Kietzman, a retired psychology professor at Queens College, died on Jan. 9 at the Parkmont Rehabilitation and Nursing Center in Fremont, Calif. He was 65 and had been a resident of Staten Island for 27 years until moving to Huntington, Calif., in 1989.
        The cause was Lewy body disease, a neurological disorder, said Dr. Karen Kietzman, his daughter.
        His research in psychiatry dealt extensively with perception in schizophrenia. He conducted research at Biometrics Research in Brooklyn both when it operated independently and after it became part of the department of psychophysiology at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Dr. Kietzman was a research associate at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and a visiting professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
        He taught at Queens College from 1962 until his retirement in 1989. Born in Kankakee, Ill., he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands in 1951, a master's in psychology from Claremont College in 1957 and a Ph.D. in experimental psychology from the University of California-Los Angeles in 1961.
        Besides his daughter Karen, who lives in Brooklyn, he is survived by his wife, Nicky; a second daughter, Kathryn, of Manhattan; a son, Kenneth, of Fremont, Calif.; a brother, Robert, of Orange County, Calif., and a grandchild.
