        Joe Fawbush, an art dealer whose SoHo gallery was known for showing the artworks of a high number of women, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. He was 38 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Raoul Reyes, a friend.
        Mr. Fawbush was born in Arlington, Tex., and majored in art history at the University of North Texas at Dennison. He worked briefly as an art handler at the Fort Worth Art Museum before coming to New York in 1978 to work for Brooke Alexander, an art dealer and print publisher. In 1983, Mr. Fawbush opened Fawbush Editions, publishing prints, multiples and illustrated books by such artists and writers as Joan Nelson, Kiki Smith, Donald Sultan and David Mamet.
        His interests shifted from publishing to exhibiting and by 1987, he was running his business as the Fawbush Gallery with a partner, Thomas Jones. Artists who had their first New York gallery shows there included Ms. Smith, whose 1987 exhibition presaged the growing prevalence of art about the body, as well as Rachel Lachowicz, Paula Hayes, Karin Davie and James Nares. The gallery also represents Christian Marclay, Michelle Stuart, Leone and Macdonald, Elliott Green and Betty Goodwin. Mr. Jones said yesterday that the gallery would remain open.
        In addition to Mr. Jones, his companion, Mr. Fawbush is survived by his parents, Daisy and Eugene Fawbush, and a sister, Dorinda Leonard, of Arlington.
