        Darren Robinson, the 450-pound member of the rap group the Fat Boys, who were known for vocally mimicking the sounds of a drum machine, died on Sunday at his  home in Queens. He was 28.
        The cause was cardiac arrest during a bout with respiratory flu, said Charles Stettler, who named and managed the band. Mr. Robinson was rapping for friends when he fell off a chair and lost consciousness.
        Mr. Robinson, who used the nicknames Buff Love and the Human Beat Box, was a member of the comical rap trio along with Mark Morales (or Prince Markie Dee) and Damon Wimbley (Kool Rock-Ski).  The Fat Boys were signed to the independent  record label Sutra after winning a rap contest in Brooklyn in 1984 and released  seven albums over the next five years. Most of the songs were about food and other joys of obesity.
        On the group's most popular album, "Crushin'," which reached No. 8 on the pop charts, they collaborated with the Beach Boys on the song "Wipeout." They also appeared in the films "Krush Groove," "Knights of the City" and "Disorderlies' before breaking up in 1989.
        Shortly before his death, Mr. Robinson had completed an agreement with Sony Records to work as a label producer. He was also working on a Fat Boys reunion album, which his band mates say they will complete as a tribute.
        He is survived by his parents, John and Ellaveen; a brother, Curt; two sisters, Barbara and Renee, and a son, Quentin, all of New York City.
