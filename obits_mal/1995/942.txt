        Giorgio Fini, a restaurateur who first packaged and sold homemade pasta, died on Monday in a Rome clinic. He was 70.
        Mr. Fini died several days after entering the clinic for heart trouble.
        After World War II, he built a fortune by selling dried tortellini in a package. In the 1950's, Mr. Fini turned his father's sausage factory in Modena,  in northern Italy, into a restaurant and then an international food company.
        Besides pasta, Fini's brand became known in Italy for packaged cold cuts, wine, balsamic vinegar and other traditional foods.
        In 1989 he sold his 500-employee company and its brand name to the Kraft food company. The family also opened a luxury hotel in Modena.
        He is survived by his wife, son and daughter.
