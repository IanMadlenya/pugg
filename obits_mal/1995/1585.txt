        Igor Hajek, a Czech editor and translator active in efforts to liberalize culture and life in Communist Czechoslovakia in the 1960's, died on April 19 at his home in Glasgow, The Independent reported on Thursday. He was 64.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, the former Marcella Maskova.
        Dr. Hajek was a senior lecturer in Czechoslovak studies at Glasgow University from 1983 until his death.
        He was born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, earned a doctorate in English at Charles University in Prague and became a translator of American and English novels into Czech.
        From 1964 to 1969 Dr. Hajek was a foreign literature editor at Literarni Novini, the weekly organ of the Czechoslovak Writers' Union, which was prominent in the struggle to make Czechoslovak life freer.
        In 1968, in what became known as the Prague Spring, Czechoslovakia briefly became the most democratized Communist state. But in August it was invaded by Warsaw Pact forces and a political crackdown ensued. Literarni Novini was suppressed, and public use of Dr. Hajek's name was banned in Czechoslovakia for two decades.
        He chose to live in exile and became a lecturer at Lancaster University in England for a dozen years before going to Glasgow.
        In addition to his wife of 40 years, his survivors include a daughter, Barbora Hajek of London, and a grandson.
