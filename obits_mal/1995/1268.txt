        Arthur Stang, a real estate developer whose projects included the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle, died on Sunday at his home in Lake Worth, Fla. He was 85.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his son, Robert.
        In addition to the 44-story Gulf and Western Building, completed in 1970, Mr. Stang helped create apartment houses, shopping centers, industrial parks and luxury housing developments, mostly in and around New York City.
        His projects included the 200,000-square-foot Dalewood Shopping Center and the 100-family Sky Meadow Estates in Hartsdale, N.Y.; the 142-acre Fairview Industrial Park in Elmsford, N.Y.; the 200-apartment high-rise at 220 East 67th Street, and the 120-apartment high-rise at 311 East 50th Street.
        Mr. Stang, who was born in Manhattan, was a graduate of City College and Brooklyn Law School. He was admitted to the bar in 1934 and practiced law until 1942. In 1937, he also became his father-in-law's partner in real estate development. Between 1960 and 1975, when he retired, Mr. Stang was the vice president in charge of the construction division of Realty Equities, a publicly held realty investment corporation.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Stang is survived by his wife, the former Blanche Feder, of Lake Worth, and a grandson.
