        Anthony P. Manginelli, a New York businessman who was the leader of the Loyal Order of Moose, died on April 13 at his home in Syracuse. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for the 1.2-million-member fraternal organization.
        Mr. Manginelli was elected Supreme Governor of the order, which is based in Mooseheart, Ill., at itsannual convention last June. He spent the last 10 months traveling to lodges across the country to oversee their community service and charitable work.
        The order, which has some 2,000 lodges in the United States, Canada, Britain and Bermuda, conducts community service programs and works closely with charitable operations like the American Heart Fund, the Cancer Society and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. It operates a 1,200-acre campus and tuition-free school in Illinois for children in need and a retirement community near Jacksonville, Fla.
        His wife of 42 years, Edna, died in 1993. He is survived by a son, Michael of San Diego, Calif.; a sister, Ann Klementowski of Syracuse, and a brother, Michael, of Holly Hill, Fla.
