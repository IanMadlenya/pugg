        Simon Geller, who operated a one-man classical music station in Gloucester, Mass., for a quarter-century and battled with the F.C.C. to keep it, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Rockville, Md. He was 75 and lived in Rockville.
        Mr. Geller was born in Lowell, Mass. After working in radio in New Jersey, he moved to Gloucester in 1964 because, he told a reporter, it was the biggest town on the East Coast without a radio station. For the next 24 years he broadcast classical recordings on WVCA-FM, 13 hours a day, 7 days a week, offering brief descriptions of the music before playing a selection and soliciting money once every hour. The radio's call letters stood for "Voice of Cape Ann," and the phrase became attached to Mr. Geller himself.
        The setup was primitive. He operated out of his apartment, subsisting primarily on donations from among his estimated 43,000 listeners, within the 35-mile radius reached by the station. When it was time to take a lunch break or run an errand, he simply shut the station down.
        Mr. Geller was renowned for his gruff manner and his crotchets, which included a hearty and often-expressed dislike for the town of Gloucester and its citizens. It was not always clear whether he operated his station out of a love for classical music or a hatred of rock.
        In 1982, he nearly lost his operating license to the Grandbanke Corporation, which promised to offer more diverse programming. But in 1985 the Federal Communications Commission, which had first ruled in Grandbanke's favor, reversed itself and handed Mr. Geller victory after 11 years of battle. In 1988 Mr. Geller sold the station for $1 million and moved to Las Vegas. The station now operates as WBOQ-FM in Beverly.
        He is survived by two brothers, Eli and Irving, of Rockville.
