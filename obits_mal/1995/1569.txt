        Jacob Shaham, a theoretical astrophysicist and professor of physics at Columbia University who helped expand the knowledge of neutron stars, died last Thursday at Presbyterian Hospital. He was 52 and lived in Riverdale in the Bronx.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Meira Shaham.
        Neutron stars are extremely dense objects, often with the mass of the sun packed into a diameter of several miles. They are thought to be born in the collapse of normal stars in supernova explosions. The resulting spinning neutron stars emit periodic radio waves and are known as pulsars. It is through the detection of pulsars that the neutron stars reveal themselves.
        Professor Shaham and his associates at Columbia found that neutron stars sometimes increased their rates of spin after picking up mass from companion stars. They proposed the mechanism by which this takes place, and predicted that such pulsars would eventually evaporate their companion stars.
        Professor Shaham was born in Tel Aviv and educated at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, where he received a Ph.D. in 1971. He did research there and at the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana before joining Columbia in 1984. He was appointed deputy chairman of the physics department and co-director of the Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory last year.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Orli, of Manhattan, and two sons, Shai, of Boston, and Gil, of Manhattan.
