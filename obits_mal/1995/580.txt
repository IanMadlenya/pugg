        Roy Hemming, a writer, critic and broadcaster specializing in music, film and video, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. He was 70.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, said Dr. Craig Metroka.
        Mr. Hemming was the author of five books, including "The Melody Lingers On: The Great Songwriters and Their Musicals," "Discovering Great Music" and "Discovering Great Singers of Classic Pop," written with David Hajdu.
        Mr. Hemming was born in Hamden, Conn., and received a bachelor's degree from Yale and a master's degree from Stanford. He was a film critic for daily newspapers at both universities.
        He was editor of Video Review magazine in the early 1980's, and a critic and feature writer for Entertainment Weekly, Stereo Review, Musical America, Gramophone and Opera News, among other publications. He also wrote extensively on film and music during his 20 years as a writer and editor of general news for Scholastic magazines.
        He is survived by his mother, Anna Hemming of New Haven.
