        Bradley Ball, a founding member of Act Up, the protest group for people with AIDS, died on Jan. 24 in his home in Manhattan. He was 34.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Michael Paller of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Ball was the first administrator of Act Up, an acronym for AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, after its formation in 1987. He was also instrumental in founding Queer Nation, a militant gay rights organization, in 1989. He was a graduate of Fordham University and an adviser to WHY (Women Here for You), a women's support group, at the Women's Health Center at the university.
        In addition to Mr. Paller, Mr. Ball is survived by his mother, Virginia Ball of Tulsa, Okla.; his father, F. Roy Ball of New Orleans; two brothers, Brian, of Calgary, Alberta, and Roger, of Tulsa, and a sister, Margaret Peery of Austin, Tex.
