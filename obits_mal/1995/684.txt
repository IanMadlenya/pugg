        Gavin Ewart, whose outpouring of poetry paired technical mastery with a witty, earthy sensibility, died on Monday. He was 79.
        "Bring me light verse to liquidate my sorrow," Mr. Ewart wrote in his first collection, "Poems and Songs," published in 1939. After a long fallow period, during which he served in the Royal Artillery in World War II and then worked as a copywriter at an advertising agency, he returned to verse with the publication of "Londoners" in 1964.
        In the years afterward, Mr. Ewart blossomed into one of England's most prolific poets. "Pleasures of the Flesh" followed in 1966, and "The Deceptive Grin of the Gravel Porters" in 1968.
        When Sir John Betjeman died in 1984, Mr. Ewart was mentioned as a possible successor as Poet Laureate. But his celebration of sex and sensuality, and occasional flippancy, kept him from becoming a safe, middle-class favorite like  Betjeman.
