        Harry Leykis, a longtime union leader at The New York Post, died on Saturday  at his home in Selden, L.I. He was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said Karen Phillips, former secretary of the New York Newspaper Guild's Post unit. Mr. Leykis was the unit chairman in 1993, when a weeklong walkout by reporters, editors and advertising, clerical and circulation workers faltered, amounting to a devastating defeat for the union.
        Mr. Leykis, an advertising makeup chief and publications supervisor, was among 287 guild workers dismissed after the strike.
        Mr. Leykis, who was born in the Bronx, went to work for The Post in 1950. He  was elected head of The Post's guild unit in 1992.
        He is survived by his wife, Laura O'Mara Leykis; two sons, Jimmy, of Bayport, L.I., and Tom, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Anne Mattarella of Rocky Point, L.I., and Terry Mennona of Miller Place, L.I.; a sister, Elizabeth Masciangelo of Ridge, L.I.; a brother, Robert, of Patchogue, L.I., and four grandchildren.
