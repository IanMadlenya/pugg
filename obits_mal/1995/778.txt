        Don Faurot, whose achievements as head coach and athletic director at the University of Missouri for more than 30 years earned him a spot in the College Football Hall of Fame, died today. He was 93.
        Mr. Faurot died of congestive heart failure in the University of Missouri hospitals, the university said.
        Mr. Faurot coached the Tigers from 1935 through 1956, after nine years at Kirksville State Teachers College, now Northeast Missouri State. At Kirksville,  his teams had a 26-0 record from 1932 through 1934, the best small-college record in the country.
        At Missouri, he took over a team that had won only two games in three years and the athletic program was $500,000 in debt. Under him, the Tigers were 101-79-10 in 19 seasons, won three conference titles and went to four bowl games. When he retired as athletic director in 1967, the program was in the black and the capacity of the football stadium, now named for him, had doubled to more than 50,000.
        He was born in Mountain Grove, Mo., and despite losing the first two fingers  on his right hand in a boyhood farming accident, he was a 145-pound fullback at  Missouri in 1923 and 1924, and played basketball and baseball.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Columbia; three daughters; seven grandchildren, and his brother, Fred, of Columbia.
