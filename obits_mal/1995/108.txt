        Lemuel Dary Wright, professor emeritus of biochemistry and nutritional sciences at Cornell University, died on Friday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 82 and a resident of the Oak Hill Manor nursing home in Ithaca.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Professor Wright joined the Cornell faculty in 1956 and retired in 1978. His research encompassed the vitamin B complex, microbiological methods of assay that quantify vitamins, bacterial growth factors and the biogenesis and metabolism of the DNA building blocks pyrimidines.
        Before going to Cornell, he worked as a research director for the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme and took part in the early discovery of the functions of some vitamins. He received a Borden Award in Nutrition in 1958 for discovering mevalonic acid, or mevalonate, a key compound from which cholesterol is synthesized. His later research at Cornell advanced the understanding of how that fatty material is formed, an important question to medical science because of its relation to heart disease.
        Professor Wright was born in Nashua, N.H., and studied chemistry at the University of New Hampshire, where he earned a master's degree in 1936. He received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from Oregon State University in 1940.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Ernestine Quarles Wright of Ithaca; five daughters, Carolyn Corson of Ithaca, Martha Solomon of Manhattan, Priscilla Pazzano of Gambrills, Md., Barbara Falgout of Vienna, Va., and Nancy Matyas of Calgary, Alberta; two brothers, Philip, of Missoula, Mont., and Paul, of Port Charlotte, Fla., and nine grandchildren.
