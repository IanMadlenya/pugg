        Richard H. Nolan, a retired New York labor leader and state official, died on Wednesday at the North Broward Medical Center in Pompano Beach, Fla. A long-time resident of Eastchester, he was 87 and lived in Hillsboro Beach, Fla.
        He suffered a short illness, according to the New York State AFL-CIO.
        Mr. Nolan was born in the Bronx. He joined the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 15 in 1928. He became its New York regional director in 1959 and was elected executive vice president of the International, then 450,000 strong, in 1964.
        He was the first and only executive president in the International Union's history. He assisted in negotiations and acted as a trouble-shooter.
        An expert on pension matters, he was regarded as the principal architect of the International Union's reciprocity program for 34 separate pension plans. It enabled members to take their pensions with them when a new workplace meant a move to another union local.
        In the 1960's, he also served as a vice president of the state council of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. He retired from the operating engineers union in 1969.
        In 1972, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller named him to the New York State Mediation Board, and in 1974 he served as special assistant for labor affairs to Gov. Malcolm Wilson.
        Mr. Nolan is survived by two sons, Richard Jr., of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Donald, of Ipswich, Mass.; a brother, Joseph, of Claremont, N.H., and two grandchildren.
