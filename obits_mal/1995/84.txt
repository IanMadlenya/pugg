        Gilbert Durieux, the chief executive of Matif S.A., the French commodity and financial futures market, died on April 28 in Cannes, France. He was 47 and lived in Paris.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, Matif said in announcing the death yesterday.
        Matif, which stands for Marche a Terme International de France, is one of the larger futures exchanges in the world. Mr. Durieux, who arrived at Matif in 1986, led the exchange's drive to modernize itself and to attract more French and foreign financial institutions.
        Mr. Durieux graduated in 1970 from Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales, a college in Paris specializing in business and finance, and then began his business career with Grindlays Bank. He joined the London futures clearing organization, International Commodities Clearing House Ltd., in 1976. From there, Mr. Durieux set up the clearing house's Paris office, and helped establish Matif.
        At Matif, Mr. Durieux was closely involved in developing Globex, the international and electronic trading system set up with both Reuters P.L.C., the financial news agency, and the American futures markets. He also helped to link Matif to Germany's futures exchange and was responsible for the French market's opening a New York office to attract American business.
        Mr. Durieux is survived by his wife, Joelle, and a son, Xavier.
