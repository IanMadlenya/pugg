        Robert Clancy, an educator who was director of the Henry George School of Social Science from 1946 to 1970 and founder of the Henry George Institute, died on Feb. 9 in Jackson Heights Hospital in Queens. He was 80 and lived in Jackson Heights.
        The cause was colon cancer, said George L. Collins, the executive director of the Manhattan school.
        Founded in 1932, the school teaches the economic and social philosophy of the 19th-century economist and philosopher Henry George, who saw land speculation as the scourge of the time and the cause of poverty and inequality.
        George argued that society, not the landowner, was responsible for the increase in land value, and that the increase should be taxed and thereby returned to society. He saw such a levy as the only tax necessary and, thus, was an early proponent of a single tax. George twice ran unsuccessfully for mayor of New York City in the late 1800's.
        Mr. Clancy expanded the school's role in adult education and through establishment of the institute set up a worldwide network of correspondence courses in subjects related to George's social and economic concepts. Students from more than 200 countries enrolled in courses.
        In 1952 he wrote a biography of the founder of the school, "A Seed Was Sown: The Life of Oscar Geiger." He was co-founder and chairman emeritus of the Council of Georgist Organizations, an international association of Georgist schools.
        He is survived by a sister, Norma Hempe of Massapequa, L.I.
