        Harley A. Wilhelm, a metallurgist who helped to establish the Department of Energy's Ames Laboratory at Iowa State University, died on Oct. 7 in the nursing unit of Story City Memorial Hospital near Ames, Iowa. He was 95 and formerly lived in Ames.
        Dr. Wilhelm assisted the Manhattan Project in World War II by devising a process for casting large ingots of high-purity uranium and thorium metals at reduced cost. His invention, which remains in use, led him and his team of scientists to provide the metal base for the atomic energy program of the early 1940's.
        A graduate of Drake University, he received his Ph.D. from Iowa State and began to work for the university's atomic energy research staff in 1942. In 1945 he was named associate director of the Ames Laboratory, a center created to investigate energy resources for the Federal Government. It has since branched out into high-speed computer design, environmental cleanup and the synthesis of  new materials.
        Dr. Wilhelm served as associate director until 1966. He continued as principal scientist and professor of chemistry and metallurgy until his retirement five years later.
        Dr. Wilhelm is survived by three daughters, Lorna Livingston and Gretchen Wilhelm of Minneapolis and Myrna Elliott of Ames; a son, Max, also of Minneapolis; 10 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. His wife, Orpha Lutton Wilhelm, died in 1991.
