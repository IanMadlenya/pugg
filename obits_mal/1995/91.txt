        Arthur J. Hill, a prominent Florida banker and securities executive who was one of the highest-ranking African-American officials in the Bush Administration, was found dead on Wednesday morning in his hotel room at the Airport Hilton in Elizabeth, N.J., where he had attended a dinner of the Republican Governors Association the night before. He was 46 and lived in Miami.
        The office of the Union County Medical Examiner said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        Mr. Hill managed the public financing branch of New York-based Prudential Securities in Boca Raton, Fla. He had held a number of banking positions in that state, including chairman and president of the Peoples National Bank of Commerce, Miami's only black-owned bank.
        In 1989, President George Bush called him to Washington, where he first headed the Government National Mortgage Association and later became Commissioner of Housing at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His responsibilities during his years in Washington included the management of more than 40 Government-backed mortgage insurance programs totaling $400 billion, the preservation and rehabilitation of housing, and the management of HUD's foreclosed properties.
        Mr. Hill, who grew up in Jacksonville, Fla., was a graduate of Florida Memorial College in Miami and of Southern Methodist University's Graduate School of Banking. He also earned a master's degree in agriculture economics at the University of Florida.
        He is survived by his wife, Licia Green-Hill; two daughters, Lolita Hill of Washington and 1-year-old Maria; a sister, Clatties Dawkins; and two brothers, Dr. Charmie L. Hill and the Rev. Kenneth Hill.
