        Thomas Fauss Gould, a scholar of Greek literature and philosophy who was a professor emeritus of classics at Yale University, died on May 13 at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 67 and had lived for many years in New Haven.
        In announcing the death last week, the university reported the cause as a liver ailment.
        In a career starting in the 50's, he schooled undergraduates in classical Greek and Greek mythology, and he translated classical Greek literature into English. He wrote "Platonic Love" (Free Press of Glencoe, 1963) and "The Ancient Quarrel Between Poetry and Philosophy" (Princeton University Press, 1978.)
        Mr. Gould was born in East Liverpool, Ohio. He received undergraduate and master's degrees, as well as a Ph.D., from Cornell University.
        Surviving are two brothers, John, of Great Falls, Va., and James, of Encinitas, Calif.
