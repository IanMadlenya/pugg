        Jesse B. Sokoloff, a real estate developer and leader of Jewish philanthropic agencies on Long Island, died on Saturday in his home in Hewlett Neck, L.I. He was 77.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He was a former president of the Jewish Community Services of Long Island. He also served on the boards of the Federation Employment and Guidance Service and UJA-Federation of New York.
        Mr. Sokoloff, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Ansie; a son, Bruce, of Bedford, N.Y.; a daughter, Lisa Sokoloff-Steinberg of Tenafly, N.J., and four grandchildren.
