        Benjamin Goldstein, a retailing executive in Detroit and New York who helped members of minorities establish their own businesses, died on Sunday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Rockville, Md. He was 83 and a resident of Washington.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter Carole G. Cohen of Washington.
        During a 30-year career in retailing, Mr. Goldstein led Kern's Department Store in Detroit and the Franklin Simon Store in Manhattan. In 1965, he went to work for the Small Business Administration in Washington, putting into practice programs for minority entrepreneurs developed by the Office of Economic Opportunity.
        In 1969, he founded the National Council for Equal Business Opportunity. Partly financed by the Ford Foundation, its purpose was to give technical assistance to minority entrepreneurs.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Goldstein graduated from New York University in 1932 and went to work for Klein Brothers in Manhattan. In 1940 he became an executive at Winkelman Stores, a chain of women's specialty shops in Detroit, and moved to Kern's in 1958. He returned to New York to head Franklin Simon, which went out of business in the late 1970's.
        Besides his daughter Carole, he is survived by his wife, Charlotte; another daughter, Judith G. Schaeffer of Putney, Vt.; two stepdaughters, Valerie Weinberg of Farmington Hills, Mich., and Liesel Flashenberg of San Jose, Costa Rica; a stepson, Lewis Flashenberg of Silver Spring, Md.; four grandchildren; seven stepgrandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
