        Aron Pressman, a former head of the Russian department at New York University, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Sunderland, Mass. A former resident of Manhattan, he was 97 and had lived in Amherst, Mass., since moving from Manhattan in the 1960's.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        A native of Tbilisi, Georgia, Professor Pressman came to the United States with the Russian Grand Opera in 1921 as a musician and coach. He worked as an artist in New York until World War II, when he was engaged to develop Russian-language courses for the United States Army.
        He joined the N.Y.U. faculty after the war. He also taught summer courses at Middlebury College in Vermont for most of his career. He retired from N.Y.U. in 1964, then helped to build the Russian department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, where he continued to teach until 1971.
        Professor Pressman is survived by his wife, Louise; two daughters, Leah Siegel of Great Neck, L.I., and Zora Essman of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a brother, David, of Manhattan; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
