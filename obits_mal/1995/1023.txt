        Dr. Edward Daniel Sullivan, a scholar on 19th-century French and comparative  literature who was dean of the college at Princeton University, died on Nov. 21  in the Medical Center at Princeton. He was 82 and lived in Jamesburg, N.J.
        The cause was a stroke, said Carol Rigolot, executive director of Princeton's Council of the Humanities, of which he was the chairman from 1974 to 1982. The council, formed in 1953, fosters teaching and research in the humanities at all  levels.
        Dr. Sullivan retired in 1982 as Avalon Professor Emeritus of the Humanities  after 36 years at Princeton. He began as an instructor in French in 1946 after teaching at Harvard University for four years.
        As dean of the college from 1966 to 1972, he was responsible for all aspects  of undergraduate education. He also presided over the advent of coeducation at Princeton.
        Princeton began to make a few exceptions for women in 1961, allowing a few into its graduate programs. The graduate schools finally opened their doors to women in 1968, and the college followed suit a year later.
        Dr. Sullivan was the author of many articles and reviews on literary, educational and social subjects, and the French Government awarded him the Legion of Honor and the Academic Palms, for services to education in France, for his achievements. His books included "Maupassant the Novelist" (Greenwood reprint, 1978), and "Maupassant: The Short Stories" (Barron's reprint, 1963).
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Boston Latin School, Exeter Academy  and Harvard University, from which he also received master's and doctoral degrees. Princeton promoted him to full professor of French and chairman of its  new department of romance languages and literature in 1958, a post he held until 1966.
        Dr. Sullivan is survived by his wife of 55 years, Eleanor Harrold Sullivan; two sons, Brian, of Princeton, and Barry, of Mechanicsville, Pa., and four grandchildren.
