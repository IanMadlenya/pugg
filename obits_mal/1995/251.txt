        George H. Duncan, a radio executive who helped establish a new kind of rock-and-roll programming format in the late 1960's and 1970's, died on Saturday while playing in an alumni lacrosse match at Cornell University in Itacha, N.Y. He was 63 and had homes in Scarsdale, N.Y., and Montecito, Calif.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At a time when pop music programming was confined to a Top 40 format, the repetition of hit singles, Mr. Duncan was among a group of broadcasters trying to increase the variety. They turned to the FM spectrum because it was freer of commercial pressure, and the format became known as progressive FM, or album-oriented rock.
        As general manager from 1968 to 1971 of WNEW-FM, the New York station that at the time was owned by Metromedia Inc., he assembled a roster of announcers that included Scott Muni, Jonathan Schwartz, Allison Steele and Rosko.
        Promoted to president of Metromedia's radio division in 1971, he oversaw the introduction of the format in stations in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Cleveland, among others.
        Before he retired in 1985, he worked for three years as a senior vice president in the development of cellular telephones and paging networks.
        Mr. Duncan is survived by his wife, Mary Joan; his mother, Natalie Agnes Milde of Beverly Hills, Fla.; his son, Keith of San Francisco, and two daughters, Kathryn of Stamford, Conn., and Patricia of Manhattan.
