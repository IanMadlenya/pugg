        Erich Kunz, an Austrian bass-baritone who sang with the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg Festival and the Vienna Volksoper for more than three decades, died on Sept. 8 in Vienna. He was 86.
        A consummate character actor, Mr. Kunz had a broad repertory that ran the gamut from Beckmesser in Wagner's "Meistersinger" and Leporello in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" to frothier roles in operettas by Lehar, Strauss and Lortzing. His career was mainly in Europe, but he sang at the Metropolitan Opera for several seasons in the 1950's, and he made many recordings.
        Mr. Kunz was born in Vienna on May 20, 1909, and studied at the Vienna Akademie fur Musik. He made his professional debut in 1933 singing Osmin in Mozart's "Entfuhrung aus dem Serail" with a regional company in Czechoslovakia, and made his debut at the Glyndebourne Opera three years later. He joined the roster of the Vienna State Opera in 1940, and remained at the house until the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Kunz made his Metropolitan Opera debut as Leporello in 1952. Other roles he sang at the house include Beckmesser, Figaro (in Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro") and Faninal in Strauss's "Rosenkavalier."
        He is survived by his wife, Winfriede, a son and a daughter.
