        Felix Ermacora, an Austrian human rights specialist whose scathing reports for the United Nations on human rights abuses in Afghanistan in the 1980's gained wide attention, died on Friday in a hospital in Vienna. He was 71 and lived in Vienna.
        The cause was a disease he caught on a United Nations mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan in December, the Austria Press Agency reported, citing a report from his family. The nature of the illness was not disclosed.
        Dr. Ermacora, a longtime professor at the University of Vienna, was an Austrian delegate to the United Nations Human Rights Commission from 1959 to 1980 and from 1984 to 1987 and appraised human rights for the United Nations in a variety of countries.
        He investigated human rights in Afghanistan for more than a decade and touched off an international controversy with a report he prepared for the commission that was made public in 1985.
        The document said that since Soviet troops had poured into Afghanistan half a decade earlier, "gross violations of human rights" had occurred there, including routine torture, the massacre of civilians, the forced evacuation of rural areas and the incarceration without trial of tens of thousands of political prisoners.
        Western diplomats at the United Nations lauded the report as the first major instance in which the world body had documented human rights violations committed by the Soviet Union, which intervened in Afghanistan on the side of the Marxist Afghan Government.
        But the Afghan Government condemned the document, which Dr. Ermacora had based largely on interviews with Afghan refugees in Pakistan because he had been barred from Afghan Government territory.
        Dr. Ermacora was born in Klagenfurt, Austria, and earned his doctorate in law at the University of Innsbruck, Austria.
