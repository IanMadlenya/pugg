        Dr. Norman Plummer, a longtime general medical director for the New York Telephone Company and an official of the United States Army's Influenza Commission, which helped develop the influenza vaccine, died on Wednesday at the William Hill Manor Health Care Center in Easton, Md. He was 94.
        Dr. Plummer, who received his medical degree from Cornell University Medical School in 1926, was closely affiliated with the New York Hospital and Cornell University Medical School for many years, serving as an assistant professor of medicine.
        He was a leading researcher in pulmonary diseases, particularly pneumonia and tuberculosis, and was among the early pioneers in the use of sulfa drugs, such as sulfapyridine, to treat pneumonia.
        After running a private practice for several years, Dr. Plummer joined the Influenza Commission of the Army Epidemiological Board in 1941, and after joining the Army as a major in 1943, he served as the board's assistant administrator.
        After World War II, he became medical director of the American Cyanimid Corporation and, in 1946, general medical director of the New York Telephone Company, where he remained until his retirement in 1965.
        Dr. Plummer was born in Reno, Nev., and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1922.
        He is survived by two sons, Norman, of Easton, Md., and Timothy, of San Francisco, and by a sister, Beatrice Hudgins of Reno.
