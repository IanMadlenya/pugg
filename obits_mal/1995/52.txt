        Arthur H. Scouten, a scholar of Restoration and 18th-century English drama, died on Sunday in St.-Germain-en-Laye, outside Paris. He was 85.
        Dr. Scouten, who was a professor emeritus of English at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught from 1947 to 1980, was the initiator and editor of "The London Stage: A Calendar of Plays, Entertainments and Afterpieces," a reference work. With one of his former students, Robert D. Hume, he rediscovered and republished a satirical comedy that had been banned by Charles II in 1669: "The Country Gentleman," by Sir Robert Howard and the Duke of Buckingham, was brought to light by Dr. Scouten and Mr. Hume in 1976 and was produced off Broadway in 1978.
        Dr. Scouten was also known for his scholarly contributions on American literature, Shakespeare and 18th-century British satire, especially the works of Jonathan Swift, and was instrumental in helping the University of Pennsylvania acquire a major Dutch collection of Swiftiana.
        Born in Kenya of missionary parents, Dr. Scouten was reared in New York City and Louisiana, where he attended Louisiana State University. Early in his career, he taught at the University of Texas and the Alabama Polytechnic Institute. He moved to Paris three years after retiring from the University of Pennsylvania in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Annick Rouet; a daughter, Clemence; a sister, Olive S. Walker of Marengo, Ohio, and three children from his first marriage.
