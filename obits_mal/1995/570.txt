        Garrison Norton, a former Assistant Secretary of State and Assistant Secretary of the Navy, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 94.
        Mr. Norton was an Assistant Secretary of State in charge of policies on international transportation and communications from 1947 to 1949.
        For several years in the 1950's, he worked for the Secretary of the Air Force in research and development. He was an Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1956 to 1959, with the primary job of expanding the Navy's research and development program.
        Then, he was president of the Institute for Defense Analyses from 1959 until his retirement in the 1960's. He went on to become chairman of the Carnegie Institution, in Washington, of which he had earlier become a trustee. He retired as a trustee in 1974.
        Mr. Norton was born in Chicago, the son of Charles Dyer Norton and the former Katherine McKim Garrison. He grew up in Washington and Manhattan, went to the Groton School in Groton, Mass., and graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1923.
        After Harvard, he joined the New York staff of Arthur Young & Company, an accounting firm. At that time, he had obtained a private pilot's license and became interested in cross-country flying. His activities in flying brought him in contact with figures in the aviation industry, some of whom became clients of the firm. In 1932, he became a general partner in the firm.
        He went into Government in 1934, serving as deputy general manager of the Home Owners Loan Corporation, assistant to the chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority and director of the Office of Transport and Communications in the State Department before becoming an Assistant Secretary of State.
        He served in the Navy during World War II and rose to be a captain.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Emily McMullan Norton; a daughter, Glenavie Norton of Philadelphia, and two granddaughters.
