        John Fresco, a vice president and divisional merchandise manager for men's apparel at Saks Fifth Avenue, died Friday at his home in Clark, N.J. He was 54.
        Jaqui Lividini, a spokeswoman for Saks, where Mr. Fresco worked for nearly 35 years, said he died of cancer.
        Born in Yonkers, Mr. Fresco began his retail career as a mail room clerk at the Associated Dry Goods Corporation in 1958, when he also worked part time as a shoe salesman at Lord & Taylor. He joined Saks after graduating from the Collegiate Business Institute in 1960.
        Mr. Fresco joined the Saks executive trainee program in 1963 and in August of that year was appointed an assistant buyer. In 1966, he was promoted to a buyer of men's hats, and later put in charge of buying men's footwear and clothing. He became a vice president in 1976.
        Surviving are his wife, Maryann; a son, Sean; two daughters, Laura Dence and Cindy Fresco, and a grandson, all of New Jersey, and a brother, James, of Canada.
