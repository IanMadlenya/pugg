        Henry Miller Watts Jr., a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, died on Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 91.
        Mr. Watts was a founding partner of the brokerage firm of Mitchel, Schreiber, Watts & Company in New York and, at his death, was among the oldest members of the New York Stock Exchange. For nearly 50 years he commuted by train and ferry to New York to work as a floor broker at the exchange. He was chairman of the exchange's board from 1962 to 1965.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Watts graduated from St. Paul's School, and from Harvard University in 1925. He joined the stock exchange in March 1929, months before the Wall Street crash.
        Mr. Watts was also president of the Muscular Dystrophy Association from 1968 to 1975, chairman of the association's executive committee from 1975 to 1979 and was a director of the association from 1966 to 1995. While president, the association became the fastest-growing voluntary health organization and established six university-based research centers, including the Henry M. Watts Jr. Neuromuscular Disease Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
        Mr. Watts was a lieutenant commander in the Navy during World War II. During the Normandy invasion, he directed troops of the Sixth Beach Battalion in one of the early assaults. He also saw action at Okinawa.
        Mr. Watts is survived by his wife of 43 years, Anna; a stepson, B. Franklin Pepper of Alexandria, Va.; three stepdaughters, Anne Fox Roome of Chicago, Virginia Pepper Purviance of Middletown, R.I., and Rebecca Pepper Sinkler of Philadelphia, former editor of The New York Times Book Review, 10 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.
