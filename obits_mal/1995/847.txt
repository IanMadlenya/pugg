        Juan Eugene Ramos, an art director and the creative partner of Antonio Lopez, the late fashion illustrator, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was  53.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Paul Caranicas.
        With Mr. Lopez, who died in 1987, Mr. Ramos conceptualized fashion illustrations and advertising campaigns that were published in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times, and were later seen in museums around the world.
        They collaborated on the concept and everything else: selection of the model, the clothes and the props. Mr. Ramos chose every color down to the shade of red  on a man's lips. The only thing he did not do was draw. Among the team's discoveries were Tina Chow, Jerry Hall and Grace Jones.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Ramos and Mr. Lopez depicted women coiffed in Leger-inspired cascades of hair and dressed in micro-minis. They sometimes put sexy men and women on motorcycles, borrowing imagery from the film "Easy Rider."
        Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said, "Juan was the art director to Antonio -- but not after the fact -- and everything that emerged, emerged from them together."
        Describing their work, Mr. Martin said: "Take a Missoni sweater, a badge of the rich bourgeoisie. Suddenly, a Missoni sweater had something to do with spirit and expressionism. The eyeglasses were askew, the building was caving in, and the hands were contorted expressionist hands."
        The partners, who both studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology, afterward taught fashion illustration there as well as at a school in the Dominican Republic.
        Besides Mr. Caranicas, Mr. Ramos is survived by his mother, Mercedes Negron,  and his sister, Sonia Ramos.
