        Howard Saalman, a teacher and architectural historian, died on Thursday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 67.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Franklin K. Toker, a former president of the Society of Architectural Historians.
        Born in the German town of Stettin (now in Poland), in 1928, Mr. Saalman and his twin brother, Peter, were brought to the United States in 1938 by their family, which settled in Manhattan.
        He attended City College and the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. He joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University in 1958, and was Andrew Mellon Professor of Architecture until his retirement last year.
        Mr. Saalman's specialty was Italian Renaissance architecture. He was the author of a highly regarded two-volume study of the architect Brunelleschi and also wrote about Michelangelo and Alberti. His "Haussmann: Paris Transformed," about the 19th-century modernization of Paris, was published in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, Jeanne; a daughter, Daphne Saalman Kalaidjian of  Newport, R.I., and his brother, of Boston.
