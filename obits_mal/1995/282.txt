        Percy Humphrey, a trumpeter best known for his work with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, died on Saturday in New Orleans, where he lived. He was 90.
        Mr. Humphrey was from a musical family in New Orleans -- his grandfather, Jim Humphrey, taught many of the first-generation jazz musicians -- and grew up playing in all sorts of situations, from dance halls to brass bands. He started out as a drummer, then changed to trumpet, working his way up to the position of first trumpet in the Eureka Brass Band, one of the city's most important. In the 1950's he took over as leader of the group.
        In 1961 he started at the recently opened Preservation Hall in New Orleans, working there regularly until March of this year. In the 1970's he also worked with the New Orleans Joymakers.
        A good portion of the history of jazz showed up in his playing. He was an expert at group improvisations, the early sort of jazz that developed from parade brass bands. He was also a skillful Louis Armstrong-style soloist and could bring his ideas and sound to the front of the group. Mr. Humphrey continued touring with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band into the 1980's.
