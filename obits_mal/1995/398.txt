        Dennis Alan Anderson, a child psychiatrist at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, Queens, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospital. He was 41 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS-related, a hospital spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Anderson was a staff psychiatrist at the center's Schneider Children's Hospital and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
        He played a key role in establishing the hospital's Worob Center for Gender Development and its Sexual Identity Service, which helps children who have problems with sexual identity and conduct. According to Long Island Jewish, the Worob Center is the first of its kind on Long Island and among only a few nationwide.
        A native of Tacoma, Wash., Dr. Anderson earned his M.D. in 1979 at the University of Washington, where he also trained in child psychiatry.
        He is survived by his mother, Leota Anderson, who lives in the state of Washington, a half-brother and a half-sister.
