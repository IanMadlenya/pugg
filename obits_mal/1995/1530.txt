        Richard H. Arbib, an industrial designer whose array of products ranged from watches and vacuum cleaners to yachts and concept cars, died on Feb. 22 in his Manhattan home. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said his brother, John A. Arbib of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        In a career that lasted more than five decades, Mr. Arbib's work embraced the functional as well as the whimsical. From a pair of cuff links to a blimp in the form of an airplane wing, his designs reflected a sense of change and drama that were increasingly important in the consumer boom that emerged after World War II.
        His projects included watches for Hamilton Watch Company, a narrow whitewall tire for General Tire and budget-minded photography equipment for Argus Cameras.
        In the late 1950's, he designed the first battery-powered watch for Hamilton, called the Ventura. The triangular-shaped design was brought back in 1989 as one of Hamilton's watch reproductions and became its most popular item.
        A television set he designed in 1947 and a radio in 1958 were part of an exhibition on industrial design last year at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.
        Mr. Arbib was born in Gloversville, N.Y. His first job after graduation from Pratt Institute in 1939 was for General Motors in its World's Fair exhibition, City of Tomorrow. He then worked in G.M.'s design department in Detroit and managed the design firm set up by Harvey Earl, the car stylist and designer.
        During World War II, he worked for Republic Aircraft in designing expendable wing-tip fuel tanks that could be attached to B-47's to increase their range.
        After the war, he set up his own firm in Manhattan. He was still creating commercial designs until the week before his death.
        Besides his brother, John, he is survived by a daughter, Jeanne Garcia of Bethlehem, Pa.; a son, Richard, of Reno, Nev., two grandchilden and two great-grandchildren.
