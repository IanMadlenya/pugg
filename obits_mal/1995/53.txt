        Edwin H. Blum, who wrote the screenplay for "The Canterville Ghost" and helped write the screenplays for "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" and "Stalag 17," died on Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 89.
        Mr. Blum was born in Atlantic City, and was reared in San Francisco. He arrived in Los Angeles in 1933 hoping to become a screenwriter, but first spent several years as a ghost writer for Ernest Pascal, the third president of the Writers Guild of America, of which Mr. Blum was a founding member. During this period he saw two of his plays produced in New York, "The Kick Back" (1936) and "I Am My Youth" (1938), which he wrote with Mr. Pascal.
        Mr. Blum wrote 15 screenplays, including "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" (1939), starring Basil Rathbone, "The Canterville Ghost" (1944), starring Charles Laughton, and "Down to Earth" (1952), starring Rita Hayworth. The screenplay for "Stalag 17" (1953), which he wrote with Billy Wilder, was nominated for an Academy Award.
        Mr. Blum also wrote many scripts for the television series "The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," "77 Sunset Strip," "The Roaring 20's" and "Hawaii Five-O."
        Active in the Democratic Party, he managed several Congressional campaigns, notably Helen Gahagan Douglas's unsuccessful campaign against Richard M. Nixon in 1950 in California. He also wrote jokes and speeches for Adlai Stevenson and Hubert H. Humphrey.
        In 1960, Mr. Blum was awarded a Ford Foundation Prize for his play "The Saving Grace," which was produced off Broadway in 1963.
        Mr. Blum is survived by his wife, Beatriz; a daughter, Deborah, of Los Angeles; a son, David, of Seattle, and four grandchildren.
