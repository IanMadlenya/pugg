        Don Cook, a foreign correspondent who covered the end of World War II in Europe and Western Europe's postwar recovery for The New York Herald Tribune and later for The Los Angeles Times, died on Tuesday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Cook retired from The Los Angeles Times in 1988 as its European diplomatic correspondent. Among the events he covered were the liberation of Paris, the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Berlin crisis and the summit meetings between President Ronald Reagan and Premier Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
        He was the author of "Floodtide in Europe" in 1965 and "Charles De Gaulle, a Biography" in 1984, both published by G. P. Putnam's Sons; and "Forging the Alliance, NATO, 1945-1950" (Arbor House/William Morrow & Company, 1989). "The Long Fuse: How England Lost the American Colonies" was completed just before his death and will be published on July 4 by Atlantic/ Grove Press.
        Born in Bridgeport, Conn., on Aug. 8, 1920, Mr. Cook grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia.
        Mr. Cook's wife, Cherry, died in 1983. He is survived by a son, Christopher, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; six daughters, Jennifer Thompson, of Glenside, Pa., Adrienne Garreau, of Broad Run, Va., Deborah Prosser, of Riverside, Calif., Caron Merrill, of North Grafton, Mass., Danielle Navidi-Kaismia, of Warrenton, Va., and Dominique Cook, of Paris; a brother, two sisters and seven grandchildren.
