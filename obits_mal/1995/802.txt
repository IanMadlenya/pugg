        Judge John S. Thorp Jr. of the State Court of Claims in Mineola, L.I., and a  former Democratic Assemblyman from Nassau County, died on Tuesday at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Centre, L.I. A lifelong resident of Rockville Centre, he was 70.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Despite his illness, Judge Thorp, who was about to retire, remained active on the bench until his hospitalization last week. He was appointed to the claims court by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1985, having sat on the Nassau County Court for 10 years.
        The son of a former Nassau Democratic county leader, Judge Thorp graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., and Brooklyn Law School.
        He was in private practice in Rockville Centre from 1954 until his election to County Court in 1975. He was a State Assemblyman in Albany from 1964 to 1975  and was chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
        Judge Thorp is survived by his wife of 39 years, Dolores Hartig Thorp; two sons, John, of Rockville Centre and Richard, of Williston Park, L.I.; a daughter, Patricia Thorp of Boston; a brother, Thomas, of Glenmont, N.Y.; two sisters, Winifred Knobloch and Mary Trencheny, both of Rockville Centre, and four grandchildren.
