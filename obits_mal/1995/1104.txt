        Edward Hidalgo, a Mexican-born lawyer who was Secretary of the Navy in the Carter Administration, died Saturday at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. He was 82.
        The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Lieut. Comdr. Joseph Quimby, a spokesman for the Navy.
        He was Assistant Secretary of the Navy from 1977 to 1979 and the Secretary of the Navy from 1979 to 1981. He was the principal negotiator of the Navy's settlement of claims filed in the 1970's by the General Dynamics Corporation, which was trying to recover excess cost on nuclear submarine construction.
        He was born in Mexico City and came to the United States in 1918, settling in New York. He received his bachelor of arts degree from Holy Cross College in 1933 and a law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1936.
        He served in the Navy from 1942 to 1946, and worked as a special assistant to Navy Secretary James Forrestal in 1945. In 1965, he was a special assistant to Navy Secretary Paul H. Nitze for a short time and in 1972 he went to work for the United States Information Agency, first as a special assistant to the director, and later as general counsel.
        He is survived by his third wife, the former Belinda Bonham, of McLean, Va., and four children, Edward Hidalgo Jr. and Joanne Tosti, both of Jupiter, Fla., Ricardo Hidalgo of Seattle, Tila Leach of Houston, and six grandchildren.
        His first wife, the former Nancy McNeil, died in 1986. He divorced his second wife, the former Karen Dane Jernstedt of Palm Beach, Fla.
