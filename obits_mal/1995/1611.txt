        George Woodbridge, a history professor and author who advised governments on economic recovery, died on March 27 at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, N.C. He had lived in Washington and the New York area for much of his career and in Raleigh since 1987. He was 86.
        The cause was renal failure, said his son, David G. Woodbridge.
        After earning a Ph.D. in history at the University of Wisconsin in 1937, he began a teaching career at Columbia that would last nearly 40 years, interrupted for service in government, at the United Nations and in business. During that time, he taught at Barnard College and was a chairman of the history department. He retired in 1974.
        During World War II, he worked for the Lend-Lease program in Washington and Egypt and afterward with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in London. In 1950, he wrote "UNRRA: History of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" (Columbia University Press).
        From 1947 to 1952 he worked in Washington as a government historian and then as an analyst on the economies of Greece, Turkey and Iran. In 1953, he went to London to help implement the Marshall Plan.
        He was born in Garden City, L.I., and received undergraduate and master's degrees from Columbia.
        Besides his son, David, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Katherine Anne, and two daughters, Kate K. Denning of Grand Junction, Colo., and Jane M. Woodbridge of Manhattan.
