        Thomas J. Johnston, a former chairman of the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles, died on Monday at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. He was  72, and had homes in California at Belvedere near San Francisco and Pebble Beach.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered earlier this year, said his wife, Elaine.
        As one of the first consultants hired in 1956 by Heidrick & Struggles, Mr. Johnston was a leader in the firm's expansion outside its Chicago home. Today, Heidrick & Struggles is one of the country's largest executive search firms and  is often called on to find top executives at some of the country's largest corporations.
        Mr. Johnston opened the firm's office in Los Angeles, its first outside Chicago, and became director of West Coast operations in 1960. Later he supervised the creation of the firm's London office, its first outside the United States, and in 1970 he became chief executive. From 1978 to 1981 he was chairman, and he remained with the company as honorary chairman until 1991, when he retired.
        Born in Oak Park, Ill., Mr. Johnston graduated from St. Mary's College in Winona, Minn., and served in the Navy during World War II. After the war, Mr. Johnston was a specialist in personnel management at various corporations, starting with Western Electric, in 1946. As retail personnel manager at Montgomery Ward & Company he met John Struggles, a founder of the firm that bears his name.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Johnston is survived by four daughters, Elene Kapp of Santa Ana, Calif., Molly Johnston of Altadena, Calif., Anne Gardner of Pasadena, Calif., Karen Johnston of Larchmont, N.Y.; a son, John of San Francisco, two sisters, Sister Katrine Johnston of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, of Dubuque, Iowa, and Kathleen Gaumond of Spring Park, Minn., and six grandchildren.
