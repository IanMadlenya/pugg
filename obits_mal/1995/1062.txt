        Dr. Donald Grigg Anderson, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and a counselor on medical education nationally, died on Sunday at the Carol Woods retirement community in  Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Anderson taught at Rochester from 1953 until his retirement in 1978. While there, he also served as dean and director of the university's medical center.
        He was a member of many advisory panels as early as the 1950's, when he was the executive secretary of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association. He sat on a commission named by President Harry S. Truman to advise the Federal Government on how to support medical education in the United States.
        He also belonged to panels that counseled the State of New Jersey on the creation of its College of Medicine and Dentistry and its later move from Jersey City to Newark. Another institution he helped put in place in the 1950's was the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in the Bronx.
        Dr. Anderson was born in Manhattan. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard College and received his medical degree from Columbia University in  1939.
        As a faculty member of Boston University School of Medicine in World War II,  he became involved in the distribution of penicillin in the United States.
        Dr. Anderson is survived by his wife, Hermine Teute Anderson; two daughters,  Patricia Anderson of Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and Dr. Roberta Pagon of Seattle; a son, James, of Boston; two stepdaughters, Fredrika Teute of Williamsburg, Va., and Andrea Teute of Chapel Hill; a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, the playwright and screenwriter, and seven grandchildren. His first wife, Dr. Erna Goettsch Anderson, died in 1974.
