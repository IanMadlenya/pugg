        Former Representative August E. Johansen, a Michigan Republican who was among the most conservative voices in his 10 years in Congress, died on Sunday in a nursing home in Orlando, Fla. He was 89 and moved to Florida from Battle Creek, Mich., in the mid-1960's after leaving Congress.
        Nationally, Mr. Johansen was best known for his ardent pursuit of political subversion while a member of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. He was defeated for re-election in 1964 after serving five terms.
        A firm believer in states' rights, Mr. Johansen opposed Federal civil rights legislation.
        Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Johansen grew up in Battle Creek. He graduated from the University of Chicago, was ordained as a Congregational minister and was a pastor in Chicago and in Michigan.
        From 1934 to 1944 he was an industrial relations manager for the Kellogg Company in Battle Creek, later working at Michigan newspapers and as an administrative assistant to Representative Paul W. Shafer, Republican of Michigan.
        Mr. Johansen's wife, Beatrice, died in 1970. He is survived by three daughters, Sally L. Higby and Mary J. Buckler, both of Clearwater Beach, Fla., and Nancy J. Beckett of Ridgefield, Conn.; eight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
