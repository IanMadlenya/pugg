        Frank Olive, a designer of hats for fashion houses, celebrities and the theater, died last Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 66 and lived on the  Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, said Winfield Huppuch, his companion.
        Mr. Olive, born Francis A. Olive Jr. in Milwaukee, started designing costumes while attending the Chicago Art Institute. He came to New York hoping for a niche in the theater. His work drew the attention of the designer Normal Norell, who suggested that he become a milliner.
        Mr. Olive's creations found customers among designer houses like Oscar de la  Renta and Pauline Trigere, as well as leading department stores and performers like Carol Burnett, Diana Ross and Peggy Lee.
        "I think that hats are an essential part of being a woman," he told an interviewer in 1968. "I design hats for a woman who feels this. I want to help her discover herself."
        He opened his first boutique in Greenwich Village on Macdougal Street, designing clothes and hats for Seventh Avenue fashion houses, which included them in their collections to sell to private customers. In 1971, he and a partner, David Stein, established Frank Olive's World on the West Side. Mr. Stein is the company's president.
        Women's Wear Daily, in a "75 Years of Fashion" issue in 1985, cited Mr. Olive as one of the influential designers of the century.
        Besides Mr. Huppuch, he is survived by a sister, Rose Mary Wachowiak of Greenfield, Wis.
