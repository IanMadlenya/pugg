        James J. (Jimmy) Powers, the longtime sports editor of The Daily News who supplemented the reach of his "Powerhouse" column with a parallel career as a boxing commentator on NBC television's Gillette Friday Night Fights, died on Saturday at his home in Bal Harbour, Fla. He was 92.
        He died in his sleep of natural causes, his family said.
        A native of Cleveland who attended Marquette University, Mr. Powers worked on newspapers in the Midwest before coming to New York in 1936 to succeed Paul Gallico at The Daily News. He retired in 1959.
        Mr. Powers is survived by three children, Patricia, Michael and Mary Anne; six grandchildren; a sister, Teresa Wight, and a brother, John.
