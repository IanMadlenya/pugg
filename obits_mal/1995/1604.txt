        Frederick R. Esty, a former chairman and chief executive of the United States Banknote Corporation, died on Tuesday at his home in Summit, N.J., after a brief illness. He was 79.
        Mr. Esty, a longtime leader in the securities printing and engraving field, was widely known as "Mr. Banknote" within the industry. His company produces stock and bond certificates and does financial printing.
        In 1934, Mr. Esty joined the Central Banknote Company, which was founded by his father. Seven years later, he moved to the Columbian Banknote Company as vice president in charge of the New York office. During World War II, he was chairman of the Victory War Bond drive in New York City.
        In 1957, when Columbian Banknote merged with the Security Banknote Company to become the Security-Columbian Banknote Company, Mr. Esty became president and chief executive. After the acquisition of Security-Columbian by United States Banknote, he was elected chairman and chief executive of United States Banknote in 1966. At his death, he was chairman emeritus of the Security-Columbian division of United States Banknote.
        He was formerly president of the Far East American Council on Commerce and Industry. He had also been chairman of the board of managers of the International Bible Society.
        Mr. Esty is survived by his wife, Ardis; a son, Frederick R. 3d, of Summit, and four brothers: Franklyn Robert Esty of Miami Lakes, Fla.; the Rev. Donald Roy Esty of Naples, Fla.; the Rev. Charles Philip Esty of Atlanta, and the Rev. Alfred Marshall Esty of Alsip, Ill.
