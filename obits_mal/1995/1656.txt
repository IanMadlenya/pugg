        Daniel Howard Cohen, a journalist and former member of the militant leftist group the Weather Underground, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 45.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his father, Sidney Cohen.
        Mr. Cohen directed the photography program at Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism from 1987 until his death.
        Mr. Cohen, who grew up in Baltimore, was arrested in 1969 at an antiwar protest in Chicago. He failed to appear for trial on aggravated battery charges and disappeared until 1976, when he surrendered and was sentenced to probation.
        Mr. Cohen's companion of several years, M. Brooks Jones, died in 1989. Mr. Cohen is survived by his parents, Sidney and Sylvia Cohen of Baltimore; a brother, Paul, of San Francisco, and two sisters, Sandra Lee Cohen Crute of Baltimore and Laura Cohen Hewitt of Manhattan.
