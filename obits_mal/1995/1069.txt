        Lee Zhito, a former editor in chief and publisher of Billboard, the music-industry trade magazine, died last Friday near his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 77.
        He was struck by a car, said a spokesman for the family, Joel Brokaw.
        Mr. Zhito was born in Kiev, which was then part of Russia, and grew up in St. Louis. He was a graduate of the University of Missouri at Columbia. He joined Billboard as a reporter in 1945 and soon began to rise through the ranks, becoming editor in chief and publisher in 1974.
        He remained at the magazine for nearly 50 years, ushering it through its growth overseas with two foreign-language editions, Billboard Benelux and Billboard en Espanol. He also initiated the development of an on-line database,  the Billboard Information Network, more than a decade before the widespread use  of the Internet.
        He is survived by his wife, Miriam, and two daughters, Nina, of San Francisco, and Lisa, of Kentucky.
