        Esker K. Davis, a manager of several missions of planetary exploration, died  on Friday in La Canada, Calif. He was 60.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., said yesterday.
        Mr. Davis was the manager of the planetary and space physics missions office at the laboratory, which directs most of the planetary exploration projects for  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He had recently completed proposals for several low-cost unmanned interplanetary missions, including one just announced to send a spacecraft to the comet Wild-2 and bring home samples of cometary dust.
        Mr. Davis was the project manager in Voyager 2's encounter with Saturn in 1981 and had previously served as an engineer or manager of unmanned flights to  Mercury, Mars and Venus.
        A native of Roanoke, Va., he earned a bachelor's degree in geology from West  Virginia University and masters' degrees from Florida State University and the University of California at Los Angeles. He was a recipient of the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal.
        He is survived by his wife, Kay; a daughter, Sherry, and a son, Esker.
