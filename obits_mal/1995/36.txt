        Matthew E. Welsh, the Governor of Indiana from 1961 to 1965 who brought in the state's first sales tax and who fought the Presidential aspirations of George C. Wallace, died on Sunday at his home in Indianapolis. He was 82 and a longtime resident of the city.
        When Mr. Wallace, the Governor of Alabama, was looking for a Northern state where he could show support among white, urban voters, Governor Welsh stepped into the 1964 Indiana Presidential primary to deny the state's 51 delegates to Governor Wallace. At the convention he turned the delegation over to President Lyndon B. Johnson.
        A popular Democrat at a time when few in his party were winning elections in Indiana, Mr. Welsh won his first bid for the governorship when Richard M. Nixon was handing John F. Kennedy a defeat in the state's Presidential race. Governor Welsh saw his popularity fall in 1963, when he proposed a 2 percent sales taxes as part a general overhaul of the state's finances. Challenged in the courts, the tax was finally put into effect.
        Born in Detroit, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1934 and the University of Chicago Law School in 1937. He served in the Indiana House and Senate and practiced law in Vincennes, Ind., before running for governor.
        Restricted by state law from seeking a consecutive term, he ran for a second term as governor in 1972, but lost to Otis R. Bowen.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia; two daughters, Kay L. Welsh of Indianapolis and Janet M. Clendenin of Clayton, Mo.; a brother, John E., of Vincennes; a sister, Margaret Clark of Indianapolis, and three grandchildren.
