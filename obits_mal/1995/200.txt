        William Mozart McVey, a sculptor whose nine-foot bronze statue of Sir Winston Churchill stands outside the British Embassy in Washington, died on Wednesday. He was 89.
        He also executed a set of bronze doors for the Federal Trade Commission building in Washington. His other work includes sculptures of Jesse Owens, in Cleveland; John W. Heisman, at Georgia Tech, and a stone frieze, near Houston, commemorating the battle of the Alamo.
        His best-known work was the statue of Churchill, which portrays Britain's wartime leader with one hand raised in a victory sign and the other clutching a  cane and a cigar. The statue was commissioned by the English-Speaking Union of the United States and was dedicated in 1966.
