        George Gerber, a former Clarks town, N.Y., supervisor who thought he had put politics behind him when he retired to Florida in 1986, died on Friday at his home in Coconut Creek, the Broward County city where he was in his second term as Mayor. He was 69.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Marilyn, said.
        A native of the Bronx who worked for export companies in Manhattan, Mr. Gerber was drawn into politics after moving to Rockland County in 1958 and joining a homeowners' association in the Clarkstown hamlet of Valley Cottage.
        After holding a series of appointive posts, including Rockland County budget officer, he served as Clarks town supervisor from 1974 until 1979, then worked as a lobbyist until he moved to Florida, where the old urge drew him into politics once again.
        "He started going to City Council meetings," said his wife, noting that he had served on the council, now known as the Board of Commissioners, since 1991 and had twice been selected by his fellow commissioners for the post of mayor.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Howard, of Valley Cottage, and Steven, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Bea Greenhause of Coconut Creek, and a granddaughter.
