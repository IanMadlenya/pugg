        John H. Kearney, who was counsel to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn for more than 50 years, died on Saturday at New York Medical Center. He was 82.
        The cause was heart disease, said a son, Kevin.
        Serving the last four bishops of Brooklyn, Mr. Kearney advised the diocese during a period of growth that saw the establishment of a new diocese and a rapid expansion of social services as well as schools, hospitals and churches.
        In the 1950's, he advised the diocese, which then included all of Long Island, in establishing a separate Diocese of Rockville Centre, which includes Nassau and Suffolk counties. In the early 1960's, he represented the Brooklyn Diocese in its $38 millon program to construct six new high schools in Brooklyn and Queens.
        The 1970's and 1980's saw the establishment of new social programs, including the establishment of the Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens. He provided counsel to Bishop Francis J. Mugavero in developing the center, which operates four hospitals and other health care installations for the diocese.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Kearney, a Brooklyn resident, was president of Builders for Family and Youth of the Diocese of Brooklyn, an organization that provides services ranging from day care to programs for the elderly. He was a founder and a director of Progress for People's Development Corporation, which developed residential units for the elderly in Brooklyn and Queens.
        He was a senior partner in the law firm now known as Hurley, Kearney & Lane.
        He graduated from Manhattan College in 1932 and from St. John's Law School in 1936.
        Besides his son Kevin, of Belle Harbor, L.I., he is survived by his wife, Mary; three other sons, John, of Nanuet, N.Y., Joseph, of Washington and James, of Bronxville, N.Y., and 11 grandchildren.
