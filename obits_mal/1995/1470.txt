        Irving P. Abel, a former president of the Longines-Wittnauer Watch Company, died in his sleep on Sunday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 85.
        The cause was undetermined, said his son, Martin, also of Boca Raton.
        Mr. Abel was appointed president of the watch-making company in 1962 and held that position until he retired in 1970. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation bought Longines that year, and Mr. Abel served as a Westinghouse consultant until 1972.
        Mr. Abel joined Longines in 1936 as a sales representative. He became national sales manager in 1950 and senior vice president in 1954.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Elsie; two daughters, Joan Bell, of New York City, and Laura Honik, of El Bolson, Argentina, and six grandchildren.
