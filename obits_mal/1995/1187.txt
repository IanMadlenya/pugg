        George L. Aguirre, a pioneer of laser photography and an advocate of Hispanic culture in New York City, died here on Sunday. He was 62.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his brother Gabriel.
        He was born on May 29, 1932, in Akron, Ohio, and made his debut as a concert pianist at Carnegie Hall when he was 14. He was an accomplished musician and spoke 14 languages. He spent most of his career at the Exxon Corporation, where he was vice president for arts and cultural activities until his retirement.
        He was a founding sponsor of the Museo del Barrio, Fifth Avenue at 104th Street. In 1986, he moved to Madrid, where he continued to promote Spanish- and Hispanic-American art. In 1993, he was the curator for "The Spanish Vision," a collection of Spanish photography on display at the Spanish Institute in New York City.
        In addition to his brother, he is survived by two other brothers, Gilbert and Gary, and a sister, Gladys.
