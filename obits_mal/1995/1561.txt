        Jerome W. Robbins, a former chief executive of HMW Industries, which was once known as the Hamilton Watch Company, died on April 15 at the Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Fla. He was 69 and lived in Jupiter and New Canaan, Conn.
        The cause of death was cancer, according to his wife, Patricia.
        During Mr. Robbins's tenure at HMW, the company introduced the Pulsar watch, the first mass-market all-quartz watch with no moving parts.
        Born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., Mr. Robbins was a 1948 graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. He served as a Navy lieutenant for three years in the Mediterranean fleet, and was recalled for service during the Korean War.
        Mr. Robbins began his post-Navy career as sales manager of the Omega Watch Company and later became a vice president at the Bulova Watch Company. Subsequently, he was president of the Elgin National Watch Company from 1965 to 1968.
        He became president and chief executive of the Hamilton Watch Company in 1971. The company later renamed itself after it sold its Hamilton Watch operations to a Swiss company to focus on the production of military equipment. Mr. Robbins served as chief executive of HMW until 1983, when he left after a hostile takeover of the company.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Robbins is survived by a son, Richard, of Wilton, Conn.; a daughter, Cyndi Kim of Newton, Mass.; a brother, Lewis, of New York City; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.
