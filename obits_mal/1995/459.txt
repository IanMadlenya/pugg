        Jerzy Toeplitz, a film historian who headed film schools in Poland and Australia, died on July 24 in Warsaw. He was 85 and had returned to Poland from Australia in 1979.
        His death was reported in Britain on Wednesday by The Guardian and The Independent.
        Mr. Toeplitz, who was born in Ukraine, helped to found and was the first rector of the Lodz Film School, serving from 1949 to 1952 and again from 1957 to 1968. Its students in those decades included the directors Roman Polanski, Andrzej Wajda and Jerzy Skolimowski.
        The British film expert David Robinson wrote in The Guardian last week that Mr. Toeplitz "was largely responsible for devising the structure and syllabus of one of the world's most effective film teaching institutions."
        He was forced to leave the Lodz post "as the result of anti-Semitic campaigns," the Independent article said. He went on to become the first director of the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, in Sydney, serving from 1973 until his retirement in 1979.
        He was the author of several books, including "Hollywood and After" and a six-volume History of Cinematographic Art. He was a co-author of "The History of Polish Film."
        Mr. Toeplitz was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, and studied at the University of Warsaw, where he was a member of the film club. He worked in Britain on the 1935 movie "Loves of a Dictator," which starred Madeleine Carroll and Clive Brook, and the 1936 movie "The Beloved Vagabond," with Maurice Chevalier.
        He returned to Poland, where he wrote film criticism and did publicity work. In the mid-1940's he joined the newly founded agency Film Polski.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Isabella Stanlislawa Gornicka, and three daughters.
