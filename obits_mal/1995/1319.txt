        Jack Sendak, an author of children's books noted for their magical and even surreal qualities, died yesterday at Centra Medical Center in Freehold, N.J. He was 71 and lived in Clarksburg, N.J.
        He had suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Sendak was the brother of Maurice Sendak, the writer and illustrator, who furnished the drawings for his first two books, "The Happy Rain" (1956), and "Circus Girl" (1957).
        Jack Sendak was born in Brooklyn. He credited his father, Philip, with inspiring his storytelling talent through the bedtime folk tales he regularly told. It led him to write at an early age, including what he later called some "rather dramatic novels."
        After Army service in World War II he worked for Emerson Radio and Television, becoming involved in early experiments with color television. He also worked for the Postal Service for a time.
        Mr. Sendak resumed writing stories in his spare time and decided to concentrate on children's books. He said "The Happy Rain" was the first manuscript he ever submitted to a publisher. In addition to "Circus Girl," titles that followed included "The Second Witch," illustrated by Uri Shulevitz (1965), "The King of the Hermits and Other Stories" with Margot Zemach (1966) and "Martze" 1968) and "The Magic Tears" (1971) with Mitchell Miller.
        "The Magic Tears" earned the Children's Book Showcase award. A New York Times reviewer found the surreal nature of "Martze" evocative of "an Ingmar Bergman story set against a Chagall landscape."
        In addition to his brother, of Ridgefield, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Gussie, and a sister, Natalie Lesselbaum of Del Ray Beach, Fla.
