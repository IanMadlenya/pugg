        Edward Wharton-Tigar, a British agent during World War II, died on June 14, the Times of London reported on Thursday. He was 82 and had a residence in London.
        Mr. Wharton-Tigar was also a mining executive and a prominent collector of what the British call cigarette cards, depicting Boer War heroes, Hawaiian hummingbirds and myriad other subjects.
        He worked for a London-based international mining company, Selection Trust, in Yugoslavia before joining the Special Operations Executive, the British equivalent of this country's Office of Strategic Services.
        He was instrumental in an explosion the agency staged to destroy a cliffside house in Tangier, Morocco, from which Germans had been using infrared equipment to track vessels passing through the Strait of Gibraltar and had been providing information to German submarines.
        Later, while still working for the agency, Mr. Wharton-Tigar organized large-scale black-market trading in currencies, jewels and other valuables in Asia, for the benefit of the Allied cause.
        After the war, he rejoined Selection Trust and as managing director for 11 years, the Times of London reported, he quadrupled the value of its international interests.
        Over the years, he came to own a total of two million collectible cards -- including one depicting the American baseball player Honus Wagner -- which he bequeathed to the British Museum in London.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Diana, and two daughters.
