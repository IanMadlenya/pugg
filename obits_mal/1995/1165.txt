        Leigh Bowery, an Australian performance artist and designer in London who was perhaps best known as a model for the English painter Lucien Freud, died on Dec. 30 in Middlesex Hospital near London. He was 33 and lived in London.
        The cause was AIDS, said his wife, Nicola Bowery.
        Mr. Bowery, who was born in Sunshine, Australia, a Melbourne suburb, in 1961, studied piano and attended fashion school before moving to London in 1980. Within a few years he was a familiar presence in London's underground clubs, known for wearing flamboyant costumes, makeup and head gear that were remarkable for their combination of kitsch references, ingenuity and formal beauty.
        In addition to his own performance attire, Mr. Bowery designed costumes for, and sometimes performed with, the Michael Clark Dance Company, winning a Bessie for his costumes when the group performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1989. He gave his first gallery performance at the Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988, and he recently formed a band, called Minty, for which he was the lead singer.
        But Mr. Bowery may be remembered longest for the full-length nude portraits that Mr. Freud began making of him in the late 1980's. These imposing paintings, which exaggerated Mr. Bowery's heavyset frame to almost mountainous proportions, dominated the final galleries of the painter's exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his father, John, and a sister, Bronwyn, both of Australia.
