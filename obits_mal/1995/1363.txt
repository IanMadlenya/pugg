        Frank Bailinson, a reporter and copy editor at The New York Times for 31 years, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 81.
        Mr. Bailinson, who had lived in Chapel Hill for the last 10 years, died of pneumonia, said his daughter, Ann Kleinman.
        A native of Passaic, N.J., Mr. Bailinson began his journalism career when he was 16, as an office boy at The Associated Press in Manhattan. After that, he went with his father to live in the Soviet Union in the 1930's.
        Then, just before World War II, he returned to the United States and worked as a copy editor for The New Bedford Times in Massachussets. During the war, he worked as a copy editor for The Pittsburgh Press, and joined The New York Times in 1948. He retired from The Times in 1979.
        While at The Times, he worked both as a reporter on the metropolitan staff and as an editor for the foreign desk. In 1964, Mr. Bailinson earned a bachelor's degree in history from Columbia University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and cum laude.
        Besides his daughter, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Bailinson is survived by his wife, Margaret, of Chapel Hill; two sons, Frank Jr. of San Francisco, and James of Falmouth, Me., and four grandchildren.
