        Edward L. Greif, a Manhattan public-relations executive who represented many religious organizations, died last Thursday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 85.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At his death he was chairman of Banner & Greif Ltd., which he founded in 1945 with Jack Banner.
        One of his early clients was the United States Public Health Service, for which he designed a campaign against venereal disease in 1948. He later served as a consultant to the service.
        Over the years, his clients included the United Church of Christ, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, the American Missionary Association and the American Bible Society. He lectured on public relations at various universities and volunteered his services for Brandeis University and the Westchester Jewish Center in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Mr. Greif, who was born in Brooklyn and attended City College, received a law degree from St. Lawrence University in 1930.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Mildred Schlamm Greif; a daughter, Marion Greif of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jim, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Lucille Stang of Cresskill, N.J., and Shirley Greif of Manhattan.
