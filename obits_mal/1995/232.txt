        Dr. Richard S. Silver, a Manhattan dentist whose expertise on the rules of golf earned him national recognition on subjects like water hazards and unplayable lies, died last Saturday at the Central Island Health Care Center in  Plainview, L.I. He was 90 years old.
        While maintaining a full-time dental practice for more than 50 years, Dr. Silver managed to devote much of his free time to studying and enforcing the rules of a game that prides itself on players knowing and following those rules. He worked long hours as a volunteer official at New York-area tournaments conducted by the Metropolitan Golf Association. As chairman of the association's Tournament and Rules Committee, he created a Rules of Golf quiz that was used to help local officials but quickly gained national acclaim.
        In 1982, he received the association's Distinguished Service Award.
        Dr. Silver also served on the United States Golf Association's Tournament Committee and its Public Links Committee, and was a strong advocate of the public-links player.
        Dr. Silver could not tolerate rules breaches. Even when playing informally with family, he was known to follow his partners into the woods to see whether their balls were in bounds, or playable.
        Can you look into an opponent's bag to ascertain what club he is hitting or move an out-of-bounds stake if it interferes with one's stance? Dr. Silver would know the answers (yes, no), and more than that, would tell players about the rules when he was officiating a match.
        "I always hope to be able to educate golfers about the rules," he once said.
        Dr. Silver, who was born in New York City, attended Columbia University and Columbia School of Dentistry. He retired from his practice in the early 1980's.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; his brother, Edward M. Silver of Irvine, Calif., and five nieces and nephews.
