        Julius Burger, a pianist, composer and conductor whose compositions were revived in a concert at Alice Tully Hall in 1991, died on Monday at his home in Queens. He was 98.
        Mr. Burger studied music at the Vienna Academy, then joined the Berlin Opera as assistant conductor. He was also assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1920's, then returned to Europe, where he worked as conductor and arranger with Otto Klemperer at the Berlin Staatsoper and arranged music for the BBC in London. He moved to the United States in 1939 and soon rejoined the Met, again as assistant conductor.
        He won praise as an arranger in the 1950's with adaptations of music by Verdi and Offenbach, and he also started composing again for the first time since World War II. But it was not until 1990 that his own work was rediscovered by his lawyer, Ronald S. Pohl, who arranged for a concert of Mr. Burger's compositions at Alice Tully Hall the next year.
        The performance, by the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Paul Lusting Dunkel, included Mr. Burger's Cello Concerto and other works composed some 50 years earlier. A recording of his music is to be released this year.
