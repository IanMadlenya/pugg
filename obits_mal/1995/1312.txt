        Christopher Palmer, an orchestrator for several Oscar-winning film composers and the author of books on film music, died on Jan. 22 at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. He was 48 and lived in London.
        The cause was AIDS, said Patrick Russ, a colleague.
        Mr. Palmer orchestrated the scores for more than 100 movies. He had a long working relationship with many well-known film composers, including Miklos Rozsa, who helped establish Mr. Palmer's career by asking him to orchestrate his score for the film "The Last Embrace." Mr. Palmer also worked closely with Elmer Bernstein ("Heavy Metal" and "Three Amigos"), Bernard Herrmann ("Taxi Driver" and "Obsession") and Maurice Jarre ("Passage to India" and "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"), and served as the musical director for Milos Forman's "Valmont."
        Mr. Palmer was born in Norfolk, England, and graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in linguistics and music. He made dozens of symphonic arrangements of music from Hollywood films, many of which he recorded. He was the author of "The Composer in Hollywood," "The Britten Companion" and biographies of Delius, Prokofiev, Ravel and other composers.
        He is survived by his mother, Frances, of England.
