        George A. Elbert, who collaborated with his wife, Virginie, on a score of cookbooks and books about indoor plants, died on Thursday in the New York University Medical Center. He was 83 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, Mrs. Elbert said.
        Mr. and Mrs. Elbert's books were published from 1968 to 1991. Almost all of the books were illustrated with photographs taken by the couple.
        Joan Lee Faust, the garden writer for The New York Times, wrote in a review of the couple's 1973 book "Fun With Terrarium Gardening," "Their pleasures are conveyed in the many novel ideas for plants to grow and containers to grow them in."
        The couple's other books include "Foliage Plants for Decorating Indoors" (Timber Press, 1989), "Dolci: The Fabulous Desserts of Italy" (1987, Simon & Schuster) and "Down-Island Caribbean Cookery" (1991, Simon & Schuster).
        Mr. Elbert also wrote about cooking and indoor plants for magazines including Ladies Home Journal, Gourmet, Horticulture, Houseplant Magazine and Woman's Day. And he wrote articles, on the same topics, for The New York Times.
        The Elberts also helped to found the Indoor Gardening Society.
        Mr. Elbert was born in Manhattan, the son of August and Blanche Elbert, and grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y. After graduating from a boarding school in Zurich, he received a degree in economics from the University of Heidelberg.
        He worked for three decades as a New York-based importer and exporter of chemicals, successively for his father, in partnership with his brother Edwin, and with other associates. He also traded on the New York Produce Exchange.
        In addition to his wife, the former Virginie Fowler, he is survived by a daughter, Suzanne, of Washington, and a grandson.
