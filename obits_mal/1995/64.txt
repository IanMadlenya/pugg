        John Phillips, the author of the novel "The Second Happiest Day," died on April 30 at his home in Manhattan. He was 71 and also had a home in Edgartown, Mass.
        The cause was heart failure, said his brother Timothy.
        His father was the novelist John P. Marquand, and until he published his first novel, Mr. Phillips used the name John P. Marquand Jr. He graduated from Harvard University in 1946 and worked as an editor at Cosmopolitan magazine until shortly before the publication of "The Second Happiest Day" (1953), a novel satirizing the author's generation.
        He was part of the circle surrounding The Paris Review, for which he was an advisory editor and a contributor.
        His most recent book was "Dear Parrot" (1980), a work of nonfiction.
        In addition to his brother Timothy, of Manhattan, he is survived by his companion, Susan Martin; a son, James, of Manhattan; a brother Elon, of Gold Beach, Ore.; a sister, Sabina, of Hilo, Hawaii, and a granddaughter.
