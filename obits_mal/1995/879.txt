        William M. Rountree, who served as a United States ambassador in Asia, Africa and Latin America from 1959 to 1973, died on Friday in Shands Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He was 78 and lived in Gainesville.
        He had been under treatment for cancer, family members said.
        Mr. Rountree came to diplomacy by way of the Treasury Department, which lent him as a budget specialist in 1941 to the Lend-Lease Administration, a vital component of President Roosevelt's efforts to sustain Britain, and later the Soviet Union, against Hitler's onslaught.
        He was then chosen by Ambassador Loy Henderson as his principal assistant in  Cairo directing United States economic operations in the Middle East. Ambassador Henderson sponsored Mr. Rountree's entry into the Foreign Service, where he soon was given responsibilities for economic and political affairs in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa.
        Mr. Rountree became a close aide of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. As an Assistant Secretary of State, Mr. Rountree was deeply involved in the 1956 Suez crisis and in the 1958 unrest in Lebanon.
        He was appointed Ambassador to Pakistan in 1959, to the Sudan in 1962, to South Africa in 1965 and to Brazil in 1970. He retired in 1973.
        Mr. Rountree was born in Swainsboro, Ga. He earned a bachelor's degree and then a law degree by attending night classes at Columbus University in Washington. Columbus later became the Catholic University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Suzanne McDowall; a daughter, Susan Hanes of Chicago; two sisters, Mary Roberts of Decatur, Ga., and Sara Thomason of New Orleans, and two grandsons.
