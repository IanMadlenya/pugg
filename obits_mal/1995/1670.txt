        Allan Scott, who as a Hollywood screenwriter was the co-author of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals, died on Thursday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 88.
        In a career that spanned 50 years, Mr. Scott wrote or collaborated on the screenplays for "Top Hat," "Follow the Fleet," "Swing Time" and "Shall We Dance," and also contributed, without credit, to the screenplay of "The Gay Divorcee," all before 1938. His other films included "Quality Street," "Skylark," "So Proudly We Hail" (in which Claudette Colbert, Paulette Goddard and Veronica Lake played Army nurses), "Let's Dance" (starring Astaire and Betty Hutton), "The Five Thousand Fingers of Dr. T." and "The Fourposter."
        Mr. Scott began his career on Broadway as the co-author with George Haight of the 1933 comedy "Goodbye Again." In the cast were Osgood Perkins, Myron McCormick and a new young actor named James Stewart. The play was revived in 1943 and again in 1956, in a production starring Donald Cook, and was filmed in 1933. Well known as a script doctor, Mr. Scott made uncredited but acknowledged contributions to dozens of movies, including "Holiday Inn," "Since You Went Away," "The Paradine Case," "Portrait of Jennie," "The Caine Mutiny" and "The Defiant Ones."
        He was born in Arlington, N.J., graduated from Amherst College and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University.
        His wife, Laura, died in 1966. He is survived by his daughter, the actress Pippa Scott of Los Angeles; his son, Dr. David Scott of Virginia Beach, Va., and four grandchildren.
