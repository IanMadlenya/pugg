        George C. Vournas, a Washington lawyer active in the Greek-American community, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 98.
        Born in Greece, he came to the United States at the age 17 and earned his law degree in Washington. He was in private practice until about 10 years ago, often representing business interests before Government agencies.
        He was a past president of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association. His familiarity with Greek-American affairs led President Lyndon B. Johnson to name him to the official United States delegation to the funeral of King Paul I of Greece in 1964.
        Mr. Vournas is survived by his wife of 51 years, Helen Petrow Vournas, and two daughters, Anastasia Vournas of Manhattan and Vassiliki Vournas of Gaithersburg, Md.
