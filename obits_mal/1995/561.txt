        Ralph Rosenblum, a film editor, director and teacher, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 69.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Rosenblum edited six of Woody Allen's films, beginning with "Take the Money and Run" and including "Annie Hall" and "Sleeper." He also edited "A Thousand Clowns," "The Pawnbroker," "Fail-Safe," "Goodbye Columbus," "The Night They Raided Minsky's" and many other films.
        He was co-author, with Robert Karen, of a 1979 book, "When the Shooting Stops . . . the Cutting Begins," in which he discussed the film editing process. Writing about the editing of "Annie Hall," he said that the challenge "was to find the plot amid all the brilliant skits."
        Mr. Rosenblum's television credits included the "American Short Story" series on PBS, and Henry Fonda's last film, "Summer Solstice" (1981), which he directed for ABC. For the past several years, Mr. Rosenblum taught at the graduate film school at Columbia University and also taught summer film workshops in Rockport, Me.
        He is survived by his wife, Davida; a daughter, Emily Kirsch of Beverly, Mass.; a son, Paul of Queens, and a brother, Jack Ross of Merrick, L.I.
