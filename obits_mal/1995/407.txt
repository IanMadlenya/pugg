        David G. Roth, an official of the American Jewish Committee who was the organization's chief liaison to ethnic groups, died on Saturday at Rush Presbyterian St. Vincent Hospital in Chicago. He was 55 and lived in Riverwoods, Ill.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery he had undergone two weeks ago, said Arthur S. Berger, a committee spokesman in New York.
        Mr. Roth was the director of the organization's Institute for American Pluralism, which is based in Chicago. He worked with various ethnic groups to develop leadership and build coalitions, and led workshops intended to improve ethnic and racial relations between students and faculty members in colleges and high schools.
        Mr. Roth, a 1961 graduate of Washington College in Chestertown, Md., joined the Chicago office of the American Jewish Committee in 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, Sandra, and a daughter, Abbie.
