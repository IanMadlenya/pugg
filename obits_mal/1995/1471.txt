        Roger Lea MacBride, who became guardian of Laura Ingalls Wilder's "Little House" series of young-adult novels, who later drew on them in his own writing and who ran for President in 1976 as the Libertarian Party's nominee, died on Sunday at his home in Miami Beach. He was 65.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Abigail Adams MacBride.
        Mr. MacBride, a lawyer who was also a writer of children's books, became the guardian of the "Little House" series in 1968, upon the death of Mrs. Wilder's daughter, Rose Lane. Mrs. Lane, an adherent of the laissez-faire objectivist philosophy of the novelist Ayn Rand, was an only child who herself was childless and who had adopted Mr. MacBride as a political disciple. He was her executor and sole heir.
        The "Little House" books recalled Mrs. Wilder's hardscrabble frontier childhood in the 1870's and became a popular success during the Depression. Mr. MacBride helped to turn them into the hit television series "Little House on the Prairie" in the 1970's. In recent years, he had begun writing his own series of historical young-adult novels, based on Mrs. Lane's childhood on a Missouri farm.
        Mr. MacBride was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. He joined the Wall Street firm of White & Case but moved on to open a small practice in Vermont, where he served a term in the State Legislature.
        Later, after moving to Virginia, he joined the anti-government Libertarian Party and drew national attention in 1972, when, as one of Virginia's 12 Republican electors, he cast his vote not for Richard M. Nixon and Spiro T. Agnew but for the Libertarian candidates, giving them their only vote in the Electoral College.
        As the Libertarian Presidential candidate four years later, he was on the ballot in 32 states and drew 173,011 votes.
        Mr. MacBride wrote a Libertarian Party manifesto, "A New Dawn for America: The Libertarian Challenge" (Green Hill, 1976), which remains in print. His other books in print, at HarperCollins Children's Books, are "Little Farm in the Ozarks" (1994) and "Little House on Rocky Ridge" (1993).
        His daughter said another book, "In the Land of the Big Red Apple," was due out next month. Just before his death, she said, he had completed a fourth book in his HarperCollins series, tentatively titled "Beyond the Horizon," and was working on several others.
        Besides his daughter, who lives in Charlottesville, Va., and Miami Beach, Mr. MacBride is survived by two sisters: Patricia Hendrickson of Westport, Conn., and Pamela Colgate of Darien, Conn.
