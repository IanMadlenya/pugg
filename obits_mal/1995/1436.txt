        Robert A. Ruehrwein, a research scientist who devised manufacturing processes used in developing the optoelectronics industry, died on March 10 in St. Luke's Hospital in Chesterfield, Mo. He was 79 and lived in Chesterfield.
        The cause was lung cancer and pneumonia, said his wife, Mary Alice Ruehrwein.
        From 1945 to 1962, Mr. Ruehrwein worked at the Monsanto Company in Dayton, Ohio, developing practical processes for optoelectonic manufacturing, which aided in the development of a multitude of products, including light-emitting diodes and high-speed lasers used in fiber-optic telecommunication networks. From 1962 until he retired from Monsanto in 1973, he worked in St. Louis developing other optoelectronic applications.
        After his retirement, he became a full-time consultant for the General Instrument Corporation, helping in setting up a division on compound semiconductors. In 1978 he joined Vactec Inc., which later became part of EG&G Inc. He retired a second time in 1992.
        He received an undergraduate degree in chemistry from Montana State University in 1936 and a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of California at Berkeley in 1939.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Alicia McColl of St. Louis, and a sister, Eleanor Whitson of California.
