        Donald M. White, a highly decorated retired rear admiral who served as a Navy aviator in both World War II and the Korean War, died on Monday at Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, Fla. He was 80 and lived in Pensacola.
        The cause was complications from abdominal surgery, his son Michael said.
        A native of Minneapolis, Admiral White graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937 and became a naval aviator three years later. He was at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, and soon after, as a member of a torpedo squadron assigned to the U.S.S. Enterprise, he participated in one of the first American offensive actions of World War II.
        Cited for "extraordinary heroism" as the acting commander of the torpedo squadron in a raid on Japanese forces at Rabaul on Nov. 11, 1943, he was awarded the Navy Cross.
        Besides his son Michael, of Palm City, Fla., Admiral White is survived by a daughter, Barbara Smith of Fairbanks, Alaska; four other sons, Bruce, of St. Leonard, Md., Donald Jr., of White Hall, Md., Edward, of Greensboro, N.C., and Anthony, of Pensacola, and 15 grandchildren. His wife of 50 years, Ruth, died in 1987.
