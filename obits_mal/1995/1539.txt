        Keith Warren Jennison, a writer, editor and publisher who became an early leader in the publishing of large-type commercial books, died on Thursday in his home in Castleton, Vt. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, said his brother, Peter S. Jennison.
        After writing more than 20 books and holding editing positions with major publishing houses in Manhattan, Mr. Jennison opened his own publishing firm, Keith Jennison Books, which was devoted to printing books in large type. The books were a boon to thousands of people who had been avid readers but whose diminishing vision turned the pleasure into more of a chore.
        In addition to printing commercial volumes, he oversaw the publication of scores of classics. The company, which Mr. Jennison started with Franklin Watts, eventually became part of Grolier Inc.
        A sixth-generation Vermonter, Mr. Jennison's first success was as an author of books on the humor and lore of his native region. His book "Vermont Is Where You Find It" (Harcourt, Brace & Company, 1941) sold more than half a million copies over 50 years.
        Starting out in publishing as a salesman for Harcourt, Brace in 1935, he became a sales manager for Henry Holt & Company in the 1940's. He helped found the firm of William Sloane Associates, where he was a vice president until 1949, after which he became an executive at Viking Press Inc. He was a vice president and editor in chief of the David McKay Company from 1959 to 1962.
        For many years after his retirement to Vermont, he taught at Castleton State College.
        Besides his brother, of Castleton, he is survived by his wife, Emily; two sons, Christopher, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Keith Nicholas, of Napa, Calif., and four grandchildren.
