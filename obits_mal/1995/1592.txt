        George Bapst Darling, a Yale University ecologist who studied the long-term radiation effects of the American atomic bombing of Japan, died on Thursday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 89.
        He had been in declining health for some time, the university said.
        Dr. Darling was professor emeritus of human ecology at the Yale School of Medicine, where he was a faculty member from 1946 until his retirement in 1974. But for much of that time, from 1957 to 1972, he was on leave to serve as director of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Hiroshima, a joint undertaking of the National Academy of Sciences and the Japanese Government.
        Leading a team of Japanese and American scientists, he carried out extensive research on how the bursts over Hiroshima and Nagasaki continued to affect the health and life spans of residents. This entailed periodic examinations of survivors who suffered varying degrees of radiation burns in 1945. The results threw new light on the behavior of genes and cancer cells.
        Born in Boston, Dr. Darling graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned a doctorate in public health at the University of Michigan. From 1932 to 1943 he oversaw the grants and fellowships of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation in Battle Creek, Mich.
        He then worked in the medical science division of the National Research Council in Washington, becoming an expert in the administration of medical and scientific affairs. At Yale he was appointed Director of Medical Affairs, responsible for coordinating the work of the School of Medicine, the Yale School of Nursing, the Department of University Health and the Grace-New Haven Community Hospital, now Yale-New Haven Hospital.
        Dr. Darling's wife of more than six decades, Ann Shaw Darling, died about three years ago.
