        Samuel J. Meer, a psychologist who helped train school psychologists to recognize learning disabilities, died on March 7 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 75 and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said a son, David Meer.
        A professor emeritus at the Graduate School of Education of the City College of New York, Dr. Meer directed the school's education clinic from 1962 to 1972, where he developed testing and diagnostic techniques so that psychologists could more quickly recognize learning disabilities and recommend a course of instruction.
        He was born in Manhattan, and received his undergraduate degree from City College and a Ph.D. in psychology from what is now Case Western Reserve University. He began teaching at the university in 1956 and retired in 1981. He was a staff psychologist for the Westchester Jewish Community Service in White Plains for nearly nine years after his retirement.
        Besides his son David, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 45 years, Renee Cutler Meer; another son, Daniel, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.
