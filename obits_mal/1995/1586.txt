        Jerauld Wright, a naval officer who led American and NATO forces during a period of expansion by the Soviet navy during the 1950's and who later was Ambassador to Taiwan, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 96.
        The cause was pneumonia, a Navy Department spokesman said.
        Admiral Wright became commander of American naval forces in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterrean in 1952 and two years later he was named United States Atlantic Fleet Commander and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
        In 1960, he retired with four stars after a 42-year career. In 1961 President Kennedy appointed him to the Central Intelligence Agency's Board of Estimates. He was named Ambassador to Taiwan in 1963 and served in that post for two years.
        Admiral Wright was given a number of combat assignments in the two world wars, the first of them in 1918 aboard a gunboat on anti-submarine patrols in the Mediterranean. Twenty-five years later he commanded amphibious assaults in the war in the Pacific.
        He stayed on in Europe after World War I in several assignments aboard destroyers, returning to the United States in 1924 to become a naval aide to Presidents Coolidge and Hoover.
        By 1942, he was a captain on Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff to help in the invasion of North Africa and other operations.
        Born in Amherst, Mass., he graduated from the Naval Academy in 1917.
        He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Phyllis; a son, William Mason Wright of Arlington; and a daughter, Marion Jerauld Wright of Denver.
