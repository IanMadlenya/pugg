        Ralph Blane, a composer and lyricist who, with Hugh Martin, created the songs for one of Hollywood's most beloved musicals, "Meet Me in St. Louis" (1944), died yesterday at his home in Broken Arrow, Okla., the town where he was born. He was 81.
        Mr. Blane, whose full name was Ralph Blane Hunsecker, began his career in show business as a tenor who sang regularly on NBC radio in the 1930's and was featured in the Broadway productions of "New Faces of 1936" and the Irving Berlin musical "Louisiana Purchase" (1940).
        In the latter show he appeared with Mr. Martin as a member of the Martins, a vocal backup group. But it was in their collaborations as songwriters that the two men would become best known.
        They made their debut as a team with "Best Foot Forward," the 1941 Broadway hit that was revived in 1963 as a vehicle to present the young Liza Minnelli. And "Meet Me in St. Louis," the M-G-M classic starring Ms. Minnelli's mother, Judy Garland, introduced the enduring standards "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas," "The Trolley Song," and "The Boy Next Door."
        Mr. Blane continued to work independently in Hollywood and was the sole songwriter for the 1952 Broadway musical "Three Wishes for Jamie." He and Mr. Martin reunited to write 10 new songs for a 1989 stage version of "Meet Me in St. Louis."
        He is survived by his son George, of Broken Arrow.
