        Don Marshall, a milliner whose creations were worn by many of society's most fashionable women, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said Alan Wilkinson of Manhattan, a business associate.
        Mr. Marshall made toques for Estee Lauder, turbans for Rosalind Russell, broad brims for Joan Crawford and veiled caplets for the Duchess of Windsor. His designs were worn by Rose Kennedy, Irene Worth and Nancy Kissinger, among others.
        The hat Grace Kelly wore at her wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco was one of his designs. It is now part of the permanent collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
        Born William Sydenstricker in Lewisburg, W.Va., he changed his name in the early 1940's, when he began appearing in Broadway choruses. While entertaining troops returning from the battlefields of Europe, a fellow cast member said she needed a new hat, and he made his first design. He opened his first studio in New York in 1945. At his death, he had salons in Manhattan, Beverly Hills and Paris.
