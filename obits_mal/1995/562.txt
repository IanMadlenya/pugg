        Verne M. Chapman, a leading mammalian geneticist and chairman of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, died on Aug. 30 while attending a scientific meeting in Tsukuba Science City in Japan. He was 56.
        Dr. Chapman, who lived in East Aurora, a suburb of Buffalo, died of a stroke, a spokeswoman at Roswell Park said.
        For the last four years, he had been working with the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Tsukuba Science City, a Government-sponsored research center, on a project to identify and characterize genes. His work led to the development of chromosome maps of laboratory mice, a crucial step in identifying and analyzing the molecular defects often associated with cancer.
        Born in Sacramento, Calif., Dr. Chapman graduated from California State Polytechnic College. He received a master's degree and a doctorate in genetics from Oregon State University.
        He joined Roswell Park in 1972 as a senior cancer research scientist and in 1982 was appointed to his present post. He was also a research professor in the Roswell Park Graduate Division of the State University at Buffalo.
        He is survived by his wife, Deborah Stewart; a son, Zachary; a daughter, Chloe, and two brothers, Gary, of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Marvin, of California.
