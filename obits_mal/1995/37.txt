        Rabbi Milton Grafman, a Birmingham, Ala., civic leader for more than 50 years who figured in a chapter of the civil rights struggle there, died on Sunday at Baptist Montclair Hospital in Birmingham. He was 88.
        Rabbi Grafman, who led Temple Emanu-El from 1941 until his retirement in 1975, was caught up in the movement toward racial equality in 1963 when he and fellow clergymen angered whites and blacks alike with their efforts to relieve tensions. They attacked segregation in public parks as well as Gov. George C. Wallace's 1963 inaugural speech in which he declared "segregation now, segregation forever."
        The clergymen irritated civil rights leaders later that year by asking the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to delay demonstrations in Birmingham and wait for the courts to act against racial discrimination. That led Dr. King to write his "Letter From a Birmingham Jail" addressed to Rabbi Grafman and seven other white clergymen in which he said blacks were tired of waiting.
        Rabbi Grafman took umbrage because he felt that Dr. King unfairly branded the group as racist. But it was 15 years before he said so publicly, breaking his silence at a civil rights conference at the University of Alabama at which he criticized Dr. King and declared, "Now this letter is studied in English courses and sociology courses, and I get at least one letter a semester asking me if I'm still a bigot."
        Rabbi Grafman was born in Washington and studied at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, where he was ordained in 1931.
        Rabbi Grafman is survived by a daughter, Ruth Fromstein of Milwaukee; a son, Stephen, of Washington; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 9, 1995, Friday
