        William J. Lentsch, a theater director who worked Off Broadway, died on Saturday at his home in Valatie, N.Y. He was 53.
        The cause was heart failure, according to the Raymond E. Bond Funeral Home in Valatie.
        Mr. Lentsch's credits included productions of Tennessee Williams's "In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel" and "The Two Character Play." One of his more unusual projects was a 1978 revival of Arthur Miller's "All My Sons" featuring the Lighthouse Players, many of whom were blind or visually impaired. In 1980, Mr. Lentsch adapted and directed "The Story of the Gadsbys," the first production of Rudyard Kipling's only completed play. In later years he taught theater and coached actors.
        Mr. Lentsch was born in Portsmouth, Va. After moving to New York City, he attended City College, from which he was graduated.
        He is survived by his mother, Mrs. Harriet Draper, and a son, Christofer, both of Houston.
