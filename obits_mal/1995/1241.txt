        Carroll P. Reed, who helped define the style of American skiing through a chain of stores that carried his name and sold skis and ski clothing, died on Sunday at a nursing home near his home in North Conway, N.H. He was 89.
        While recovering from a ski accident in Jackson, N.H., in 1934, Mr. Reed, a native of West Roxbury, Mass., became captivated by the Mount Washington Valley in New Hampshire, and saw its potential as a ski resort.
        Within two years he founded one of the first ski schools in New England and started the first of the Carroll Reed stores, importing Scandinavian ski wear that was sold through ski shops and mail order. His holiday catalogue with a back-cover photograph of the Reed family was a favorite of his customers.
        In 1969 Mr. Reed sold the chain, which by then consisted of a mail-order business, two stores and several mountain shops.
        Mr. Reed also helped found the Conway Scenic Railroad, a steam excursion railroad in North Conway.
        Besides his wife, Katherine, Mr. Reed is survived by two daughters, Damon, of Haverhill, Mass., and Stephanie Markham Hastings of Fryeburg, Me., six grandchildren and a great-grandson.
