        Maurits Dekker, a retired New York publisher of scientific texts and materials, died on Monday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Stamford, Conn. A Greenwich resident, he was 95.
        He had been in failing health for several years, his family said.
        Born in Amsterdam, Mr. Dekker studied chemistry and microbiology at the University of Amsterdam, graduating in 1922. He started a career in scientific writing and the book trade and was sent to New York in 1939 by Elsevier Publishing of Amsterdam.
        During World War II, he became co-founder of Interscience Publishers of New York, which merged with John Wiley & Sons in the 1960's but remains a separate imprint. Mr. Dekker next joined Marcel Dekker Inc., also a science publisher, which was founded by his son in Manhattan. He retired as its chairman in 1989.
        Besides his son Marcel, of Greenwich, he is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Wynberg of Groningen, the Netherlands; another son, Andrew of Pittsburgh; 10 grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren.
