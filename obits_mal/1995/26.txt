        Tony Azito, the lanky, loose-limbed Broadway actor who led the Keystone Kops in the New York Shakespeare Festival's 1981 production of "The Pirates of Penzance," died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Bonnie Egan, a friend.
        Mr. Azito was born in Manhattan and attended public schools in Manhattan and Queens. He studied drama at the Juilliard School, where he worked with John Houseman in the experimental company that later became the nucleus of the Acting Company. He also studied with the dancer and choreographer Anna Sokolow.
        He left Juilliard in 1976 to take the role of Mr. Peachum's assistant in the Shakespeare in the Park production of "The Threepenny Opera." A year later, he appeared as Dr. Nakamura in the Brecht-Weill musical "Happy End," which starred Meryl Streep. Both performances were widely praised.
        In 1980, he was nominated for a Tony Award and received a Drama Desk Award for his role as the Sergeant in "Pirates." He also appeared in the film version of the operetta.
        Mr. Azito spent four years with the LaMama Experimental Theater Company, appearing in a dozen shows. In the 1970's, he often performed cabaret at Reno Sweeney and the Ballroom. With the Shakespeare Festival, he appeared as Bardolph in "Henry IV" (1985) and Feste in "Twelfth Night" (1986).
        His film credits included "Union City," "Private Resort" and "Bloodhounds of Broadway," as well as small roles in "The Addams Family" and "Moonstruck." In the television series "Miami Vice" he had a recurring role as the drug dealer Manolo.
        He is survived by his mother, Gladys, of Hartford; a sister, Jeannie, also of Hartford, and three brothers: Arturo, of San Francisco; Mark, of Amsterdam, and Benjamin, who is serving in the Marine Corps.
