        Dr. Leo Pine, a Federal medical researcher who developed a growth medium for the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease, died on Dec. 29 at a relative's home in Jupiter, Fla. He was 72 and lived in Atlanta.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, his wife, Geraldine, said.
        Dr. Pine, a biochemist and medical mycologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta for more than 30 years, published more than 140 scientific papers on toxic shock syndrome, Listeria bacteria, the disease-causing fungus Histoplasma capsulatum and other subjects. He found in 1978 that a growth medium he had developed in the 1960's worked for the bacterium that causes Legionnaires' disease.
        Dr. Pine was born on Feb. 13, 1922, in Tucson, Ariz. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Arizona and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. Before joining the C.D.C. in 1963, he was a research professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and carried out research at Duke University and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
        He retired three years ago but continued his work at the centers as a guest researcher until last year.
        In addition to his wife, of Atlanta, he is survived by three sons, Jonah, Joshua and Jonathan, all of Atlanta; three daughters, Leah Goldberg of Athens, Ga., Elizabeth Lehrer of Boca Raton, Fla., and Karin Freye, of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.
