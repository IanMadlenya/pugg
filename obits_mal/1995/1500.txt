        Dr. Norman Herzig, medical adviser to the Albert Schweitzer Institute for the Humanities and a former director of obstetrics and gynecology at Montefiore Medical Center and Morrisania and North Central Bronx hospitals, died on March 4 at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 82 and moved to Hamden, Conn., from Manhattan six years ago.
        The cause was heart disease, said his wife, Helen.
        One of Dr. Herzig's last activities for the Schweitzer Institute, in New Haven, was to assist in an airlift of children from Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, to hospitals in the United States for special medical treatment.
        Born in Manhattan, he received an undergraduate degree from Columbia College in 1933 and a medical degree from New York University Medical School in 1939. He taught for a number of years at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine until his retirement in 1979. He also was a former director of obstetrics and gynecology at the Martin Luther King Health Center.
        His first marriage ended in divorce in 1956. Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Erica Zielinski of Manalapan, N.J, and Beth Herzig of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Jill Marshall of Ossining, N.Y., and Degen Marshall Sayer of Rye, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
