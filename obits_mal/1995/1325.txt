        Jerry Zimmerman, a pianist with the New York City Ballet who appeared onstage in many of the company's productions, died on Saturday at his home in Pittstown, N.Y. He was 52.
        The cause was AIDS, said Deborah Koolish, a spokeswoman for the City Ballet.
        Mr. Zimmerman's role as a solo pianist with the company became prominent when a spate of so-called piano ballets by George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins became highly popular. In 1971, when Mr. Robbins revived his 1956 comic ballet, "The Concert," it owed much of its huge success to Mr. Zimmerman's hilarious performance as the exasperated concert pianist.
        But Mr. Zimmerman was also a serious pianist, often seen on the stage playing in such ballets as Balanchine's "Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' " and Robbins's "Goldberg Variations," "Dances at a Gathering" and "In the Night."
        Mr. Zimmerman, who was born in Hooversville, Pa., studied with Beveridge Webster at the Juilliard School and in London with Ilona Kabos before joining the City Ballet in 1969 at Balanchine's invitation. He made his recital debut in 1974 at Alice Tully Hall. In 1979, at the invitation of President Carter, he took part in a program with Mikhail Baryshnikov, Patricia McBride and other City Ballet principals in a nationally televised program from the White House.
        He is survived by his mother, B. Elaine Zimmerman; a brother, Christopher Zimmerman, and a grandmother, Bessie Smith.
