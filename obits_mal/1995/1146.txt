        Harlan Logan, who after careers as a teacher, magazine editor and public relations consultant became a State Representative when he retired to New Hampshire in 1961, died on Dec. 16 in Hanover, N.H. A longtime resident of Meriden, N.H., he was 90.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said his daughter Lois Evans of Manhattan.
        In a 30-year career that included directing Scribner's Magazine and Look, Mr. Logan had left publishing in 1952 to become the director of public relations at the Corning Glass Works and, later, a vice president at General Foods.
        When he retired, he quickly became involved in politics through opposition to a trailer park and was elected to the State Legislature in 1968. During his four years of service, he was the Republican majority leader in 1969 and remained active in politics until the onset of his illness in 1980.
        Born in Starkville, Miss., he received his undergraduate and graduate degrees in 1925 and 1926 from Indiana University, where his father was a professor of geology. He was a Rhodes Scholar, then taught at New York University.
        Besides his daughter Lois, he is survived by his wife, Audrey of Hanover; a second daughter, Haven Faulk of Orinda, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Robin Wilkerson of Boston, Cathy Wilkerson of Brooklyn, and Ann Olsen of Kentucky; 11 grandchildren; 4 stepgrandchildren, and 7 great-grandchildren.
