        F. Karl Willenbrock, an electrical engineer and educator who retired two years ago as a senior scientist in the United States Department of Commerce, died on Aug. 24 at a nursing home in Alexandria, Va. He was 75 and a resident of the nearby town of Reston.
        The cause was heart failure, said Patricia Samaras, a colleague and friend.
        Dr. Willenbrock served as a researcher, laboratory director and associate dean at Harvard University from 1950 to 1967, when he became provost and professor of engineering and applied science at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He joined the National Bureau of Standards in 1970 to head its Institute of Applied Technology.
        Returning to academe in 1976, he spent 10 years as a dean and professor of engineering at Southern Methodist University. After that, he was associated with the American Society for Engineering Education, the National Science Foundation, Carnegie Mellon University and, finally, the Technology Administration in the Commerce Department.
        Frederick Karl Willenbrock was born in New York City and graduated from Brown University in 1942. He moved on to Harvard to earn master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering and applied physics.
        Survivors include his wife, Mildred White Willenbrock of Reston; a sister, Annamarie Morley of Los Angeles, and a brother, Berthold D. Willenbrock Jr. of Farmingdale, L.I.
