        James Shriver 3d, a former managing editor and vice president of the Gallup Poll, died on June 29 at Princeton Hospital in Princeton, N.J. He was 67 and lived in Princeton.
        The cause was throat cancer, said Mackell M. Shriver, his former wife.
        From 1974 until his retirement in 1989, Mr. Shriver wrote the Gallup Organization's weekly syndicated press releases and edited its monthly publication. He also took care of much of the company's day-to-day management.
        He was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and graduated from Princeton University in 1950.
        He started his career in advertising, at Gallup & Robinson, an advertising research firm in Princeton. Later, he worked in New York as an account executive at the Young & Rubicam and J. Walter Thompson agencies and at the Colgate-Palmolive Company.
        He returned to Princeton in 1974 to join the Gallup Organization. Since his retirement, he had worked as a volunteer for Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit group that provides taped material for the sight-impaired.
        In addition to Mrs. Shriver, who lives in Princeton, Mr. Shriver is survived by a brother, Charles D., of Rancho Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.
