        Arthur Cohen, an engineer who helped to develop the proximity fuse detonator, a battlefield device that caused enemy missiles to explode prematurely, died on Jan. 12 at New York Hospital. He was 74 and lived in Flemington, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Denise Shapiro.
        The detonator, using radio waves to set off warheads before they hit their targets, was used in 1944 in the Battle of the Bulge, when the Allies defeated Germany's last major offensive. Decades later, Mr. Cohen helped develop a ceramic heat shield to protect satellites and enable manned spacecraft to survive the heat of re-entering the atmosphere.
        Mr. Cohen, who received a degree from Alfred University, worked for Sylvania and was chief of research and development for several companies. He also founded his own company, Ceramics for Industry.
        Besides his daughter Denise, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Sylvia Wieder Cohen; another daughter, Ann Sherman, and a son, Lawrence, both of Needham, Mass.; a sister, Sarah Silverstein of Rochester, and five grandchildren.
