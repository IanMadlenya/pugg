        William F. Rickenbacker, an investment counselor and a senior editor of National Review magazine, died on Thursday at his home in Francestown, N.H. He was 67.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        The son of Edward V. Rickenbacker, the World War I ace and founder of Eastern Airlines, the younger Mr. Rickenbacker graduated from Harvard College in 1949. He then went into the investment-counseling business, said his wife, Nancy Angel.
        He branched out into various writing ventures, usually to propound his libertarian beliefs. An example of this stance was his refusal in 1962 to fill out a Federal census form because he contended it violated constitutional protections against illegal search and seizure. He was fined $100 and placed on one day's probation.
        As well as working for National Review, Mr. Rickenbacker was also a contributing editor to Modern Age and author of eight books.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Rickenbacker is survived by two sons, James Edward, of Houston and Thomas, of Tewksbury, Mass.
