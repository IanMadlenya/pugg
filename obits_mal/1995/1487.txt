        Morris B. Zale, founder of the jewelry-store chain the Zale Corporation, died on Wednesday at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. He was 93 and lived in Dallas.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his son Donald.
        Mr. Zale started the company in 1924 as a small jewelry store in Wichita Falls, Tex. By 1986, when the Zale Corporation was acquired in a hostile takeover by Peoples Jewelers of Canada and Swarovski International Holdings A.G. of Switzerland, Mr. Zale had built it into an international company with more than 1,500 stores and $1.2 billion in annual sales.
        Mr. Zale stepped down as president in 1971 and became the chairman. He was appointed chairman emeritus in 1981 and retired in 1987.
        In 1952, he and his brother, William, formed the Zale Foundation, a philanthropic organization. The foundation helped build the Zale Lipshy Hospital in Dallas. It also finances scholarships and provides grants for programs for homeless people, including the Genesis Shelter in Atlanta, for mothers and infants, and the Vogel Alcove in Dallas, a day-care program for children from homeless families.
        In addition to his son Donald, of Dallas, Mr. Zale is survived by his wife, Edna Lipshy Zale; another son, Marvin, of Boca Raton, Fla.; a daughter, Gloria, of Great Neck, L.I.; 14 grandchildren, and 30 great-grandchildren.
