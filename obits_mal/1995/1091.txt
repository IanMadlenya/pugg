        David J. Silber, an actor who appeared in plays on and off Broadway as well as in several touring and regional theater productions, died on Thursday at his parents' home in Brookline, Mass. He was 41.
        The cause was AIDS, said his mother, Kathryn.
        Mr. Silber was best known for his starring role in the Off Broadway production of Rudyard Kipling's play "The Story of the Gadsbys." Of his performance as Captain Gadsby, Mel Gussow wrote in The New York Times: "The sandy-haired Mr. Silber is a windswept military hero. One can imagine him leaping on horseback and riding into battle."
        He also appeared on Broadway in "Zoya's Apartment," "Breaking the Code," "Pygmalion" and "Aren't We All?" He appeared at the Ford Theater in Washington in "A Christmas Carol," which was later broadcast on PBS.
        David Joslin Silber was born in New Haven in 1953. He attended the University of Texas and graduated from Boston University in 1975. Until recently, he lived in Manhattan and Ghent, N.Y.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by his companion, Marc Brody of Manhattan and Ghent; his father, Dr. John R. Silber, the president of Boston University, and seven siblings.
