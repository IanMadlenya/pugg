        Charley Boswell, who lost his sight during World War II but gained renown as  a blind golfer, died on Sunday night. He was 78.
        Boswell, who died at HealthSouth Medical Center, had been in failing health since suffering a blood clot on the brain during a fall in March, a hospital spokesman said.
        He was a star in football and baseball at the University of Alabama, but his life as an athlete appeared over when he was blinded by a German artillery shell that exploded after he pulled a crew member from a tank in 1944.
        "I've often said that it took a lot of courage to go back into that tank and  get that soldier," said Alston Callahan, development director at the Eye Foundation Hospital. "But all of the things he did after losing his sight, they  took real courage."
        Along with founding an insurance company, raising a family and serving as Alabama state revenue commissioner, Boswell learned to play golf despite the loss of his sight. Blind golfers play with the aid of a caddy or sight coach who helps direct their shots.
        Boswell once shot an 81, and he won 28 national and international titles for  blind golfers. His circle of friends expanded to included the rich and famous, and he became well known as host of the Charley Boswell Celebrity Golf Classic,  which raised $1.5 million for the Eye Foundation Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, Kitty; two sons, Steve and Charles Jr., and a daughter, Kay McCarty.
