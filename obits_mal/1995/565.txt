        Raymond Koontz, who orchestrated Diebold Inc.'s transformation from a manufacturer of bank vaults and safes into a leading maker of automated teller machines, died on Thursday at his home in Canton, Ohio, a Diebold spokesman said. He was 83.
        A native of North Carolina, Mr. Koontz left the University of Virginia after two years during the Depression to work as a $25-a-week salesman in a department store. "That doesn't appear to be much of a salary today," he said in an interview in 1959. "But in 1931 it was a princely sum, and I was happy to be far above the bread lines."
        After a succession of jobs, Mr. Koontz joined Diebold in 1947 as the assistant to the president. After serving a series of executive jobs, he was named president in 1952 and served until 1978. During that tenure, Diebold's annual revenue nearly doubled, to $451 million from $229 million. In the early 1970's he pushed the 126-year-old company into the emerging automated teller machine market, against the resistance of other Diebold officials, according to the company's 1994 annual report. Now the company, which is based in Canton, makes more than half of the automated teller machines used in the United States.
        Mr. Koontz was elected chairman and chief executive of Diebold in 1978 and remained in both positions until his retirement in 1988. He served on the board from 1949 until April of this year.
