        Theodore H. Halligan, a financier and civic leader, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Halligan was an oft-quoted interpreter of financial trends. During his Wall Street career, he served as a vice president at Dean Witter, a partner of Walston & Company and a managing director of Piper Jaffray. At his death, he was a general partner of Penfield Partners and engaged in private money management.
        Another important part of his life was shaped by the United States Military Academy, where he began a lifelong association with Army football and served as the mentor and adviser of many students and alumni. He graduated from West Point in 1945 and served for 10 years with the 11th and 82d Airborne Divisions in Korea and Japan, attaining the rank of captain.
        Born in Rutherford, N.J., he earned a master's degree in 1950 from the University of Missouri.
        He was the immediate past president of the West Point Society of New York and an officer of India House and the National Institute of Social Sciences. He recently became a member of the New York City Private Industry Council and was a board member of U.S.O. International and the St. Andrew's Society, among other organizations.
        Mr. Halligan is survived by his wife, Irene R. Halligan, Commissioner of Protocol for New York City; a son, Mark, of Venice, Fla.; four daughters, Theodora O'Neill of Fair Haven, N.J., Laurie Carter of Los Angeles, Dr. Kyle DeBenham of Coty, Wyo., and Beth DeBenham of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
