        Stanley Lewis, owner of the Parnassus bookshop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and former publisher of the journal Parnassus: Poetry in Review, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 58 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        He had leukemia, said his daughter, Andrea.
        In 1976, when Mr. Lewis closed his cosy, cluttered Parnassus store, which he had operated for a decade at 216 West 89th St., the reviewer and editor Thomas Lask wrote this lament for the shop in The New York Times:
        "The West Side will mourn it as the major loss of a civilized amenity. For Parnassus was more like a family-run candy store than a literary emporium. All sorts of people from affluent burghers to seedy winos dropped in. Literary types gathered to comment on the failing powers of such and such a critic or to collect a choice morsel of gossip."
        When Mr. Lewis, a slight, pipe-smoking bookman, opened Parnassus in 1966, he stocked it at first with his personal library of 500 books. After a holdup late in 1975, he decided to move the shop to Rhinebeck, N.Y.
        Later he returned to New York and was the manager of the Books & Company bookstore -- at 939 Madison Avenue, near the Whitney Museum -- and then a co-manager of the Chartwell bookstore at 55 East 52d Street. He also published books and ran a wholesale academic and scholarly book business.
        He co-founded the journal Parnassus in 1975 with Herbert Leibowitz and was its publisher for several years, his daughter said.
        Mr. Lewis was born in Brooklyn and attended Baruch College. His first two marriages ended in divorce.
        Besides his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, the former Judith Kaufman; two sons, David and Daniel, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Rita Kalmore of Richboro, Pa.
