        Hugh Borton, an authority on Japan who became president of Haverford College after heading Columbia University's East Asian Institute, died on Sunday at his home in Conway, Mass. He was 92.
        Dr. Borton was in the State Department from 1942 to 1948 and was chief of its Japanese affairs division and special assistant to the director of Far Eastern Affairs in charge of preparations for the peace treaty with Japan.
        He was a senior research associate at Columbia's East Asian Institute from 1967 until 1991, after heading Haverford -- in Haverford, Pa. -- from 1957 to 1967, when he retired from that post.
        His writings during those last years at Columbia included a second, 1970 edition of his 1955 history of Japan's transformation into a modern, industrialized world power, "Japan's Modern Century."
        Also in 1970, Dr. Borton addressed a gathering of 300 Asia scholars in Washington and contended that the United States intervention in Vietnam resembled Japan's disastrous attempt to achieve a political solution by military means on the Asian mainland before World War II.
        He began his immersion in Japanese history at a seminar in Tokyo in the winter of 1928-29. Years later he wrote, "Having decided to enter a new field of study and set for myself a high standard of intellectual and personal integrity, I was fortunate to have done so when my special knowledge was useful both for the academic world and for our Government in determining its postwar policies toward Japan."
        After studying at the Imperial University in Tokyo from 1931 to 1937, he received a doctorate in Japanese history from the University of Leiden in the Netherlands in 1937. He was on the Columbia faculty from 1937 to 1957, with time out for his State Department duty.
        In the 1950's, he edited a book of essays, "Japan" (1951), which was praised in The New York Times Book Review as "outstanding" and containing "gems of writing." He was a co-author of "The Far East, 1942-46" (1955) and "Japan Between East and West" (1957). In addition, he rose to be a full professor of Japanese and, from 1954 to 1957, the East Asian Institute's director.
        As Haverford's president, he oversaw the raising of tuition, in 1958, to $1,000 from $850. Also, in a 1958 speech to a conference in New York on secondary schools, he warned against overspecialization in science and mathematics there.
        In addition, he spoke out against an antisubversion provision of the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The provision required students seeking loans to dislaim, by affadavit, belief in or support of groups advocating the overthrow of the Government by force. And in 1967 he warned Haverford students that they faced suspension if found illegally using drugs.
        Dr. Borton was born in Moorestown, N.J., graduated from Haverford in 1926 and received an M.A. in history from Columbia in 1932. He was awarded several honorary degrees and was decorated by the postwar Japanese Government.
        He is survived by his wife of 68 years, Elizabeth Wilbur Borton; a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Anne Carter-Borton, both of Conway; a brother, John Carter Borton and a sister, Faith Weston, both of Kennett Square, Pa.; two grandchildren and a great-grandson.
