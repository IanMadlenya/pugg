        John Allen Buggs, an expert in community relations who was the staff director of the United States Civil Rights Commission for much of the 1970's, died on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 79.
        He had Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Buggs retired after suffering a stroke in 1978. In addition to his work on the Civil Rights Commission, he had served as staff director of the Model Cities Administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
        He was the Civil Rights Commission's deputy staff director before he became acting director in 1971, and then permanent director
        In that post he was often outspoken. In 1971 he contended, before a House Judiciary subcommittee, that Federal agencies were ignoring open-housing laws or enforcing them ineffectively. In 1972, writing about New York, he argued that "racial and ethnic data are essential in order to help assess the nature and extent of discrimination in city employment."
        The reports prepared by the commission while he was its director include "A Generation Deprived: Los Angeles School Desegregation" (1977).
        Mr. Buggs was with the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission from 1954 to 1967 and became widely known for his peacemaking after the 1965 riots in the city's Watts section.
        Earlier he was an official with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Marion County, in north-central Florida, and co-chairman of the Florida State Committee on School Integration.
        A doctor's son, he was born in Brunswick, Ga. and earned a B.A. in history at Dillard University in New Orleans and an M.A. in sociology from Fisk University in Nashville.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Mary Gale Buggs, who is known as Polly; two daughters, Zara Taylor and Diane Dix, and two grandsons.
