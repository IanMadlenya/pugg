        J. Ross Gamble, a corporate lawyer and banker who helped found the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation and had a long association with Dartmouth College, died on Monday at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 83.
        Born in Springfield, Mass., Mr. Gamble received his law degree at George Washington University. In the late 1930's he became a partner in the firm Leighton & Gamble, with offices in Washington and New York.
        In 1947, he joined four other entrepreneurs to organize Texas Eastern, where he was a founding director. The company, based in Houston, has grown into a corporate giant that supplies the East Coast with natural gas.
        His link to Dartmouth lasted from 1930 to 1957 when he resigned as director of development and coordinator of all fund-raising efforts. More recently he was affiliated with the Dartmouth National Bank of Hanover and the Hanover Water Company.
        Mr. Gamble is survived by a daughter, Margaret Fairlee Gamble of Philadelphia; a son, J. R. Peter of Lyme Center, N.H.; a sister, Doris Gammon of Bethesda, Md., and two grandsons. His wife of 52 years, Margaret Turner Herring  Gamble, died in 1992.
