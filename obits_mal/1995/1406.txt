        Paul Bancroft Jr., a San Francisco developer who was an early promoter of the Mexican fishing village of Puerto Vallarta as a resort, died on Monday at his home in San Francisco. He was 90.
        A prominent social figure, Mr. Bancroft bought a home in Puerto Vallarta, on Mexico's Pacific coast, and helped make the town into the fashionable international resort it has become in the last 30 years by attracting his friends and many other socialites.
        For the past four decades, Mr. Bancroft was associated with the Bancroft Library at the University of California at Berkeley. He was the only surviving grandson of Hubert Howe Bancroft, a California pioneer and a chronicler of California and Western history. The Berkeley library is the depository of the grandfather's collection and manuscripts.
        Paul Bancroft graduated from Yale University in 1927. He then lived in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., working as the American distributor of Charles Heidsieck champagne. After World War II, he returned to San Francisco and was active in real-estate development until recently.
        Mr. Bancroft is survived by his son, Paul 3d, of Queenstown, Md.; a stepson, Messmore Kendall Jr. of Palm Beach; two stepdaughters, Florence Fisher of New York City and Sue Wallingford of San Francisco; 14 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  April 5, 1995, Wednesday
        An obituary on March 23 about Paul Bancroft Jr., a San Francisco developer, incorrectly described his relationship to Hubert Howe Bancroft, the California pioneer who was a chronicler of Western history. Paul Bancroft was not the sole surviving grandson of Hubert Bancroft. Another grandson, Griffing Bancroft Jr., lives in Naples, Fla.
