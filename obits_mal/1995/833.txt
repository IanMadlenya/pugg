        Max Fernandez Rojas, one of the wealthiest people in Bolivia, died in a plane crash on Sunday. He was 51.
        Mr. Fernandez and six other people were killed when his private twin-engine plane crashed outside Uyuni, a town about 190 miles south of La Paz, the capital.
        Mr. Fernandez, a popular member of the Civic Solidarity Union, which is part of the governing coalition, was the majority owner of the Bolivian National Brewery. Bolivian National exports beer to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.
        His remains are to be returned to La Paz, where burial is expected on Tuesday. He is survived by seven children from two marriages, both of which ended in divorce.
