        James Robert Laycock, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway historian, died Wednesday morning at his son David's home in Avon, Ind. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Laycock, who failed to attend the 1914 Indianapolis 500 only because he was born on June 3 of that year, a few days too late for it, was present at every one of the Memorial Day races after that until 1994, when illness forced him to stay home.
        Mr. Laycock was brought to his first Indy 500 as an infant by his parents, Clarence Perl Laycock and Emma Catterson Laycock. Of the 79 Indianapolis 500 races to date, Mr. Laycock missed only the first four and the most recent two.
        He was employed full time by the Postal Service from 1936 until retiring in 1969, but his avocation was clearly centered around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. He started as an assistant to Snappy Ford, the speedway press room director, in 1949 and took over the job in 1953 after Ford's death. Until his death, he held a variety of jobs at the track, including scoring races and registering entries. He had also been editor of the Indianapolis 500 record book since 1960 and was a member of the track's Hall of Fame committee.
        Besides his son David, he is survived by two other sons, Robert and Dan. All  the sons live in the Indianapolis area.
