        James F. Greene Sr., a Deputy Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the 1970's, died on Sunday at the Vantage House Retirement Center in Columbia, Md. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Greene began his career with the immigration service in 1941 as an agent at a border horse-patrol station at Amado, Ariz. He rose to an administrative rank in which he oversaw the service as it expanded into new areas of responsibility with the influx of refugees fleeing Southeast Asia and the havoc spread by the drug trade.
        Before he became an associate commissioner in 1968, he was in charge of the border patrol enforcement division that watched over immigration from Canada and Mexico. He was instrumental in stepping up security patrols as well as streamlining the processing for those people entering the country legally.
        He also helped develop anti-smuggling programs during the 1960's and 1970's. He retired in 1977 but was called back to the service in 1981 to be on a panel investigating the refugee camps in Southeast Asia, where thousands waited for legal entry into the United States.
        Mr. Greene, who was born in Springfield, Ill., served in the Navy from 1933 to 1939. In early assignments with the immigration service, he worked in upstate New York and Minnesota before moving to Washington in the early 1950's. On retirement, he moved from College Park, Md., to Palm Coast, Fla., but he returned to the Washington area in 1990 and lived in Columbia.
        Mr. Greene is survived by his wife of 57 years, Margaret Mary; three sons, James F. Jr., of Lima, Peru, Stephen H., of Annapolis, Md., and Thomas G., of Silver Spring, Md.; a sister, Georganne Tiemann of Troy, Ill., and six grandchildren.
