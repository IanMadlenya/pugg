        H. L. Stevenson, a former editor in chief of United Press International who presided over the news service's coverage during the era of the Vietnam War and Watergate, died on Thursday. He was 65 and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        Mr. Stevenson had been in poor health since suffering a heart attack in November, a family friend told U.P.I. He died at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Stamford, Conn.
        Mr. Stevenson spent 31 years working for U.P.I., becoming managing editor in 1965 and editor in chief and vice president in 1972. He oversaw coverage of the Apollo moon landings, the Middle East and the energy crisis.
        In 1972 and 1978, Mr. Stevenson and other U.P.I. executives visited China to press for the reopening of Western news bureaus there. He wrote widely published accounts of Chinese life under Communism and wrote articles on life in Cuba under Fidel Castro after similar visits there during the early 1980's.
        Mr. Stevenson was a trustee of the William Allen White Foundation, which supports activities of the school of journalism at the University of Kansas, and a Pulitzer Prize juror. For more than 10 years, he wrote the U.P.I. Reporter, a weekly newsletter.
        In 1983, Mr. Stevenson was promoted to executive vice president. In 1984, he left the company and later became corporate editor of Crain Communications for six years.
        Born Nov. 23, 1929, in New Orleans, Hubert L. Stevenson grew up in Picayune, Miss., where his first job in journalism was with the Picayune Item. He was an infantry platoon sergeant from 1950 to 1952, and in 1953, he joined United Press as a reporter in Jackson, Miss. In 1963, he became Southern Division news manager, responsible for much of the coverage of the civil rights movement.
        Mr. Stevenson is survived by his wife, the former LaVerne Harris, and a daughter, Jennifer, a reporter for The St. Petersburg Times in Florida.
