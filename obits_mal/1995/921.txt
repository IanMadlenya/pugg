        Martin Kleiman, a founder and benefactor of the Diabetes Research Institute,  died on Tuesday at his home in Miami. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said the institute, which is affiliated with the University of Miami School of Medicine.
        Mr. Kleiman was among a group of parents of diabetics who banded together seeking relief from that complex disease. They discovered a small, promising program at the Miami medical school and in 1971 established the institute to bolster it with the help of national and international experts in the field.
        Mr. Kleiman, a Florida paint and plastics manufacturer, also was a founder and past president and board chairman of the Diabetes Institute Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization created to support the institute's efforts  in research, education and patient care. In addition, he was a founding board member and national fund-raising chairman of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation in New York, which began in 1970.
        Mr. Kleiman is survived by his wife, Marge; two sons, Gary, of Miami, and Glenn, of Milwaukee; two sisters, Norma Hackmeyer and Lydia Kleiman, both of New York, and four grandchildren.
