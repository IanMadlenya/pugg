        Dr. David Schwimmer, a longtime Manhattan internist who was active in research in the 1940's and 50's about survival rations for military personnel, died yesterday at his home in Teaneck, N.J. He was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter Georgia.
        Dr. Schwimmer practiced on the Upper East Side of Manhattan from 1944 until he retired in 1993. Over the years, he was a part-time professor at New York Medical College, was affiliated with a half-dozen New York hospitals and, in 1970 and 1971, headed Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital's medical board. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine and a fellow of the American College of Physicians.
        In 1947, a report by Dr. Schwimmer was made public that disclosed that after more than three years of research, members of New York Medical College's Metropolitan Research Unit had perfected a low-calorie survival diet that might have broad value in the event of an atomic war.
        The research was carried out on Welfare Island with Army personnel and conscientious objectors as subjects. Dr. Schwimmer said he and his associates had found that the subjects could get along on a daily diet of 900 calories in the form of small biscuits.
        Born in Hungary, Dr. Schwimmer came to the United States as a boy. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Lafayette College, a medical degree from New York University in 1939 and a master's degree in medical science from New York Medical College.
        In addition to his daughter Georgia, of Albany, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Gertrude; another daughter, Shoshanna, of Renick, W. Va.; a son, Mark, of Washington; a sister, Marion Klein of Oradell, N.J.; a brother, Dr. Morton Schwimmer of Manhattan, and a grandson.
