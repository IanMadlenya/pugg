        Paul A. Wolkin, a national figure in continuing education for the legal profession, died on Thursday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 78.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his wife, Diana Burgwyn.
        Mr. Wolkin retired in 1992 as executive vice president of the American Law Institute. He was also executive vice president of the Committee on Continuing Professional Education, operated jointly by the institute and the American Bar Association.
        He took charge of the committee in 1963 and expanded it into a comprehensive  national program of seminars, books, periodicals and instructional tapes.
        Mr. Wolkin, born in Philadelphia, earned three degrees at the University of Pennsylvania: a B.A. in 1937, an M.A. in psychology in 1938 and a J.D. in 1941.  He joined the staff of the American Law Institute in 1947 and, for 15 years beginning in 1951, also practiced with the firm of Wolkin, Sarner & Cooper. He was a founder of a periodical, The Practical Lawyer, which offered concise articles of advice on how to improve the services of a law practice.
        Mr. Wolkin's first wife, Martha Kessler Wolkin, to whom he was married for 48 years, died in 1992. He and Ms. Burgwyn married last year. Also surviving are a  daughter, Rachel Sesser of Montclair, N.J.; a son, Dr. Adam Wolkin of Livingston, N.J., and five grandchildren.
