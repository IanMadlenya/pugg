        George Kirby, a resilient comedian and singer known for his impersonations, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 71.
        He had Parkinson's disease, said a longtime friend, the dancer Norma Miller,  The Associated Press reported. "He was telling jokes to the end," she said.
        Mr. Kirby used to say genially that he was "the first black stand-up comedian -- before me, they were buck and wing." His last public appearance was  in May, when show-business friends staged a benefit evening to help pay his medical bills.
        By 1977, he had worked up 100 impersonations, ranging from Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney to dialect characters and singers like Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughan.
        In 1982, Mr. Kirby appeared before a packed, cheering house at the Manhattan  nightspot Dangerfield's and sang these words softly:
        Yes, I'm back again.
        On the road again.
        I've paid some heavy dues, my friend.
        I ain't doing nothing wrong again.
        For three and a half years before that night, he had been in Federal prison in California, convicted of selling cocaine and heroin to a Government undercover agent in Las Vegas.
        He was released on parole and resumed his career. Later he said the crowds at his shows made it seem "like I was never away."
        Mr. Kirby was born in Chicago and went on to appear with Miss Miller in Las Vegas in 1952 in the Count Basie show. Later, he appeared solo in Las Vegas and  was on television frequently.
        He is survived by his wife of 34 years, Rosemary.
