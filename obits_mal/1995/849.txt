        Hermann Langbein, who saw the horrors of Auschwitz from inside a camp doctor's office and later lectured and wrote about it, died Oct. 25 in Vienna. He was 83.
        A native of Vienna, Mr. Langbein started out as an actor, then became politically involved in efforts to stem rising Austrian fascism.
        Mr. Langbein volunteered in 1937 for the International Brigades, which fought in the Spanish Civil War against Franco's troops. After the defeat of the Spanish Republic, he and his comrades were interned in France; after the French surrender to Germany in 1940, the Nazis sent him to the concentration camps.
        During his time in Dachau, Auschwitz and finally Neuengamme, he helped organize prisoners in resistance groups. Designated an "Aryan political" in Auschwitz, he was assigned as a clerk for the camp's SS doctor, Eduard Wirths.
        In that relatively privileged position, he did what he could to relieve some  of the suffering around him. "I can honestly say that I exploited Dr. Wirths," he said this year in an interview with the Austria Press Agency on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.
        He is listed in the Yad Vashem memorial in Israel as one of the "righteous among the nations."
        After the war, Mr. Langbein turned to writing. He made his camp experiences the subject of several books, including "The Auschwitz Trial in Frankfurt" and "Not Like Sheep to Slaughter." One book, "Against All Hope: Resistance in the Nazi Concentration Camps, 1938-1945," was published in New York by Paragon House in 1993.
