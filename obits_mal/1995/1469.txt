        Ira C. Herbert, a retired executive vice president of the Coca-Cola Company, died at his home in Atlanta on Saturday. He was 67.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola.
        Mr. Herbert, who worked at Coca-Cola in Atlanta for 27 years in various capacities, was named an executive vice president of the company in 1976, a title he held until he retired in 1991. In 1988, he was named president of the company's North American soft drink business sector and president of Coca-Cola U.S.A. He was also elected chairman of the board of Coca-Cola Beverages Ltd., a Canadian subsidiary, in 1991, a position he held after retirement.
        Mr. Herbert, who joined Coca-Cola in 1965 as a brand manager for Fanta products, was named marketing director in 1971, president of Coca-Cola Foods in 1975, chief marketing officer in 1982 and deputy to the president of the Coca-Cola Company in 1986. He was involved in developing several marketing campaigns, including "Coke: It's the Real Thing" and the "I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing" broadcast commercials.
        Before joining Coca-Cola, Mr. Herbert, a Chicago native, worked at MacFarland Aveyard & Company and Edward H. Weiss & Company, advertising firms in Chicago.
        Mr. Herbert is survived by his wife, Lila; a daughter, Carrie Beskin, and a son, Fredric, all of Atlanta; a son, Jeffrey, of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.
