        Ralph Pomerance, whose architectural firm, Pomerance & Breines, designed more than 400 buildings, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Pomerance was a graduate of the Carnegie Institute of Technology. He opened his own office in 1933 and two years later became a partner with Simon Breines in an architectural practice that continued until both men retired in 1993.
        The firm designed a number of homes notable for their flat roofs, large plate-glass windows and open floor plans, a heralded example being the house Mr. Pomerance designed for his family in Cos Cob, Conn. One early project, the Swedish Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, was designed in collaboration with the Swedish architect Sven Markelius and earned Mr. Pomerance a decoration from the Swedish Government.
        Mr. Pomerance was a former chairman of the Housing Authority in Greenwich, Conn., and was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn; a daughter, Pamela Steiner of Cambridge, Mass.; two sons, Stephen, of Boulder, Colo., and Rafe, of Washington; a stepson, Paul Selver of Mountain Lakes, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Elsbeth Haladay of Baltimore; four grandchildren, and six stepgrandchildren.
