        Ralph Kirstein Heyman, a former president and chief executive of the Consolidated Cork Corporation, a manufacturer of bottle caps and can-manufacturing equipment, died on Monday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 86.
        The cause of death was a stroke, said his daughter, Jeanne H. Keller, of Rye Brook, N.Y.
        Consolidated Cork, based in Piscataway, N.J., was one of the three largest manufacturers of caps and can-making equipment for the beverage industry. Its customers included Budweiser, Pepsi and Coca-Cola.  Mr. Heyman joined Consolidated Cork as secretary in 1941 and served as a vice president before becoming president and chief executive in 1964. He was appointed chairman in 1970. Consolidated Cork was bought in 1971 by the National Can Corporation.
        Mr. Heyman left the company in 1972 and worked for Frank C. Brown & Company, a New York management consulting firm, as an associate consultant. In 1975, Mr. Heyman started his own business as a management consultant to companies involved in mergers and acquisitions. He retired in 1994.
        Mr. Heyman started as a construction worker at the Gresham Construction Company in New York in 1929, after he graduated from Cornell University. In 1932, he joined the sales department at the Consolidated Lithographing Company, where he was appointed vice president in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, of Scarsdale; his daughter, Jeanne, and two grandchildren.
