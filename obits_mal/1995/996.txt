        Joey Fariello, a New York boxing trainer who handled several champions and sent Buster Mathis Jr. into the ring against Mike Tyson two weeks ago, died on Wednesday after suffering a stroke on Christmas Eve. He was 58.
        He died in St. John's Hospital in Elmhurst, Queens, near the Maspeth house of an aunt he stayed with during the week. Even though he had a home in Rhinebeck,  N.Y., he lived at his aunt's home to be closer to his base gym, Gleason's in Brooklyn. He was at her house when he collapsed.
        Fariello got his start as a trainer as an assistant to Cus D'Amato, Tyson's  first handler and father figure, and helped in bouts involving the former world  heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson.
        After training Mathis's father two decades ago, he sent in the son against Tyson, the former heavyweight champion. Though Mathis Jr. lost by the expected knockout, he surprised many by lasting three rounds.
        A week before that bout, Fariello helped Tom (Boom Boom) Johnson successfully defend his featherweight title for the eighth time. At the time of his death, Fariello was training Junior Jones, the former junior featherweight champion, for a bout at Madison Square Garden on Jan. 12.
        He is survived by his wife, Theresa, and three children, Jimmy, Frank and Terry.
