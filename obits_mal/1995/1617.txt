        Vladimir E. Maximov, a Russian writer who was a prominent anti-Soviet exile in the 1970's and 80's, died on March 26 in Paris, where he had lived since 1974. He was 64.
        He had cancer, Agence France-Presse reported.
        Commenting on Mr. Maximov's death, the Russian newspaper Pravda said he "cannot be imagined as an outsider to Russia, Russian literature and the Russian people."
        Born in Moscow to parents who fell afoul of the Soviet Government, he was originally named Lev A. Samsonov and began writing under the name Vladimir Maksimov in the early 1950's. He earned international praise for his 1971 novel, "Seven Days of Creation," which criticized Soviet society and was first published in West Germany.
        In the following years, Mr. Maximov, who protested the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, was expelled from the Soviet Union of Writers, committed to psychiatric hospitals and deprived of his Soviet citizenship.
        In exile in Paris, he edited Kontinent, an influential dissident magazine published in Russian containing writings by Eastern bloc authors who were barred from publication in their countries.
        In later years, Mr. Maximov paid visits to his homeland, and his citizenship was restored in 1990.
