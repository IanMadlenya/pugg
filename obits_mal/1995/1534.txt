        Harry Specht, an advocate for strengthening social work's commitment to the poor, died last Sunday at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, Calif., where he lived. He was 65.
        The cause was pneumonia brought on by complications from throat cancer, said a son, Dan Specht.
        Dr. Specht, who was dean of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley, co-wrote a book, "Unfaithful Angels: How Social Work Abandoned Its Mission" (Free Press, 1993), that was critical of a shift in the profession from helping the poor to private counseling of the middle class.
        Born in the Bronx, he received an undergraduate degree from City College in 1951, a master's in social work from Western Reserve University in 1953 and a doctorate in social research from Brandeis University in 1964. He joined the faculty of Berkeley's School of Social Work in 1967 and was appointed dean in 1977.
        Besides his son Dan, of Silver Springs, Md., he is survived by a second son, Eliot, of Knoxville, Tenn.; a brother, Robert, of Port Townsend, Wash.; a sister, Lynn Klein of Queens, and a grandson.
        Correction:  March 26, 1995, Sunday
        An obituary headline last Sunday about Harry Specht, dean of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley, misstated his profession. He was a social worker, not a sociologist.
