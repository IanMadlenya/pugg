        Brajendra Singh, the last Maharajah of Bharatpur, who was a sportsman and conservationist, died on July 8 in the former princely state of Bharatpur, now part of Rajasthan State in northwestern India. He was 76 and lived in his former principality.
        His death was reported on Friday by the British newspaper The Independent.
        The Maharahajah was stripped of his ruling powers after India became independent. But he remained known for epic duck shoots that he presided over, before independence, at the Keolado Ghana marsh in his 2,000-square-mile state 100 miles south of Delhi.
        Accounts vary as to just how many thousands of wildfowl were downed in a good day's sport during that era in Bharatpur. But a New York Times correspondent, who attended a shoot there in 1951, reported that the record was held by a shoot organized for Lord Linlithgow, just before World War II, when 39 guns brought down 4,323 ducks in one day.
        Soon after the abolition of Indian royalty in 1970, running as plain Brajendra Singh, he lost the seat in India's Parliament that he had held for four years. Then he helped convert the marshy duckshoot area into India's best-known bird sanctuary.
        He was crowned Maharajah in 1939 and acquiesced in 1947 to the merger of Bharatpur into India's union of states. He was married twice and had one son and four daughters.
