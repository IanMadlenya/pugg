        David S. Breslow, an industrial chemist whose research advanced the development of plastics, died on May 26 at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del. He was 78 and lived in Wilmington, Del.
        Dr. Breslow began experimenting with polymers, the long-chain molecules that  are the building blocks for thousands of materials, just after World War II. His work helped to develop catalysts that produced the chemical reactions from which polyethylene and polypropylene resulted. The research also focused on how to stabilize the materials so they could be used in the mass production of a vast array of consumer products.
        A native of Queens, he began work at Hercules Inc., the Wilmington chemical company, in 1946 and retired in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann G.; a son, Lee David, of Londonderry, N.H.;  two daughters, Fern Seltzer of Denver, and Gail Breslow of Paris; a sister, Mildred Novick of Delray Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.
