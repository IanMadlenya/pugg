        Moshe Brilliant, a contributing correspondent for The New York Times in Israel for 38 years, died yesterday in Tel-Hashomer Chaim Sheba Hospital in Tel Aviv. He was 79.
        The cause was complications from a series of illnesses, his family said.
        From 1949 until he retired eight years ago, Mr. Brilliant filed secondary articles, and main stories that broke when The Times's staff correspondents were out of the country. He was The Times's only representative in the country in in 1956, when Israeli troops invaded Sinai.
        His sources inside the Government gave The Times the first balanced account of the "Lavon Affair" of the 1950's and 60's, which ultimately brought down the Government of David Ben-Gurion, the country's founding father.
        The case erupted when Pinhas Lavon, then Defense Minister, was accused of giving the go-ahead to an Israeli plot to bomb United States libraries in Cairo and Alexandria and Egyptian theaters that showed British and American films. The motive was to turn Britain and the United States against Egypt.
        Mr. Brilliant was born on April 26, 1915, in West Hoboken, N.J. He moved to what was then Palestine in 1933 and got a job as a messenger for The Palestine Post.
        Sent to the courthouse to pick up documents about a land case, he returned with a summary he had copied by hand. The Post's Tel Aviv bureau chief was so impressed that he called the editor in Jerusalem and suggested making Mr. Brilliant a reporter. In time Mr. Brilliant became The Post's Tel Aviv bureau chief.
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, of Tel Aviv; a son, Joshua, of Rimon, Israel; a daughter, Chedva, of Har Halutz, Israel; a brother, Leslie, of Bayside, Queens; a sister, Rivkah, of Forest Hills, Queens, and six grandchildren.
