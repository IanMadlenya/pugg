        Thomas G. Davis, the former medical director of the SmithKline Beckman Corporation, died on Saturday at his home in Radnor, Pa. He was 67.
        The cause was acute leukemia, said his wife, Nancy.
        In 1977, Dr. Davis was appointed medical director of SmithKline Beckman, a Philadelphia pharmaceutical company. He became head of its department of worldwide medical affairs in January 1989. He retired later that year when the company merged with Beecham Group PLC of Britain to form SmithKline Beecham PLC.
        After leaving SmithKline, he worked as a consultant in the medical industry. In 1993 he became managing director of Quadrant Holdings, a medical company in Cambridge, England. Dr. Davis and his wife lived in Cambridge until January, when they returned to Pennsylvania.
        In 1986, during Dr. Davis's tenure at SmithKline, annual sales of the ulcer treatment medication Tagamet topped $1 billion for the first time.
        Dr. Davis received his medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1956.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Davis is survived by two daughters, Gwyneth Davis of Albany, Calif., and Lynne Davis Reynolds of Huntsville, Ala.; a son, Thomas Jr., of Santa Cruz, Calif., and two grandchildren.
