        David Wineman, a longtime social work professor who was an expert on disturbed children and advocate of children's rights, died on Wednesday at Grace Hospital in Detroit. He was 79 and lived in Southfield, Mich.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his brother, Saul.
        Mr. Wineman retired in 1984 after teaching for 33 years at Wayne State University's School of Social Work, in Detroit. At the time of his death, Mr. Wineman had spent a decade specializing in issues involving children's rights as a full-time volunteer for the Michigan chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
        He was the co-author, with Fritz Redl, of two books regarded as seminal works and still in print after four decades. They are "Children Who Hate: The Disorganization and Breakdown of Behavior Controls" (1951, Free Press) and "Controls From Within: Techniques for the Treatment of the Aggressive Child" (1952, Free Press).
        For several years, beginning in 1946, Mr. Wineman was the director of Pioneer House, a home for severely disturbed boys in Detroit. From 1950 to 1968, he was the clinical director of a University of Michigan summer program for disturbed children.
        Mr. Wineman worked against corporal punishment of children, arbitrary suspensions and expulsions from school, and the inadequacies he saw in the foster care and adoption systems. He put forth his views in testimony before legislatures and school boards and in many of his writings.
        He was born and reared in Detroit and received a bachelor of science degree in 1937 from what is now Wayne State and a master's degree in social work from the University of Michigan.
        His wife, Geraldine, died in May. Besides his brother, Saul of Farmington Hills, Mich., he is survived by two sons, Steven Wineman of Cambridge, Mass. and Jim Thompson of Southfield, and a grandson.
