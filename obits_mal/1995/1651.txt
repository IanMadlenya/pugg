        Ralph Levitz, former chairman of the Levitz Furniture Corporation, died on Saturday at his vacation home in La Costa, Calif. He was 82 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
        He suffered a long illness due to a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Levitz, who was born in 1912 in Lebanon, Pa., worked in his father's furniture business when he was young. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from the Wharton School of Business in 1933. He and his brother Leon owned a small store in Pottstown, Pa., before starting the Levitz furniture company in 1963 in Allentown, Pa.
        The company, which now has its headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., went public in 1968. There were more than 80 stores nationwide at the time Mr. Levitz retired in 1983. He and other members of the Levitz family divested themselves of all their stock by 1985.
        Mr. Levitz gave more than $3.5 million to various charities, including the Red Cross, the United Jewish Appeal, hospitals and cultural institutions.
        He was married six times.
        Besides Philip, Mr. Levitz is survived by his wife, Mary Jacqueline Levitz, and two grandchildren.
