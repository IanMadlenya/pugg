        Eugene J. Webb, a Stanford University professor who studied organizational behavior, or how businesses work and how people work in organizations, died on March 14 at Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 61 and lived in Palo Alto.
        The cause was respiratory disease, the family said.
        During his more than 25 years at the university's Business School, he studied organizations and the nature of the relationships among employees as well as the nature of competition among corporations. He played an early role in bringing the methods of behavioral psychology into the curriculum of business schools.
        He was one of four authors of the book "Unobtrusive Measures: Nonreactive Research in the Social Sciences" (Rand McNally 1966), which emphasized the need for practical, if unconventional, approaches in research, for example tracking the popularity of museum exhibits by measuring the wear and tear on the floor in front of displays.
        Born in Albany, he received an undergraduate degree from the State University of New York in Albany in 1954 and a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Chicago in 1956.
        He began teaching at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 1960 and joined Stanford in 1968.
        Dr. Webb is survived by his wife, Mimi; a daughter, Alison Webb Desmarais of Barrington, N.H.; two sons, Leigh Geoffrey, and Gregory Paul, both of Washington, and his mother, Alice Webb Connors of Albany.
