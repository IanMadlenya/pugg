        Lee Cass, a bass-baritone who taught voice at Carnegie Mellon University, died on Sunday at Shady Side Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 70 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Barbara.
        Mr. Cass was born in Brooklyn. He studied voice with Mack Harrell at the Juilliard School and earned a doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh.
        When NBC experimented with televised opera in the early 1950's, Mr. Cass was a regular in its casts. He sang at the New York City Opera, the Cleveland Opera, the Civic Light Opera of Pittsburgh and the Santa Fe Opera Festival.
        Mr. Cass also appeared in several Broadway productions, including the original "Most Happy Fella," "Green Willow" and "All in Love."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Gertrude Edzant of Brooklyn.
