        Dan Friedman, a graphic designer, author and teacher, died on Thursday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his brother, Kenneth Friedman.
        "Dan was one of the people who created what is known as the new typography in the United States, which he helped reinvent by mixing typefaces, setting type at angles and using asymmetry in his design," said Ellen Lupton, curator of contemporary design at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design in Manhattan.
        In the 1980's, Mr. Friedman started designing Day-Glo colored art furniture, much of it made from found objects.
        Mr. Friedman taught graphic design at Yale University, at the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., and at Cooper Union.
        He was born in Cleveland and graduated from what is now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
        He is survived by his brother, of Mill Valley, Calif.
