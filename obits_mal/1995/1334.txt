        George Kalafatis, a lawyer and sports agent who negotiated multimillion-dollar contracts in baseball, football and basketball, died on Saturday at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He was 50.
        His family said the cause was either a heart attack or a stroke.
        Mr. Kalafatis, whose clients included Mike Hargrove, manager of the Cleveland Indians, and Jim Rice, the former Boston Red Sox star, grew up in New York City and was a former baseball player himself, at Jamaica High School in Queens and Long Island University in Brooklyn. He set the season batting mark of .533 at L.I.U. in 1963 and later played in the Detroit and Montreal farm systems.
        Mr. Kalafatis served as an agent with the International Management Group in Cleveland until opening his own company, Omni Sports Management, about 10 years ago.
        He is survived by his parents, Orestis and Mary; a sister, Elli; his wife, Frances; a daughter, Lara, and a son, Christopher.
