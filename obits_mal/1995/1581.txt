        Alexander Knox, an actor and playwright who won an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Woodrow Wilson in the 1944 film "Wilson," died on Tuesday at the Berwick-Upon-Tweed Infirmary in Northumberland, England. He was 88 and had homes in London and Berwick-Upon-Tweed.
        The cause was bone cancer, said his wife, Doris.
        Mr. Knox was born in Strathroy, Ontario, and graduated from the University of Western Ontario, where he received a degree in English literature.
        After making his stage debut in 1929 in Boston, he went to England, where he acted on the stage and made two films, "The Gaunt Stranger" and "The Four Feathers." At the outbreak of World War II, he returned to the United States and appeared on the Broadway stage as Friar Laurence in the Laurence Olivier production of "Romeo and Juliet" (1940) and as Tuzenbach in the Katharine Cornell production of "The Three Sisters," in 1942. He also appeared on Broadway in "Jupiter Laughs" (1940), "Jason" (1942) and "The Closing Door" (1949), which he wrote.
        In the early 1940's, Mr. Knox embarked on a long film career as a character actor, initially in Hollwood and later in England. In addition to "Wilson," his film credits include "The Sea Wolf" (1941), "None Shall Escape" (1944), "The Divided Heart" (1954), "The Night My Number Came Up" (1955), "The Longest Day" (1962), "Khartoum" (1966) and "Nicholas and Alexandra" (1971).
        He was also a sometime screenwriter, and helped to write the scripts for "Sister Kenny" (1946), "Sign of the Ram" (1948) and "The Judge Steps Out" (1949).
        He also wrote the plays "Old Master" and "Trafalgar Square," along with several novels, including "Bride of Quietness" (1933) and "Night of the White Bear" (1971).
        In 1980, he appeared in the television film "Cry of the Innocent."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a grandson, Oliver, of the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel.
