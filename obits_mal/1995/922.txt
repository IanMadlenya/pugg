        Robert A. Jones, dean of libraries at Seton Hall University in South Orange,  N.J., died on Tuesday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 57 and lived in High Bridge, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said Elinor G. Walker of the Seton Hall office of public relations.
        Dr. Jones played a major role in fund raising for the construction of the university's Walsh Library, which opened in September 1994, and in other aspects of that project.
        After being the library director at Bradley University in Illinois and at the College of Wooster in Ohio, Dr. Jones moved to Seton Hall in 1987. He was for a  time the president of the Council of New Jersey College and University Libaries.
        He was born in Strasburg, Ohio, and received a bachelor's degree from the College of Wooster, an M.S. in library science from the University of Illinois and an M.A. and a Ph.D. in American studies from Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Christine Coolidge; three daughters, Elizabeth Ullrich of Nashua, N.H., Margaret McClure of Wooster, Ohio, and Ellen  Whitt of Indianapolis; three grandchildren, and two brothers, Thomas, of Chicago, and Donald, of Columbia, Ill.
