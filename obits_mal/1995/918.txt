        Henry Hoffman, a former editor at WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times, died on Wednesday at Saddle Back Memorial Hospital in Laguna Hills, Calif. He was 87.
        Mr. Hoffman, who was born near Minsk in Russia and was brought to New York as an infant, worked as a teletype operator for Western Union before he joined The  Times in 1941, initially to take telephone dictation from reporters calling in their articles.
        After serving in the Navy during World War II, he returned to The Times, where he worked briefly in the paper's office at the United Nations before becoming a news script writer, preparing news broadcasts for WQXR. At his retirement in 1973 he was the broadcast news operation's assistant editor.
        Mr. Hoffman, whose wife, Martha, died in 1991, is survived by a brother, Fred, of West Los Angeles, Calif.
