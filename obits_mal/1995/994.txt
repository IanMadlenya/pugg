Before moving to New Jersey, he worked for 10 years at Harvard as assistant to the dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, director of the Office of Tests, associate director of the College Entrance Examination Board and a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education.
        He wrote numerous articles on testing, measurement and college admissions. After retiring from the testing group, he served for several years as a consultant for the Ford Foundation and the National Institute of Education.
