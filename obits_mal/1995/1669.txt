        Ted Estabrook, a producer and director whose technical innovations helped shape early television, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.
        The cause was leukemia, said his daughter Dr. Alison Estabrook of Englewood, N.J.
        He was a pioneer in integrating filmed news footage into live broadcasts, and he helped develop a technique in which still pictures were superimposed on live footage.
        In Baltimore in 1948, he directed coverage of the Democratic National Convention that nominated Harry S. Truman.
        Three years later, as director of WPIX-TV in New York City, he added to the medium's early history by directing broadcasts of the Kefauver hearings on organized crime, feeding the station's coverage to networks for national showing. When a reputed mobster, Frank Costello, objected to the camera showing his face, Mr. Estabrook focused on the mobster's hands, nervously twisting as he testified. The coverage led to national citations.
        He also directed "Chronoscope," an interview program whose format, with a moderator and news panelists asking a guest questions, was widely copied by the networks.
        In the mid-1960's, after a scuba diving accident, he set up a studio to teach television production.
        Mr. Estabrook is survived by two other daughters, Polly, of Los Angeles, and Elizabeth, of Brooklyn; a sister, Dolly Hasrick of Clinton, Wash., and three grandchildren.
