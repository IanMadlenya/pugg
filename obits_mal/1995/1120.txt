        Edwin Michael Slote, a lawyer who specialized in bankruptcy and corporate reorganization, died on Jan. 14 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 89.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Starting in the 1930's, Mr. Slote was involved in the reorganization of railroads and other corporations by the Federal Courts. They included the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Erie Railroad of Cleveland, the Pierce Arrow Motor Company, the Third Avenue Transit Transit Company and the Childs Company, the restaurant chain.
        Mr. Slote, who also had a residence in Pound Ridge, N.Y., was active in volunteer work. In 1968, he assisted the Library of Congress in creating a program that makes audio tapes, including many concerning cases before the Supreme Court, available to blind lawyers.
        He was born on the Lower East Side, and was a graduate of Columbia University and New York University Law School. He received his law degree in 1925.
        Mr. Slote is survived by his wife of 53 years, Tisha Kunst Slote; a daughter, Wendy Kleinbaum of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  January 28, 1995, Saturday
