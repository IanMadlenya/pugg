        Morris S. Schwartz, a retired professor of sociology at Brandeis University,  died on Saturday at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 78.
        The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, The Boston Globe reported.
        Late in his life, Dr. Schwartz was interviewed three times on the ABC program "Nightline" and reflected on life with a terminal illness.
        He used to say, "Learning to die is also learning how to live."
        Dr. Schwartz was born in Chicago, received his doctorate from the University  of Chicago and taught at Brandeis, which is in Waltham, Mass., from 1959 to 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Green; two sons, Jonathan, of Brighton, Mass., and Robert, of Tokyo, and a brother, David, of Berkeley Springs, W.Va.
