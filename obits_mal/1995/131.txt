        Julian Hill Whittlesey, an architect who was concerned with large-scale housing projects and city planning for three decades and then went on to work as an archeologist in the 1960's, died on Saturday at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 89.
        First drawn to problems of providing housing to the expanding populations of big cities, he became a consultant to the Resettlement Administration in the 1930's and later the United States Public Housing Administration. With the outbreak of World War II, he designed housing and administrative space for the military.
        Mayer & Whittlesey, the firm he co-founded in 1935 with Albert Mayer, would become known for large apartment buildings. One of the most prominent was Manhattan House, the glazed white-brick building between Second and Third Avenues and 65th and 66th Streets.
        The firm was also involved in the planning of the new cities of Kitimat, British Columbia, and Chandigarh, India. In the 1950's, with the establishment of Whittlesey, Conklin & Rossant, the firm that would become Whittlesey, Conklin & Echeverria, Mr. Whittlesey became involved in the development of the planned community of Reston, Va., outside Washingon.
        He was born in Greenwich, Conn., and received degrees in civil engineering and architecture from Yale in 1927 and 1930, respectively. Before beginning his architecture career, he received a fellowship to the American School of Classical Studies as an architectural surveyor in Athens.
        In 1960 he returned to the school for a summer archeological project. For the next 17 years, he worked on such projects in Mediterranean countries, helping to introduce new methods in underwater photography and extending the use of photographs to make reliable measurements.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eunice Stoddard Smith, and a daughter, Peregrine Whittlesey Freund of Manhattan and Wilton.
