        John H. Eisele, who had a 45-year career as a builder in and around New York  City, died on Tuesday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 104.
        Mr. Eisele went into the building trade in 1905 at 14 as a clerk for the construction of the New York Public Library. He completed his education at night school and graduated from the Columbia University School of Engineering, where he later taught.
        He built airfields as a lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in World War I, then founded the John H. Eisele Construction Company in 1922. The company took part in projects like the Bulova Center off Grand Central Parkway, buildings at  La Guardia Airport, the New York World's Fair of 1939 and New York University, as well as hundreds of schools, churches, libraries and factories in the metropolitan area.
        The company merged in 1958 with the Conforti Construction Corporation, a Manhattan-based international real-estate and construction company, of which he  became a partner.
        Mr. Eisele is survived by his wife of 68 years, Mary Loretto Smith Eisele; two daughters, Bette Cassidy of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Rosemary Filippo of  Jupiter, Fla.; three sons, Dr. John H., of Davis, Calif., Paul M., of San Francisco and Dr. Frederick R., of State College, Pa., 20 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.
