        Rajan Pillai, one of Asia's most flamboyant businessmen, died on Friday. He was 47 years old.
        The cause of death was complications from cirrhosis of the liver, said a doctor who had been treating him for the last two years.
        At the peak of his powers, Mr. Pillai ran Britannia Biscuits, a large maker of cookies, but lately he had been a fugitive from Singapore. He had been indicted there, accused of fraud amounting to millions of dollars.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Pillai was a prisoner in India, awaiting an extradition hearing.
        Mr. Pillai was born in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, the son of a cashew exporter. He was active in the hotel and food industries, and his career soared when he was allied with F. Ross Johnson, the American executive who became head of RJR Nabisco Inc.
        But in 1993, the Singapore Government charged Mr. Pillai with defrauding the country of $17.2 million.  And as a court prepared to pronounce a 14-year prison term on him, Mr. Pillai fled to India.
        Last Tuesday, Indian police seized him from a New Delhi hotel and took him to Tihar Jail. On Thursday, a magistrate rejected Mr. Pillai's appeal for medical treatment, saying he was trying to seek "asylum" at the hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, Nina, and two young sons.
