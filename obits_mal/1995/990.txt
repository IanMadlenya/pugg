        Lynden G. Newland, a journalist who helped found Jamaica's main opposition party and went on to become Labor Minister and Mayor of Kingston, died on Tuesday. He was 81.
        The cause was pneumonia, family friends said.
        The journalist and labor leader helped found the Jamaica Labor Party in 1943 as a rival to the People's National Party, founded five years earlier. Since then, those two parties have dominated Jamaican politics.
        Mr. Newland served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1944 to 1949 and as Mayor of the capital from 1948 to 1949. As Minister of Labor and Social Security in 1964 he created the national insurance plan.
        Prime Minister P. J. Patterson paid him tribute as a defender of the working  people and a "seminal figure" who contributed to the building of modern Jamaica.
