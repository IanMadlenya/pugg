        John Colman, a piano accompanist for many major ballet and modern dance choreographers, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, said his nephew Jonathan Snaith.
        Mr. Colman was born in Duluth, Minn. He began training in music in New York City as a teen-ager, studying with Paul Boepple of the New York School of Dalcroze Eurythmics. Through the school, he found work as an accompanist in the studios of Charles Weidman, Doris Humphrey and Eleanor King.
        He later studied with Ernst Levy at the Dalcroze school in Paris, where he met Kurt Jooss. He subsequently worked with Jooss and his company in Devonshire, England.
        Other choreographers he played for over the years, as he developed a reputation as a master musical improviser, included George Balanchine, Paul Draper, Agnes de Mille and Hanya Holm.
        Mr. Colman began composing for dance while working with Jooss, and subsequently studied composition with Paul Hindemith in Berlin. At the time of his death, he was completing an English translation of Hindemith's "Craft of Musical Composition."
        Mr. Colman was assistant conductor and pianist for the Dessoff Choirs and musical director of the Theater Dance Company, for which he composed the score for King's "Ode to Liberty." In the 1940's, he played for classes at the School of American Ballet, where he also taught rhythmic analysis.
        In addition to Mr. Snaith, Mr. Colman is survived by three other nephews and a niece.
