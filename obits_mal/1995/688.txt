        Thomas Newbold Morgan, a founder of the Clarion Music Society and a major benefactor of other musical organizations in New York City, died on Oct. 20 at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 67.
        The cause was a heart attack, friends said.
        As a descendant of some of New York's oldest and most provident families, whose fortune dated from merchant sailing days, Mr. Morgan had neither the need  nor the inclination to earn a living. Instead, he devoted his life to three main interests: music, food and conversation.
        A native of New York City who spent boyhood summers at Belleville, his family's vast Hudson River estate, Mr. Morgan operated what amounted to a rarefied musical salon at his East 93d Street town house.
        Although he was best known for his support of Clarion and its musical director, Newell Jenkins, whose concerts are devoted to often obscure Baroque composers, Mr. Morgan also supported the Jupiter Symphony, Noah Greenberg's Pro  Musica, the Harlem School of the Arts, the New York Philharmonic and other cultural groups as well as individual performers and composers.
        He is survived by a brother, Gerald, of Richmond, Va.
