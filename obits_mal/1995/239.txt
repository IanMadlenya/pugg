        G. J. Tankersley, who was chairman and chief executive of the Consolidated Natural Gas Company from 1979 to 1987 and who led the company into energy exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico, died on Sunday. He was 74.
        He died at his home in Stahlstown, Pa., from complications related to a degenerative muscle disease, said Cynthia Navadeh, a company spokeswoman.
        When Mr. Tankersley took over Consolidated, which is based in Pittsburgh, it was mostly an interstate pipeline company and a distributor of natural gas. He led the company into the risky business of exploring for gas and oil in the Gulf of Mexico, a venture that eventually turned the company into a significant producer.
        Consolidated has since built up its position in the gulf, making heavy investments in deep-water exploration. One of its deep-water ventures has led to a major addition to its oil and gas reserves.
        Outside the energy business, Mr. Tankersley served as chairman of the Pittsburgh branch of the Federal Reserve Bank and as vice chairman of the board of the University of Pittsburgh. He also served two terms as president of the Pittsburgh Symphony Society.
        He graduated from Auburn University in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering. He began his career in the gas industry in 1949. He joined Consolidated in 1966 as president of the East Ohio Gas Company, a subsidiary, in Cleveland. He became the subsidiary's chairman in 1973.
        He served as the first chairman of the National Alliance of Businessmen in Cleveland, working to promote the hiring of members of minorities.
        He and his wife, the former Mary Armstrong, who died in 1993, created an endowment for the International Aquaculture Network at Auburn, which seeks to ease world hunger by improving fish farming.
        Mr. Tankersley is survived by a daughter, Betty Carol Tankersley of Cleveland; a son, George Jackson Jr., of Denver, and four grandchildren.
