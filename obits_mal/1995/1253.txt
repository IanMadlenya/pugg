        Philip Jerome Rudd, a leading real estate developer for many years on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, died on Feb. 11 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Rudd, who was born in Buffalo and raised in Brooklyn, began his real estate career after a business that he owned in the early 1950's was forced from its quarters. The landlord had tripled the rent.
        In seeking another space, Mr. Rudd bought a building and then began to buy and sell other properties. With his longtime partner, Francis J. Greenberger, Mr. Rudd formed Time Equities Inc. and bought more than 50 buildings in New York, many of them on Amsterdam Avenue.
        One of the company's largest developments was Clinton Hill Apartments, a large complex in Brooklyn that the company converted to a cooperative in 1984.
        Mr. Rudd was an advocate of freeing New York properties from commercial and residential rent control laws and often traveled to Albany and Washington to speak on behalf of landlord trade groups. He served as chairman of the Associated Builders and Owners of New York and as chairman of the West Side Chamber of Commerce.
        Mr. Rudd is survived by his wife, Barbara; three sons, Mark, Frederick and Richard, all of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.
