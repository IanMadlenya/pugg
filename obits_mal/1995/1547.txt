        E. Russell Sprague, a former chairman and chief executive of Tambrands Inc., which is based in White Plains, died on Thursday in Palmer, Mass. He was 79 and lived in Palm City, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, the family said.
        Mr. Sprague joined the company, which makes Tampax tampons, as an engineer in 1939. As president from 1976 to 1981 and chairman from 1981 to 1987, he sponsored research at Harvard University on toxic-shock syndrome, which had been linked to tampons. He retired as a member of the board and honorary chairman in 1993.
        He was a trustee of Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, the American International College in Springfield, Mass., and Wing Memorial Hospital Association in Palmer.
        He is survived by his wife, Karen; a son, Russell; a stepson, Charles Lanzetta; three daughters, Dian S. Reed, Linda S. Kenney and Nancy S. Chouinard; nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
