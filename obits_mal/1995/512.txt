        Marvin Becker, president of the Network Polymers Corporation and an innovator in specialty plastics, died Aug. 9 in Branford, Conn. He was 67.
        The cause was stomach cancer, according to his brother, Gary, an economist at the University of Chicago and a winner of the Nobel Prize.
        Mr. Becker began his career as an engineer for the Monsanto Corporation but moved on to form a number of manufacturing businesses. He held a number of patents for techniques in molding plastics. His latest and largest business, Network Polymers, which was started in 1985 with his partner, Alan Woll, manufactures the tough ABS plastics used in auto parts.
        Mr. Becker was born in Pottsville, Pa., and spent much of his youth in Brooklyn. After Army service in World War II, he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering.
        He is survived by his wife, Jessica Miller Becker, of Branford and three children from a previous marriage: Sally, of Edwards, Colo.; Michael, of Akron, Ohio, and Adam, of Rome.
