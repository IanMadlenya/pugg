        H. G. Peter Wallach, a political scientist specializing in American Constitutional law and contemporary German politics, died on March 13 while riding his bicycle near his home in Berlin, Conn. He was 56.
        The cause of death was a massive heart attack, his family said.
        Professor Wallach was on sabbatical from Central Connecticut State University, where he was a professor of political science. He was working on a book on political leadership.
        He was co-author, with Ronald A. Francisco, of "United Germany: The Past, Politics, Prospects," (Greenwood, 1992) and with George K. Romoser of "West German Politics in the Mid-Eighties: Crisis & Continuity" (Greenwood, 1985). The books, both in print, chronicle political developments in Germany, where Dr. Wallach had been an election observer since 1980.
        Professor Wallach was also a director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union.
        Professor Wallach was born in New York City. He graduated from Kenyon College and received his doctorate in political science from the University of Connecticut. He joined the Central Connecticut faculty in the late 1970's.
        Professor Wallach is survived by his wife, Dr. Martha Kaarsberg Wallach; his mother, Gerda Wallach of Hartford; a brother, Wendell, of Bloomfield, Conn.; a sister, Amei Wallach of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Dr. Tina Kaarsberg of Washington; two stepsons, Raymond Kaarsberg of Clinton, Mass., and Fred Kaarsberg of Queen Charlotte City, B.C., and three grandchildren.
