        Lee Albert Rubel, a mathematician who promoted the use of analog computers, died on March 25 at Covenant Hospital in Urbana, Ill. He was 66 and lived in Urbana.
        The cause was leukemia, said his wife of 40 years, Nina Marcus Rubel.
        Dr. Rubel, who researched a wide variety of subjects in his discipline, had taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign since 1958. Most recently he developed mathematics to improve analog computers, a type of computer in which numerical information is represented in the form of a quantity, usually voltage, that varies continuously.
        "Rubel's theoretical blueprint has been as important a contribution to analog computing as Alan Turing's machine was to digital computing," said Jonathan W. Mills, a computer scientist at Indiana University. Turing, a British mathematical logician who died in 1954, devised a theoretical computer that served as a mathematical model of digital computers.
        Dr. Rubel's interests extended to complex variables, number theory, harmonic and functional analysis, logic and topology, and algebraic differential equations.
        Lee Albert Rubel was born in Manhattan, became a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of City College and received a doctorate at the University of Wisconsin. He became a full professor at Illinois in 1965, but retired from teaching two years ago to pursue his research full time.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Rubel is survived by a son, Mark B., of Champaign; a daughter, Natasha Rubel, of Chicago; and a brother, Arthur J., of Laguna Beach, Calif.
