        Franklin A. Rhodes Jr., the executive director of the Harlem Y.M.C.A. on West 135th Street, died on Thursday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. He was 52 and  lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, a progressive degeneration of the lungs, according to the Y.M.C.A. of Greater New York.
        Mr. Rhodes began his career with the Young Men's Christian Association in Gary, Ind., in 1969. He held executive positions in Washington, Boston and Pittsburgh, focusing on projects that provided job training and work experience.
        He transferred to the Harlem Y.M.C.A., near Lenox Avenue, in 1994 and embarked on a campaign to shore up its finances. His efforts led to the current  renovation of the adjacent Jackie Robinson Youth Center, a sports and recreation center to open in 1996.
        Mr. Rhodes was born in Brownsville, Tenn., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Tennessee State University. He worked as a public school teacher and coach before he joined the staff of the Y.M.C.A. in Gary as a physical education director.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris Hurst Rhodes; his parents, Franklin A. Sr.  and Mary P. Rhodes of Halls, Tenn.; two brothers, Algeleon, of Atlanta, and Jacob, of Rochester, and a sister, Valena Rhodes, also of Atlanta.
