        Ralph A. Weller, a retired executive who led the Otis Elevator Company through a period of robust growth, died on Friday at Manor Care in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was a resident of Manhattan and was 73.
        He had been in failing health since late last year, his family said.
        Mr. Weller became president of Otis, the world's largest maker of elevators and escalators, in 1968 when the company had revenues of $500 million. By 1974, just before the United Technologies Corporation took over Otis, the company reported contracts totaling $1.2 billion.
        Mr. Weller was born in Cleveland and graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Virginia Military Institute in 1942. He joined the Marine Corps that year and served in the Pacific, where his unit received a Presidential Citation for valor on Iwo Jima. After active duty ended, he remained in the reserves, retiring in 1961 as a lieutenant colonel.
        After receiving an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1957, he went to work for Otis, where he rose through a number of executive positions, including vice president in charge of the far western region.
        He was the vice president responsible for engineering, production and purchasing when he was elected president. He became chief executive officer in 1969 and chairman in 1975. He was named a director of United Technologies when it acquired Otis. He continued as chairman of Otis and retired in 1984.
        Mr. Weller is survived by three sons, Michael F., of Green River, Wyo., John A., of Orinda, Calif., and Robert O., of Seattle, and five grandchildren.
