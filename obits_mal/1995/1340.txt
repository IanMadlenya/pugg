        John H. Livingston, a specialist in wills, trusts and estates who was one of the oldest lawyers still practicing in New York, died on Sunday at his home in Oyster Bay Cove, L.I. He was 89.
        The cause of death was heart failure, according to his wife and sole survivor, Elisabeth.
        At his death, Mr. Livingston was a partner and working member of Lott & Livingston, a family firm that has existed since the mid-17th century. Lott & Livingston represented the Reform Protestant Dutch Church, now Flatbush Reformed Church, when it was incorporated in 1654.
        Descended from a distinguished Brooklyn family whose ancestors were among Brooklyn's early Dutch settlers, Mr. Livingston was born in Brooklyn. He attended Prospect Heights School and graduated from Polytechnic Preparatory Country Day School in 1921.
        Mr. Livingston was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree cum laude by Williams College in 1925, and after a year's clerkship in the law office of his father, William, he entered the Law School of Columbia University. He received his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1929 and joined the family firm after he was admitted to the bar in 1930.
        That same year, he married Elisabeth Sloan Pratt, whose uncle, Alfred P. Sloan Jr., was president of General Motors.
        In 1939, the Livingstons moved from Brooklyn to Oyster Bay Cove, where Mr. Livingston served as a village justice for 35 years.
        He was also a member of the board of the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and the board of the Y.M.C.A. of Brooklyn. He was counsel for the Brooklyn Home for Children and on the boards of Brooklyn Hospital and St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. He was also active on the board of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
