        Michael Emery, a journalist and professor who with his father wrote a textbook used in more than 200 colleges, died on Wednesday at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 55.
        The cause was cancer.
        Mr. Emery taught at California State University, Northridge, for nearly three decades. With his father, Edwin, he wrote "The Press and America" (Prentice Hall), a widely used textbook now in its eighth printing.
        He was also the author of several other books on journalism.
        Before joining the faculty at Northridge in 1968, Mr. Emery worked for United Press International and reported for Los Angeles radio stations and CBS News.
        He is survived by his wife, Lulu, five children and two sisters.
