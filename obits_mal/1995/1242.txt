        Moorhead C. Kennedy, a banker who served as one of the first presidents of Goodwill Industries of Greater New York, died on Feb. 9 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 93 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said a son, Alexander S. Kennedy of Manhattan.
        Mr. Kennedy began his business career with Drexel & Company and became a partner in the brokerage firm of Montgomery Scott & Company.
        After service in the Navy during World War II, he was elected a vice president of Empire Trust Company, which later merged with The Bank of New York. He retired in 1962.
        He became treasurer of Goodwill Industries, the organization that employs the handicapped, three years after it was established in New York in 1943. He was elected president in 1952 and served for five years.
        In 1954, he also was elected president of the New York City Society for Crippled Children.
        He was a graduate of Princeton University, in 1923, and of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 1925.
        In addition to his son Alexander, he is survived by a second son, Moorhead Kennedy of Manhattan, who was one of the American hostages held at the United States Embassy in Teheran, Iran, for 444 days beginning in 1979, and the hostages' spokesman. He is president of the Moorhead Kennedy Institute, an educational foundation that specializes in cultural diversity and sexual harassment training for schools and corporate executives.
        Mr. Kennedy is also survived by his wife of 65 years, Anna Scott Kennedy; a daughter, Mary Kennedy Adamson of Devon, Pa.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
