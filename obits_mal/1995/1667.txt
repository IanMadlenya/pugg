        Doug Allan, the director of marketing and public relations for the San Francisco Opera and a former marketing executive for the Brooklyn Academy of Music, died on Saturday in a boating accident on Lake Baptiste, near Bancroft, Ontario. He was 49 and lived in San Francisco.
        Mr. Allan joined the San Francisco Opera in 1992 when the marketing and public relations departments were combined. Colleagues said that his programs had helped produce record ticket sales for the company this season.
        Before moving to San Francisco, Mr. Allan was vice president for marketing and promotion at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. His campaigns for the Next Wave Festival, which was two years old when he arrived, helped establish the academy's image as the home of groundbreaking programming. He also oversaw the Next Wave Journal, concert programs and other publications.
        Mr. Allan was born in Welland, Ontario. He received a degree in radio and television arts from the Ryerson Polytechnical Institute in Toronto, and between 1972 and 1985 held public relations and marketing posts with Theater London and the National Ballet of Canada, both in Toronto; the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra.
        He is survived by a sister, Lynn Allan of Peterborough, Ontario, and a brother, William James Allan of Hamilton, Ontario.
