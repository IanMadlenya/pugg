        Stanley A. Cain, a pioneering conservationist who helped develop the science of ecology and served as an assistant secretary of the Interior Department in the 1960's, died yesterday at a nursing home in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 92.
        Although his academic specialty was botany, Dr. Cain, a Butler College graduate who received his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1930, broadened his scientific interests considerably beyond the world of plants.
        During a succession of teaching positions at Butler, Indiana University and the University of Tennessee, he focused increasingly on the relationship between people and the environment, coming to believe that industrial and other threats to the land were putting people in increasing peril.
        Dr. Cain's concerns generally ran ahead of academic science, at least until 1950, when he became a professor at the University of Michigan, where he founded the Department of Conservation, the first academic unit devoted to the specialty.
        Partly because of his work, conservation became an increasing national concern, and in 1965 Dr. Cain, who had served as chairman of the Michigan Conservation Commission, was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson as Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
        After his government service ended in 1968, he returned to the University of Michigan, where he became head of the Institute for Environmental Quality until his retirement in 1972. He later taught at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
        The author of two books and more than 100 articles, Dr. Cain was a pioneer from the beginning of his science career. For his first research paper in 1927, on ecological mapping, he took photographs from a biplane, the first use of aerial photography in the biological sciences.
        He is survived by a son, Stephen, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and seven grandchildren.
