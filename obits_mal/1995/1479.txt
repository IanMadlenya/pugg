        B. Richard Bugelski, a scholar known for his contributions to learning theory in psychology, died on March 3 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Cheektowaga, N.Y. A resident of Getzville, N.Y., he was 81.
        He suffered a brief illness, according to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where he was distinguished professor emeritus of psychology.
        Dr. Bugelski advanced the concept of "secondary reinforcement," a concept that has become a staple in psychology textbooks. In secondary reinforcement, a response is strengthened by the use of a stimulus associated with a different stimulus of primary reinforcement value.
        Dr. Bugelski was born in Johnstown, Pa., and grew up in Buffalo. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Buffalo, and his doctorate from Yale.
        He taught at the University of Buffalo from 1946 until his retirement in 1978. He served as chairman of the department of psychology in the 1960's but relinquished that post in 1969 when he was named a distinguished professor, the supreme academic rank in the SUNY system.
        Just before his retirement, he received the SUNY Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Teaching.
        He was the author or co-author of 7 books, 8 book chapters and 50 articles in scholarly journals.
        Dr. Bugelski is survived by his wife, Sadie Locurto Bugelski; two daughters, Victoria Stearns of Tonawanda, N.Y., and Catherine Labuda of Houston; a sister, Victoria Schwartz, and four grandchildren.
