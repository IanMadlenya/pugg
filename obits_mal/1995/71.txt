        Thomas Eden Binkley, a medieval music expert and director of the Early Music Institute at Indiana University, died on April 28 at his home in Bloomington, Ind. He was 63.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said a spokesman for the university.
        Mr. Binkley was a pioneer in researching medieval performance practices and presenting authentic reconstructions of early liturgical music. He first attracted interest in music of the Middle Ages with recitals of works from the 13th-century manuscript "Carmina Burana." His influence on performance standards of pre-Baroque music has been widespread.
        He was born in Cleveland and graduated from the University of Illinois in 1956. He did graduate studies at the University of Munich, Germany, where in 1959 he founded the Early Music Quartet. He toured with the ensemble as its director and lutenist for 15 years.
        Mr. Binkley joined the faculty of the Indiana University School of Music in 1979, and during his tenure initiated the Focus Recording Series and the "Scholarship and Performance" publication series. He had taught at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland, and at Stanford University, and was a vice president of Early Music America.
        He is survived by his wife, Raglind; four daughters, Leonore, Isabel and Beatriz, of Bloomington, and Christina, of Orlando, Fla.; and a brother, Robert, of London, Ontario.
