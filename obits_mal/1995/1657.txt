        Henry G. Mautner, a biochemist who specialized in selenium chemistry, died last Friday at Deaconess Hospital in Boston. He was 70 and lived in Newton, Mass.
        The cause was complications from leukemia and kidney failure, said Susan Erickson, a family friend.
        Dr. Mautner was professor emeritus of biochemistry and pharmacology at Tufts University. He joined the university in 1970 as chairman of a combined department of biochemistry and pharmacology at its medical school.
        He was known for his work with derivatives of selenium, a metal-like element related to sulfur with medical applications as a potential cancer fighter. Other research involved selenium derivatives of a substance that allows messages to travel from nerve to nerve.
        Born in Prague, he was a graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles and earned a master's degree from the University of Southern California and a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.
        He went to Tufts from Yale University, where he was a professor and head of the medicinal chemistry section. At his death, he was science chairman of the Children's School of Science in Woods Hole, Mass.
        Dr. Mautner is survived by his wife, Dorothea; two daughters, Andrea, of Newton, and Monica M. McQueen of San Francisco; his mother, Maria Mautner of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a grandson.
