        George Woodall Cadbury, an economist in Canada who was an international leader in the Planned Parenthood movement, died on Feb. 25 in the Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital in Oakville, Ontario, where he lived. He was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, said a daughter, Lyndall Elizabeth Boal of Mt. Kisco, N.Y.
        At his death, he was chairman emeritus of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and an honorary director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of Canada.
        First appointed chairman of the international federation's executive committee in 1960, he, as well as his wife, Barbara, had long been associated with work on behalf of population control. In 1990 the couple were awarded the Order of Canada for their work in leading the campaign to remove contraception from the country's criminal code in 1969.
        Educated as an economist, he received a master's degree from Kings' College, Cambridge University, and held a number of Government posts as an economics adviser. From 1941 to 1945 he was the chief economic adviser to the Province of Saskatchewan, where he helped the country's first Socialist Government establish a health care system. From 1945 to 1951 he was director of the Technical Assistance Administration of the United Nations.
        Mr. Cadbury was the grandson of the founder of the British chocolate company, which in 1969 merged to form Cadbury Schweppes P.L.C.
        Besides his wife and his daughter Lyndall Boal, he is survived by another daughter, Caroline Ann Woodroffe of London, and four grandchildren.
