        George Prideaux, a composer of music for the theater, died on Nov. 6 at Hillhaven San Francisco, a nursing home. He was 75.
        The cause was heart failure, said Rayanna Simons, a friend.
        Among his many compositions were dozens of scores for plays produced at the  Cubiculo Theater and the Theater for a New City. He also wrote music for the Festival of the Arts at Spoleto, Italy, including an orchestral setting for Ingmar Bergman's play "Painting on Wood." Another of his compositions was a score for a work by Joyce Carol Oates, "The Ontological Proof of My Existence."
        Mr. Prideaux was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied with the composer Ernest Bloch.
        No immediate family members survive.
