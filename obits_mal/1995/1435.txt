        Peter H. Sandfort, a dairyman who fought New Jersey's pricing policies on milk in a campaign that was closely followed by the industry in the 1960's, died on Saturday in Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 79 and a resident of Hawthorne, N.J.
        The cause was complications from pulmonary fibrosis, said his wife, Mary Ann Badner Sandfort.
        Partly as a result of Mr. Sandfort's effort, new pricing recommendations were adopted, which included a formula that was based on farmers' costs.
        In the early 1960's, Mr. Sandfort set out to break the state's grip on prices by selling milk through a family-owned network of outlets in New Jersey and Pennsylvania called Garden State Farms. At the time, the vast bulk of milk was sold by home delivery at prices set by a state agency, the Milk Control Board.
        In 1960, he petitioned the board to be allowed to sell milk at 87 cents a gallon, instead of the established $1.08. The request was denied and, shortly after, the board raised the price to $1.10. Mr. Sandfort sought an injunction and set off a court battle that went on for two years and pitted him against about 30 milk companies, milk-industry unions and the State Attorney General as well as the board.
        Price limits were formally lifted in 1962 and replaced by the formula.
        Mr. Sandfort's first wife, Edythe A. Nielsen, died in 1964.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Peter H. Jr., of Ramsey, N.J., John, of Warwick, N.Y., and Dr. M. Robert, of Portsmouth, R.I.; two daughters, Joan Swartz of Clarks Summit, Pa., and Marni Sandfort of Washington; three sisters, Mickey Smits of Wyckoff, N.J., Nell De Korte of Santa Maria, Calif., and Adriana Knapp of Midland Park, N.J.; 12 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
