        Robert B. Meyer Jr., a former curator of aero propulsion at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington and a longtime director of his family's Cord Meyer Development Company in Forest Hills, Queens, died on Wednesday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 74.
        His family said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        A native of Locust Valley, L.I., Mr. Meyer, who graduated from St. Paul's School and from Yale University, served in the Army Air Corps in World War II and then worked as an insurance broker before joining the museum in 1959.
        While aviation was his vocation, Mr. Meyer had a fondness for other forms of transportation: he was affiliated with both the Bentley Driver's club and the Rolls-Royce Owners club.
        Mr. Meyer had also served as treasurer of the family-owned development company. It was founded by his grandfather, Cord Meyer, who developed Forest Hills and other Queens communities at the turn of the century.
        Mr. Meyer is survived by his wife, Maria Teresa; four daughters, Katharine Meyer of Potomac, Maria Teresa Prendergast of Miami Beach, Ana Maria Hill of Denver and Carmen Vasquez of Austin, Tex.; a son, Carlos, of Leesburg, Va., and two grandchildren.
