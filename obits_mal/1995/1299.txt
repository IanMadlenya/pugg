        Woodrow Wilson Williams, who had 10 straight hits as a Cincinnati Reds infielder in 1943, tying a National League record that still stands, died Friday at Appomattox Health Care Center, a nursing home in Appomattox, Va. He was 82 and had lived in Pamplin, Va.
        He was suffering from a severe virus infection, said his daughter Martha Ferguson.
        After tying the record, Williams, who was known as Woody, said, "You've got to have luck to get a string of hits in a row, but you also have to be seeing the ball good, and I was seeing it clearly."
        He was then 31, and he became the seventh batter to achieve that National League record, The Sporting News reported at the time. He got his 10 hits in 10 straight at-bats, against 6 different pitchers in two ball parks during three games on two successive days.
        He also played for the Brooklyn Dodgers in a career that shuttled between the majors and minors.
        In addition to his daughter Martha of Roanoke, Va., he is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Mamie Inge; another daughter, Pam Williams Harris of Pamplin; two daughters from a previous marriage; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
