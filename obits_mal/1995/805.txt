        Robert H. Adleman, an author whose work included books about World War II as  well as a number of novels, died on Thursday at Ashland Community Hospital in Ashland, Ore. He was 76.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son-in-law Jonathan Edelman.
        One of Mr. Adleman's novels, "The Devil's Brigade," was made into a 1968 film that starred William Holden as leader of a commando group during World War  II. Two of his nonfiction books also dealt with World War II. "Rome Fell Today" (1968) described the course of the war in Italy. "The Champagne Campaign" (1969) was about an airborne unit in France. His nonfiction also included "The Bloody Benders" (1970), about a murderous family in 19th-century Kansas, and "Alias Big Cherry," about a master swindler. "Sweetwater Fever," a novel, was set in a small town in Oregon.
        He is survived by his wife, Margie; two daughters, Barbara Edelman and Perry  Clennon, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Stanley and Edward, and a sister, Bernice Landsburg, all of New Jersey, and three grandchildren.
