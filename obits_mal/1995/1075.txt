        Manuel Gutierrez Mellado, a Franco-era general who played a major role in Spain's transition to democracy and helped face down a coup attempt in 1981, was killed in a highway crash today, Defense Ministry officials said. He was 83.
        As First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of defense after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, General Gutierrez Mellado reformed the army to make it politically neutral.
        His most famous moment came on Feb. 23, 1981, when Lieut. Col. Antonio Tejedo fired shots in Parliament in a military bid for power.
        Members of Parliament dove for cover, except for Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, the Communist Party head Santiago Carillo and General Gutierrez Mellado, who stood up to intervene and resisted efforts by Civil Guard conspirators to wrestle him down.
        Mr. Suarez told Spanish television that General Gutierrez Mellado had been "a great soldier, loyal to Spain, to the King and to democracy" and "one of the people I love most."
        General Gutierrez Mellado was born in Madrid on April 30, 1912, and was orphaned at 8. He graduated first in the class of 1933 from the General Military Academy in Zaragoza, whose director at the time was Franco.
        During the Spanish Civil War, he served in the intelligence service of Franco's army in Burgos. In 1939, he created the Defense Information Service, which together with the Military Information Service was the precursor to Spain's secret service.
        Mr. Suarez chose him from the senior army ranks to become First Deputy Prime  Minister in 1976. As part of his reform of the military, General Gutierrez Mellado promoted liberal-minded generals, ignoring a tradition of strict seniority by age. He set up a single Defense Ministry, reorganized the general staff and established a new intelligence organization.
        He retired with the rank of lieutenant general in 1982.
