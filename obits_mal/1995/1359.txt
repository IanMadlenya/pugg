        Maurice H. Halperin, an exiled American scholar and former intelligence official whose books chronicled the career of Fidel Castro, died Friday at Royal Columbia Hospital outside Vancouver, British Columbia, a friend, Lenard Cohen, said. He was 88 years old and had lived in Canada since 1968.
        He died of a stroke, Mr. Cohen said.
        Mr. Halperin left the United States in the 1950's after the Federal Bureau of Investigation accused him of being a Communist spy. He studied and taught for 15 years in Mexico City, Moscow and Havana, before he became disillusioned with the Soviet Union and took a position at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.
        During World War II, Mr. Halperin, who did undergraduate work at Harvard University and held a doctorate from the Sorbonne, was chief of the Latin American division of the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, he worked at the State Department until 1949, when he became chairman of Latin American studies at Boston University.
        In 1953, the F.B.I. accused him of having passed secrets to the Soviet Union during the war. Mr. Halperin refused to testify before a Senate committee and lost his teaching position. Blacklisted, Mr. Halperin and his wife, Edith, moved to Mexico City, where he taught at the National University of Mexico.
        Mr. Halperin left Mexico in 1958 and went to the Academy of Sciences in Moscow. There he met Che Guevara, who invited him to Cuba. From 1962 to 1968, Mr. Halperin lectured at the University of Havana and was a consultant to the Ministry of Foreign Trade.
        He is survived by a son, Dr. David Halperin, of Chiapas, Mexico; a daughter, Judith Gamoran, of Seattle; a brother, Theodore Halperin of Boston, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
