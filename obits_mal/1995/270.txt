        Ernest C. Havemann, a retired journalist and textbook writer, died Wednesday at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 83 years old.
        The cause was pneumonia, his son, Joel, said.
        A native of St. Louis, Mo., Mr. Havemann earned bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology from Washington University, then began working as a reporter, first for The St. Louis Star-Times and then The St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
        Mr. Havemann came to New York to work for Time magazine, and after serving in the Air Force in the Pacific during World War II, he switched to the staff of Life magazine where he produced profiles of Ty Cobb, the baseball great, and Joseph Welch, the lawyer who finally humiliated Senator Joseph McCarthy. Mr. Havemann was one of the first American reporters in the Soviet Union after World War II, reporting in Life that it was a desolate and unhappy place for ordinary citizens.
        Mr. Havemann left Life in 1956 and work as a freelance magazine writer and book author. In the 1960's, he collaborated with Jerome Kagan, a Harvard University psychologist, to write a college textbook, "Psychology: An Introduction." The book broke new ground, cutting through the discipline's jargon. The authors collaborated on four more editions, the last in 1984.
        Besides his son, Joel, of Chevy Chase, Md., Mr. Havemann is survived by four grandchildren.
