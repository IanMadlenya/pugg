        Shannon Hoon, a singer and songwriter whose band, Blind Melon, shot to the top of the charts in 1993 with their eclectic single "No Rain," died today. He was 28.
        Mr. Hoon died on his tour bus, said Sgt. Marlon DeFillo of the New Orleans police. His band members apparently could not wake him and called the authorities.
        Sergeant DeFillo said Mr. Hoon, a native of Lafayette, Ind., died about 1:30 P.M. The bus was parked in a parking lot at the time. The sergeant said that there was no sign of trauma, and that the cause of death remained unclassified pending an autopsy.
        The band, based in Los Angeles, was in New Orleans to play at Tipitina's, a music club. In Los Angeles, a security guard at Capitol Records, the band's record company, said that no one was available to comment.
        After mixed reviews of the band's appearance at Woodstock '94, the group had  been beset by personal problems. Mr. Hoon had been arrested for drunken and disorderly conduct in New Orleans during the recording of the band's second album, "Soup."
        On stage, Mr. Hoon was wildly emotional, spinning around his microphone stand in bare feet and sometimes shedding his clothes. His high-pitched voice was described by a critic for The New York Times as "a vintage whine" that sounded like "Neil Young after a coughing fit," as he sang with desperation of the uncertainties of youth and the fears of entering adulthood.
        The band, which mixed trappings of 1960's psychedelia with rural rhythms, got its name from neighbors of the group's bassist, Brad Smith. They were unemployed hippies in Mississippi who called each other "blind melons."
