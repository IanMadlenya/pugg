        Rabbi Abraham Shusterman, a member and leader of interfaith groups that played a role in calming social unrest in American cities in the 1960's, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Baltimore. He was 88.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Sara Lee Jacobson of Baltimore.
        Rabbi Shusterman, who headed Baltimore's oldest Reform congregation, the Har Sinai Congregation, from 1941 to 1972, was co-chairman of the Interfaith Council of Metropolitan Baltimore and was on the board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        He also headed the Clergy Brotherhood of Baltimore and a number of regional organizations of Reformed Rabbis. From 1955 until 1968, he appeared on a weekly television program devoted to social and religious issues.
        Born in Altoona, Pa., he graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1929 and was ordained in 1931 from the Hebrew Union College.
        His first wife, the former Lillian Epstein, died in 1971. Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Rose Fox Shusterman; a son, David E. of Dallas; a brother, David of Clarksville, Ind.; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
