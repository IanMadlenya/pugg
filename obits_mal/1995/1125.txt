        Donald MacCampbell, a literary agent in Manhattan for more than 50 years, died on Dec. 26 at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. He was 85 and lived in Darien.
        He suffered a brief illness, said Maureen Moran, an editor at Donald MacCampbell Inc. in Manhattan.
        A few months ago, Mr. MacCampbell figured that he had negotiated some 3,000 paperback contracts. Most of them were for romances, mysteries and Westerns aimed at the mass market, many of them written under pseudonyms.
        But in 1960 he found a publisher for a series called Capitol Hill Books, which featured the writings of prominent legislators, among them Eugene McCarthy, Paul Douglas, Henry Jackson and William Proxmire.  By Mr. MacCampbell's own account, most of the books were ghost-written.
        Mr. MacCampbell was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University. He worked as a writer and editor at American Mercury and Atlantic Monthly Press before becoming a literary agent in Boston. He set up shop in Manhattan in 1939.
        He also was the author of several books about writing and reading.
        Mr. MacCampbell's first wife, Kathleen, died in 1983. He is survived by his second wife, the former Betty Hirschel; a daughter, Jane Norton of Reston, Va., and a granddaughter.
