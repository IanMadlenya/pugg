        John T. Ryan Jr., the retired chairman and chief executive of the Mine Safety Appliances Company, died on Monday at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Mr. Ryan, a resident of Pittsburgh, was 83.
        Mr. Ryan, whose father founded the company in 1914 with George H. Dieke, joined Mine Safety Appliances in 1936 as a sales engineer. He served as the general manager and as executive vice president before becoming president in 1953 and chairman in 1963.
        Mine Safety Appliances' early success came from the battery-operated lamp for miners' helmets, first developed for the company in 1915 by Thomas A. Edison to replace the open-flame lamp.
        Under Mr. Ryan's leadership, the company, which mainly manufactured equipment for the mining industry, began making safety products for the military and fire and utility companies.
        Mr. Ryan oversaw the company's expansion into Europe, Asia and Latin America. Mine Safety Appliances, which reported sales of $459.6 million last year, has operations in 25 countries.
        Mr. Ryan retired from the company in 1990. A son, John T. Ryan 3d, is the current chief executive.
        In addition to his son, John T. 3d of Pittsburgh, Mr. Ryan is survived by his wife, Mary Irene O'Brien Ryan, also of Pittsburgh; two daughters, Irene R. Shaw of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Julia R. Parker of Darien, Conn.; three other sons, Michael D. Ryan of Milwaukee, Dr. Daniel H. Ryan of Rochester and William F. Ryan of Catonsville, Md.; 21 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
