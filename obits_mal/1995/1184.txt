        George Eells, a writer and editor and a biographer of such entertainment luminaries as Cole Porter, Mae West and Anita O'Day, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 72 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was pneumonia after complications from brain surgery in June, said Patrick Pacheco, a friend.
        Mr. Eells's best-known work was his book about Porter and his songs, "The Life That Late He Led" (Putnam, 1967).
        "Mae West: A Biography" (William Morrow) was written with Stanley Musgrove and published in 1982, two years after the star's death. "High Times Hard Times" (Putnam, 1981) was filled with Ms. O'Day's vivid images of the likes of Gene Krupa, Stan Kenton and Billie Holiday.
        Mr. Eells also wrote about the Hollywood gossip columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, ("Hedda and Louella," Putnam, 1972), Robert Mitchum, and helped Ethel Merman write her autobiography.
        Besides his books, he wrote scripts for "This Is Your Life," Ralph Edwards's popular television program, in the early 1970's and again in 1984.
        Mr. Eells was born in Winslow, Ill. He studied at Northwestern University and Columbia University, and in 1945 became entertainment editor of Parade magazine in New York. He worked as an editor and writer at Look magazine, Theater Arts and Signature, the magazine of the Diners' Club.
        He is survived by his companion of many years, Aurand Harris, a children's playwright.
