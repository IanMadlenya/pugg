        William Summer Johnson, an organic chemist at Stanford University who developed more efficient techniques for making complex chemical compounds for medical use, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Portola Valley, Calif., near Stanford. He was 82.
        He had been ill with circulatory and heart problems, a Stanford spokesman said. He reached emeritus status in 1978 but kept working in his laboratory until about four months ago.
        Dr. Johnson was credited with attracting world-class chemists to Stanford and helping to build its chemistry department into one of the most prestigious in the United States. He headed the department from 1960 to 1969, when he was then appointed Jackson-Wood Professor of Chemistry.
        In a career spanning more than five decades, Dr. Johnson devised more efficient ways to produce a wide variety of biologically important compounds like steroids and vitamins.
        One aspect of his work involved the synthesis of corticosteroids, a class of steroids secreted by the adrenal cortex and used to treat inflammation in wounds. While the compounds had been synthesized in World War II, the process was highly cumbersome until Dr. Johnson simplified it.
        He contributed simpler procedures for making male and female hormones and hormones to treat inflammations like arthritis. He did so through what he called a "biomimetic approach to total synthesis," imitating the biological processes by which such highly complex structures are created.
        Dr. Johnson, who was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1936 and a Ph.D. in organic chemistry from Harvard University in 1940. He taught at the University of Wisconsin from 1940 to 1960, when he became executive head of the chemistry department at Stanford.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Barbara Allen Johnson.
