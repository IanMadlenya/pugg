        Henry Solomonoff, a musician, artist and businessman who helped found the American Negro Ballet, died last Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        The cause was cancer, said Stephanie Reich, his daughter.
        Mr. Solomonoff, who was born in Paris and reared in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and New York City, trained in music with Joseph Schillinger, a composer, and Leon Theremin, a pioneer in the development of electronic music. Mr. Solomonoff performed with the Theremin Studio Ensemble, along with the Victor Lopez Orchestra, in such New York City theaters as the Paramount and the Roxy. He was featured in "Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey," a documentary by Steven M. Martin, which was shown last year at the New York Film Festival.
        Mr. Solomonoff was also the president and creative designer of Designer Stones, a family jewelry business, and was known in the fashion jewelry business as Henry Stone. He performed with the Lopez orchestra as Eugene Henry. His paintings were exhibited in New York City at the Cork Gallery and at the National Academy of Design.
        In 1937, he collaborated with Eugene Von Grona, a dancer and choreographer, to create the American Negro Ballet, among the earliest American concert-dance companies of black dancers. Mr. Solomonoff managed and presented the company in New York and Boston. The company, which lasted about two years, also performed on Broadway in Lew Leslie's "Blackbirds of 1939."
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a grandson and a sister, Sophie Schneer, all of Williamstown, Mass.
