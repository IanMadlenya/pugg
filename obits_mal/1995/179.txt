        Richard Vogt, the conductor and director of the Greenwich Choral Society, died on Saturday at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 65.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his brother, Howard S. Vogt of Bloomfield, N.J.
        Mr. Vogt had led the Greenwich Choral Society since 1973. Under his direction, the group performed locally and nationally, and appeared at the Aldeburgh Festival in England in 1976 and 1985. He had also been the director of music at the First Congregational Church in Old Greenwich since 1967, and had served as choral director with the American Opera Society and the Caramoor Festival.
        In January, he was the chorus master for a Carnegie Hall concert by the Orchestra of St. Luke's.
        His brother is his only survivor.
