        The Rev. Barnabas Ahern, a prominent Roman Catholic theologian and biblical scholar, died on Monday at the Immaculate Conception Passionist Monastery in Chicago. He was 79.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said the Rev. Michael Joseph Stengel, head of the Passionist order.
        During the Second Vatican Council, convened by Pope John XXIII in 1962, Father Ahern collaborated in the drafting of the major texts that re-examined the church's teachings and practices. As the leading American scholar on Scripture at the council, he contributed to the decrees that examined divine revelation, ecumenism and religious freedom.
        The author of "New Horizons" (1963) and "Christ Among Men" (1968), he taught at the Vatican's Gregorian University, where theologians study, from 1965 until 1984, when he went to Kenya, to help establish a graduate school for theological studies.
        Born in Louisville, Ky., as James Ahern, he entered the Passionist order in 1932, taking the name Barnabas Mary, and was ordained a priest in 1941.
