        Richard L. Solomon, an experimental psychologist, scientist and a professor,  died on Thursday in Boston at age 77. The cause of death was complications from  cardiac surgery, said his brother, David Solomon.
        Mr. Solomon was a pioneer in addiction research, having devised an opponent-process theory to explain drug use and addiction. His career included professorships at Brown University, Harvard University and at the University of  Pennsylvania, where he was James M. Skinner Emeritus Professor of Science after  retiring in 1985.
        His research covered many areas of experimental psychology, exploring avoidance learning in dogs and people and the effects of punishment on subsequent behaviors. He also conducted a variety of experiments on acquired motivation.
        Mr. Solomon was born in Boston in 1918 and received his A.B. from Brown University in 1940. After serving in the Army Air Force in World War II, he completed his doctoral work in psychology at Brown.
        He received numerous awards for his work, including a Guggenheim Fellowship.  He was one of the first experimental psychologists to be elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and received an honorary doctorate of sciences from his alma mater in 1990.
        Besides his brother, David, of Santa Monica, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Maggie; two daughters, Janet Solomon of Philadelphia and Elizabeth Marks of West Hartford, Conn., and a grandson.
