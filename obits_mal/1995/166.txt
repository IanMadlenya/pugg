        Arvid Jouppi, a longtime and much-quoted automobile industry analyst, died on Thursday at the Angela Hospice in Livonia, Mich., outside Detroit. He was 77 and lived in Canton Township, Mich.
        The cause of death was heart failure, officials at the hospice said.
        Mr. Jouppi's views and comments were eagerly sought by journalists because of his long experience with the auto industry and his interest in matters that went beyond strict financial analysis. He would regale reporters with stories of how Chrysler Corporation's near-collapse in the early 1980's could be traced to big bank loans it took out in the 1950's.
        He would even comment on short-term auto sales fluctuations, but only after warning his questioner that the statistics were close to meaningless in predicting longer term trends. When Chrysler decided to sell and lease back its technology center north of Detroit in 1990 to raise cash, Mr. Jouppi observed: "This is a nice way to have your cake and let somebody else buy it for you."
        In the years after World War II, Mr. Jouppi worked as a news editor in The Associated Press bureau in Detroit.
        He developed an interest in automobiles, and went to work for an automotive supplier in 1947. Five years later he joined the General Motors Corporation's communications staff. He moved on to Chrysler Corporation in 1957 as head of its eastern division of public and investor relations.
        The investor-relations work put him in contact with Wall Street and in 1963 he joined Hayden, Stone Inc. as an analyst. In 1975 he started his own automotive research services company, Arvid Jouppi Associates, in the Detroit area. It was associated with various investment companies and is currently a unit of Keane Securities.
        He was a graduate of Michigan State University.
        Mr. Jouppi is survived by his wife, Edith; a daughter, Gloria Timmers; two sons, William and Jim, and three stepsons, John, Scott and Joseph.
