        Richard L. Tobin, a reporter and editor for The New York Herald Tribune and an editor and executive of The Saturday Review, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Southbury, Conn. He was 85.
        At The Herald Tribune from 1932 to 1956, Mr. Tobin was a reporter, editor, war correspondent and assistant to the publisher. At The Saturday Review for 16 years beginning in 1960, he was managing editor, executive editor, associate publisher and senior vice president.
        Mr. Tobin also taught at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and was Riley Professor of Journalism at Indiana University.
        Mr. Tobin was the author of "Invasion Journal," published in 1944, which dealt with his experiences as a correspondent in London and Western Europe. Other books included "Golden Opinions" (1948), "The Center of the World" (1951) and "Decisions of Destiny" (1961).
        For a number of years, Mr. Tobin monitored changing fashions in language through an annual survey of usage among newspaper and magazine editors. In a resulting book, "Tobin's English Usage" (1985), he wrote, "It's a war of words that never ceases and never will -- intrusive usage battling entrenched diction, with the outcome always uncertain and sometimes quite startling."
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Tobin graduated from the University of Michigan in 1932 and received a distinguished alumnus award in 1964.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Cleveland of Southbury; a son, Mark C. Tobin of Nantucket, Mass; two sisters, Blanche McCain of Manhattan and Anne Perry of Washington, and two grandchildren.
