        Billy Bruton, the leadoff batter, chief base stealer and rangy center fielder for the powerful Milwaukee Braves teams of the 1950's, died on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack while driving near his home in Wilmington. He was 69.
        The Delaware State Police said Bruton's car drifted off the highway and struck a pole. He was pronounced dead a short time later at Christiana Hospital.
        Bruton was a rookie when the National League franchise moved to Milwaukee from Boston in 1953, and he became an immediate hero when he hit a 10th-inning home run that gave the Braves a 3-2 victory over St. Louis in Milwaukee's first  major league game.
        As a teammate of Henry Aaron, Warren Spahn, Eddie Mathews, Red Schoendienst,  Joe Adcock and Lew Burdette, Bruton went on to lead the league in stolen bases for three consecutive seasons. He played eight seasons with the Braves before calling it quits in 1964 after four years with the Detroit Tigers. His career batting average was .273.
        Bruton missed the 1957 World Series, which Milwaukee won, with a knee injury, but when the Braves lost in seven games to the Yankees in 1958, Bruton was the leading hitter with a .412 average.
        He is survived by his wife, Loretta; three daughters and a son.
