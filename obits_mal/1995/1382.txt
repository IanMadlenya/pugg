        Alph B. Peterson, a former president and chief executive of the International Playtex Corporation, a consumer products company, died on Feb. 7 at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart, Fla. Mr. Peterson, 82, lived in Stuart.
        The cause was bone marrow disease, said his son, Steven.
        Mr. Peterson became a marketing vice president at the International Latex Corporation, a division of the Stanley-Warner Corporation, in 1954 and was promoted to executive vice president in 1958. When International Playtex was formed as a consumer-products subsidiary of International Latex in 1960, Mr. Peterson was appointed head of Playtex, which made tampons, disposable baby bottles, women's undergarments and rubber gloves.
        Mr. Peterson was involved in marketing campaigns and was responsible for the first television campaign for brassieres, Steven Peterson said. After persuading television executives to sell advertising time for the Living Bra, the first commercial featured a woman who played tennis and whose image slowly changed to reveal the bra as she moved about the court.
        International Playtex, which was bought by the Rapid-American Corporation in 1968 and was later sold several times, is now Playtex Apparel. The Sara Lee Corporation of Chicago owns it. Other parts of the business are part of another company, Playtex Products Inc.
        Mr. Peterson left Playtex in 1968 and was the chairman and chief executive of the Benrus Watch Company. He was also a consultant to the Remington Products Company from 1979 to 1986, when he retired.
        In 1933, Mr. Peterson became an office boy at Lever Brothers. He worked his way up to marketing vice president.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Ethel; three daughters, Linda Henry of Ashaway, R.I., Janet Dickstein of Paramus, N.J., and Patricia Messenger of Lexington, Mass., and four grandchildren.
