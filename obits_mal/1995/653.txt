        Vada Pinson, the star center fielder for the Cincinnati Reds in the 1960's who twice led the National League in hits, died Saturday night at Summit Medical Center after a stroke earlier this month. He was 57.
        The two-time All-Star played 11 of his 18 seasons with the Reds. He also played with Seattle, Cleveland, California and Kansas City. He served as a hitting coach with four teams, including the Mets.
        Pinson was one of only six players to hit 250 home runs and steal 300 bases. The others were Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds, Joe Morgan, Andre Dawson and Barry Bonds. He finished his career with a .286 average, 256 homers and 1,170 r.b.i.
