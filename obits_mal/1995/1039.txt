        Richard Haydock, who organized the legal referral service of the New York City bar association in 1947 and headed it until his retirement in 1984, died on Nov. 23 at Tally-Ho Manor in Boonton Township, N.J. A 43-year resident of Mountain Lakes, N.J., he was 82.
        Mr. Haydock, a native of New York City, was an economics graduate of Harvard  University and received his law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1937. He worked for the Legal Aid Society before forming the Legal Referral Service of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, taking the position of executive director. It was one of the first such services in the country for people unacquainted with the law or with lawyers, and provided legal help for a modest fee.
        What started as a one-man operation taking just four calls in July 1947 has  since grown to an organization that handles more than 100,000 calls a year. Its  clients range from prison inmates to big corporations, although most calls come  from middle-income people with ordinary legal problems.
        Mr. Haydock is survived by two sons, Roger, of Eugene, Ore., and William H.,  of Mountain Lakes, and three grandchildren. His wife, Katherine Snyder Haydock,  died two years ago.
