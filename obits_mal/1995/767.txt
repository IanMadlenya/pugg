        Walter Mendelsohn, the longtime managing partner of the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98.
        From the time he joined Joseph Proskauer, Alfred Rose and Norman Goetz in 1921, Mr. Mendelsohn, a New York native who received his bachelor's and law degrees from Yale, was a driving force in virtually every facet of the firm's growth.
        A trust, estates and corporations specialist, he was credited with everything from creating the firm's structure of departments in the 1920's to establishing branch offices in the 1970's.
        He was the last surviving name partner of the firm.
        Mr. Mendelsohn is survived by a daughter, Sue Mellins; a son, Paul Richard Mendelsohn; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
