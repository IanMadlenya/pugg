        Harvey Eugene Lyon, a retired rear admiral and submariner who helped to build Trident missile submarines in the 1970's, died on Monday at his home in Fairfax, Va. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Admiral Lyon was born in McCook, Neb., graduated from the United States Naval Academy and did postgraduate work in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He spent 30 years in the Navy, mostly on submarines.
        He served in the Pacific in World War II and the Korean War. His assignments also took him to the Atomic Energy Commission.
        He was the Navy's project manager for the design of the Trident program and construction of the submarines. He retired from the Trident system in 1981, after which he directed the office of nuclear reactor security in the Department of Energy.
        Admiral Lyon is survived by his wife of 40 years, Marjorie Walker Lyon; a son, Lieut. Comdr. Harvey C., of San Francisco; a daughter, Ginger S. Lyon of Fairfax, and three grandchildren.
