        Vaclav Neumann, the conductor of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra for more than 20 years, died on Saturday in Vienna. He was 74.
        Through his many recordings, his tours with the Czech Philharmonic and his occasional guest appearances in the United States -- including a series of Janacek's "Jenufa" at the Metropolitan Opera in 1985 -- Mr. Neumann established a reputation as a versatile conductor with a special affinity for Dvorak, Martinu, Janacek, Smetana and Mahler. He had completed a recording of Mahler's Seventh Symphony in Prague last month.
        Mr. Neumann was born in Prague on Sept. 29, 1920, and studied the violin and conducting at the Prague Conservatory from 1940 to 1945. After several years as a member of a string quartet, he made his conducting debut with the Czech Philharmonic in 1948. He was chief conductor of the Prague Symphony Orchestra from 1956 to 1963 and of the Prague Philharmonic for a season ending in 1964.
        His first international success came in 1956, when he conducted a production of Janacek's "Cunning Little Vixen" at the Berlin Komische Oper. He was that company's principal conductor from 1957 to 1960 and continued his association with it until 1964, when he accepted two posts in Leipzig, East Germany, as general music director of the Leipzig Opera and principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra. In 1968 he resigned the Leipzig posts to protest the cooperation of East German troops in crushing the Prague Spring democracy movement. He was succeeded by Kurt Masur.
        Mr. Neumann also took a political role in 1989, first by refusing to perform on Czech radio and television, to protest the blacklisting of actors who were demanding political change, and then by conducting a performance of the Beethoven Ninth Symphony in honor of Civic Forum, the movement led by Vaclav Havel, then a dissident, with Mr. Havel onstage during the finale.
        Mr. Neumann became chief conductor of the Czech Philharmonic in 1968, and although he relinquished the post in 1990 he continued to work with the orchestra as a guest conductor. He was also general music director of the Stuttgart Staatsoper from 1970 to 1973.
