        Dexter Means Bullard Jr., who expanded psychiatric care for children and adolescents at the mental hospital that his grandfather founded in Rockville, Md., died on Thursday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 66 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Bullard, who retired a year ago, succeeded his father as medical director of the Chestnut Lodge mental hospital in 1969. His father, Dexter Bullard Sr., who died in 1981, led the hospital for 38 years and gained international renown for the treatment of schizophrenics. The elder Dr. Bullard's father, Dr. Ernest Luther Bullard, founded Chestnut Lodge in 1910.
        Besides expanding the hospital's services to children, the younger Dr. Bullard wrote many papers on the care of children and adults with serious mental illnesses.
        He was born in Washington, graduated from Yale College in 1951 and received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1956. Before moving to Chestnut Lodge, he was chief of the outpatient psychiatric service at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
        Dr. Bullard is survived by his wife, Louisa Jenkins Bullard; two sons, Mercer, of Chevy Chase, and Prescott, of Gaithersburg, Md.; a daughter, Lindsay Bullard of Bethesda; his mother, Anne W. Bullard of Finksburg, Md.; a sister, Rose B. Dyrud of Chicago, two brothers, James, of Ashton, Md., and Anthony, of Finksburg, and a granddaughter.
