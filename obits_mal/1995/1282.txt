        Leonard Gordon Ratner, a scholar of constitutional law who argued against efforts to limit the powers of the United States Supreme Court, died on Feb. 9 in the Driftwood Healthcare Center in Torrance, Calif. He was 78 and a resident of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said his wife, Catherine Ratner.
        An emeritus professor of law at the University of Southern California, he was recognized as an expert on the separation of powers among the branches of the Federal Government.
        Professor Ratner was a leading exponent of the view that Congressional power to limit the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was restrained by the Constitution. He believed Congress could not impair the essential functions of the Court to review cases. It was an argument that was influential in rejecting efforts to limit the Court's jurisdiction in areas like abortion, school prayer and school desegregation.
        He also argued that the power of Congress to declare war limited the war-making power of the President as Commander in Chief.
        A graduate of the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, he practiced law in Los Angeles before teaching at the University of Southern California Law Center.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Eric, of San Francisco, Steven, of Los Angeles and James, of Tucson, Ariz.
