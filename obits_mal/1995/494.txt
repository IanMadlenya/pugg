        Wilbur Stark, a radio, television and film producer, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said Naura Hayden, a friend.
        Mr. Stark, who was born in Brooklyn, made a name for himself in radio in New York in the 1940's when he produced "Movie Matinee," a radio quiz show on WOR, and later "Teen Canteen" for WINS and "Escape With Me" for WABC. He produced more than 1,500 radio shows and 1,000 television shows.
        His television credits include "Col. Humphrey Flack" and "Rocky King, Inside Detective," both on the DuMont network in the 1950's. Mr. Stark was also a producer of "Cat People," "The Thing" and "The Storyteller," among other films.
        He is survived by two daughters, Pam, of Connecticut, and Koo, an actress, of London, and a son, Brad, also of London.
