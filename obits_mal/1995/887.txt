        Kosso Eloul, the sculptor who designed the eternal flame at Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, died on Wednesday. He was 75.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Rhon.
        He had an international reputation and has a sculpture at the Canadian Embassy in Beijing and a monument in Mexico City. But probably his most important sculpture is the eternal flame at Yad Vashem.
        The flame, in a large, stark room, emerges from a stone floor through a bronze sculpture in the image of a broken goblet. Under the goblet is a basement containing the ashes of Nazi victims taken to Israel from concentration camps. The floor is covered with victims' names.
        The flame is raised for memorial ceremonies in the hall, and dignitaries visiting Israel usually lay a wreath there.
        Mr. Eloul was born in Russia and grew up in Israel, where he was co-founder of an artists' movement known as New Horizon. He moved to Toronto in 1964. He has some 44 pieces on public display in the Toronto area.
