        Michael Dash, a singer who functioned both as a countertenor and a baritone and who appeared with numerous opera companies around the country, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 36.
        The cause was AIDS, said a friend, the conductor Robert Bass.
        Mr. Dash made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1987 singing in Handel's "Julius Caesar." He also sang with the Glimmerglass, Chautauqua and Virginia Operas. He pursued a special interest in contemporary music, and performed recently in the world premiere of Harry Partch's "Bitter Music" with Musician's Accord.
        He was born In New Orleans and was a scholarship student at the Juilliard School. As a teen-ager he recorded the boy soprano part in George Crumb's "Ancient Voices of Children," a Nonesuch recording for which Mr. Dash received two Grammy nominations.
        He is survived by his parents, Calvin and Dorothy Dash, and a brother, Elliot, all of Wheaton, Md.
