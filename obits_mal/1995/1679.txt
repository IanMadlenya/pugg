        John E. Howard, the chief investigator and a principal prosecutor in the case against Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, the assassin of Senator Robert F. Kennedy in 1968, died on Monday at his home in Irvine, Calif. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said.
        Mr. Howard, a Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County, presented the case to the county grand jury that indicted Mr. Sirhan for first-degree murder, and he was one of three prosecutors at the trial.
        Senator Kennedy was seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1968, running against Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, and had won several major primaries, including the one in California the day he was shot at the Ambassador Hotel. He died the next day.
        At Mr. Sirhan's trial, Mr. Howard, a large man with close-cropped hair, delivered the state's final argument to the jury. He pleaded strongly for the death penalty, reminding the jurors that the Senator had carried the hopes of many Americans and might have achieved the nation's highest office.
        "This defendant," he said, "will regard permission to live as a triumph."
        Mr. Sirhan was sentenced in 1969 to die in the gas chamber, but the State Supreme Court overturned the sentence on the ground that the death penalty law was unconstitutional. That left Mr. Sirhan with a life sentence and the right to seek parole. He vainly did so for the ninth time last December and remains in a special housing unit at a state prison north of Los Angeles.
        Mr. Howard joined the District Attorney's office in 1952. He rose to the post of chief deputy and served as Acting District Attorney when the District Attorney died in 1975. He retired the next year and practiced law for several years before moving to Irvine.
        Mr. Howard is survived by his wife, Janet, and two daughters.
