        The Rev. Robert Emmett Kearns, a Roman Catholic priest whose missionary work in Peru over five decades included development of an educational radio network, died on Monday at the St. Teresa's Residence at the Maryknoll Fathers and Brothers Residence in Ossining, N.Y. He was 77 and had lived in Ossining since his return from Peru last year.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said a nephew, Richard Kearns, of Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        Ordained in 1944 as a priest with the Maryknolls, a Catholic missionary society, Father Kearns was sent first as rector of a seminary in Puno, on the high plateau of Peru near the Bolivian border.
        After serving in a number of parishes, in 1963 he was put in charge of establishing an educational radio network for schools and homes. With the support of the Government, the network offers courses in arithmetic, history, geography, religion and civics.
        When an earthquake ravaged Huaras in 1970, Father Kearns set up a network to get emergency help, and the station remains part of Peru's civil defense office.
        Father Kearns is survived by a sister, Mrs. Margaret Bruett, of Brielle, N.J.
