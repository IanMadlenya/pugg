        Charles Allen Blackwell, a Broadway dancer and stage manager, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Frances.
        After attending Oberlin College, Mr. Blackwell toured Europe, Africa and Israel with the Pearl Primus School of African Dance. He had a short career in business, returned to the theater as a solo dancer in "Fanny" and then moved into stage management. Among the shows he worked on were "Promises, Promises," "Sugar," "The Wiz," "Sunday in the Park With George" and "Jerome Robbins's Broadway."
        He received a Tony nomination as author of the book that became the basis for the musical "The Tap Dance Kid," and wrote the screenplay for "A Piece of the Action," which starred Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David; a daughter, Lisa, and a granddaughter.
