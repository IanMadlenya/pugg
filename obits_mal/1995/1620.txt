        Fred Harvey Harrington, a former president of the University of Wisconsin, died yesterday at Meriter Hospital in Madison. He was 82. Mr. Harrington was credited with raising the university's academic standing in the 1960's and broadening its mission before being driven from office by widespread campus unrest in 1970.
        The cause of death was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        A native of Watertown, N.Y., he graduated from Cornell, earned graduate and postgraduate degrees from New York University and taught for a year at Washington Square College before moving to Wisconsin in 1939. Mr. Harrington was a professor of history in 1947, and was named president of the university in 1962.
        During his nine-year tenure, Mr. Harrington won national acclaim for elevating the university's academic standing and leading the drive to extend the state university system's campus services to the inner cities.
        In the face of countless campus protests, Mr. Harrington emerged as a staunch defender of the rights of students to protest. And although he drew the line at violence, he also spoke out against the use of excessive force against peaceful demonstrators, a stance that drew criticism from university regents and others who demanded that he take a hard line.
        In May 1970, as many as 4,000 students staged a four-day battle against the police and National Guard troops. With the odor of tear gas in the air, he announced his resignation, citing a lack of support from regents and legislators and sheer fatigue.
        He then spent seven years working for the Ford Foundation in India, returning to Wisconsin as a professor of history in 1977. He retired in 1982.
        Mr. Harrington, whose wife, Nancy, died last fall, is survived by four daughters, Heather Monroe of Brooklyn, Holly Harrington of Batavia, Ill., Hilary Mandel of Los Altos, Calif., Helise Harrington of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
