        Mel Williamson, a painter and art director who turned to writing after his eyesight failed, died on Monday at his home in New York City. He was 72.
        The cause was bone cancer, said his wife, Lorraine.
        Mr. Williamson was narrator and co-writer, with Clayton Riley, of "The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military," a three-part documentary shown on public television in 1983. He was also a writer and co-producer of another television documentary, "Diggers: The Blacks Who Dug the Panama Canal."
        He was a co-author, with George Ford, of a children's book titled "Walk On," illustrated by Mr. Ford, and the author of a biography for young readers, "Richard Allen: Founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States."
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Williamson studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before beginning to paint. After moving to New York City, he was the art director of Viking Press for many years. He also wrote political commentary, with Paul Robeson Jr., for The Amsterdam News.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lisa, of New York City.
