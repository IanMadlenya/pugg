        Lex Hixon, a scholar on the mystic traditions of the world's religions and formerly a host of a radio show on WBAI-FM, died on Nov. 1 at his home in Riverdale in the Bronx. He was 53.
        The cause was cancer, said Cassia Berman, an associate.
        From 1971 to 1984, Dr. Hixon was host of the weekly radio program "In the Spirit," in which he interviewed representatives of the world's religions, among them the Dalai Lama and Mother Teresa.
        Dr. Hixon was born in southern California. He graduated from Yale University, where his studies in comparative religion included the teachings of the Hindu mystic Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa, which influenced Dr. Hixon for the rest of his life.
        He received a Ph.D. in comparative religion at Columbia University in 1976 and lectured at the New School of Social Research.
        Dr. Hixon is survived by his wife of 30 years, Sheila King Hixon; three daughters, Alexandra Ballard of Rye, N.Y., and India and Shanti Hixon, both of Riverdale; a son, Dylan, of Los Angeles; his parents, Alexander and Adelaide Hixon of Pasadena, Calif.; two brothers, Andrew, of Ketchum, Idaho, and Anthony, of Cambridge, Mass., and two grandchildren.
