        Irving S. Kosloff, who established the 76ers in Philadelphia in 1963 and owned the National Basketball Association franchise during its years of greatest success and most abysmal failure, died on Sunday at his home in Merion, Pa. He was 82.
        The cause of death was leukemia, his family said.
        After Philadelphia's first N.B.A. club, the Warriors, moved to San Francisco in the fall of 1962 with its star, Wilt Chamberlain, Mr. Kosloff came to the city's rescue. With a partner, Ike Richman, he bought the Syracuse Nationals, moved them to Philadelphia as the 76ers and acquired Chamberlain in a trade on Jan. 15, 1965.
        During Mr. Kosloff's 13 years as owner, the 76ers made the playoffs nine times and won the championship in 1967 after establishing a season record of 68 victories that lasted until broken by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1971-72. The following season, the 76ers set a record that still stands, for fewest victories, 9.
        Mr. Kosloff, who owned the Roosevelt Paper Company, sold the team for $8 million in 1976 to F. Eugene Dixon, who sold it to its current owner, Harold Katz, in 1980.
        Mr. Kosloff is survived by his wife, Libby; a son, Ted; a daughter, Joyce Cooper; a sister, Leah Boish, and six grandchildren.
