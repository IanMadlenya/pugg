        Solomon L. Siegel, who served as the executive director of Kingsbrook Jewish  Medical Center in Brooklyn during a crucial period of its development, died Nov. 24 at the Manor Care nursing home in Boca Raton, Fla. A former resident of Little Neck, Queens, he was 80.
        He had suffered a series of strokes, his family said.
        Mr. Siegel began his career in hospital administration in 1946 as an office  manager at Kingsbrook's predecessor, the Jewish Sanitarium and Hospital for Chronic Diseases. He became its executive director in 1962 and oversaw its transformation into a teaching hospital affiliated with the State University of  New York Downstate Medical Center.
        Mr. Siegel retired in 1976, but continued his relationship with the hospital  as a consultant for some time.
        He was born in Brooklyn, and received a degree in business administration from Baruch College of City University and a master's degree in business education from Columbia University. During World War II, he served with the Seabees in Hawaii, the Philippines and China.
        Mr. Siegel is survived by his wife of 56 years, Ruth Spievak Siegel; a son, Andrew, of Forest Hills, Queens; a daughter, Harriet Reiter of Highland Park, Ill.; two brothers, Lazarus, of Manhattan, and Jack, of Lawrence, L.I.; a sister, Gertrude Baer of Little Neck, and two granddaughters.
