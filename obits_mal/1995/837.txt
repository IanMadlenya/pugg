        Joseph Hintersteiner, a watercolor painter who promoted the arts in northern  Manhattan, where he lived, died on Sunday at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Paul.
        Mr. Hintersteiner, a native of Austria, devoted much of his life to supporting the cultural, artistic and ethnic diversity of New York. He retired a year ago as executive director of Arts Interaction, the Washington Heights and Inwood Council for the Arts. He was also a board member of that area's Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association.
        He began his artistic career in 1937 at the 92d Street Y, working in oils and stage design. He changed to watercolors while studying at the Art Students League and worked in that medium almost exclusively.
        He joined Arts Interaction in 1979 and was elected executive director 10 years ago. Under his leadership, the organization brought together music, literary, theater, visual arts and dance groups for exhibitions and performances.
        Mr. Hintersteiner is survived by his wife, Marguerite; two sons, Paul, of Manhattan, and Robert, of White Plains, and a daughter, Evelyn Gansfuss of Pittstown, N.J.; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
