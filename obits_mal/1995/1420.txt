        Richard Winfield Quarles, an expert in the use of vinyl resins in coatings and adhesives and a former executive at the Union Carbide Corporation, died on March 16 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, according to the Kimble Funeral Home in Princeton.
        Dr. Quarles was a member of a team of scientists that developed two-part epoxy resin adhesives while on a research fellowship at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh. The adhesives, known to most people as the glues that come in two containers, are activated by mixing two elements.
        He joined the Union Carbide Corporation as a research chemist in the 1930's. He retired in 1976 as the company's director of patents.
        He was born in Richmond, and was a chemical engineering graduate of the University of Virginia. He also received a Ph. D. in physical chemistry from Virginia. He did post-doctoral studies at the University of Michigan.
        Dr. Quarles is survived by three sons, Richard W. Jr., of Parkersburg, W. Va., James D., of Phoenix, and Thomas L., of Wilsonville, Ore.; two daughters, Barbara V. Quarles of Phoenix and Elizabeth Douglas of Amherst, Mass.; a sister, Susan Allison of Alexandria, Va., and four grandchildren.
