        William Vernon Platt, an international insurance-brokerage executive, died last Wednesday at Jupiter Island Hospital in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 79. A former resident of Rye, N.Y., he lived in Hobe Sound and Siaconset, Mass.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family reported.
        Mr. Platt retired in 1975 as president of Marsh & McLennan International, worldwide insurance brokers. But he remained a consultant to its Manhattan-based corporate parent, the Marsh & McLennan Companies, into the late 1980's.
        He grew up in Rye, where his father, Livingston Platt, served as Mayor. He was a fourth-generation Yale University graduate. One of those preceding him at Yale was his great-grandfather, Thomas Collier Platt, who was a United States Senator from New York.
        He was a football star at both Phillips-Andover Academy and Yale. In World War II, he served as a gunnery officer on destroyers and saw action in battles in the Pacific. He was discharged as a lieutenant commander.
        Mr. Platt's wife of 55 years, Yvette Beardsley Platt, died a year ago. He is survived by three daughters, Laurie Shnayerson of Manhattan, Hilary Cole of Hamilton, Mass., and Leslie Huntington of Lyman, N.H.; a brother, Peter, of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Priscilla Hooke of Rochester, and seven grandchildren.
