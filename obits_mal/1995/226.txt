        Robert H. Ganz, an inventor and head of a New Jersey company whose specialized packaging machinery is sold worldwide, died on Tuesday at Hackensack Medical Center. He was 65 and lived in Saddle River, N.J.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ganz was chief executive officer of Ganz Brothers Inc. of Bergenfield, which specializes in surgical-dressing equipment. The company was started as Columbia Machine Works in 1895 by his grandfather Charles Ganz. It changed its name in the 1930's and is marking its 100th anniversary this year.
        Robert Ganz held some 100 United States and international patents related to surgical-dressing and automatic packaging machines. He became the company's chief executive nearly 30 years ago. He was born in Ridgefield, N.J., and started his career with the family concern after graduating in engineering from Fairleigh Dickinson University.
        Mr. Ganz is survived by his wife, Loretta Rothermel Ganz; two sons, Jonathan R., of Dumont, N.J., and Christopher R. H., of Saddle River; a daughter, Lesleigh L. G. Ordway of San Anselmo, Calif., and a grandson.
