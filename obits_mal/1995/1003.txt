        Roland L. Dobrushin, a Russian mathematician who was an expert on probability theory and a foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States, died on Nov. 12 in Moscow, where he taught at Moscow State University. He was 66.
        The British daily The Independent reported his death last week.
        Professor Dobrushin was one of the great figures of the second half of the 20th century in the field of probability theory, said Persi Diaconis, professor  of mathematics at Harvard.
        Probability in mathematics has been defined as assigning a number as a measure of the "chance" that a certain event will happen. Probability theory, as another expert in the field, William Feller, once wrote, "constructs abstract models."
        Professor Diaconis said that Professor Dobrushin "pioneered new techniques for rigorous mathematical analysis of random phenomena" and that his greatest achievement "was giving a rigorous foundation for statistical mechanics," and finding "new patterns completely unexpected by practical workers."
        "He had remarkable technical ability and also a remarkable ability to translate real-world phenomena into rigorous mathematics," Professor Diaconis added in an interview.
        Professor Dobrushin taught at Moscow State University from 1955 to 1965 and again from 1991 until his death and was head of the laboratory at the Institute  for Problems of Information Transmission of what is now the Russian Academy of Sciences for three decades. He was a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other American universities.
        He was born in Leningrad and studied at Moscow University and elsewhere. He was married four times and had five daughters.
