        Avron Douglis, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland who was an expert in partial differential equations, the means by which mathematicians express many fundamental laws of physics and engineering, died on Feb. 15 at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Dr. Marjorie Douglis.
        Born in Tulsa, Okla., he received his undergraduate degree in economics from the University of Chicago in 1938 and a doctorate in mathematics in 1949 from New York University, where he taught for six years.
        In 1956 he went to the University of Maryland, first as a research professor at the Institute for Fluid Dynamics and Applied Mathematics and then as a mathematics professor. He retired in 1988.
        He wrote the book "Ideas in Mathematics" (D. B. Saunders, 1971).
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Dr. Franklin Douglis of Houston; a daughter, Carole of Washington; a sister, Darthea Purvin of Columbia, Md., and two grandchildren.
