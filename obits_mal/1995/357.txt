        Joel David Morgan, an artist manager and concert presenter, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 35 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Candace Flores, a friend.
        Mr. Morgan was born in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., and studied piano at the Manhattan School of Music and with Adele Marcus. After graduation from the Manhattan School in 1986, he became a publicity agent at Jay K. Hoffman & Associates.
        He started his own management firm, Joel Morgan & Associates, in 1989, and specialized in young singers and conductors. He was also the director of the Center for Chamber Music, a concert-presenting organization in Greenwich, Conn.
        He is survived by his companion, Michael Gamberdell; his mother, Louise Morgan of Fort Walton Beach; a sister, Martha Harwin of Perdido Key, Fla., and two brothers, Robert, of Fort Walton Beach, and Timothy, of Pensacola, Fla.
