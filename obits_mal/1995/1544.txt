        William Arnold Scott, who founded organizations aimed at increasing awareness of gay and lesbian concerns in Houston and became a national figure on AIDS issues, died on April 4 at Park Plaza Hospital in Houston. He was 46 and lived in Houston.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said a spokesman for the Texas Board of Health, which oversees programs and policies of the Texas Department of Health. Mr. Scott had been a member of the board since 1988.
        Mr. Scott was a past president of the National Lesbian and Gay Health Foundation. In Houston, he founded counseling services and support groups that aided men with the AIDS virus and was a co-founder of the AIDS Foundation of Houston.
        Mr. Scott was born in Bay Shore, L.I., and received an undergraduate degree from Mercy College and a master's degree in social work from the State University of New York at Albany. He had a private practice as a social worker and psychotherapist in Houston.
        He is survived by his companion, Jose Rodriguez of Houston; his mother, Stella Martha Scott of Haverstraw, N.Y., and three brothers, Almon, of Wilmington, N.Y., Joseph, of Stony Point, N.Y., and Lawrence, of Charlotte, N.C.
