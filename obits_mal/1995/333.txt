        Angus W. McDonald Jr., a specialist in the Communist revolution in China and founder of the Asia Education Center in Minneapolis, died on Monday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 53. The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, said Archibald Spencer, a friend.
        Dr. McDonald graduated from Amherst College in 1965 and earned a doctorate in Chinese history at the University of California at Berkeley.
        Dr. McDonald taught at the University of Minnesota, Stanford University and Macalester College in St. Paul. His illness forced him to stop lecturing last year.
        In the early 1980's he worked for the Control Data Corporation developing programs in Japanese language instruction. He later founded the Asia Education Network to create links between experts on Asian affairs and the business community.
        Dr. McDonald is survived by his wife, Susan Strong McDonald; a son, Angus 3d, of Pittsburgh; two daughters, Elizabeth and Louise McDonald of Minneapolis; his mother, Elizabeth Dandridge McDonald of Lexington, Ky.; two brothers, E. Dandridge, of Charleston, W.Va., and Edward C., of Gatlinburg, Tenn., and a sister, Mary Lloyd McDonald of Bethany, Conn.
