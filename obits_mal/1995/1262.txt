        Edmund W. Adams, senior director of advertising for National Football League publications, died on Monday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. Mr. Adams, who lived in Larchmont, N.Y., was 60.
        He died from injuries suffered in a fall at his home, said his wife, the former Joan Pederson.
        Mr. Adams joined NFL Properties in 1975, and over the years introduced strategies that led to developing N.F.L. publications like Super Bowl magazine and Gameday, a weekly magazine published in the football season and distinguished by inserts customized for each team and distributed to fans in the stadium.
        Mr. Adams was born in the Bronx. He graduated from Fordham University.
        After beginning an advertising career in the 1950's at the J. Walter Thompson agency, Mr. Adams worked for The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Saturday Evening Post and Popular Science.
        Also surviving are a son, William, of Larchmont; two brothers, Lawrence, of New Milford, N.J., and Michael, of Hong Kong, and two sisters, Anne Flynn of Tappan, N.Y., and Maureen Springer of Succasunna, N.J.
