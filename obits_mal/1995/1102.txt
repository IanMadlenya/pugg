        James Bell, a professor of solid mechanics at Johns Hopkins University who did extensive research into how materials undergo change, died on Sunday at his home in Baltimore. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife of 54 years, Perra Bell.
        His scientific investigations included research into how such forces as heat, stress or cold could be used to alter materials permanently. He developed a gauge to measure strain on materials and wrote more than 80 papers based on his research on dynamic plasticity in materials.
        During the 1950's and 1960's, he conducted research for the Johns Hopkins Medical School and worked on the development of a mechanical pump for use during cardiac surgery and a dialysis apparatus.
        A student of music since childhood, he played the oboe with the Hopkins Symphony Orchestra and continued his study at the Peabody Institute. He conducted research on acoustics and wrote on the history of the physics of music for the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians in 1980.
        Born in Melrose, Mass., he graduated from New York University in 1940 and joined the engineering faculty at Johns Hopkins in 1945. He became a professor emeritus in 1979.
        In addition to his wife, the former Perra Somers, he is survived by a daughter, Jane Kiester of Gainesville, Fla.; a sister, Hester Coe of Winter Park, Fla., and three grandchildren. His son, Christopher, was killed in Vietnam in 1969.
