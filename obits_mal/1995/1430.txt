        Hugh Auchincloss Steers, a figurative painter, died on March 1 at the home of his cousin, Hugh D. Auchincloss Jr. He was 32 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his dealer, Richard Anderson.
        Mr. Steers, who was born in Washington and studied at Yale University, painted in a style that mixed dreamlike allegory with Expressionist-tinged realism and incorporated art history references. In the last five years his work had increasingly dealt with AIDS. Many of his paintings showed single male figures, almost nude or in women's clothes, isolated in dark rooms; others depicted pairs of men bathing and dressing each other or embracing.
        In his last works, shown at the Richard Anderson Gallery in the fall, Mr. Steers included a recurrent male figure that he regarded as a self-portrait. Dressed in a white hospital gown and white high heels, the figure entered the lives of other characters as both an avenging and a guardian angel.
        His work is in the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Denver Art Museum.
        He is survived by his mother, Nina Auchincloss Straight, and his stepfather, Michael Straight, both of Washington, and by two brothers, Burr, of Los Angeles, and Ivan, of Manhattan.
