        Sherman Paul, a literary scholar who wrote studies of Emerson, Thoreau, Edmund Wilson and other American writers, died on May 28 at a hospital in Bemidji, Minn. He was 74 and lived on Wolf Lake, near Bemidji.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, said his wife, Jim.
        Mr. Paul was born in Cleveland and graduated from the University of Iowa. After serving in the Army Air Force from 1942 to 1946, he earned a master's degree in English from Harvard University in 1948 and a doctorate in 1950.
        He taught English at Harvard for two years, then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana. From 1967 to 1988, he taught at Iowa, where in 1974 he was named the Carver Distinguished Professor of English.
        Mr. Paul wrote and edited more than 20 books, nearly all exploring an Emersonian tradition he called "the green American tradition." They include "Emerson's Angle of Vision: Man and Nature in American Experience" (1952), "The  Shores of America: Thoreau's Inward Exploration" (1958), "Edmund Wilson: A Study of Literary Vocation in Our Time" (1965) and "Music of Survival: A Biography of  a Poem by William Carlos Williams" (1968). His most recent book was "For Love of the World: Essays on Nature Writers" (1992).
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by four children, Jared Lempert of Berkeley, Calif., Meredith Olsen of Iowa City, Erica, of Lockhart, Tex., and Jeremy, of Fairfield, Iowa; two brothers, Julius, of Fredonia, N.Y., and Louis,  of Beverly Hills, Calif., and two grandchildren.
