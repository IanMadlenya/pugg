        Sir Grahame Clark, an archeologist and authority on prehistoric Europe, died on Tuesday at his home in Cambridge, England. He was 88.
        Sir Grahame was knighted for his work in 1992. He was master of Peterhouse College at Cambridge University from 1973 to 1980; Disney Professor of Archeology at Cambridge from 1952 to 1974, and head of the department of archeology and anthropology there from 1956 to 1961 and from 1968 to 1971.
        In 1990 he received a $120,000 Dutch award, the Erasmus Prize of the Netherlands Foundation, for increasing knowledge of prehistoric Europe through "opening new methods in his field by integrating ecology, anthropology and economics in the classic study of prehistory."
        The Times of London said on Thursday that Sir Grahame, an expert on the Mesolithic period, "helped to develop European archeology away from a preoccupation with stone-tool typology and toward a broader understanding of how early societies exploited their environment."
        The Mesolithic period, or Middle Stone Age, began when the last glacial period ended more than 10,000 years ago. In Europe, Mesolithic cultures lived on almost until 3,000 B.C.
        Sir Grahame's books ranged from "The Mesolithic Settlement of Northern Europe" (1936) to "Aspects of Prehistory" (California, 1970), "Symbols of Excellence: Precious Materials as Expressions of Status" (Cambridge, 1986), "Economic Prehistory" (Cambridge, 1989) and "Space, Time and Man: A Prehistorian's View" (1992).
        Sir Grahame, born in the county of Kent, received a doctorate and two other degrees at Cambridge.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Gwladys Maude White; a son, Philip, of Trumpington, and six grandchildren.
