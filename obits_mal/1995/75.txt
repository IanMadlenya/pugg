        Ray McKinley, a big-band drummer, singer and band leader famous for his work with the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra and the Glenn Miller Orchestra, died on Sunday in Largo, Fla. He was 84.
        Mr. McKinley began his professional career at the age of 9 with various bands in the Fort Worth area. He left home when he was 15 and played with Milt Shaw's Detroiters and the Smith Ballew and Duncan-Marin bands. His first substantial professional engagement came in 1934 with the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra. A year later, the band split up, and Mr. McKinley stayed with Jimmy Dorsey, leaving in 1939 to work with the band leader Will Bradley.
        Together, he and Mr. Bradley produced a series of hits that often used a boogie-woogie beat. "Beat Me Daddy Eight to the Bar" was a hit in 1940, as were "Celery Stalks at Midnight," "Scrub Me Mama" and "Down the Road a Piece."
        In 1942 Mr. McKinley was part of an Army Air Forces band led by Glenn Miller. He joined a small band from the orchestra, including Mel Powell, Peanuts Hucko and Trigger Alpert, and after Mr. Miller's death in 1944, Mr. McKinley took over the band.
        After the war, Mr. McKinley joined forces with the arranger Eddie Sauter and formed a musically adventurous band that lasted until 1950. He then worked as a freelance singer. In 1956 the Glenn Miller estate asked him to head the New Glenn Miller Orchestra, and he spent the next decade leading that band and touring around the world.
        From 1973 to 1978, he led another band playing Miller's music. He was also a consultant to Disney World in Florida and did other freelance work, often leading small bands.
        He is survived by his wife, Gretchen Haveman of Largo, and a daughter, Jawn McKinley of Minneapolis.
