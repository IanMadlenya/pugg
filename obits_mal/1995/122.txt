        Christopher Chadman, a Broadway choreographer and dancer, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 47 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Gilbert Parker of the William Morris Agency.
        Mr. Chadman was born in New York City and trained at the High School of Performing Arts. He made his Broadway debut in 1968, dancing in "Darling of the Day." In 1976, Mr. Chadman played Rosencrantz in Cliff Jones's "Rockabye Hamlet," directed by Gower Champion, and then took over the title role in a revival of "Pal Joey" at Circle in the Square when Edward Villella, for whom he was the understudy, quit the show during previews.
        He assisted Bob Fosse on the musicals "Pippin" (1972) and "Chicago" (1975), and worked with him again on the 1986 musical "Big Deal." Mr. Fosse encouraged him to try choreography, and Mr. Chadman was credited for the "Yankee Doodle Dandy" number in "Dancin' " (1978), in which he performed and was the dance captain. The next year, he choreographed and directed "Dancing in the Dark," a cabaret revue built around the songs of Arthur Schwartz, at the Manhattan Theater Club. He choreographed the 1983 Broadway musical "Merlin," with Billy Wilson.
        Mr. Chadman's greatest success came in 1992 with his choreography for the Broadway revival of "Guys and Dolls." His work on the show was nominated for Tony, Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards, and won the Fred Astaire Award. In his review of the revival in The New York Times, Frank Rich credited Mr. Chadman with helping to "give the audience a fantasy Broadway."
        Mr. Chadman also worked in touring and regional theater productions. He designed choreography for Peter Allen and the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and staged two Michael Feinstein shows on Broadway, "Piano and Voice" and "Isn't It Romantic."
        He is survived by his parents, Gertrude and Sidney Brown, and a brother, Dr. Harvey Brown, all of Los Angeles.
