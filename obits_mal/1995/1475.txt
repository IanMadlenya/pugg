        Gustavo Correa, a scholar of Spanish poetry and a professor emeritus at Yale University, died on Feb. 18 in Bogota, Colombia. He was 80.
        The cause of death was cancer, the family said.
        Professor Correa returned to Colombia, his native country, three years ago after living in Washington and Hamden, Conn., for a number of years.
        He was the author of scores of articles on Spanish writers and was the author of several books, including an anthology of Spanish poetry.
        Before joining Yale in 1960, he taught at Williams College, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Oregon, Tulane University, the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his wife, Ines; two daughters, Amanda and Patricia; a son, Albert, and four grandchildren.
