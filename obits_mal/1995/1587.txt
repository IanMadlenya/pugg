        The Rev. Dr. William J. Villaume, a Lutheran minister who pursued prominent parallel careers as pastor, educator and national religious administrator, died last Monday at his home in Corpus Christi, Tex. He was 80.
        The cause was emphysema, his family said.
        In a life that took him from a troubled childhood in Brooklyn to the highest councils of Protestantism in the United States, Dr. Villaume was a pastor of three churches, served as president of three colleges and headed two major departments of the National Council of Churches in New York. In the 1950's, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asked him to deliver an inaugural prayer and made him a Federal adviser on child welfare, the elderly, housing and education.
        Dr. Villaume was born in Brooklyn and abandoned as a child. He graduated from Wagner College on Staten Island, began his ministry at St. Peter's in Manhattan and later served as pastor of churches in Middletown, N.Y., Fitchburg, Mass., and Rindge, N.H. He was also president of Lutheran colleges in Ontario and the Bahamas and of Pierce College in Athens.
        He is survived by his wife, Arlette; two sons, William, of Auburn, Ala., and James, of Corpus Christi; two daughters, Jean Elizabeth Aldridge of Leawood, Kan., and Nancy Lynne Tieeszen of Sioux Falls, S.D.; nine grandchildren, and two brothers, Louis, of Lake Charles, La., and Jacques, of Baton Rouge.
