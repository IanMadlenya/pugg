        G. Prescott Low, publisher of The Patriot Ledger in Quincy for 38 years and an advocate of local ownership of newspapers, died on Thursday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 82.
        Mr. Low was the third generation of his family to own and manage the evening  newspaper. His son, K. Prescott Low, is now the publisher.
        Mr. Low became publisher in 1935, and stepped down from day-to-day operations in 1973, although he remained a member of the company's board. During his years as publisher, circulation grew to 72,000 from 9,000 as the paper reached two dozen communities south and west of Boston.
        "To me, the newspaper was a responsibility, a public trust," Mr. Low said recently. "I think the whole thing that's wrong with chain newspapers is that there is no sense of public trust."
        In addition to his son, survivors include his wife, Felice; two daughters, Loring Low Stevens of Cambridge, Mass., and Meredith Low Emmons of Hanover, Mass.; five grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
