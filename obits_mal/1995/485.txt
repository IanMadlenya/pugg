        Nathaniel M. Gerstenzang, a former assistant foreign editor of The New York Times, died yesterday at Evanston Hospital in Illinois. He was 87 and had moved to Wilmette, Ill., in November from Maplewood, N.J.
        During his tenure, Mr. Gerstenzang helped oversee foreign coverage of two Middle East wars, most of the Vietnam War, the 1956 Hungarian uprising and Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev's tour of the United States in 1959, a first for a Soviet leader.
        Khrushchev touched down in Disneyland and Coon Rapids, Iowa, generating reams of copy at every turn. For channeling the flow, Mr. Gerst enzang won a Polk Memorial Award.
        Mr. Gerstenzang started at The Times as a copy editor in the sports department in 1934, became an assistant to the foreign editor in 1948 and the assistant foreign editor in 1954. He retired in 1970.
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from New York University and its law school. While working his way through law school he covered sports for The Evening Post.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Miriam; a daughter, Nina Chaitin of Glencoe, Ill.; a son, James of Bethesda, Md.; six grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
