        F. W. Elliot Farr, a financial analyst and investment adviser in Philadelphia for more than 60 years, died at his home in Gladwyne, Pa., on Sunday. He was 85.
        The cause was leukemia, said his daughter Martha F. Kent of Essex, Vt.
        Mr. Farr began his investment career in 1933 in investment research at the Girard Trust Company. After 35 years with the firm, rising to senior vice president of investment research and policy, he took an early retirement in 1968 to become a general partner of W. H. Newbold's Son & Company, a brokerage.
        In 1990, he left to help found Radnor Capital Management, an investment counseling firm for which he served as managing director, the job he held at the time of his death.
        Mr. Farr was an expert in cash-flow analysis and was long a proponent of value investing, in which he looked for stocks trading for relatively little money compared with their assets or earnings.
        Mr. Farr was born in Philadelphia and educated at Haverford College. He received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.
        In addition to Mrs. Kent, he is survived by his wife, the former Anne Hinchman; two other daughters, Lucretia Denny of Cornwall, England, and Caroline W. Farr of Wallingford, Pa.; a brother, James of Towanda, Pa.; a sister, Lady Foot of Devon, England, and four grandchildren.
