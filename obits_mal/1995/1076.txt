        Judge Murray Mogel, an acting State Supreme Court justice sitting in Manhattan, died at his apartment on the Upper East Side on Dec. 8. He was 68.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said. Judge Mogel, whose term would have expired at the end of 1998, took disability retirement in October because of ill health.
        He was born in Brooklyn, and graduated from the University of Chicago. He received his law degree from Columbia University School of Law in 1960. He was in private practice in New York before joining the Legal Aid Society and becoming chief of its Federal Defenders Unit in the Southern District of New York.
        Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed him to a 10-year term as a judge of the Criminal Court in 1978, and he was reappointed in 1988. He was named an acting Supreme Court justice in 1986.
        Judge Mogel is survived by his mother, Bertha Mogel, and a brother, Lee, both of Manhattan.
