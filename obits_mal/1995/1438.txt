        Dr. Joseph Post, who developed the first successful nutrition-based treatment for liver disease, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Dr. Post, a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine, conducted his investigations at the N.Y.U. Research Service at Goldwater Memorial Hospital from 1946 to 1985. His studies revealed the connections between alcohol, protein deficiency and liver ailments.
        He also advanced knowledge about the growth of cancer cells. His research found that such cells develop slowly in the human breast but faster in bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract. His interests took in the physiology and pathology of the liver, nutrition and metabolism, tumor cell replication and radiation biology.
        Robert Sklarew, professor of medicine at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., said, "His work had a major impact on the selection and planning of chemotherapy."
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from City College. Dr. Post received his medical degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate in medical science from Columbia University. He was an officer in the Army Medical Corps in World War II.
        He was an instructor at Columbia before he joined the faculty at N.Y.U. in 1946. He advanced to full professor in 1971 and reached emeritus status four years ago.
        He also was in private practice for 42 years and worked as an attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital and University Hospital.
        Dr. Post is survived by his wife of 53 years, Anne Bretzfelder Post; two sons, David, of Newton Centre, Mass., and Thomas, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
