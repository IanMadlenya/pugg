        John Wieland Oswald, who as president of Pennsylvania State University from 1970 to 1983 was an early advocate for the university's entrance into the Big Ten Conference, died on Wednesday in his home in Philadelphia. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said a daughter, Elizabeth Browne, of Philadelphia.
        As the 13th president of the 138-year-old university, Dr. Oswald said Penn State would benefit academically from an association with like-minded institutions that dominated the list of major public research universities in the country. The university joined the Big Ten in 1989.
        In 1993, Penn State spent $283 million on research, which put it 13th on the list of major research universities.
        Dr. Oswald's term as president began as campuses across the nation entered the final stages of unrest over the Vietnam War. He guided the university through that time and through the financial constraints caused by the economic downturn of the 1970's.
        A native of Minneapolis, he received his undergraduate degree from DePauw University in 1938 and a doctorate in plant pathology from the University of California in 1942. He began teaching at the University of California at Davis in 1946, and by 1962, he was a university vice president. In 1963, he became president of the University of Kentucky, where he served until his appointment to Penn State.
        In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, he is survived by his wife, Rose; a son, John Jr., of Minneapolis; a second daughter, Nancy, of San Francisco, and four grandchildren.
