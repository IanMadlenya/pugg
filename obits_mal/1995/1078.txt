        Dr. Sheldon Green, a theoretical chemist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was 51 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was a heart attack, said the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a NASA laboratory in Morningside Heights where he worked.
        Dr. Green, who received a Ph.D. in theoretical chemistry from Harvard University in 1971, was an authority on the properties of molecules in outer space, a rare interstellar phenomenon. He contributed more than 100 papers to scientific journals and provided the theoretical models that enabled radio astronomers to recognize such molecules in their observations.
        Dr. Green is survived by his parents, Bernard and Florence Green of Silver Spring, Md.; two sisters, Joanne Wolinsky of Laurel, Md., and Bonnie Grabelle of Columbia, Md., and his companion, Bruce Haas.
