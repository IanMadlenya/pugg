        Joseph L. Czarnecki, who transformed Joe's, a workingman's tavern in the industrial town of Reading, Pa., into a world mecca of mushroom cookery, died on Saturday at Reading Hospital. He was 84.
        The cause was complications from prostate cancer, his family said.
        Joe's was opened in 1916 by Mr. Czarnecki's parents, Joseph and Magdalena, two Polish immigrants. Its specialty was cream of mushroom soup made from wild mushrooms gathered in the forests surrounding Reading. Mr. Czarnecki (pronounced CHAR-nick-ee), who learned about mushrooms from his parents, took over the tavern in 1947. Gradually it evolved into a restaurant specializing in  dishes incorporating the wild morels, cepes, chanterelles and other mushrooms that Mr. Czarnecki collected from the piney woods nearby. Mr. Czarnecki developed many of the recipes, including his specialty, a version of beef Wellington using wild mushroom duxelles rather than liver pate.
        After an article about the restaurant appeared in Gourmet magazine in the early 1960's, food lovers from all over the world began making the trek to Joe's. Mr. Czarnecki ran the restaurant until 1979, when his son Jack took over. Jack Czarnecki still runs the restaurant and is a cookbook author; his brother,  Joseph, lives in Poland and is a journalist and author.
        Mr. Czarnecki was also an accomplished photographer, specializing in pictures of mushrooms, and he was considered an authority on the identification of edible and poisonous mushrooms.
        He is survived by his wife, Wanda Soltys Czarnecki, of Reading; his two sons, and five grandchildren.
