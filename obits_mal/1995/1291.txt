        George Minturn Worden, a former public relations executive, died on Wednesday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. A resident of the Georgetown section, he was 73.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Worden attended Columbia University and began his career working in New York for John Hill, founder of Hill & Knowlton Inc. He retired in 1986 as a senior vice president in the public relations firm's Washington office.
        He was an associate director of the National Press Foundation and took part in national politics. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, he was a public-affairs officer of the National Democratic Committee.
        He was a longtime chairman of the National Press Club's public-relations committee and lectured on public relations at George Washington University, and American University, among others. A student of the Civil War era, he contributed articles on the subject to The Washington Post and other publications.
        He opened his own firm in Washington in 1958, which later became part of Palmer, Willson & Worden, a firm based in New York. He returned to Hill & Knowlton in 1970 and remained a senior consultant for several years after his retirement.
        Mr. Worden is survived by his wife of 36 years, Joan Marziotti Worden; a son from a previous marriage, Robert, of Teaneck, N.J.; two daughters, Amy, of Washington, and Andrea, of Palo Alto, Calif., and two grandsons.
