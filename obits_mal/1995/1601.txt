        Sir William Hayter, who as Britain's Ambassador to the Soviet Union played a role in Nikita S. Khrushchev's groundbreaking visit to Britain in 1956, died on March 28 in Stanton St. John, England, where he lived. He was 88.
        The Times of London reported last Thursday that it was Sir William who suggested that the British Government invite Mr. Khrushchev, the head of the Soviet Communist Party, and Nikolai A. Bulganin, the Soviet Prime Minister, to make the visit.
        Its results were mixed. Talks with the Government of Sir Anthony Eden were generally amicable, but Mr. Khrushchev declared that if the West used force in the Middle East, the Soviet Union would do so, too.
        Later an American authority on the Soviet Union, David J. Dallin, wrote, "the Soviet Union emerged from these talks a recognized Middle East power."
        Sir William was Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1957 and warden of Oxford University's New College from 1958 to 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Iris, and a daughter.
