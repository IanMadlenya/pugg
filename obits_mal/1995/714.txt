        Vernal (Nippy) Jones, whose last time at bat in an otherwise undistinguished  major league career resulted in a memorable shoe-polish incident that helped the Milwaukee Braves win a World Series game in 1957, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home here. He was 70.
        Jones, a first baseman who also played for the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies over parts of eight seasons, was leading off the Milwaukee 10th inning as a pinch-hitter in Game 4 with the Yankees ahead by 5-4 when a pitch from Tommy Byrne struck his left foot.
        Umpire Augie Donatelli at first called the pitch a ball and Jones was ordered to continue batting. But after Jones showed Donatelli that the ball had  a smudge of shoe polish on it, Jones was allowed to take first base. That ignited a rally that ended when Eddie Mathews hit a home run to lift Milwaukee to a 7-5 victory and a 2-2 tie in a Series they eventually won in seven games.
        Jones, who later worked in public relations and the title-insurance businesses in Sacramento and became a professional fishing guide, is survived by his wife of 49 years, Nora, four children and six grandchildren.
