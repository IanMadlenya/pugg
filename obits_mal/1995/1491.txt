        James H. Luther Jr., a former senior vice president and general counsel for Sterling Drug Inc. and the former head of a trade organization for manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs, died Thursday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a type of cancer known as small-cell lymphoma, his family said.
        Mr. Luther joined Sterling Drug in 1955, after working for the law firm of Donovan Leisure Newton and Irvine in Manhattan for four years. He was appointed vice president of legal affairs of Sterling's Glenbrook Laboratories Division in Glenbrook, Conn., in 1964 and then made vice president and associate counsel of Sterling four years later.
        In 1976, he became general counsel of the company and in 1978 a senior vice president.
        He retired in 1988, six months after Sterling was acquired by the Eastman Kodak Company.
        Throughout his career, he was active in his industry's trade organizations, serving as chairman from 1985 to 1987 of the Proprietary Association, a Washington-based group that represented over-the-counter manufacturers.
        He was also active on the law committee of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.
        Mr. Luther was raised in West New York, N.J., and was educated at Fordham College and at Fordham Law School, where he received his degree in 1951.
        He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a son, David, of Manhattan; a daughter, Stephanie Luther Brandley of Summit, N.J.; a brother, William A. Luther of Glenside, Pa., and two grandchildren.
