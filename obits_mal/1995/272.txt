        William W. Ambler, the former director of admissions at Haverford College in Haverford, Pa., died on Tuesday at his home in Kennett Square, Pa. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, a press release from the college said.  Mr. Ambler had served on the admissions staff at the college for 30 years, retiring in 1987.
        Born in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., Mr. Ambler enrolled at Haverford in 1941. A Quaker, he left two years later to join the Civilian Public Service during World War II. He returned to Haverford to earn his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1949.
        In 1952, he became assistant director of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked until joining the Haverford admissions staff in 1956.
        Mr. Ambler is survived by his wife, Barbara.
