        Roberto De Lamonica, an artist and teacher of graphics at the Art Students League for nearly 30 years, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was emphysema, said Lawrence Campbell, archivist of the Art Students League.
        Mr. De Lamonica was born in 1933 in Ponta Pora, Brazil, and studied art in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In 1965 he earned a Guggenheim Fellowship for work and travel in the United States, and he settled in New York City in 1967. He worked in a figurative style influenced by Surrealism and Abstract Expressionism, and had one-man shows at the Pan-American Union in Washington, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Columbia Museum in Columbia, S.C. He also taught graphics at the New School for Social Research and in the early 1980's spent two years at the Sydney College of Art in Australia creating a new graphics department for the school.
        Mr. De Lamonica won several prizes for his prints, which are represented in many public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum, New York City, and the Walker Art Center.
        No immediate family members survive.
