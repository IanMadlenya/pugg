        Harold Fieldsteel, formerly a top financial strategist for the Seagram Company, died last Saturday at Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 72 and lived in Garden City, L.I.
        The cause of death was cancer, a spokesman for the company said.
        Mr. Fieldsteel worked in New York for Seagram, the Montreal-based distilled-spirits and wine giant, for 42 years, ultimately becoming executive vice president of finance and administration before his retirement in 1983.
        In that post, he was responsible for negotiating asset sales and acquisitions, including the 1980 sale of the Texas Pacific Oil Company to the Sun Company for $2.3 billion.
        Soon after that sale, Seagram tried to buy Conoco, then the nation's ninth-largest oil company, but lost out to a bid by E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. Seagram's response, in which Mr. Fieldsteel played a central role, was to parlay 27.9 million shares that the company had accumulated in Conoco into a 20 percent interest in Du Pont.
        Mr. Fieldsteel began his career in 1941 as an auditor at Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, the United States branch office of the Seagram Company. A year later he graduated from the School of Business and Public Administration at the City College of New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Lorena; a daughter, Laura Behar of Garden City; a son, Robert Fieldsteel of Greenwich, Conn., and two grandchildren.
