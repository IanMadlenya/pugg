        Masahiro Tomonaga, who owned and operated restaurants in New York and Tokyo, died on Sunday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 63 and also had homes in Roxbury, Conn., and Tokyo.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his companion, Clint Wade.
        Born in Nagasaki, Mr. Tomonaga attended business school in Tokyo and was in the restaurant business for more than three decades.
        In Tokyo, he owned and operated the Polo Lounge and the Regent. In Manhattan, he opened the Regent of Tokyo in 1971 and Regent East in 1974, both Japanese restaurants that have since closed.
        In addition to Mr. Wade, Mr. Tomonaga is survived by two sisters, Kimie and Yukie Tanaka of Tokyo.
