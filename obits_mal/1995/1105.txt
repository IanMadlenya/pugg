        Sidney Slon, a radio scriptwriter who wrote "The Shadow" and "Dick Tracy" shows in the 1940's, died on Saturday morning at a nursing home in Ramapo, N.Y. He was 84 years old and lived most of his life in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure after suffering from Alzheimer's disease for five years, his family said.
        Mr. Slon, who was born in Chicago, attended Northwestern University and later studied acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. In 1933, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career and encountered some success on radio. Among his many roles, he was an announcer for Xavier Cugat's music show and played Dr. Romaine in the comedy show "The Goldbergs."
        His writing career took off in 1938 when he became the writer of "The Shadow," a popular drama with Orson Welles. In the 1950's, he produced and wrote for some of the earliest television series, including "Big Town" and "Sergeant Preston of the Yukon."
        In the 1960's, Mr. Slon left the entertainment business and went to work for a family enterprise, A. G. MacInnis Contracting, the company that provided granite for the Verazzano-Narrows Bridge and many other New York City landmarks.
        He is survived by his second wife, Jean MacInnis Slon, whom he married in 1947; their three children, Steven, of Allentown, Pa., Jonathan and Alison, both of New York City; a brother, Lawrence, of Richmond; two children from his first marriage to Betsy Shannon Martin, Shannon Simon of New York and Terrie Heekin of Dublin, Ohio, and five grandchildren.
