        Joseph M. Sugar, a movie executive who developed new techniques of film distribution, died at his home in Palm Springs, Calif., last Saturday. He was 73.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, a business associate said.
        Mr. Sugar was born in New York City and attended New York University. He started his movie career in 1938 at Republic Pictures, a movie distribution company, and after serving in the Army Air Forces he joined Eagle Lion, which distributed classic English movies.
        As vice president for domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox from 1962 to 1967, Mr. Sugar popularized the sale of reserved seats to movies, which was known as the "road show" technique. The distribution method had been used for some small movies, but Mr. Sugar established it as a pattern for major studios with the successful road show release of "The Sound of Music." He used the same technique for the distribution of "Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines," "The Agony and the Ecstasy," "Patton" and "Hello Dolly."
        "Joe helped revolutionize the distribution of movies in the 1960's and 1970's," said Richard Zanuck, head of the Zanuck Company and former head of production at 20th Century Fox. "With a system of asking audiences to buy reserved seats well in advance of a performance, he created the concept of an event."
        In 1968, Mr. Sugar became president of the Cinerama Releasing Corporation, and distributed films that included "Charly," "Willard" and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" He joined Embassy Pictures in 1983 and formed his own distribution company in 1986.
        Mr. Sugar's wife, Sarah, died several years ago. He is survived by a brother, Richard, of Manhattan; a son, Steven, also of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
