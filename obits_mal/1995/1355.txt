        Eric Q. Bohlin, who was president of Eberhard Faber Inc., a maker of pencils, died on Jan. 24 at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Palm Harbor, Fla.
        The cause was complications of pulmonary and heart disease, said his son, Peter, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Bohlin led Eberhard Faber from 1963 until his retirement in 1972. The company was acquired in 1987 by the Faber Castell Corporation of Parsippany, N.J.
