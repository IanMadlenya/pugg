        Henry O. Selz, who spent his life providing food, medicine and other help to international refugees from war, famine or poverty, died on Oct. 10 when a car he was driving struck a pole on a highway near his home in Fairhaven, Mass. He was 72 and also had homes in India and Cyprus.
        The police in Fairhaven speculated that Mr. Selz might have been blinded by the setting sun. They said on Saturday that an autopsy had been unable to determine whether he had suffered a heart attack while driving. The accident also killed a passenger in his car, Euphemia Connal, a friend who had been visiting him from Cyprus.
        A nephew, Christopher Selz of Palantine, Ill., said notice of his uncle's death had been delayed, pending the completion of arrangements for a memorial service in New Bedford, Mass., on Nov. 4.
        A Quaker, Mr. Selz turned his religious principles into a career as a professional relief administrator, primarily in the developing world. He worked at various times with CARE, as director of operations in Guatemala, Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Kenya, Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka; with the United States Foreign Aid Program in Afghanistan and Pakistan; with the American Friends Service Committee in India; with American Near East Refugee Aid on the West Bank, and, more recently, with British and American Quaker agencies in Iraqi Kurdistan.
        Mr. Selz, who was born in Evanston, Ill., attended Northwestern University, but he left college during World War II to work as a volunteer ambulance driver with the American Field Service in North Africa. Later, he aided wartime relief efforts in Italy, France and Pakistan.
        After graduating from Harvard in 1948, he began his career by assisting refugees during the partition of India and Pakistan.
        Mr. Selz, whose Indian-born wife, Swarn, died many years ago, leaves no immediate survivors.
