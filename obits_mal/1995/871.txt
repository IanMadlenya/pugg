        Jeffrey Schaire, a former editor in chief of Art and Antiques magazine, died  on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 41.
        The cause was AIDS, said his sister, Paula.
        Mr. Schaire was born in Fresh Meadows, Queens. He graduated from the State University College at Binghamton and earned a master's degree in English literature from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. After working at Farrar, Straus & Giroux and at Harper's magazine, he joined Art and Antiques in 1983, and became editor in chief in 1987.
        Under his guidance, the magazine invited M. F. K. Fisher, D. M. Thomas, John  Updike, Pete Hamill and others to write on art, and broke the story of Andrew Wyeth's unknown "Helga" paintings. After resigning in 1992, Mr. Schaire served briefly as editor of Body Positive, a magazine for those infected with the H.I.V. virus.
        In addition to his sister, of San Francisco and Manhattan, he is survived by  a brother, Scott, of Atlanta.
