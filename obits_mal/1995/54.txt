        J. Kennard Bosee, a former president of The New Yorker, died yesterday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan and Nantucket, Mass.
        Mr. Bosee worked at The New Yorker for 37 years. He joined the magazine in 1948 as assistant director of market research. He became the treasurer and chief financial officer in 1966, a member of the board of directors in 1968 and the president in 1984.
        His tenure as president was overshadowed by a fierce battle waged by the Newhouse family for ownership of the magazine. Mr. Bosee retired after a year, at the age of 65, just after the magazine was acquired by Advance Publications, the Newhouse publishing company.
        Mr. Bosee was also the chairman and chief executive of Boulder Enterprise, a subscription-fulfillment company owned by The New Yorker, and he was a director of the Publishers Information Bureau, a magazine industry trade group, for 18 years.
        Mr. Bosee graduated from Yale University in 1941.
        Survivors include his wife, Claire Couch Bosee; two sons, John Kennard Bosee 4th of Darien, Conn., and Thompson Torrey Bosee of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Barbara Bosee Seelaus of Ridgefield, Conn.; two stepchildren, Michael Wesley Havran of Woodenville, Wash., and Catherine Havran Hojnicki of East Greenwich, R.I., and two granddchildren.
