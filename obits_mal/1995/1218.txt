        Max Schnapp, a labor activist turned advocate of pets and their owners, died on Jan. 10 at Interfaith Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 90 and lived in Brighton Beach.
        He had a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Schnapp founded and was president of the Pet Owners Protective Association. For many years, he was a highly visible, vociferous presence at hearings and meetings about no-pets clauses in leases, rules on owners' having to clean up after their dogs, and the like.
        He was born in Austro-Hungary, where he committed himself to political and social causes as a member of the Socialist Party. He came to the United States in 1923 and worked as a knitting-machine mechanic.
        In the 1930's, he led strikes and organized factory workers for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. He also belonged to the International Workers Order and taught unemployed tenants during the Depression how to organize against evictions and homelessness.
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Schnapp said, he found that unions had grown too bureaucratic and corrupt for his taste. He shopped around for another cause and decided on animals.
        He joined the Sierra Club to save endangered species. He fought for humane kosher slaughter. Eventually, he became involved in just about every aspect of what he called the "humane movement."
        He founded his association -- known as POPA -- in 1970. He lobbied for a law that barred the eviction of elderly tenants with pets from rent-controlled apartments and for an end to the sale of shelter animals for research. He also helped to persuade department stores to drop plans for selling dog-skin coats imported from South Africa.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Paulette Asche Schnapp; a daughter, Charlotte Klein of Mamaroneck, N.Y., three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His first wife, Sarah Felsenfeld Schnapp, died in 1936.
