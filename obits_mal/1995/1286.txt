        Noel Rockmore, a painter who specialized in pictures of New Orleans jazz musicians, died on Sunday at St. Jude Medical Center in Kenner, La., a suburb of New Orleans. He was 66 and lived in the French Quarter.
        A spokesman for the hospital would not give the cause of death.
        In addition to making hundreds of paintings and portraits of Preservation Hall jazz musicians, he also painted the city's shipyards, its annual Carnival and its street people, exhibiting his work in galleries and museums in both New York City and New Orleans. His work is represented in the New Orleans Museum of Art.
        He is survived by a son, Christopher Davis of Brooklyn; two daughters, Robin Kelly of Sacramento, Calif., and Emily Davis of Sante Fe, N.M., and a sister, Deborah Davis of San Leandro, Calif.
