        Judge Hubert Louis Will, who sat on the bench of Federal District Court in Chicago for 34 years, died on Saturday at his vacation home in Oconomowoc, Wis.  He was 81 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was cancer, said Kevin Feldis, his law clerk at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
        Judge Will was appointed by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. He grew more  selective about his docket when he took senior status in 1979 but continued to hear cases until a few months ago.
        He was born in Milwaukee and graduated from the University of Chicago and its law school. Before his appointment to the district court, he was a partner in the Chicago firm Nelson, Boodell & Will.
        Judge Will is survived by his wife, Jane; two daughters, Nikki H. Stein and Ami Louise Allen, both of the Chicago area; seven grandchildren and two stepgrandchildren.
