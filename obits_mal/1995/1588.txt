        Leonard Seidenman, a leader in the Jewish refugee movement for nearly four decades, died on April 20 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80 and a resident of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Nina Seidenman of Milton, Mass.
        Mr. Seidenman, who had a prominent role in the 1980's resettlement of thousands of Soviet Jews, began his career working with American Jewish organizations in 1947, helping to resettle refugees from Europe. He then served in the Italian Office of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, overseeing relief efforts in that country.
        He joined the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in 1967 as director of European and North African operations.
        From 1981 to 1984 he was executive vice president, leading efforts to find homes for Jews fleeing the Soviet Union.
        He is survived by his daughter.
