        Eugene V. Panagopulos, a former shipowner and naval architect, died on March 17 at a nursing home in Montreal. A former resident of Larchmont, N.Y., and Athens, he was 78.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Panagopulos was born in Greece and came to the United States after World War II as a consulting naval architect and marine surveyor. He went into the shipping business in Manhattan in 1952, when he bought his first vessel. Over the years, he owned more than 30 freighters.
        He was a marine engineering graduate of Athens Polytechnic University. He received a master's degree from the University of Newcastle, in England.
        Mr. Panagopulos is survived by his wife of 40 years, Mary Salamis Panagopulos; two sons, Demetrios, of Honolulu, and Basil, of Cos Cob, Conn.; two daughters, Nan M. Corbin of New Fairfield, Conn., and Eugenia Zamkinos of Westport, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
