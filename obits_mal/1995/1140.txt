        Ralph W. Nicholson, a former advertising executive and senior assistant postmaster general of the United States, died on Jan. 1 in his home in Marshall, Va. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, said Matthew B. Coffey of Washington, a friend and former colleague
        In 1961, President John F. Kennedy put Mr. Nicholson in charge of installations and logistics for the Post Office Department, and he later took over responsibilities for finance. He served there through the Johnson Administration. In 1969 he was named vice president and treasurer of the Corporation of Public Broadcasting.
        Two years after the Postal Reorganization Act in 1970, he returned to the renamed Postal Service and oversaw the financial operations until 1975. Upon retirement, he served as a director of Conrail from 1976 to 1981.
        Mr. Nicholson went to Washington after a career in advertising. In 1950 he was named a vice president of Fuller & Smith & Ross Inc., after starting out as a copywriter four years earlier. In 1954, he became head of its New York office.
        Born in Chicago, he graduated from the University of Chicago. He later worked in the advertising department of General Electric and in public relations for his alma mater.
        Mr. Nicholson is survived by his wife of 52 years, Rosemary Kleutgen Nichols, of Marshall, and a brother, Edward, of Sarasota, Fla.
