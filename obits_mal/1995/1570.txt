        Samuel Herbert Herman, a xylophonist and longtime staff musician for NBC radio and television, died on Sunday at the Baptist Home at Brookmeade in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 91 and lived in Fishkill, N.Y.
        The cause was heart failure, said his niece, Ellen Wolf of Fairfield, Conn.
        Mr. Herman, known as Sammy, was one of the most sought-after xylophonists in the music business. He was hired by NBC Studios in 1928 as its first xylophonist, playing on numerous shows, including "The Lucky Strike Orchestra," "Hit Parade," "The Shell Chateau Hour," "Manhattan Merry-Go-Round," "The American Melody Hour," "Concentration" and his own show, "The Herman and Banta Show," with Frank Banta. He stayed with NBC until his retirement in 1966.
        He was born in Bronxwood Park, N.Y., and began studying music when he was 8. Over the years he played with George Gershwin, the Dorsey Brothers, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra and many other well-known performers. He was a member of the American Federation of Musicians for almost 70 years. In 1994 he was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie; two stepdaughters, Anne Dougherty of Florida and Carol DeMetro of Highland, N.Y.; a stepson, William Reagan of Amsterdam, N.Y.; one grandchild, and three great-grandchildren.
