        Jerry Franklin Daniels, a member of the original Ink Spots, died on Tuesday.  He was 79.
        Mr. Daniels was a tenor and guitar player when the group began singing on Indianapolis street corners in 1931.  Originally called King Jack and the Jesters, the group changed its name to the Ink Spots in 1932, and first recorded on the Victor label in 1935, without much success.
        Mr. Daniels left the group in 1936, and was replaced by the tenor Bill Kenny, whose high notes helped propel the group to stardom in 1939, when it signed with Decca Records and switched from jive to ballads.
        The band's first big hit was "If I Didn't Care," released in 1939.
        Mr. Daniels became a state excise officer and retired in 1981.
