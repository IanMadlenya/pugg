        Theodore R. Bowie, professor emeritus of art history at Indiana University, died on Sunday at his home in Bloomington, Ind. He was 90.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, the former Marilyn Miller, of Bloomington and Manhattan.
        Professor Bowie, who turned to art history and particularly to Asian art after beginning his academic career in French literature, played an important role in the development of the art history program and the University Art Museum at Indiana.
        Widely traveled in Asia, he searched out acquisitions for the museum and material for the many exhibitions he organized. Among the foremost was one of the first major shows of Thai art in the West, a display that opened in Bloomington in 1960 and was seen at major museums in the United States, Europe and the Far East. A second exhibition, "The Sculpture of Thailand," opened in 1972 at Asia House in Manhattan.
        Born in 1905 in Nagasaki, Japan, to a Russian mother and an American father, Professor Bowie grew up in Nice, France, and San Francisco. He received a bachelor's degree in 1927 from the University of California at Berkeley, where he later earned a master's degree in political science and a doctorate in French literature.
        In addition to his wife, who is the vice president for affiliate services of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, he is survived by two daughters, Alexandra, of Brooklyn, and Jocelyn, of Winter Park, Fla., and five grandchildren.
