        John J. Sughrue, director of the Huntley-Brinkley newscasts on NBC-TV in the 1960's and an award-winning producer of documentaries, died on Feb. 10 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 67.
        Mr. Sughrue, who lived in Forest Hills, Queens, died of lung cancer, said his sister Jane Giberga.
        A native of Queens, Mr. Sughrue joined NBC News in the 1950's and quickly rose through the ranks to play a major role as a director during the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where Chet Huntley and David Brinkley headed the team coverage.
        In 1965, he collaborated with Lucy Jarvis to film "The Louvre," which won the George Foster Peabody Award and two Emmys.
        Besides Mrs. Giberga, of Forest Hills, Mr. Sughrue is survived by another sister, Suzanne Carrington, also of Forest Hills; a daughter, Babette, of Manhattan; two sons, John, of Minnesota, and Clifford, of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.
