        Geoffrey Parsons, a pianist who accompanied many of the world's leading singers in recitals, died on Jan. 26 at Middlesex Hospital in London. He was 65 and lived in London.
        The cause was cancer, said Peter Bloor, his manager.
        Mr. Parsons was widely considered one of the leading accompanists of the day. The list of singers with whom he worked includes Victoria de los Angeles, Birgit Nilsson, Nicolai Gedda, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Christa Ludwig, Janet Baker, Thomas Hampson and Jessye Norman. He also played for instrumentalists like the cellist Paul Tortelier and the violinist Nathan Milstein.
        Geoffrey Penwill Parsons was born in Sydney, Australia. In 1950, he settled in England, where his first big break came accompanying the bass-baritone Peter Dawson. He also worked closely with the eminent German lieder singer Gerhard Husch, and in 1961 accompanied Miss Schwarzkopf in a recital at Festival Hall in London. He worked regularly in some 40 countries, including more than 30 tours of Australia.
        He was an honorary member of both the Royal Academy and the Guildhall School of Music, and a fellow of the Royal College of Music, where he was Prince Consort Professor of piano accompaniment. In addition, he was an Officer of the Order of Australia and the Order of the British Empire, and in 1992 received the Royal Philharmonic Society's Instrumentalist of the Year Award. Many of his numerous recordings also won awards.
        He is survived by two brothers in Australia.
