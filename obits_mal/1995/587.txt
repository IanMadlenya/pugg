        William J. Wilkins, a member of the panel of judges that convicted leading Nazi industrialists during the Nuremberg war crimes trials, died on Saturday at his home in Bellevue, Wash. He was 98.
        Mr. Wilkins, a Superior Court judge in Washington State's King County for more than three decades, is believed to have been the last survivor of the 32 judges appointed to the Nuremberg trials by President Harry S. Truman, said Brig. Gen. Telford Taylor, the chief prosecutor at the trials.
        Judge Wilkins was a member of the four-judge panel that convicted several leading German industrialists who had helped finance and arm the Nazis, the most well known of whom was Alfried Krupp.
        Robert E. Conot, author of "Justice at Nuremberg" (Harper & Row, 1983), said yesterday that the trial of the industrialists was one of several tribunals convened after the principal trial of leading Nazis had concluded.
        Not only was the Krupp family Hitler's main supplier of weapons, Mr. Conot said, "but they also, of course, used slave labor and concentration camp labor."
        Alfried Krupp was found guilty of plunder, but his sentence was cut short in 1951, along with those of many other Nazis, because of American interest in shoring up Germany in the face of the threat posed by the Soviet Union.
        Judge Wilkins once wrote: "Imagine my surprise one day in February 1951 to read in the newspaper that John J. McCloy, the high commissioner to Germany, had restored all the Krupp properties that had been ordered confiscated. At the time of his death in 1968, Krupp was reputed to be the richest man in Europe."
        Judge Wilkins, a native of Ironwood, Mich., graduated from Washington University Law School in 1928.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucille; two sons, Jay, of Issaquah, Wash., and Jensen, of Woodinville, Wash., and two daughters, Jeannie Guzzi of Seattle and Virginia Cook of Houston.
