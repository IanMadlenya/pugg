        John Carrier Weaver, a university administrator instrumental in the formation of the University of Wisconsin System, with 27 campuses when he was its president from 1971 to 1977, died on Friday at his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. He was 79.
        The Wisconsin State Journal reported that the cause of his death was not announced but that he had a heart attack years ago and had undergone open-heart surgery.
        Dr. Weaver was president of the University of Missouri, with four campuses, from 1966 to 1970 and president of the University of Wisconsin, with a single campus in Madison, in 1971 before he oversaw its merger with the Wisconsin State University System. He went on to teach geography, and hold administrative posts, at the University of Southern California from 1977 until his retirement in 1985.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruberta; two sons, Andrew Bennett of Austin, Tex., and Thomas Harwell of Atlanta, and two granddaughters.
