        Louis E. Schwartz, a retired New York Law School professor and an authority on personal injury law, died on Thursday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 92.
        The cause was cancer, said a son-in-law, Norman H. Dachs of Woodmere, L.I.
        Shortly after graduating from Brooklyn Law School in 1924, Mr. Schwartz co-founded the law firm of Schwartz, Levitt & Sommer and for nearly 30 years specialized in personal injury cases. His first book, "Trial of Automobile Cases" (Matthew Bender), was published in 1929, and a more extensive, six-volume work, "Trial of Accident Cases" (Matthew Bender), in 1958.
        He also wrote "Proof, Persuasion and Cross Examination" (Executive Reports Corporation, 1973.)
        He taught at New York Law School from 1951 to 1967.
        His wife of 68 years, Mary Tomashoff Schwartz, died last year. He is survived by two daughters, Elaine Bressler of Manhattan and Zena Dachs of Woodmere; a sister, Sylvia Trevor of Larchmont, N.Y., 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
