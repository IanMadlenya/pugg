        Joel Saxe, who helped to found the Rich's Department Stores chain 33 years ago, died on Feb. 3 at Salem Hospital in Massachusetts. He was 58 and lived in Marblehead, Mass.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokesman for the company.
        Mr. Saxe opened a discount department store in Salem with his father-in-law, Jerry Rich, and Mr. Rich's two sons. Over the years, 26 stores were added throughout New England, and annual sales grew to more than $250 million.
        A native of Boston, Mr. Saxe attended the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. He was a founder of the Marblehead Citizens Scholarhip Fund and was on the board of the Jewish Federation of the North Shore.
        He is survived by his wife, Sandra; two sons, Stephen D. and Richard S., and a daughter, Suzanne D. Rothenberg, all of Marblehead, and two grandchildren.
