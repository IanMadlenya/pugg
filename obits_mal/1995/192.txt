        Michael Ugo Stille, a New York correspondent for the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera for 40 years who moved to Milan to become its chief editor in 1987, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 75 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Stille, who headed the paper for five years until he retired in 1992, began his career in journalism as part of a team writing under a pseudonym that  he later took as his own name. He was born Mikhail Kamenetzki in Moscow on Dec.  3, 1919. His family moved to Italy in 1921, and he attended the University of Rome.
        In the 1930's, he and the poet Giamme Pintor wrote a column for the magazine  Oggi under the name "Ugo Stille." After Mr. Pintor was killed trying to cross German lines and Mr. Kamenetzki emigrated to the United States, Mr. Kamenetzski  changed his name to Michael Ugo Stille, in part as a tribute to Mr. Pintor.
        Arriving in this country, he joined the United States Army and was sent back  to Italy, where he oversaw several radio stations, including Radio Palermo and Radio Milan, during the Allied occupation.
        He returned to the United States and began writing for Corriere della Sera in 1946. He filed 200 to 400 dispatches a year before he was named editor in 1987,  even though had not lived in Italy in more than 40 years and had not held a management job.
        He is survived by a sister, Myra Kamenetzki, and a son, Alexander Stille, both of Manhattan; a daughter, Lucy Stille, of Los Angeles, and a grandson.
