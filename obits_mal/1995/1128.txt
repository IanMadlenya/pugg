        Dr. Lemuel W. Diggs, who spent more than 60 years as a national leader of research into sickle cell anemia and helped the actor Danny Thomas establish the aims of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, died on Jan. 8 at his home in that city. He was 95.
        The cause was general organ failure, said a son, Walter W. Diggs, also of Memphis.
        Dr. Diggs's work during a long career in hematology led in 1971 to the first comprehensive research center on sickle cell anemia, a hereditary blood disease. The center was established at the Memphis campus of the University of Tennessee, where Dr. Diggs had joined the faculty in 1929.
        He also helped create the South's first blood bank, and only the nation's fourth, in Memphis in 1938.
        In the late 1950's, he visited pediatric centers across the United States at the request of Mr. Thomas to help develop the concept for St. Jude, a children's hospital that the entertainer envisioned for Memphis. Dr. Diggs urged that it become a research hospital as well as a center for treating children with leukemia and other cancer.
        He was an author of the standard laboratory reference on blood cells, "Morphology of Human Blood Cells," which is still used as a text.
        Dr. Diggs, a native of Hampton, Va., received undergraduate and master's degrees from Randolph-Macon College and a medical degree in 1925 from Johns Hopkins University.
        In addition to his son Walter, he is survived by his wife, Beatrice; two daughters, Alice D. Sullivan of Olive Branch, Miss., and Margaret D. Simons of Honesdale, Pa.; a second son, Dr. John S. Diggs of Bozeman, Mont.; a sister, Dorothy D. Barton of Arlington, Va., and 10 grandchildren.
