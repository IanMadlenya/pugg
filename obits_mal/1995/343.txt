        Christopher Cadbury, an Englishman who helped set up and develop nature preserves in Britain and elsewhere, died on June 25 in Worcestershire, the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph reported Thursday. He was 86.
        Mr. Cadbury worked in his family's chocolate-manufacturing company, Cadbury Brothers, and was president of the Royal Society for Nature Conservation from 1962 to 1988.
        In that post, he worked to establish trusts to promote wildlife conservation in individual British counties. By the mid-1960's, The Daily Telegraph reported, such trusts embraced "the whole of Britain."
        He also personally bought a number of pieces of land that he turned over to conservation groups to be administered as nature preserves. These purchases included, in 1973, the mile-long Aride Island in the Indian Ocean.
        Another British newspaper, The Independent, reported last week that Aride is home to "a million breeding sea birds and the sweet-scented Wright's gardenia that is found nowhere else in the world."
        Mr. Cadbury had three sons and two daughters by his marriages to the former Honor Milward, who died in 1957, and the former Betty Hone, who died in 1991.
