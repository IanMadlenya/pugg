        Louis J. Soffer, a medical educator, clinician and pioneering researcher on the body's glands, died on Monday in a nursing home in Stamford, Conn. A longtime resident of Manhattan, he was 90.
        He spent four decades at Mount Sinai Medical Center, serving as chief of endocrinology for over 25 years. He contributed more than 150 scientific papers  and wrote two textbooks on ailments caused by malfunctioning adrenal glands.
        Dr. Soffer was born in London and was brought to New York City as an infant. He attended Columbia University and received his medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in Brooklyn, now Downstate Medical School.
        He interned at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital and did research for several years at Johns Hopkins University Medical School. He moved to Mount Sinai in 1935 and became head of endocrinology in 1948.
        Dr. Soffer is survived by a son, Dr. Richard L. Soffer of Norwalk, Conn.; a daughter, Lucy S. Blankstein of Falls Church, Va., and four grandchildren.
