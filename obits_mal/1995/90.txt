        William Donald Wright, who helped to widen minorities' access to the broadcast media, died on May 2 at El Camino Hospital in Los Altos, Calif. He was 63 and lived in Los Altos.
        The cause was lung cancer and emphysema, said his wife, Eileen.
        After a Federal appellate court ruling in the late 1960's gave the public a right to participate in regulatory decisions, civil rights advocates increasingly turned their attention to challenging broadcast programming that they saw as discriminatory, and to promoting the hiring of minorities within television and radio.
        A leader in this effort, Mr. Wright in 1968 co-founded Black Efforts for Soul in Television, or BEST. He went on to help found the National Black Media Coalition, where he was chairman emeritus at his death.
        As a director of the Cablecommunication Resource Center in Washington in the early 1970's, he also researched minority enterprises' opportunities in the emerging cable television industry.
        And in 1973 at Stanford University, he established a branch of the Cablecommunication Resource Center, where he administered a National Science Foundation grant for a study of blacks and television. He was also a director of the Media Access Project and the National Citizens' Communication Lobby.
        Mr. Wright was a native of Edinboro, Pa.
        A previous marriage, to Mary Wright, ended in divorce in 1962.  Besides Eileen Wright, he is survived by two children from his first marriage -- Vincent, of Albuquerque, N.M., and Shelley Dodson of Washington -- and a grandson.
