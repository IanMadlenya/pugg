        Frederic Billings Littlefield, founder of Camp Robin Hood in Brooksville, Me., where generations of boys made their summer homes, died on March 1 at his home in Medford, Mass. He was 92.
        He died in his sleep, said his son, Frederic S. Littlefield of Concord, Mass., who runs the camp.
        In 1928, Mr. Littlefield cleared a camp site on land handed down from his family, built log cabins and personally held recruiting drives in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. He then introduced his young campers, many drawn from socially prominent families, to the rigors of outdoor hikes and the importance of good table manners.
        Among the campers were the descendants of Theodore Roosevelt, John D. Rockefeller and Joseph Pulitzer.
        During the campers' eight-week hiatus along Penobscot Bay, Mr. Littlefield saw to it that the boys made archery bows, learned to build campfires and experienced the mysteries of snipe hunts. The camp's routine eventually expanded beyond the traditional fare of nature study and hiking to include activities like whitewater rafting and sailing instruction aboard a 38-foot racing yacht.
        For the first 40 years the number of campers was about 100 each summer, but gradually the figure more than doubled. In the 1990's the camp became coeducational.
        Mr. Littlefield was also an entrepreneur. He ran his own lumber business, the Maine Wood Company, for nearly 30 years. He also established the Boston Corset Company, the Gold Reclaiming Company and the Littlefield Lumber Company. In 1948, he started the Flag Center in Cambridge, Mass.
        His first marriage ended in divorce. Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Dorothy Littlefield of Medford and of Palm Beach, Fla.; two daughters, Janet Canfield of Memphis, Tenn., and Barbara Pluff of Brunswick, Me.; 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
