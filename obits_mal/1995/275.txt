        Bernard R. Ostrow, the founder and former president of a large kosher-food processing business in Newark, died on Friday at his home in West Orange, N.J. He was 76 and also lived in Delray Beach, Fla.
        The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ostrow retired in 1984 as president of Shofar Kosher Foods, a company he started in 1953.
        Mr. Ostrow is survived by his wife, Sherry Friedlander Ostrow; three daughters, Gail, of Bridgeport, Conn., Wendy, of San Francisco, and Ivy Coghlan of Ramsy, N.J; a son, Dr. David G., of Milwaukee; a sister, Eleanor Jacobson of Encino, Calif., and five grandchildren.
