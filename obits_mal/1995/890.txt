        Tyrone Turner, editorial business manager for Newsweek magazine, died on Wednesday at Walt Disney World's Pleasure Island. He was 40.
        His body was found early on Thursday in four feet of water under the Planet Hollywood restaurant, which is elevated over a lagoon, the Orange County Sheriff's office said. He probably drowned, though the exact cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner's office, a sheriff's spokesman said. No foul play was suspected.
        Mr. Turner was last seen about 2 A.M. on Wednesday when he and a group of associates, attending a business conference, were leaving the area to return to  their hotel rooms.
        Mr. Turner, of New York City, is survived by his wife, Rosalyn, and two sons.
