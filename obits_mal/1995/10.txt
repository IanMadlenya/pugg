        Lee Goerner, who served as editor and publisher of the literary house Atheneum from 1989 until its demise last year, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 48.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, said his wife, Katherine McNamara.
        Mr. Goerner had been working as a freelance editor since last year. Atheneum folded after its parent, Macmillan, was purchased by Paramount Publishing.
        During Atheneum's final year, Mr. Goerner had been its only editor, handling about 20 books a year by such authors as Reynolds Price, Paule Marshall, Larry Woiwode, Samuel Hynes, Benjamin Cheever and Charles Johnson.
        Before joining Atheneum, Mr. Goerner had been a senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, where his authors included Don DeLillo, Michael Herr, Isabel Allende and Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
        A native of Tulsa, Mr. Goerner graduated from Cornell University in 1969 and received a master's degree from the University of California at Davis. He began his publishing career in 1973 as an assistant to Robert Gottlieb, then the editor in chief at Knopf. In 1979, he was a recipient of the Tony Godwin Memorial Award, which allows an editor to work for six months with a British publishing house.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Hugh and Virgina Goerner of Austin, Tex.; two brothers, Michael, of Needham, Mass., and Jon, of Dallas, and a sister, Gail Billington of Hamilton, Va.
