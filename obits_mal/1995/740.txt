        James J. Kennelly, a former Speaker of the Connecticut House of Representatives, died yesterday at John Dempsey Hospital in Farmington, Conn.
        Mr. Kennelly, who was 64, had been admitted to the hospital more than a week  ago after a heart attack.
        A lawyer and the husband of United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, he was the State Representative of Hartford's First Assembly District  for 12 years. Mr. Kennelly, a Hartford Democrat, was Speaker of the State House from 1975 to 1979.
        In that post, he controlled committee assignments and often determined the fate of legislation. Mr. Kennelly left the House shortly after losing a bid for  a third term as Speaker and went on to form a law partnership with Lewis Rome.
        Mr. Kennelly grew up in Hartford's southwest corner and graduated from Holy Cross College and the University of Connecticut School of Law. Beginning in 1959 he practiced law in Hartford.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Kennelly is survived by three daughters, Eleanor Gaetan of Washington, Barbara MkNelly of Davis, Calif., and Louise Curtis of Jamestown, N.C.; a son, John B. Kennelly of Hartford, and four grandchildren.
