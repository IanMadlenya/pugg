        Raphael Simches, a former president of the Council for Exceptional Children, died on March 13 at his home in Anna Maria, Fla. He was 74.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Simches was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University. He joined the Bureau of Handicapped Children in the New York State Department of Education in 1953 and rose to be director of special education.
        He became president of the National Association of State Directors of Special Education in 1965 and president of the Council for Exceptional Children, based in Virginia, in 1974.
        He left the New York Education Department in 1976 to work as a program specialist in the United States Office of Education in Washington. He retired in 1984 and moved to Florida.
        He became a City Commissioner in Anna Maria and then served for five years as Mayor, starting in 1989. He resigned in December because of failing health.
        Mr. Simches is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; three daughters, Laura A. Wilhelm of Framingham, Mass., Elizabeth V. Ayre of Paris, and Dr. Mary A. Boden of West Hartford; a brother, Gabriel, of Holmes Beach, Fla.; a sister, Frieda Morrison of Albany, and one grandchild.
