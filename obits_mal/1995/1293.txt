        James R. Cowan, a physician who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health and Environmental Services in the Nixon Administration and in a variety of other high posts in health administration, died Feb. 16 at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 78.
        His wife, Dolores, who said Dr. Cowan suffered from heart and vascular ailments, attributed the death to natural causes.
        After spending 1953 to 1970 in private practice in general medicine and surgery in East Orange, N.J., Dr. Cowan was appointed Commissioner of Health for New Jersey. From 1974 to 1976, he served in the Nixon Administration.
        Dr. Cowan spent the next year as senior vice president of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Greater New York, and from 1977 until his retirement in 1988, he was the president and chief executive officer of United Hospitals Medical Center in Newark.
        In 1990, Dr. Cowan was indicted on charges of accepting bribes disguised as consulting fees at the hospital. In 1992, he pleaded guilty to a count of corporate misconduct. He was sentenced to probation and community service and ordered to make restitution of $100,000 to the hospital, according to the New Jersey Attorney General's office.
        Dr. Cowan, who was born in Washington, was a graduate of Howard University and Meharry Medical College in Nashville. In 1945, he entered the Army and served as a surgeon in Germany before beginning his civilian practice.
        Dr. Cowan's first two marriages ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, the former Dolores Gower of Sarasota, he is survived by two sons, Dr. James R. Cowan Jr. of Ridgewood, N.J., and Dr. Jay C. Cowan of South Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Jill W. Cowan Davis of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
