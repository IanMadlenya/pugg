        Robin Clark, a correspondent for The Philadelphia Inquirer, was killed on Friday in a traffic accident near Los Angeles, where he had been based since 1993. He was 40.
        The Inquirer said the Santa Monica police reported that Mr. Clark -- who had been covering the O. J. Simpson trial -- and a cousin, Nicole Weaver of New York, and her friend Melissa Penn of Scarborough, Me., were driving in his 30-year-old Volkswagen bus on the Pacific Coast Highway, when the van was clipped by a car changing lanes. The van skidded into oncoming traffic and was hit by another car. It was not clear who was driving the van.
        Mr. Clark attracted wide attention with his reporting about what The Inquirer called rampant abuse by workers of Philadelphia's disability system. In one 1990 article, he told of one city official who slipped in a puddle of spilled ketchup at lunch and was awarded $2,045 in monthly disability payments for life. Later the city overhauled the system.
        Mr. Clark previously worked for The Charlotte Observer and The San Francisco Examiner. He was hired by The Inquirer in 1983.
        Mr. Clark is survived by his wife, Becky, from whom he was separated; his mother, Ann Weaver Dodge; a sister, Ann Clark Howell, and his companion, Margaret Grace.
