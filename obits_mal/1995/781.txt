        Leslie L. Vivian Jr., Princeton University's former good-will ambassador to its neighbors in Princeton and Mercer County, died on Wednesday at his home in Vineyard Haven, Mass. He was 76.
        The cause was prostate cancer, the university said.
        As director of community affairs from 1970 until his retirement in 1986, Mr. Vivian was a visible presence in many civic causes. They included Princeton Community Housing Inc., the Mercer County Heart Fund, the Arts Council of Princeton, the Boy Scouts and the Medical Center at Princeton. He was a native of Elizabeth, N.J., and he continued his community activities after moving to Martha's Vineyard three years ago.
        Mr. Vivian is survived by his wife, Anita Willis Vivian; a son, Leslie L. 3d, of Haworth, N.J.; three daughters, Mary Vivian of Vineyard Haven, Elinor Edmundson of St. Cloud, Fla., and Ann Dintenfass of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; a brother, Robert P., of Westfield, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
