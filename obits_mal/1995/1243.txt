        Valentin Mandrajji, a designer of fine chinaware, died on Feb. 5 at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, said Richard R. Gillespie, a former associate at Cartier.
        Born Prince Valentin Hldbodaroff-Mandrajji to Russian parents in Vienna and educated in Romania, he worked primarily in Bucharest for 23 years, restoring paintings for museums and painting frescoes. He also produced Orthodox icons whose images were done in gouache and gold leaf.
        He moved to Manhattan in 1976 and began to produce designs for manufacturers of china, crystal and silverware.
        With his partner, Barbara Marsten, he created designs for such firms as Cartier, Christian Dior, House of Faberge, Lenox, Sasaki crystal, Retroneu, Pfaltzgraff and the Franklin Mint.
        He is survived by his wife, Voica Ortansa, and his mother, Vera Hldbodaroff of Queens.
