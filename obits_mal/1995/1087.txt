        Dr. William A. Ritchie, a retired archeologist for the State of New York who  conducted nearly 100 excavations of prehistoric sites, died on Thursday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. He was 92 and lived in Delmar, N.Y.
        He served as chief archeologist at the New York State Museum and Science Service from 1949 until his retirement in 1972. In 1987, he received the Distinguished Service Award of the Society for American Archeology, the society's highest honor.
        He conducted his work in various parts of northeastern North America and was considered an authority on the early inhabitants of that region. He was the author of several books on ancient Indian settlements in New York State, the state's archeology in general and the archeology of Martha's Vineyard, as well as the author of more than 150 scientific papers and monographs.
        A native of Rochester, he graduated from the University of Rochester, from which he also received a master's degree. He received a Ph.D. in archeology from Columbia University.
        Before his appointment as State Archeologist he was an archeologist and, later, the curator of archeology at the Rochester Museum and Science Center.
        Dr. Ritchie is survived by his wife, Beatrice Fisher Ritchie; a son, Dr. Galen B., of Delmar; two brothers, Prof. Donald L., of Brevard, N.C., and Orrin  B., of Clarkesville, Ga.; two sisters, Olga C. Ritchie of Rochester, and Laura R. Balch of Naples, Fla.
