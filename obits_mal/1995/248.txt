        Akiva Kohane, a Jewish international aid official, died on May 27 at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 84 and a resident of Boston.
        The cause was heart failure, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee said. He had retired in 1990 from the organization, for which he was country director for Poland.
        Mr. Kohane, who was born and educated in Cracow, escaped the German invasion of Poland in 1939 to Palestine, where he formed a group to help those who stayed behind. In 1944, he joined the staff of the distribution committee, a New York-based organization devoted to helping needy Jews around the world.
        Mr. Kohane's survivors include his wife, Judith Zimmermann Kohane, and two sons, Isaac and Daniel, both of Boston.
