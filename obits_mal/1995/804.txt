        Pete Welding, a leading authority on jazz and the blues who became a successful record producer, died on Friday at his home in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif. He was 60.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokesman for EMI Records Group North America, where Mr. Welding dealt in artists and repertory.
        Mr. Welding began his career in the 1960's as an editor at the jazz publication Downbeat and remained a contributor through the late 1980's. It was in the early 60's that he founded Testament Records, which specialized in jazz and gospel artists. He personally recorded such artists as Otis Spann and Johnny Shines for the Testament label. He also produced recordings for the Prestige, Bluesville, Elektra and Arhoolie labels and worked at other record companies, including Epic and Playboy, before joining EMI.
        He and a partner, Lawrence Cohn, were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993 for their album notes for "Roots 'n' Blues: The Retrospective (1925-1950)," released on Columbia/Legacy. He and Mr. Cohn had received a Grammy nomination in 1973 for producing "Leadbelly (Live in Concert)."
        At the time of his death, Mr. Welding was completing a book about the blues for the Smithsonian Institution.
        He is survived by his wife, Darlene; a daughter, Renee, and two sons, Raymond and Robert.
