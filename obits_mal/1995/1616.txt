        Russell Reading Braddon, an Australian author whose first literary success was based on his four years as a Japanese prisoner of war, died on March 20 in his home in Urunga on the north coast of New South Wales. He was 74 and had returned to his native city, Sydney, in 1993 after spending most of his professional life in England.
        Captured in Malaya early in 1941, he survived the prison camps set up by the Japanese to build the Bangkok-Rangoon Railway. His 1952 book about his experiences, "The Naked Island," sold more than a million copies worldwide and was made into a play in London in 1959.
        He moved to England in the late 1940's, and wrote dozens of novels, biographies and plays. The biographies included "Joan Sutherland" (1962) and "Roy Thomson of Fleet Street" (1965); among the novels were "The Year of the Angry Rabbitt" (1964), "When the Enemy Is Tired" (1968), "The Thirteenth Trick" (1973) and "The Finalists" (1977).
        In 1983, he wrote "Japan Against the World, 1941-2041: The 100-Year War for Supremacy," in which he examined what he called Japan's "insatiable thirst for international pre-eminence."
        He was also a well-known broadcaster, appearing as a panelist and making documentaries for the BBC.
