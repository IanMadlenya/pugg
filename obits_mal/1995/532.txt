        Mr. Christie, who worked for McGraw-Hill for 30 years, was an economist at the Dodge unit of the construction information division.

        Mr. Christie joined F. W. Dodge in 1962 as a senior economist. He was appointed chief economist in 1965 and was named vice president in 1970. He retired in 1992, but remained a construction industry consultant to the company.
        Before joining Dodge, Mr. Christie worked as an economist at the Prudential Insurance Company in Newark from 1952 through 1961. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree from Columbia University in 1950, and he received a master of science degree from the Columbia School of Business in 1953.
        Mr. Christie is survived by his wife, Marjorie, of Franklin Lakes; a daughter, Linda A. Christie of Boston; three sons, Stuart A. Christie of Montclair, N.J., Ross A. Christie and David A. Christie, both of San Diego, Calif., and five grandchildren.
