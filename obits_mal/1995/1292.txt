        Harold Allen Zabrack, a composer, pianist and former professor at Westminster Choir College of Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., died on Feb. 2 at his home in Creve Coeur, Mo. He was 66.
        The cause was peritonitis, said a spokeswoman for the college.
        Mr. Zabrack was the composer of dozens of works for the piano, many of which he performed in concert. He was the soloist in the premieres of his First Piano Concerto with the St. Louis Symphony and of his Symphonic Variations with the Milwaukee Symphony.
        He was born in St. Louis and received degrees in music from Chicago Musical College.
        He was the chairman of the piano department at Westminster until his retirement in 1993. He also wrote articles for Clavier Magazine, the American Music Teacher and other journals.
        He is survived by five sisters, Goldie Levinson, Lillian Fishgoll, Esther J. Imber, Dorothy Kaplan and Celia Pevnick, all of Creve Coeur.
