        Larry McAfee, a quadriplegic who won court permission to turn off his ventilator in 1989 but later changed his mind, died on Sunday at University Hospital in Augusta, a spokesman said. He was 39 and had lived in Augusta for the past four years.
        Mr. McAfee, who died of pneumonia, had been hospitalized since April 4, the hospital said.
        A mechanical engineer, he was paralyzed in a motorcycle accident in 1985 and had to use a ventilator to breathe. In 1989, frustrated with his limitations, he decided he would rather die.
        His legal battle for the right to die ended with a Georgia Supreme Court ruling in his favor. But Mr. McAfee changed his mind after moving to a nursing home in Birmingham, Ala., where Dr. Russ Fine, director of the Injury Prevention Research Center at the University of Alabama, befriended him and persuaded him to give life another chance. Mr. McAfee later moved to a personal-care home in Augusta and was taught to operate a specially equipped computer.
        "Turning off the ventilator still remains a very viable option to me," he said in an interview at the time. "But I want to look into the possibilities to  see what's available first. I want to give it a try."
        A 1993 television movie, "The Switch," told the story of Mr. McAfee and his relationship with Dr. Fine.
        He is survived by his parents, James A. and Amelia Brantley Mc Afee of Tennille, Ga., and three sisters, Patricia M. Dunn of Stone Mountain, Ga., and Lynn M. Gilbert and Julie M. Orr, both of Sandersville, Ga.
