        Dr. Herman Beerman, a professor emeritus of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania whose research helped advance the diagnosis and treatment of syphilis and psoriasis, died on Jan. 1 in his home in Philadelphia. He was 93.
        The cause was heart failure, said Dr. Lawrence Charles Parish of Philadelphia, a former student and colleague.
        While Dr. Beerman maintained a private practice in clinical dermatology, his major activity was in diseases of the skin, dermatopathology. He was a leader in promoting the use of anthralinin in the treatment of psoriasis. When penicillin became the treatment of syphilis, he was among the early practitioners in developing treatment schedules.
        Two years after receiving a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1927, he joined the faculty of the School of Medicine there. By the time he retired in 1967, he had risen from assistant instructor to chairman of the dermatology department, a post he held for 18 years.
        He was the editor of the dermatology and syphilology section of the American Journal of Medical Sciences for many years and served as book review editor of the International Journal of Dermatology. With John Stokes and Norman Ingraham, he wrote the third edition of "Modern Clinical Syphilology" (W. B. Sanders Company, 1945).
        Born in Youngstown, Ohio, he also received an undergraduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1923.
        He is survived by his wife of 70 years, Emma Segal Beerman; a daughter, Mariette Bronstein of Ridgewood, N.J.; two grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
