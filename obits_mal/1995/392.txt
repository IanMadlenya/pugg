        Charles Miller, editor at large and former managing editor of Artforum magazine in New York City, died on July 12 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 44, and lived in Greenwich Village and East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Gregory M. Griffin.
        Mr. Miller was born in 1951 in Pottsville, Pa. He received a bachelor of arts degree from Elizabethtown College in 1972, a master of arts from Middlebury College in 1973 and, in 1979, a Ph.D. in German studies from Indiana University. In the early 1980's he taught German and German literature at Ohio State University in Columbus and pursued post-doctoral work in Berlin.
        In 1983, after failing to receive tenure at Ohio State, Mr. Miller decided to go into art criticism. He took a job as the editor of Dialogue, a nonprofit arts journal in Columbus, and left in 1986 to become managing editor of Artforum, the journal of contemporary art, in New York City.
        He also published reviews and articles, in Artforum, The New Art Examiner and Art Criticism, and taught art history at the School of Visual Arts. He became editor at large of Artforum in 1992.
        In addition to Mr. Griffin, Mr. Miller is survived by his mother, Rhuba H. Thissen of Pine Grove, Pa.; his father and stepmother, Vincent and Rene Miller of Friedensburg, Pa., and his sister, Christine Miller Onderdonk of Saugerties, N.Y.
