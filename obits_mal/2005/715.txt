        Paul Reynard, a French-born painter who was active for more than three decades as an artist and teacher in New York, died on Friday at his home in Monsey, N.Y. He was 78.
        The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Ellen, said.
        Mr. Reynard, who had five solo exhibitions at the Brewster Gallery in Greenwich Village during the 1970's and 80's, taught drawing at the School of Visual Arts from 1981 to 2002.
        He was also a co-chairman of the Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, which is dedicated to advancing the teachings of the Armenian-born mystic George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, who died in 1949.
        Paul Léon Reynard was born in Lyon on Oct. 3, 1927, and received his early training there with the painter Claude Idoux. Mr. Reynard later worked with Idoux on the famous windows of the Church of St.-Rémy in Baccarat, France, and, on his own, on stained-glass windows in churches throughout France and Germany.
        In 1947, Mr. Reynard moved to Paris, where he studied under Fernand Léger at the École de Beaux-Arts, before coming to the United States in 1968. During the 1970's, he painted a number of murals in the Northeast, including one at 100 Park Avenue in Manhattan and another at Harvard University.
        Mr. Reynard's first marriage, to Josée Tenas, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Ellen Dooling, whom he married in December; a brother, Jean; a son from his first marriage, Antoine; and four grandchildren, all of whom live in France. Another son, Nicolas, a photographer for National Geographic, died in a plane crash while on assignment last year.
        Correction:  November 19, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Nov. 1 about Paul Reynard, a painter and teacher, misstated his title at the Gurdjieff Foundation of New York, which is dedicated to the teachings of the Armenian-born mystic G. I. Gurdjieff. Mr. Reynard was a co-president of the foundation, not a co-chairman.
