        Ben A. Franklin, a former national correspondent for The New York Times, died on Saturday at his home in Garrett Park, Md. He was 78.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Franklin was the editor of The Washington Spectator, a twice-monthly political newsletter.
        A longtime reporter in the Washington bureau of The Times, Mr. Franklin, who joined the paper in 1959, reported for many years on the Middle Atlantic States. Among the subjects he covered were coal mining in Appalachia, the resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in 1973 and the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 in Middletown, Pa.
        Mr. Franklin retired from The Times in 1989.
        Benjamin Arthur Franklin, apparently no relation to the founding father, was born on Nov. 12, 1927, in Manhattan. His father was an editor for The New York Herald Tribune.
        Mr. Franklin earned a bachelor's from the University of Pennsylvania in 1948 and a master's from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in 1950. In the Korean War, he served in the Coast Guard.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jane Burrage; three daughters, Abigail Plumer of Manhattan; Elizabeth Franklin of Frederick, Md.; and Clare Duran of Geneva; a sister, Zilpha Platky; and five grandchildren.
