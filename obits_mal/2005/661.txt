        John E. Struggles, a founder and longtime partner of Heidrick & Struggles, one of the first executive search firms in the world and currently one of the largest, died on Tuesday at his home in Winnetka, Ill. He was 91.
        The firm, which is based in Chicago, announced the death.
        With Gardner W. Heidrick, Mr. Struggles founded Heidrick & Struggles in 1953. An international concern, the firm today employs 1,300 people, with offices in 57 cities throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia. Recent clients have included the Walt Disney Company, Volvo, Office Depot, Nike, Coca-Cola, J.C. Penney, Starbucks, Honeywell and TIAA-CREF.
        Mr. Struggles remained with the firm until his retirement in 1986. Mr. Heidrick, who retired in 1982, died in 2002.
        Before they went into business together, Mr. Struggles had been an executive at Montgomery Ward & Company and Mr. Heidrick a management consultant with Booz Allen Hamilton. They began Heidrick & Struggles in a two-room office in downtown Chicago, with Mrs. Heidrick and Mrs. Struggles as the secretarial staff. The firm grew quickly, aided by the vigorous demand for corporate executives in the postwar economy.
        John Edward Struggles was born on Nov. 29, 1913, in Wilmette, Ill. From 1932 to 1934, he attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, before starting his business career with the Consolidated Biscuit Company in Chicago.
        Mr. Struggles went on to work for Pillsbury Mills, and in 1941 joined Montgomery Ward, eventually becoming vice president for personnel there. During World War II, he served with the Navy in the Pacific.
        Mr. Struggles is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Goetz, whom he married in 1937; a son, Kirk, of Northfield, Ill.; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. A daughter, Stephanie, died in 1981.
