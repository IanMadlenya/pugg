        Tommy Hanneford of the Royal Hanneford Circus, known as ''the funniest man on horseback,'' died here on Monday. He was 78.
        His death followed a short illness, said his wife, Gertrude, who was also co-owner and a producer of the circus, which they formed with Mr. Hanneford's sister in 1965.
        The circus reorganized in 1975 and began performing at Shrine Temples, touring the country for about 40 weeks a year. Mr. Hanneford's last appearance was three weeks ago at a Shriner's Circus in Springfield, Ill.
        The family's circus history dates to 18th-century England, according to a Shriner Web site, sahibshrine.org/circus/hanneford.htm. The Hanneford family first toured as a troupe in 1807. Mr. Hanneford began as a clown at age 5, the site said.
        Mr. Hanneford was also a technical adviser for television productions, and appeared in the 1986 television movie ''Barnum.''
        Besides Gertrude, his wife of 53 years, his survivors include a daughter, Nellie Hanneford-Chapay of Sarasota; a brother, George Jr. of Myakka City, Fla.; and three grandchildren.
