        Mort Fega, a veteran disc jockey who was a familiar presence on the New York jazz scene of the 1960's, died on Jan. 21 in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 83 and lived in Delray Beach, Fla.
        The cause was complications of back surgery, his wife, Muriel, told The Associated Press.
        A lifelong jazz fan, Mr. Fega was working as a salesman in New Rochelle, N.Y., his hometown, in 1955 when he persuaded a local radio station, WNRC, to give him his own Saturday afternoon show. The station's signal reached parts of New York City, and his show gradually became so popular there that he was hired as the master of ceremonies for the first Randalls Island Jazz Festival in 1959. Shortly after that he moved to New York to do a nightly show, ''Jazz Unlimited,'' on WEVD.
        Facing tough competition from the jazz disc jockey Symphony Sid Torin, whose show was on directly opposite his, Mr. Fega developed a loyal following with a mix that drew heavily on modern musicians like Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk but also included big bands, singers and even stand-up comedy. Almost everything he played came from his extensive record collection.
        He briefly ran his own record company, Focus, with a roster including the singers Carmen McRae and Bob Dorough. He was also the M.C. of jazz concerts at Carnegie Hall, the Apollo Theater and the Newport Jazz Festival.
        Mr. Fega left WEVD in 1966, but continued to spin records for several other New York stations before joining KXIV in Phoenix in 1969. Seven years later he moved to the University of Hartford's station, WWUH-FM.
        He retired to Florida in 1986, but until recently had a weekly show on WXEL-FM, a public radio station in South Florida, taught and wrote.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons Russell, of Altadena, Calif.; Douglas, of Carefree, Ariz.; Kenneth, of Sedona, Ariz.; and Roger, of Amherst, Mass; and eight grandchildren.
