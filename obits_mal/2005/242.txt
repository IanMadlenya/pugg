        Jim Wiwa, a chief of the Ogoni of southern Nigeria who became a symbol of his embattled people after the execution of his son, the dissident environmentalist and playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa, in 1995, died on April 1 at his home in Bane, Nigeria. He was believed to have been 101.
        Mr. Wiwa's grandson Ken Wiwa confirmed the death.
        An outspoken critic of Nigeria's military government, led by Gen. Sani Abacha, and of Royal Dutch/Shell, which had operated for years in oil-rich Ogoniland, Ken Saro-Wiwa was arrested in May 1994 on charges of inciting his followers to murder and was sentenced to death after a trial his defenders said was a sham. With worldwide attention focused on the case, Mr. Wiwa pleaded with the Nigerian authorities to spare his son's life. Mr. Saro-Wiwa, then 54, and eight other Ogoni men were hanged on Nov. 10, 1995.
        Jim Beeson Wiwa was born in Bane in 1904. Educated in Nigeria, he worked as an interpreter and later as a forest ranger and a trader in palm oil and other goods. At his death, he was chairman of the Council of Chiefs of Bane and a patron of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, the organization founded by Mr. Saro-Wiwa.
        Mr. Wiwa married several times. His wife Jessica, Mr. Saro-Wiwa's mother, died in 2003. He is survived by many children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
        Even after the death of General Abacha in 1998 and the advent of democratic rule in Nigeria the next year, Mr. Wiwa remained bitter about his son's death, and about the persistent poverty among the Ogoni.
        ''There has been no reconciliation,'' he told the magazine In These Times in 2001. ''There is no water, there is no electricity, there is no good school. And yet it is here where the resources of Nigeria come out, from this Ogoniland.''
