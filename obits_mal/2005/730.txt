        Leonard N. Block, the retired chairman and chief executive of the Block Drug Company, a philanthropist and a former treasurer of Lincoln Center, died on Wednesday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 93.
        The death was announced by his family, who said he had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for many years.
        Born in Brooklyn, Leonard Nathan Block was a 1933 business graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Upon graduation, he joined the family business begun by his immigrant father, a pharmacist trained at Columbia University, who opened a single drugstore in Brooklyn in 1907.
        Working with other family members, Mr. Block rose to chairman and helped build Block Drug into an international business, based in Jersey City since 1938. The company made household pharmaceuticals like Nytol sleeping tablets; Sensodyne toothpaste; Poli-Grip denture adhesives; and Polident denture cleaners, introduced in the 1930's and Block's leading brand for decades. The family sold the company in 2001 to the London-based GlaxoSmithKline.
        Mr. Block was a board member of Lincoln Center and its treasurer for many years into the 1980's. He was a longtime supporter of other institutions including Mount Sinai Medical Center; Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J.; Planned Parenthood of New York City; and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, serving as chairman of its distribution committee. He was a founder of the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged and served as a member of the supervisory board of the New York State Division of Social Welfare during the Rockefeller administration.
        Mr. Block is survived by his wife of 69 years, Adele Goldberg Block; a daughter, Peggy Danziger, and a son, Thomas, both of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.
