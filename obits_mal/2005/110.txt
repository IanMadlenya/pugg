        Otto Plaschkes, a British producer of films including the spy thriller ''Hopscotch'' (1980) and the dark comedy ''Georgy Girl'' (1966), died on Monday in London. He was 75.
        The cause was heart failure, said Rob Gerlach, a friend.
        Mr. Plaschkes gravitated to wry screenplays that explored identity and sized up society. ''Georgy Girl,'' jointly produced with Robert A. Goldston, made a heroine of the plump, gawky young woman played by Lynn Redgrave.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Plaschkes was head of European production for the American Film Theater, founded by Ely Landau to adapt plays for the screen. There he was executive producer of ''The Homecoming'' (1973), adapted from Harold Pinter's play; ''Butley'' (1976), written and adapted by Simon Gray; ''Galileo'' (1975), based on Charles Laughton's 1947 adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play; and ''In Celebration'' (1975), which David Storey wrote and adapted.
        ''The Holcroft Covenant'' (1985), one of his last films, was an adaptation of the Robert Ludlum best seller.
        Mr. Plaschkes was born in Vienna on Sept. 13, 1929, and was among the Jewish children who escaped Nazi-occupied countries through the Kindertransport. He was later reunited with his parents and sister.
        He studied history at Cambridge and received an education diploma at Oxford, according to an obituary in The Guardian. He then became a production assistant at Ealing Studios, working on ''Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962). In the 1980's he was chief executive of the British Film and Television Producers Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise Stein Plaschkes; a daughter, Valli Plaschkes of Manhattan; and a sister.
