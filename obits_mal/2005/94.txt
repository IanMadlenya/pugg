        Christopher Marquis, a reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, died yesterday in San Francisco. He was 43.
        He had been staying at the home of a brother, Matthew, who said the cause of death was AIDS.
        Christopher Marquis, whose specialty was Latin American politics, joined The Times in 2000 from the Washington bureau of Knight-Ridder Newspapers, where he was chief foreign affairs writer. Before that, he was a foreign correspondent for The Miami Herald, focusing on Cuba and Central America.
        Mr. Marquis was born on Nov. 13, 1961, in Marin County, Calif.
        He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1984 with a bachelor's degree in literature, and earned a master's degree in journalism from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. He was a Nieman fellow at Harvard in 1998 and 1999.
        His novel, ''A Hole in the Heart'' (St. Martin's), about a lonely teacher in Alaska dealing with the untimely death of her husband, was published in 2003 to favorable reviews. He had taken a leave of absence from The Times several months ago to work on a second novel.
        In addition to his brother Matthew, Mr. Marquis is survived by his parents, Harold and Nancy Marquis of Santa Rosa, Calif.; another brother, Jeff, of Santa Monica, Calif.; and a sister, Julie, of Claremont, Calif.
