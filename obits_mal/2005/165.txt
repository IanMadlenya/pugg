        Bill Potts, a jazz arranger, pianist and educator, died on Feb. 16 in Plantation, Fla. He was 76 and lived in Fort Lauderdale.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter, Christi Desky.
        Mr. Potts first attracted attention in the early 1950's as chief arranger for the Orchestra, a big band organized by the jazz broadcaster Willis Conover that performed in Washington and was heard on the Voice of America. The Orchestra was known for attracting big-name guest soloists, and Mr. Potts, who was also an audio engineer, recorded concerts at which the ensemble backed up Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Those recordings were later released on LP.
        Mr. Potts also worked as pianist, arranger or both with the big bands of Woody Herman, Stan Kenton and Buddy Rich, and with the singers Paul Anka and Bobby Vinton.
        From 1974 to 1990, he taught music theory, arranging and jazz-combo classes at Montgomery College in Rockville, Md. He also worked as an audio technician there and led the student jazz ensemble.
        A native of Arlington, Va., Mr. Potts spent most of his career in the Washington area. He began performing in local nightclubs after being discharged from the Army in 1956. In the 1980's he led a big band twice a year at Blues Alley, Washington's main jazz room. He continued to perform locally until he moved to Florida in 1995.
        Although Mr. Potts mostly worked in support of other musicians, he did record occasionally as a leader. His best-known album was his first, ''The Jazz Soul of Porgy and Bess,'' recorded in 1959 with an all-star ensemble.
        He is survived by his daughter, Ms. Desky, of Davie, Fla.; a brother, Robert Potts of Reston, Va.; two sisters, Virginia Stafford of Alexandria, Va., and Janet Potter of Daytona Beach, Fla.; and two granddaughters. His marriages to Marjorie Johnson and Barbara Kleinkopf ended in divorce.
