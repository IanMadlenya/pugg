        After leaving Harvard, Mr. Boyer established the Shearwater imprint at Island Press, where he published two more books by Dr. Wilson, ''Naturalist'' (1994) and ''In Search of Nature'' (1996). After leaving Shearwater, Mr. Boyer worked at W.W. Norton & Company and the University of California Press.
