        Dr. Jack Munushian, a scientist in the aerospace industry and an educator at the University of Southern California who helped establish an innovative system to broadcast lectures to students off campus, died on May 28 in Los Angeles. He was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said a close friend, Zouhrab Bassmajian.
        An electrical engineer by training, Dr. Munushian began his career in the 1950's and worked as a scientist and manager in the aircraft and aerospace industries in Southern California.
        In 1968, he was recruited by U.S.C. to help build up its engineering programs. He was the founding chairman of the university's computer science department and director of its Graduate Center of Engineering Sciences.
        Dr. Munushian soon sensed that a larger pool of potential graduate students remained untapped. In the 1970's, he helped create the Instructional Television Network at U.S.C., which was used to reach engineers and other scientists at the region's aerospace companies. The concept, called distance learning, enabled part-time students to view live lectures from their workplaces.
        As a result, Dr. Munushian attracted thousands of new students and ''showed foresight in understanding that distance learning would continue to be important, and would even expand, as it transferred from remote television hookups to today's Internet,'' said Dr. William H. Steier, a professor of electrical engineering at U.S.C.
        Jack Munushian was born in Rochester. He graduated from the University of Rochester and earned his doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1954.
        He lived in Los Angeles and became a professor emeritus in 1994.
        No immediate family members survive him.
