        Anthony C. Russo, a former director of labor relations for the City of New York, died last Thursday in Queens. He was 88 and lived in Flushing, Queens.
        His death was announced by the Quinn-Fogarty Funeral Home in Flushing.
        Mr. Russo entered the civil service through the examination system set up by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia to replace political appointments, beginning as a clerk in the Department of Sanitation. He became a labor-management expert who served under seven New York mayors.
        Mr. Russo rose through the ranks at the Welfare and Labor Departments and eventually bargained with labor leaders like Mike Quill of the transit workers and Albert Shanker of the teachers' union.
        Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed Mr. Russo deputy commissioner of the Department of Labor. He worked as a mediator and administered the city's employee relations program.
        With the election of Mayor John V. Lindsay, Mr. Russo became assistant director of labor relations, then first deputy. Continuing as first deputy director of labor relations and later director under Mayor Abraham D. Beame, he led the city's negotiating teams in major contract talks.
        Mr. Russo was the incumbent director of labor relations when Mayor Edward I. Koch took office. Mr. Koch established the post of deputy mayor for labor relations, a job that eclipsed Mr. Russo's position. Mr. Russo stepped down as director in December 1978 and retired after 42 years in the city administration.
        Mr. Russo is survived by his wife, Marguerite, and a brother, Louis M. Russo.
