        The Rev. Rufus A. Strother Jr., who led a predominantly African-American congregation in northern Westchester County for 38 years and was noted for his work to foster understanding between races and to improve community relations, particularly during the years of the civil rights movement, died on Jan. 20 in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 74.
        His family announced his death but did not give a cause.
        Mr. Strother had retired amid great fanfare just a year ago from the Antioch Baptist Church, founded 111 years ago to serve the domestic workers living in and around Bedford Hills, a mainly white area. He created an annual banquet, promoted interfaith worship and started an educational seminar honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
        He was born in Orange, Va., and grew up in Millbrook, in Dutchess County, N.Y. He served in the Korean War, then attended school to become a minister. His first church was Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Stormville, N.Y., in 1960. Five years later, he moved to Antioch Baptist, where membership rose from 50 to 250 as a diverse congregation gathered to hear his sermons.
        He was moderator of the Central Hudson Baptist Association from 1979 to 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances Willis Strother; two daughters, Marcia Gross and Andrea Strother; and a grandson. He is also survived by four brothers, Lawrence and Gilbert Johnson and Philip and Richard Strother, and five sisters, Evelyn Johnson, Gloria Morgan, Ruth Latimore, Esther Latimore and Marie Mackie.
