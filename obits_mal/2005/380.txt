        Robert Plate, a freelance writer and author of historical biographies for young people, died on May 14 at his brother's home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 86 and formerly lived in Woodstock, N.Y.
        His death, after a long illness, was announced by his family.
        Mr. Plate wrote ''The Dinosaur Hunters: Cope and Marsh'' (1964), about the fierce rivalry of the paleontologists and fossil collectors Edward Drinker Cope (1840-1897) and Othniel Charles Marsh (1831-1899).
        He also wrote ''Palette and Tomahawk: The Story of George Catlin'' (1962); ''Alexander Wilson (1766-1813): Wanderer in the Wilderness'' (1966); ''Charles Wilson Peale: Son of Liberty, Father of Art and Science'' (1967); and ''John Singleton Copley: America's First Great Artist'' (1969).
        Born in Brooklyn, Robert Plate attended Duke University and N.Y.U. in the 1930's and started writing in 1940. A conscientious objector in World War II, he served as a forest-fire fighter with Dorothy Day's Catholic Workers instead. Early in his career, he contributed to comic strips like Captain Midnight and wrote crime tales and short stories. Later he wrote articles for national and arts journals and scripts for television.
        Besides his brother, William, Mr. Plate is survived by two sisters, Muriel Walker of Darien, Conn., and Betty Trivell of Manhattan.
