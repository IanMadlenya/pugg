        Sheldon H. White, a Harvard developmental psychologist whose research endorsed early childhood education programs like Head Start, died on March 17 at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. A resident of Newtonville, Mass., he was 76.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        As a researcher at the University of Chicago in the 1950's and early 60's, Dr. White studied children's eye movements and the effects of various stimuli in attracting their attention. He later connected the results to the next developmental step, learning.
        After moving to Harvard in 1963, Dr. White became interested in development of children ages 5 to 7, and his later research addressed the notion of instilling ethical behavior in children.
        From 1991 to 1993, Dr. White was chairman of a Department of Health and Human Services committee convened to evaluate Head Start. He also advised the Children's Television Workshop and the National Laboratory for Early Childhood Education.
        Dr. Brendan A. Maher, an emeritus professor of psychology at Harvard, noted that in the face of criticism of Head Start, Dr. White had found that ''when the smoke had blown away, the general conclusion was that it has been a success.''
        Dr. Maher added: ''Sheldon White was extremely sophisticated about the evaluation. He brought to it a great personal and scientific integrity.''
        Sheldon Harold White was born in Brooklyn. He earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard and a master's from Boston University in 1952. The University of Iowa awarded him a doctorate in psychology in 1957.
        Dr. White is survived by his wife of 47 years, Barbara Notkin White; two sons, Andrew S., of Lexington, Mass., and Gregory S., of Needham, Mass.; a brother, Aaron, of Framingham, Mass.; and three grandchildren.
