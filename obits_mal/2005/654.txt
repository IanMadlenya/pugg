        Thomas P. Lawless, the chief of police for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority since 2003, died on Wednesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 62 and lived in Flushing, Queens.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, which was diagnosed seven weeks ago, said his son-in-law, James M. Driscoll.
        Chief Lawless directed the transportation authority's 700-member department, which patrols the Long Island Rail Road and Pennsylvania Station; the Metro-North Railroad and Grand Central Terminal; and nine bridges and tunnels. (The New York Police Department's Transit Bureau is responsible for the subways.)
        "Tom oversaw the expansion of our canine and emergency-services units, and his years of police experience were invaluable, not only to the members of our department but to our customers," said William A. Morange, the authority's director of security and a former chief of patrol for the New York City police.
        Chief Lawless was born in Edgewater, N.J., and was raised in Queens. A graduate of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, he joined the New York Police Department in July 1965 and, over the next 38 years, rose to become an assistant chief, the third-highest uniformed rank.
        Among other positions, Chief Lawless was commander of the Police Academy in Manhattan and the 104th, 112th and 113th Precincts, all in Queens. He retired in December 2003 as the Queens South patrol commander and immediately joined the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
        Chief Lawless is survived by his wife, Ivonne Santiago Lawless; three sons, Kevin, Kristopher and Kerry, all of New Jersey; a daughter, Kristine Lawless-Driscoll of Levittown, N.Y., who is a New York City police detective; two stepchildren, Hernando Olaya and Jeanette Olaya; and eight grandchildren. He is also survived by his mother, Agnes; a brother, Dr. William P. Lawless; and two sisters, Maureen Lawless and Kathryn Cerame, all of Gilbert, Ariz.
