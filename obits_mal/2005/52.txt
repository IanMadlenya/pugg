        David Nyhan, a former political reporter, editor and influential columnist for The Boston Globe, died on Sunday at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 64.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Olivia. Mr. Nyhan had collapsed after shoveling snow.
        Mr. Nyhan, who spent 32 years at The Globe, retired from the paper in 2001. After that, he wrote a twice-weekly column for The Eagle-Tribune Company, which publishes four daily newspapers in New England.
        Well connected in Boston political circles and beyond -- he was a pallbearer at the funeral in 1994 of Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the former speaker of the House -- Mr. Nyhan remained a populist of liberal social conscience. In a 2001 interview with The Globe, Senator Edward M. Kennedy called him ''closer to the grass roots than almost any politician.''
        Charles David Nyhan Jr. was born in Boston on Dec. 23, 1940, and raised in Whiskey Point, the Irish working-class section of Brookline. He graduated from Harvard in 1962.
        After working for The Salem Evening News in Massachusetts, and The Associated Press, Mr. Nyhan joined The Globe in 1969 as statehouse bureau chief. He was a reporter, and later news editor, in the paper's Washington bureau, and its White House correspondent during the Ford administration. Mr. Nyhan, who began writing his op-ed column in 1985, was named an associate editor of The Globe two years later.
        He also wrote ''The Duke'' (Warner, 1988), a biography of Michael S. Dukakis.
        Mr. Nyhan's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, the former Olivia Hill, whom he married in 1978, he is survived by two children from his first marriage, Veronica Jones of Washington and Nicholas, of Brooklyn; a daughter from his second marriage, Kate; two brothers, Christopher, of South Portland, Me., and F. John, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a sister, Margaret Lockwood of Brookline; and two grandchildren.
