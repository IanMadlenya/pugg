        Victor Futter, a prominent New York lawyer and professor of law, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhasset. He was 86.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Until recently, Mr. Futter was special counsel to the dean and a professor of law at Hofstra University Law School. He had previously taught at Columbia University Law School and was also general counsel of Fairleigh Dickinson University.
        Mr. Futter was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 22, 1919. He earned a bachelor's degree from Columbia in 1939 and, in 1942, a law degree, also from Columbia, where he edited the Law Review.
        In World War II, he was an Army officer in the European theater and a military governor in Japan.
        Mr. Futter began his legal career with the New York firm Sullivan & Cromwell, where he worked from 1946 to 1952. In 1952, he became associate general counsel of the Allied Corporation (now Honeywell International); at his retirement in 1984, he was a vice president and secretary there. He was later a partner in the New York office of the law firm now known as Sills Cummis.
        Mr. Futter is survived by his wife, the former Joan Feinberg, whom he married in 1943; three children: Jeffrey, of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., Ellen, the president of the American Museum of Natural History, and Deborah, of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
