        John Sahag, a Manhattan hairstylist for many celebrities with a dry-cut method that challenged the old routine of shampoo, rinse and repeat at upscale beauty salons, died on June 15 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 53.
        The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by the John Sahag Workshop, the Madison Avenue salon where he developed his signature technique of building texture by cutting hair in a series of uneven layers, seemingly on blind intuition.
        With his leather pants and unruly mop of hair he was often described as the industry's rock star. He created recent styles for the actresses Jennifer Aniston and Debra Messing, but he is perhaps best known for the boy cut he gave Demi Moore for the 1990 film ''Ghost,'' prompting a trend of short, choppy styles for women.
        ''John was like the mad professor of hair,'' said Edward Tricomi, owner of the Warren-Tricomi salon, who along with Mr. Sahag advocated a shift to dry-cutting in the late 1970's because it gave greater command of how a style would ultimately look.
        ''It was the difference from painting by numbers to sketching a haircut by hand,'' Mr. Tricomi said. ''You didn't cut a haircut, you felt it.''
        Mr. Sahag, whose original name was Sahag Jamgotchian, was born on Jan. 2, 1952, in Beirut, Lebanon. He was raised in Australia, where he started sweeping the floor in a hair salon as a child. At 18 he moved to Paris, where he learned his craft.
        He opened his first salon in New York in 1985.
        Mr. Sahag is survived by his father, Atum Jamgotchian; his mother, Hatum; a sister, Mary; and three brothers, Hoveness, Andr√© and Jack.
