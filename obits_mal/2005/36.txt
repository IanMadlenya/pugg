        Howard Feuer, a prominent casting director who filled roles for scores of Hollywood movies and Broadway shows, died on Dec. 20 at Hackensack Hospital in New Jersey. He was 56.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his mother, Gertrude Feuerstein.
        Mr. Feuer's credits include a long list of theatrical productions, many of them cast collaboratively with Jeremy Ritzer. Among them are three plays by Michael Frayn -- ''Noises Off,'' ''Benefactors'' and ''Wild Honey'' -- presented in the 1980's, and ''42nd Street,'' ''Barnum'' and ''Oh! Calcutta!''
        Mr. Feuer went on to become one of the busiest casting directors for movies, including ''Moonstruck,'' ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' ''Philadelphia'' and ''The Truman Show.'' He worked with the directors Jonathan Demme and Bernardo Bertolucci, among others. Norman Jewison, who directed ''Moonstruck,'' said in a statement that Mr. Feuer's ''knowledge of artists working in New York theater was immense.''
        In addition to his mother, Mr. Feuer is survived by his father, Monte Feuerstein, of Fair Lawn, N.J., and a sister, Donna Epstein of Pine Brook, N.J.
