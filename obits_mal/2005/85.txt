        Steve Burgh, a record producer and session musician who played with Billy Joel, Phoebe Snow, Steve Forbert, David Bromberg and others, died on Monday at his home in Kingston, N.Y. He was 54.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his lawyer, Leslie Berman.
        Mr. Burgh was a versatile sideman and producer whose talents were sought by a varied crowd of musicians during the 1970's and 80's. He played with John Prine, Judy Collins, Willie Nelson and Steve Goodman, and he was a guitarist on Mr. Joel's 1976 album ''The Stranger,'' including the Grammy-winning song ''Just the Way You Are.'' He was the musical director for Phoebe Snow and played with Gladys Knight, Paul Anka and Richie Havens.
        In 1982 Mr. Burgh started a recording studio, Baby Monster, in Lower Manhattan, and it flourished for more than a decade with sessions by the Ramones, Emmylou Harris, John Cage, Daniel Lanois, Luscious Jackson and Cypress Hill, among many others. After moving to Accord, N.Y., a decade ago, he recently moved to Kingston and opened 33, a nightclub and recording studio.
        Born in Trenton, Mr. Burgh got an early start in music playing with his band, Jacob's Creek, and playing widely as a guitarist. A music fan recently approached him with a photograph of Jimi Hendrix taken early in his career at a club in New York, and asked Mr. Burgh to identify the others players in the picture. One guitarist was Mr. Burgh.
        He is survived by his mother, Zeldine Schwartzman Golden; his twin children, Juliet and Louis; two half sisters, Elizabeth Golden and Jennifer Devos; four half brothers, Harry, Robert and Mark Burgh, and Todd Golden; and his former wife, Jamie Burgh.
