        John F. Lawrence, who led The Los Angeles Times in creating one of the first separate business sections in a general-interest newspaper, died on Jan. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 70.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Kathleen Hale, who said he did not smoke.
        In his two decades as an editor and columnist at The Times, and earlier as an assistant managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Lawrence pushed for aggressive business reporting. He helped reporters decipher financial records, humanize companies and report scandals like the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980's and abuses in the mutual fund industry in the 1960's.
        Business coverage became a regular part of The Times's front page, helping inspire other newspapers to expand and promote their financial coverage.
        As chief of The Times's Washington bureau during the Watergate scandal, he was jailed briefly in 1972 for refusing to turn over tape recordings of a confidential interview of Alfred C. Baldwin III, a government witness, conducted by two Times reporters.
        John Frederick Lawrence was born in Cleveland on Feb. 6, 1934, and received a bachelor's degree in government from Oberlin College.
        He began reporting for The Wall Street Journal in 1956 and later headed its Philadelphia and Pittsburgh bureaus. He left in 1968 as assistant managing editor in charge of its Pacific Coast edition.
        He became a senior editor at Fortune in 1988. In 1989, he joined the New York Stock Exchange as vice president for communications, a position he later held at the Capital Group Companies.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Lawrence is survived by three sons, Wesley, of Portland, Ore.; David, of Santa Clara, Calif.; and William, of Pasadena, Calif.; a daughter, Deborah Griego of Mountain View, Calif.; and seven grandchildren. His previous marriage ended in divorce.
