        Sir Edwin A.G. Manton, a longtime executive of the insurance conglomerate American International Group who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II of England for charitable contributions to the Tate Gallery in London, died on Oct. 1 at New York Weill Cornell Hospital. He was 96 and lived in Manhattan.
        Sir Edwin died of natural causes after being hospitalized for a week, his lawyer, Henry Christensen III, said.
        ''Sir Edwin Manton was one of the most generous benefactors in Tate's history,'' Sir Nicholas Serota, the director of the Tate, said in a statement.
        He worked for most of his professional life in New York City, joining American International Underwriters, a member of the C.V. Starr insurance group, in 1933.
        When the company was restructured as the A.I.G. group, Sir Edwin became one of the leading forces in expanding the company's international property insurance division, Martin J. Sullivan, the current president and chief executive of A.I.G., said.
        At his death, he was an honorary director and senior adviser.
        Sir Edwin remained a British citizen and was a private collector of British art. As a way to serve both Britain and his adopted home, he established the American Fund for the Tate Gallery in 1987 with a gift of A.I.G. shares, providing a $6.5 million endowment.
        The Fund helps Americans donate to the Tate museums, which include the Tate Britain and the Tate Modern in London, and facilitates acquisitions of North and South American art for international collections.
        Sir Edwin also contributed to special projects for the galleries. He received the title of Knight Bachelor for his services to the Tate in 1994.
        Edwin Alfred Grenville Manton was born in Essex, England, in 1909. His wife, Florence, died in 2003. He is survived by a daughter, Diana H. Morton of Wayland, Mass.; two granddaughters; and five great-grandchildren.
