        Milton Elkin, who founded the radiology department at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in 1954 and led it for 32 years, died on Oct. 31 in West Hartford, Conn. A former resident of Scarsdale, N.Y., he was 89.
        His death was announced by the medical school, an affiliate of Yeshiva University. His family said the cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease.
        Dr. Elkin stepped down as chairman in 1986 and continued to teach as a distinguished professor of radiology before taking emeritus status some years ago.
        Milton Elkin was born in Boston. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard in 1937 and received his medical degree there in 1941. During World War II he served as a flight surgeon in the United States Air Force, and later worked at medical centers in Boston and Los Angeles. After his appointment at Albert Einstein, he helped build the radiology department into a nationally recognized unit, meanwhile serving as director of radiology at Bronx Municipal Hospital Center (now Jacobi Medical Center).
        Dr. Elkin's medical writings include a two-volume textbook.
        Dr. Elkin's wife, the former Gloria King, died in 1996 after 53 years of marriage. He is survived by a son, Dr. Phil Elkin of Blue Hill, Me.; two daughters, Laura Friedman of West Hartford and Karen Segall of Scarsdale; and six grandchildren.
