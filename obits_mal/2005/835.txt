        Don Caswell, a veteran copy editor in the culture, style and foreign news departments of The New York Times, died on Tuesday at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 65.
        The cause was complications of emphysema, said his brother-in-law, Dale Franz.
        Mr. Caswell, who joined the paper in 1977 and retired in February, was known as an uncommon perfectionist, and he edited many of The Times's reviewers and critics, including Ruth Reichl, the paper's restaurant reviewer from 1993 to 1999.
        In her book ''Garlic and Sapphires: The Secret Life of a Critic in Disguise,'' Ms. Reichl singled out Mr. Caswell with affection as ''the longtime bane of my existence'' who each week challenged her assumptions.
        Mr. Caswell graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in journalism. Before joining The Times, he was an editor at The Philadelphia Bulletin.
        His survivors include a sister, Sandra Myers Franz.
