        Robert Alan Maguire, an authority on early Soviet literature and the writings of Nikolai Gogol, died on July 8 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 75 and lived in Morningside Heights in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was cancer, according to Columbia University, where he was the Boris Bakhmeteff professor emeritus in the Department of Slavic Languages.
        Dr. Maguire, who joined the faculty in 1962, concentrated on 19th- and 20th-century Russian literature. He wrote a standard text, ''Red Virgin Soil: Soviet Literature in the 1920's'' (Princeton University Press, 1968) . He also wrote ''Exploring Gogol'' (Stanford University Press, 1994), for which he won a prize from the Modern Language Association in 1995 for outstanding work in Slavic languages and literature.
        Dr. Maguire translated works of prose and poetry from Russian and Polish, including, with John Earl Malmstad, Andrei Bely's ''Petersburg'' (1977). According to Columbia, he had just finished a new translation of Dostoyevsky's ''Demons.'' Robert Maguire was born in Canton, Mass. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1951, served in the Army and completed his studies at Columbia, receiving a master's degree in 1953 and a doctorate in 1961. Appointed to the faculty a year later, he was promoted to full professor in 1970 and was named Bakhmeteff professor of Russian studies in 1992. He was chairman of the Department of Slavic Languages in the 1970's and 80's, and retired in 2003.
        Dr. Maguire was a past president of the American Gogol Society. An accomplished viola player, he was also on the board of the amateur Chamber Music Conference.
        He is survived by a brother, Thomas, of Traverse City, Mich.
