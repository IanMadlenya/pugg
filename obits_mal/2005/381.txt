        Walter Schaap, a jazz fan who became one of the first jazz scholars, died in New York on May 28. He was 87 and lived in Hollis, Queens.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, the jazz historian and broadcaster Phil Schaap.
        Mr. Schaap studied French history at Columbia University and was doing postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in 1937 when he became friends with the pioneering French jazz researchers Charles Delaunay and Hughes Panassie.
        He translated much of their work and that of other writers, including the Swiss conductor Ernst Ansermet, whose review of a 1919 performance by the soprano saxophonist Sidney Bechet is widely regarded as the first published work of jazz criticism.
        Mr. Schaap was soon writing about jazz for various publications, in both English and French, and working in the nascent field of jazz discography. He contributed to all editions of Delaunay's ''Hot Discography,'' the first comprehensive reference book of jazz recordings, and helped edit the final edition, ''New Hot Discography,'' in 1948.
        From 1949 until he retired, in 1970, he was the vice president of a company that made filmstrips and other educational materials.
        Mr. Schaap's wife, Marjorie, died in 1990. He is survived by his son.
