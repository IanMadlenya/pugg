        Jonathan Thomas, a sculptor who exhibited widely in North America, died on Monday at his home in New York. He was 59.
        The cause was bladder cancer, said his partner, the playwright Edward Albee.
        Mr. Thomas worked in wood, wood pulp, polymer resin and steel to create a series of abstract, African-inspired totems. He also exhibited related works called language robes, which were bannerlike constructions draped over armatures.
        He was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and earned a bachelor's degree in science and mathematics in 1968 and another in art history in 1969, both from McMaster University in Ontario. He did graduate studies in art history at the University of Toronto.
        In addition to Mr. Albee, he is survived by two sisters, JoAnn Wolfarth and Mary Lou Lafford, in Canada.
