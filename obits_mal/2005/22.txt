        Joseph S. Frelinghuysen, whose memoir, ''Passages to Freedom,'' chronicled his escape from a prison camp in Italy during World War II, died on Saturday in Morristown, N.J. He was 92 and lived in Far Hills, N.J.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his daughter Barbara F. Israel.
        Mr. Frelinghuysen, born to a prominent New Jersey family who had served in the military since the Revolutionary War, was a first lieutenant with the artillery in northwestern Africa when he was captured in November 1942 and taken to a prison camp in Italy. In September 1943, he and another American prisoner, Richard M. Rossbach, crawled through the camp's wire fences. But the British Eighth Army, which they had hoped to join, was stationed on the other side of the Apennines.
        At one point on their trek, a young couple, Berardino and Letizia DiGiacomantonio, took the risk of sheltering them. Though the Germans briefly recaptured Mr. Rossbach, each man eventually succeeded in rejoining the Allied forces. Several years later, Mr. Frelinghuysen helped the DiGiacomantonios to move with their children to the United States. They live in Raritan, N.J.
        Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen was born in East Hampton, N.Y., on Aug. 11, 1912, and graduated from Princeton in 1934.
        After the war, Mr. Frelinghuysen worked at the family's insurance firm, and later managed the family's dairy business in Somerville, N.J.
        Mr. Frelinghuysen's wife of 67 years, Emily Lawrance Frelinghuysen, died on Dec. 23 at the age of 93.
        In addition to his daughter Barbara, of Manhattan, he is survived by a son, Joseph S. Frelinghuysen Jr. of Pottersville, N.J.; two other daughters, Margaret F. Kurzman of Manhattan and Susan F. van Roijen of Orlando; a sister, Emily F. MacFarland of Sun Valley, Idaho; 10 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
