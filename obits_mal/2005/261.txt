        Ralph D. Gardner, a writer and advertising executive and a biographer of Horatio Alger, died on March 30 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, his son Ralph Jr. said.
        A freelance contributor to The New York Times and other publications on military, travel and other subjects, Mr. Gardner was best known for ''Horatio Alger: Or, The American Hero Era,'' a study of the life and work of the author of up-by-the-bootstraps tales.
        Reviewing Mr. Gardner's book in The New York Times Book Review, Hal Borland expressed reservations about its worshipful approach to its subject, but said that ''it offers what is probably the best bibliography yet in print'' of Alger's work.
        Mr. Gardner began his career in 1942 as an office boy at The Times, and later worked on the paper's picture desk in New York, Paris and Frankfurt. He left The Times in 1955 to start his own agency, Ralph D. Gardner Advertising.
        Mr. Gardner was born in Manhattan on April 16, 1923. He received a certificate in journalism from New York University in 1942 and a certificate in military administration from Colorado State College the next year. He changed his surname from Goldburgh around 1950.
        In addition to his son, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Gardner is survived by his wife, the former Nellie Jaglom; two other sons, Peter, of Hanover, N.H., and James, of Manhattan; and six grandchildren. Another son, John, died in 1987.
