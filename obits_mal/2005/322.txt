        Benny Bailey, an American trumpet player who for most of his career was a well-known fixture on the European jazz scene, died on April 14 at his home in Amsterdam. He was 79.
        His death was announced by city officials, who did not specify the cause.
        Mr. Bailey was admired by his fellow musicians for his versatility and his prodigious technique. He was still young when he became one of the first of a wave of bebop-era musicians to move to Europe, and he remained relatively unknown in the United States.
        Ernest Harold Bailey was born in Cleveland on Aug. 13, 1925. He studied trumpet at the Cleveland Conservatory of Music and began his career with the rhythm-and-blues bands of Bull Moose Jackson and Scatman Crothers. He toured Europe with Dizzy Gillespie's big band in 1948, and later that year joined Lionel Hampton, with whom he spent five years before quitting in the middle of a European tour and settling in Sweden. He moved to Amsterdam in the 1990's.
        Except for a brief return to the United States in 1960, Europe remained his base of operations for the rest of his life. His occasional return visits included weeklong engagements at the Village Vanguard in New York in 1995 and 1996.
        Mr. Bailey spent a decade with the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band and toured with the George Gruntz Concert Jazz Band. He also worked frequently with both visiting and expatriate American musicians.
        But for all his accomplishments, he was probably best known for about 60 seconds of music: his impassioned improvisation on the hit single ''Compared to What,'' recorded at the 1969 Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland with the pianist and singer Les McCann and the saxophonist Eddie Harris.
        ''When I went back to the States about 10 years later,'' he told an interviewer, ''I found the only way people knew about me -- especially young people -- was through that record.''
