        Paul Hester, the drummer for the New Zealand pop band Crowded House, was found dead on Saturday near his home in Melbourne, Australia. He was 46.
        Mr. Hester had hanged himself from a tree in a nearby park, a representative of Melbourne's Metropolitan Ambulance Service told The Associated Press. He was last seen taking his dogs for a walk late Friday night.
        Mr. Hester was born in Melbourne but became one of the best-known pop musicians in New Zealand. In the early 1980's he played with Neil Finn in Split Enz, and in 1985 formed Crowded House with Mr. Finn and the bassist Nick Seymour. Many critics compared the group's songwriting to that of the Beatles, and its first album, ''Crowded House,'' released in 1986, became a worldwide best seller. Two of the album's songs, ''Don't Dream It's Over'' and ''Something So Strong,'' became staples on the radio and on MTV.
        The band's later albums were hits in Australia and in Britain, but despite widespread critical acclaim, never became big sellers in the United States. Mr. Hester, usually the joker of the group, surprised many listeners with ''Italian Plastic,'' a delicate and melodic song he wrote for the band's 1991 album, ''Woodface.'' He quit Crowded House in 1994, citing the pressures of touring and frustration over the music business, and the group ended soon after.
        Since leaving Crowded House, Mr. Hester had worked as a television and radio announcer. His survivors include two daughters.
