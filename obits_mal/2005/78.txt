        Paul Good, a television and print journalist known for his coverage of the civil rights movement, died on Jan. 23 in Greenwich, Conn. He was 75 and lived in Westport, Conn.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Regan.
        Mr. Good was best known for his reporting from the South in the 1960's, first for ABC News and later as a freelance newspaper and magazine writer. He wrote several books on race relations, including ''The American Serfs: A Report on Poverty in the Rural South'' (Putnam, 1968); ''The Trouble I've Seen: White Journalist/Black Movement'' (Howard University, 1975); and a novel set in the South, ''Once to Every Man'' (Putnam, 1970).
        Paul Joseph Good Jr. was born in Brooklyn on March 11, 1929. In the 1940's, he briefly attended Brown University and Boston University before going to work as a journalist, first as a rewrite man on The New York World-Telegram and Sun, and later as a news writer, editor and producer at NBC. In 1960, he joined ABC, where he was the Latin American bureau chief and the Southern bureau chief, based in Atlanta.
        In 1964, Mr. Good left ABC to focus on advocacy journalism. He interviewed many of the principal figures in the civil rights movement, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy. Mr. Good's work appeared in The Nation, The Washington Post, The New York Times Magazine and elsewhere; he also wrote two monographs for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, ''Cycle to Nowhere'' (1968) and ''Cairo, Illinois: Racism at Floodtide'' (1973). From 1981 to 1991, Mr. Good was head of the journalism and public relations department at the School of Visual Arts in New York.
        Mr. Good's wife, the former Ruth Thompson, died in 1994; a son, Sean Richard, died in 2002. He is survived by his daughter, of Brooklyn, and one grandchild.
