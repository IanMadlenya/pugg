        Gordon K. Greenfield, whose QTV brand of teleprompters is used by the White House and in thousands of TV newsrooms, died on Jan. 7 at his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He was 89.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Greenfield, a veteran business executive, bought QTV when it was a fledgling equipment maker that had recently acquired the rights to the original TelePrompTer, a device for public speakers that displays words on a screen. The company went on to provide prompters to every president since Lyndon B. Johnson.
        In 1984, Mr. Greenfield acquired Autocue, the company that patented the teleprompter in Britain, and he sold the combined company in 2000 to a group that included its British management. The company now supplies its prompting equipment and software to the major American television networks and the BBC.
        Before buying QTV, Mr. Greenfield led City Specialty Stores, the parent company of department stores like Oppenheim Collins and Franklin Simon, and was president of two holding companies, the America Corporation and the Franchard Corporation.
        Mr. Greenfield was a major benefactor of the Manhattan School of Music. He was a member of its board of trustees for 34 years and was its chairman from 1981 to 1994.
        Gordon Kraus Greenfield was born in Philadelphia on June 16, 1915, and graduated from Princeton.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Harriet Copelin Greenfield; three daughters, Juliet Six and Faith Lewis, both of Washington, and Hope Greenfield of Califon, N.J.; two sons, Gordon K. Greenfield Jr. of Norwich, Vt., and James Greenfield of Manhattan; a sister, Elizabeth Zeidman of Wyncote, Pa.; a brother, Albert M. Greenfield Jr. of Glen Moore, Pa.; and seven grandchildren.
