        Stephen Edward Weil, a legal expert in the arts and a museum administrator long associated with the Smithsonian Institution, died on Tuesday in Washington. He was 77.
        The cause was liver failure, his family said.
        A lawyer by training and a former official of the Whitney Museum of American Art, Mr. Weil became the deputy director of the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 1974. He retired from that post in 1995 and became senior scholar emeritus at the Smithsonian Center for Education and Museum Studies.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Weil graduated from Brown University in 1949 and received an L.L.B. from Columbia University Law School in 1956. He practiced as an associate with what was then the New York firm of Rosenman, Colin, Kaye, Petschek & Freund. He was a vice president and general manager of the Marlborough Gallery from 1963 to 1967 and an administrator, secretary and trustee of the Whitney in New York from then until 1974.
        Mr. Weil was an expert in copyrights, trusteeships and the sale of artworks from museum collections. He was on the faculty of the Museum Management Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1979 to 1996.
        He wrote often for art and museum periodicals, and he was a co-author of ''Art Law: Rights and Liabilities of Creators and Collectors'' (1986). His books now in print are ''Rethinking the Museum and Other Meditations'' (1990), ''A Cabinet of Curiosities: Inquiries Into Museums and Their Prospects'' (1995), ''A Deaccession Reader'' (1997) and ''Making Museums Matter'' (2002).
        Mr. Weil's marriages to Rose Reicherson Weil of Brooklyn and Elizabeth Perry of Washington ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife of 15 years, Wendy Luke; a daughter and two sons from his first marriage, Rachel J. Weil of Ithaca, N.Y., David N., of Providence, R.I., and Michael D., of Brooklyn; and four grandchildren.
