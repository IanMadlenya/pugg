        Tom Dillon, a former president of the Actors' Fund, a social-service organization for members of the entertainment industry, died on Monday at the Lillian Booth Actors' Home in Englewood, N.J. He was 86 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was complications of the flu, his wife, Alice, said.
        Mr. Dillon, who began his career as an Irish tenor, became a trustee of the Actors' Fund in 1973 and was the organization's president from 1989 to 2004. He oversaw a range of services, including skilled-nursing and assisted-living centers, and affordable housing for people with AIDS.
        Thomas Joseph Dillon was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 3, 1918, and as a young man performed in stock, vaudeville and burlesque. In the Army Air Forces during World War II, he performed on Broadway in Moss Hart's revue ''Winged Victory,'' and he later appeared on television variety programs. From 1966 to 1982, Mr. Dillon worked in the composing room at The New York Times.
        Mr. Dillon's wife, the former Alice Parker, is his only immediate survivor.
