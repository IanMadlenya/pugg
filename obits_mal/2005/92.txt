        John Patterson, a television director whose frequent work on crime shows included every season finale of ''The Sopranos'' on HBO, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 64.
        The cause was prostate cancer, HBO announced.

        He also directed the pilot episode of ''Law & Order'' in 1988.
        His work on ''The Sopranos,'' where he was one of a core group of directors, earned him two Emmy Award nominations, in 2000 for the episode with Pussy's death and in 2003 for the show where Tony and Carmela split. Mr. Patterson directed 13 of the show's 65 episodes.
