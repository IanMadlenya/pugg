        Milton A. Wolf, an economist, investor and real estate developer who headed the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and served as President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to Austria in the late 1970's, died Thursday at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He was 80.
        The cause was complications of lymphoma, according to the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland, which announced his death.
        Mr. Wolf, a native of Cleveland, was a prominent supporter of the American Jewish Committee. He was president of the distribution committee from 1993 to 1996 and remained active as a life trustee.
        After serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II, Mr. Wolf graduated with a B.A. in chemistry and biology from Ohio State in 1948, and a B.S. in civil engineering from the Case Institute of Technology in 1954. He returned to Case, which by then had become Case Western Reserve, for an M.A. in economics in 1973 and a Ph.D. 20 years later.
        Mr. Wolf founded the Zehman-Wolf Construction Company in Cleveland in 1948 and led it for 28 years, building shopping centers and housing. In 1980, he founded Milton A. Wolf Investors. He taught international economics at Case Western Reserve from 1981 to 1987.
        In 1977 President Carter chose him as his ambassador to Vienna. After he left the post of ambassador, he was active in President Carter's unsuccessful campaign for re-election. He had a personal rapport with Austria's chancellor Bruno Kreisky and kept his ties to Vienna; at his death, he was chairman of the American Austrian Foundation.
        Mr. Wolf's wife, Roslyn Zehman Wolf, died in 2001 after 53 years of marriage. He is survived by a son, Leslie E.; three daughters, Caryn W. Wechsler, Dr. Nancy Wolf and Dr. Sherri Wolf; and five grandchildren.
