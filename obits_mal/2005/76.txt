        J. Richard Butler, a former executive director of Church World Service, an international relief and development agency, died on Jan. 25 at his home in New York City. He was 74.
        The cause was complications of prostate cancer, according to the agency, which announced the death.
        As the agency's executive director in the mid-1980's, Mr. Butler oversaw humanitarian work in more than 80 countries. At the time of his death, he was special assistant to Joseph C. Hough Jr., president of Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan.
        Mr. Butler received a bachelor's degree from Earlham College and a master's from Johns Hopkins. He held positions with the United Church of Christ and the World Council of Churches, among other organizations. During the Iranian hostage crisis, Mr. Butler, working for Church World Service, helped arrange for three American clergymen to visit the hostages on Christmas in 1979.
        Mr. Butler is survived by his wife, Barbara Henshaw Butler, from whom he was separated; three children, Mark, Ann and Martha; and five grandchildren.
