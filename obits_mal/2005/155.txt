        Don Celender, an art professor and quirky Conceptual artist whose projects involved taking polls, died on March 3 in Pittsburgh. He was 73 and lived in St. Paul, Minn.
        The cause was cancer, said Ivan C. Karp of the OK Harris Gallery in SoHo, his longtime representative.
        Mr. Celender, who was born in Pittsburgh in 1931, earned a bachelor of fine art degree from Carnegie Mellon University in 1956 and a Ph.D. in art history from the University of Pittsburgh in 1963. After working briefly in the department of education at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, he taught at Macalester College in St. Paul until he learned of his illness in January.
        In 1969, with Conceptual Art gaining steam, Mr. Celender began a series of letter-writing campaigns that spoofed the movement while spreading its ideas and gathering interesting information. With his Cultural Art Movement he sent outlandish proposals to 25 museum directors, suggesting for example that Sherman Lee, director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, drop by parachute1,000 works of Asian art from the museum's collection, one at a time, onto the state of Alabama. Mr. Lee replied that since art was in the mind of the beholder, he had ''mentally performed'' Mr. Celender's idea.
        In subsequent works, Mr. Celender surveyed film directors, prison wardens, labor leaderss, religious figures, travel agents, celebrities and famous chefs about their art preferences. He also produced a series of baseball cards using artists' faces.
        Mr. Celender's work was included in many books and exhibitions surveying Conceptual Art. On a nearly annual basis, he tacked the responses to his surveys to the walls of Mr. Karp's gallery, mounting 29 exhibitions from 1970 to 2004.
        He is survived by his daughter, Catherine; and two sisters, Norma DePrimio and Teresa D'Amico, and two brothers, James and Joseph, all of the Pittsburgh area.
