        Edward J. Czerwinski, a specialist in Slavic literature and culture who as a theater impresario in the 1970's and 80's introduced many important Eastern European artists to American audiences, died on Feb. 16 in Erie, Pa. He was 75.
        His friend Edgar Stroke announced his death.
        As founder and director of the Slavic Cultural Center in Port Jefferson, N.Y., Dr. Czerwinski presented theater, dance, concerts, readings and exhibitions by artists like Witold Gombrowicz, Ivan Klima, Jozef Szajna and Jerzy Grotowski.
        Fluent in Polish, Russian, Croatian and Czech, he also translated many Eastern European and Russian works into English.
        Edward Joseph Czerwinski was born on June 6, 1929, in Erie, one of 10 children of Joseph Czerwinski, a steelworker, and Anna Branecka Czerwinski. After his father died and his mother was hospitalized, he was reared by his older siblings, who encouraged him to go to college.
        He went on to earn two master's degrees and then two doctorates, one in English and American literature from Emory University (1957) and one in Russian and Polish literature from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1965). He began his teaching career in 1957 at the Georgia Institute of Technology and ended it as a full professor of Slavic languages and literature at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where he taught from 1979 to 1993.
        He wrote and published many articles and books and founded the Slavic Center in 1970. He is survived by two brothers, Walter and Richard, and two sisters, Estelle Dworakowski and Florence Bablak, all of Erie.
