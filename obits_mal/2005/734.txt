        Graham Payn, a handsome, debonair actor and singer who for 30 years was the companion of the playwright Noël Coward, died on Nov. 4 at the home the two had shared, Les Avants, in the Swiss Alps above Montreux. He was 87.
        His death was announced on the Web site of the Noël Coward Society in London, www.noelcoward.net.
        Mr. Payn, who was a co-editor of Coward's diaries, which was published in 1982, and wrote the 1994 memoir ''My Life With Noël Coward,'' began his career on the London stage as a child. He appeared in a 1931 production of ''Peter Pan'' as a 13-year-old and, a year later, sang in a Coward revue, ''Words and Music.''
        In 1945, he was in Coward's first postwar revue, ''Sigh No More,'' this time performing a well-known song, ''Matelot,'' which Coward had written expressly for him. The next year, Coward wrote a major part for him in ''Pacific 1860,'' which starred Mary Martin.
        Though he was not a star, Mr. Payn, who was almost 20 years younger than Coward, appeared regularly in London over the next 15 years, acting in both musicals and dramas by a variety of playwrights. He also traveled to Broadway in 1948 to perform with Gertrude Lawrence in Coward's ''Tonight at 8:30.''
        He had movie roles as well, appearing in the adaptation of Coward's ''Astonished Heart'' and the 1969 version of ''The Italian Job.''
        Mr. Payn's personal relationship with Coward continued until Coward's death at 73 in 1973. The two were frequent hosts of celebrities and British royalty at their homes in Switzerland and Jamaica, giving the irrepressible Coward ample opportunity to hold court.
        Graham Payn was born in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, in 1918 and moved with his family to England in 1929. He oversaw Coward's estate after the playwright's death, often traveling to give talks about Coward and their life together.
