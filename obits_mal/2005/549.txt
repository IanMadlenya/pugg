        David Teitelbaum, a prominent corporate lawyer who helped found the Brooklyn Philharmonic in 1954 and was its first president, died on Aug. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 98.
        Mr. Teitelbaum's family confirmed the death.
        A partner in the New York law firm Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine, Mr. Teitelbaum was president of the Brooklyn Philharmonia, as the orchestra was originally known, from 1954 to 1962. He was chairman of the orchestra's board from 1962 to 1971.
        The orchestra, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, took about a year to plan its first concert, an all-Beethoven program, on May 3, 1955, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Its name was changed to the Brooklyn Philharmonic in 1982.
        Mr. Teitelbaum was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 21, 1906. As an amateur pianist, he accompanied silent films in movie houses as a teenager. He earned a bachelor's degree in English literature from New York University in 1926 and a law degree from Harvard in 1929.
        Mr. Teitelbaum became a senior partner at Donovan, Leisure in 1936. From 1975 to 1977, during New York's fiscal crisis, he served on the Temporary Commission on City Finances.
        Mr. Teitelbaum's first wife, the former Sylvia Lowenthal, whom he married in 1937, died in 1984. His second wife, the former Ruth Horowitz Lea, died in the early 1990's. He is survived by two children from his first marriage, Richard, a composer at Bard College, and Tim, a computer scientist at Cornell; a brother, Bernard, of Denver; two grandsons; and two great-grandsons.
