        Marion J. Levy Jr., a scholar of sociology and international affairs who wrote about modernization theory, which seeks to explain why some societies undergo rapid economic development and corresponding social change, died on May 26 in Princeton, N.J., where he lived. He was 83.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, according to Princeton University.
        Dr. Levy retired in 1989 as Musgrave Professor of Sociology and International Affairs at Princeton. He had taught there since 1947 and was chairman of its department of East Asian studies for a time.
        He once said that ''the fundamental problem posed by modernization is whether human animals can adjust as readily to longevity, affluence, and peace as they have in the past to shortgevity, poverty, and war.'' He predicted that life in a modernized world ''is likely to become crowded, affluent, nasty, brutish and long.''
        His writings include the book ''Modernization: Latecomers and Survivors'' (1972), and the two-volume work ''Modernization and the Structure of Societies'' (1966), which examined the differences between societies that were relatively nonmodernized and those that were relatively modernized. He carried out innovative scholarship about why Japan, not China, was in the vanguard of modernization in Asia, concluding that while many assumed the two countries were similar when they were first opened to Western influence, in reality the similarities were only superficial.
        Marion Joseph Levy was born and raised in Galveston, Tex., was a Navy lieutenant in Asia in World War II and received a doctorate in sociology from Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife, Joy; a daughter, Dore J. Levy of Providence, R.I., who is a professor of comparative literature and East Asian studies at Brown; two sons, Noah, of Atlanta, and Amos, of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and a sister, Ruth Levy Kempner of Galveston.
