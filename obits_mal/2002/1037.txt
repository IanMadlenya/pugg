        Ward Davenny, a pianist, an administrator and a professor emeritus of piano at the School of Music at Yale University, died on Dec. 10 at his home in New Haven. He was 86 and had remained active in performing, organizing concerts and teaching.
        Born in Ashtabula, Ohio, on July 28, 1916, Mr. Davenny attended the Cleveland Institute of Music, graduating with a bachelor's degree at 17, then studied at Yale, earning a bachelor's degree in music in 1936 and a master's degree in music in 1937.
        After a year's residency at the American Academy in Rome, he joined the faculty at Yale in 1939, leaving for a tour of duty in the Army from 1943 to 1946. He then was the director of the Hartford School of Music until 1954, when he became director of the Cleveland Institute. While there, he performed extensively, including as a member of a piano duo with Arthur Loesser that appeared several times with the Cleveland Orchestra, under George Szell.
        Mr. Davenny returned to Yale in 1960 as the chairman of the piano department. Though he appeared regularly as a recitalist and performed 36 piano concertos, he was particularly known for his work in chamber music, regularly performing at the university and at the Yale Summer School of Music and Art, in Norfolk, Conn., with resident and guest ensembles including the Yale, Guarneri, Tokyo, Fine Arts, Muir and Berkshire String Quartets. After retiring in 1987, he was a visiting professor at the University of Illinois from 1989 to 1991.
        Mr. Davenny is survived by two daughters, Susan Davenny Wyner, formerly a soprano and now a conductor, of Medford, Mass.; and Katherine Davenny, an epidemiologist, of Cedar Grove, Md.; a son, Ward L. Davenny, an art professor, of Carlisle, Pa.; four grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
