        Scott Shuger, an early Internet journalist who wrote the popular column ''Today's Papers'' for the online magazine Slate, died on Saturday while diving off the coast of California just south of Los Angeles. He was 50 and lived in Los Angeles.
        His body was found in the water a little off the shore by kayakers. The cause of his death was not known, his family said; an autopsy is pending.
        In 1997, Microsoft's publication Slate hired him to write a new daily column, described by Slate as the first to depend on the Internet for both its subject matter and its distribution; it was a sometimes controversial assessment of the latest Internet editions of several national newspapers. He wrote the column until September, when he became Slate's chief writer about the struggle against terrorism.
        Born and raised in Baltimore, he held a bachelor's degree from Carleton College and a doctorate in philosophy from Vanderbilt. He was a naval intelligence officer and was on the staff of The Washington Monthly before becoming a freelance writer in Los Angeles.
        Survivors include his wife, Debora; a daughter, Dale Shuger of Brooklyn; two sisters, Nancy Shuger of Baltimore and Lisa Shuger Hublitz of McLean, Va.; and his parents, Sewell and Virginia Shuger of Baltimore.
