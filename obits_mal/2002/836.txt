        Yaacov Farkas, who under the pen name Zeev became the dean of political cartoonists in Israel, died on Tuesday in a hospital near Tel Aviv. He was 79.
        When Mr. Farkas, whose pen name means wolf in Hebrew, won the Israel Prize for Journalism in 1993, the judges declared that he had ''established the art of the political cartoonist'' in his adopted homeland. His cartoons were also published in other countries.
        He said he saw himself more as a journalist than as an artist, which made the prize for journalism the greatest compliment.
        His work over the years reflected changes in attitudes in Israel.
        In the days when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization did not recognize each other, he used to portray Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. leader, with crude representations of bombs where his eyes should have been.
        But the bomb images disappeared after Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo accords in 1993, a pact that provided for mutual recognition and a shift to a measure of self-rule for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
        Mr. Farkas was born in Hungary and survived the Nazi death camp at Dachau.
        In 1947, the year before the state of Israel was established, he went to what was then British-governed Palestine.
        In 1952 he began doing cartoons for Omer, a newspaper for new immigrants. In the same year his cartoons began appearing in the mass-circulation daily Maariv.
        In 1962 he also began doing cartoons for Israel's most respected newspaper, Haaretz. His work appeared in its weekly supplement until the 1980's and daily thereafter.
        His wife and his son died before him. He is survived by a daughter.
        His final cartoon was published last October. Its caption said, ''Thank you for your attention since Sept. 2, 1962.''
