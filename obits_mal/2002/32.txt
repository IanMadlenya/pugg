        Donald W. Johnston, a composer and arranger who scored a number of Broadway musicals, died Jan. 7 at a hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 57 and lived in Maplewood, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said David E. LeVine, his lawyer.
        Mr. Johnston arranged the dance music for the original production of ''42nd Street'' in 1980 and was the conductor and musical director for the show in 1987 and 1988. He was also credited with additional arrangements and orchestration in the current revival at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts.
        He also wrote dance arrangements and orchestrations for ''Marilyn: An American Fable'' and was the musical director for ''The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby,'' ''Cyrano de Bergerac'' ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and other productions by the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 1980's.
        He is survived by his wife, Diane Johnston, and two sons from a previous marriage, Evan and Adam, all of Maplewood; his father, Donald Johnston of Manhattan; and a sister, Suzanne Clark of Berkeley Heights, N.J.
