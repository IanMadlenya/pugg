        Walter H. Waggoner, a reporter, correspondent and editor at The New York Times for 41 years, died Wednesday in Chapel Hill, N.C. A former resident of Montclair, N.J., he was 84 and lived in Pittsboro, N.C.
        The cause was complications from a fall and surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Waggoner joined the Washington bureau of The Times in 1944. He retired in 1985 as a reporter on the metropolitan staff.
        In Washington, he covered the State Department, the Truman White House, the wartime price and production agencies and the Pentagon. He was president of the State Department Correspondents Association in 1952 and 1953.
        In 1947, he won a Nieman fellowship to study history, political science and philosophy at Harvard.
        In 1955 he opened The Times's bureau in The Hague. In 1958 he joined the paper's London bureau.
        He came to New York in 1961 as a general assignment reporter. He also worked as a suburban and city editor and covered New Jersey.
        Walter Herrick Waggoner was born in Clinton Corners, N.Y., and graduated from Bard College in 1939. Determined to be a journalist, he did publicity work and odd jobs until The Wall Street Journal hired him as a reporter and assigned him to Washington in 1941.
        Mr. Waggoner is survived by his wife of 58 years, Margaret Bucci Waggoner; a son, Geoffrey H., of Charleston, S.C.; two daughters, Anne K. Bancroft of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Mary E. Lemma of Flagstaff, Ariz.; and three granddaughters.
