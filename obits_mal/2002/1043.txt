        James Kilgo, who wrote essays on the outdoors, man's relationship with it and friendship between men, died on Dec. 8 in Athens, Ga. He was 61 and lived in Athens.
        The cause was complications of cancer, said the University of Georgia Press, his publisher.
        In ''Inheritance of Horses'' (1994, Georgia), collected essays, Mr. Kilgo also pondered relationships between men of different generations in the same family. Reviewing the work in The New York Times Book Review, Rebecca Chace called it ''a book of self-reflection in the best sense.''
        His first book was ''Deep Enough for Ivorybills'' (1988), essays about his hunting in the South. In it he described hearing what could have been the call of the elusive ivory-billed woodpecker in swamps in Louisiana. Another book, ''Colors of Africa,'' about his travels there, is to be published in March.
        He was a former director of the creative writing department at the University of Georgia in Athens. He also taught English and English literature before retiring in 1999.
        Born in Darlington, S.C., he graduated from Wofford College in Spartanburg, S.C., and received a doctorate in English from Tulane.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Jane Guillory; a son, John C., of Aiken, S.C.; two daughters, Sarah Jane Joyce of Maryville, Tenn., and Ann G. Kilgo of Athens; his mother, Caroline Kilgo of Darlington; two sisters, Caroline Tierney of Dallas and Maizie Belser of Seneca, S.C.; a brother, John S., of Greenville, S.C.; and two grandchildren.
