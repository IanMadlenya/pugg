        Eugene M. Ezersky, an expert on outdoor and environmental education who was involved in programs to foster gardening and greenery in New York City, died on Jan. 18 at a hospital in Westchester County. He was 75 and lived in Roslyn, N.Y.
        He had a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Ezersky, who earned a doctorate in education from New York University, was a Board of Education official for a time, directing activities involving outdoor education and camping. For 31 years, he and his wife owned and operated a children's summer camp, the Indian Head Camp, in Honesdale, Pa.
        He drew on his experiences when he taught at N.Y.U. for some years.
        In 1976 he was named coordinator of a federally financed pilot program to encourage low-income New Yorkers to grow food for themselves.
        As the director of city programs for Cornell Cooperative Extension, he provided support for another project, Grow Truck, which loaned garden tools and books to community groups in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Myrna; a daughter, Jane, and a son, Peter, both of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.
