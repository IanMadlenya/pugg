        Samuel A. Tower, a writer and an editor for The New York Times and a stamp columnist there for 11 years, died Friday in New Haven. He was 87.
        He pursued his interest in stamps in two books, ''A Stamp Collector's History of the United States'' (Messner, 1975) and ''Makers of America: Stamps That Honor Them'' (Messner, 1978).
        Mr. Tower was born in New Haven on Aug. 28, 1914, to parents whom his son, John, described as ''poor Russian immigrants.'' He won a scholarship to Yale, John Tower said.
        After graduation, Samuel Tower worked for The Associated Press, then joined the NBC radio news staff in Washington, before becoming a Congressional correspondent for The Times's bureau there.
        About 1950, he transferred to New York, initially as a copy editor on the foreign news desk and on the Large Type Weekly, a compilation of Times articles for readers with poor sight. Then he became editorial manager of the education division of The Times, introducing high school and college students to the paper.
        Mr. Tower began writing a stamp column for The New Haven Register in his spare time in 1968, and he took over the column in The Times in 1973, with an emphasis on introducing readers to the hobby and informing them about new issues of stamps. He retired in September 1984. (The Times discontinued the hobby page, where the column appeared, in 1993.)
        Mr. Tower is survived by his son, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and two grandchildren.
