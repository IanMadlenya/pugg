        Ian Hornak, a representational painter who exhibited his work regularly in New York galleries during the last three decades, died on Dec. 9 in Southampton, N.Y. He was 58.
        The cause was an abdominal aneurysm, said his dealer, Katharina Rich Perlow.
        Mr. Hornak came into his own as an artist when abstract painting seemed to have run its course and many young artists were investigating new possibilities for representational painting. He became known for elaborate, extremely detailed paintings of flowers, food and tableware that recall the 17th-century Dutch vanitas tradition. At the same time, his pictures have a sharply focused hyper-real look that verges on Surrealism and Photorealism. His frames, often bearing painted imagery or decoration, added layers of meaning to his postmodernism word.
        Mr. Hornak was born in Philadelphia on Jan. 9, 1944. When he was 8 he moved to Michigan, where his parents ran a small farm. After two years at the University of Michigan, he transferred to Wayne State University and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in fine arts, finishing in 1966. After a stint teaching at Wayne State, Mr. Hornak moved to New York, where he met Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Fairfield Porter and Lowell Nesbitt, a realist whose studio Mr. Hornak sublet in the summer of 1968.
        Mr. Hornak began exhibiting in 1972 at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery and moved to the Fischbach Gallery in 1977. Since 1988 he had had seven solo shows at the Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery. Among the institutions that own his work are the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art.
        Mr. Hornak is survived by his sister, Rosemary Hornak, and his brother, Michael, both of Mount Clemens, Mich.
