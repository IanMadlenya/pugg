        David Horowitz, who reported from the United Nations for 50 years and devoted himself to writing about its relationship with Israel and the Palestinians from a Zionist point of view, died Oct. 27 in New York. He was 99.
        Mr. Horowitz began working at the United Nations in 1947 when it started at Lake Success, N.Y., and was a working member of its press corps almost until his death.
        At first, he wrote mainly for the United Israel Bulletin, the journal of the United Israel World Union, an international organization he founded in 1943. In 1954, he founded the World Union Press, for which he wrote a regular column with a Jewish and biblical perspective on U.N. events. At one time it was carried by about 30 newspapers.
        From 1969 to 1972 he was managing editor of The American Examiner, a forerunner of The Jewish Week. He was elected president of the United Nations Correspondents Association in 1981.
        Mr. Horowitz was born in Malmo, Sweden, the son of a cantor who immigrated to Worcester, Mass., in 1914. In 1924, Mr. Horowitz went to Palestine, returning to the United States in 1934.
        He is survived by a brother, Emmanuel Horowitz, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and a son, Herbert Solomon, of San Diego.
