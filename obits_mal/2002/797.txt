        Ronald J. Moss, a former advertising executive who was New York State commerce commissioner under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, died Sept. 3 at a nursing home in Port Jefferson, N.Y. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to his former wife, Sylvia Moss, who added that Mr. Moss had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
        A native of Brooklyn who was raised in Maplewood, N.J., Mr. Moss went directly from his sophomore year of high school to the University of Chicago, where he graduated at the age of 19. He earned his law degree at Rutgers University, then practiced law, joining the advertising agency Kenyon & Eckhardt as general counsel in 1970. He rose to become chairman of the board before retiring in 1984, a year before joining the Cuomo administration.
        A lifelong activist in Democratic Party politics, Mr. Moss was also a founder of the African Medical and Relief Foundation, a group that flies medical help into remote regions of East Africa.
        Besides his former wife, Sylvia, of New York City, Mr. Moss is survived by two daughters, Hayley, of Malibu, Calif.; and Julie, of New York; and his mother, Lee Moss, of New York.
