        Dr. Irving Kupfermann, a leading student of the way that animals' nervous systems control their feeding behavior and motivational states like hunger, died on Feb. 19 at his home in Port Washington, N.Y. He was 64.
        The cause was a neurodegenerative disease, said Dr. John Koester, a colleague..
        At his death, Dr. Kupfermann had been for 28 years both a professor of physiology and cellular biophysics and psychiatry in the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute; it is affiliated with Columbia and is on its campus.
        In the 1960's, he worked at Harvard and then at New York University with Dr. Eric R. Kandel, a psychiatrist and Nobel Prize-winner for studies of the mechanisms of learning and memory.
        At N.Y.U. Dr. Kupfermann discovered the egg-laying neurohormone in a kind of sea slug called Aplysia californica and demonstrated that it was released from a cluster of neuroendocrine cells, leading to the laying of eggs.
        He and co-workers in Dr. Kandel's laboratory also delineated the connections between individual neurons in the neural circuit that triggers a simple defensive reflex, findings that helped create a new scientific field, the cellular neurobiology of behavior and learning.
        Dr. Kupfermann established his own laboratory in 1970 and began to study how the activity of individual neurons creates a change in the motivational state of an animal. Perhaps the most important of their ideas is that of neuromodulation, the activity of neurons that regulate behavior but do not initiate it.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Kupfermann received a bachelor's degree from the University of Florida and a doctorate in biopsychology from the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife of 37 years, Kerstin; a son, David, of Alma, Colo.; a daughter, Celina Poole of Del Ray Beach, Fla.; and a grandson.
