        Louis Owens, a prizewinning American Indian novelist and scholar, died on July 26 at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. He was 54.
        The cause was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the hospital said. He shot himself in the Albuquerque airport, the authorities said.
        Mr. Owens won the Columbus Foundation's American Book Award in 1997 for his novel ''Nightland,'' a mystery interwoven with Indian legends about two poor, part-Cherokee ranchers who find a suitcase full of money and a body that appears to have fallen from the sky. Mr. Owens won the French Roman Noir award for ''The Sharpest Sight,'' another mystery, in 1995.
        He wrote five novels in all, most depicting the relationship between Indian traditions and contemporary American society. He also wrote five collections of essays and criticism.
        Louis Dean Owens was born on July 18, 1948, in Lompoc, Calif. His father was half Choctaw and his mother was half Cherokee. Mr. Owens grew up in California and Mississippi. He was a ranger for the United States Forest Service from 1969 to 1974 in Washington State.
        Mr. Owens received his bachelor's degree in 1971 from the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he also earned a master's in 1974. He married Polly Pipkin in 1975.
        He was a Fulbright lecturer on American literature in Italy in 1980 and earned a Ph.D. from the University of California at Davis in 1981. He then taught at several universities before his most recent position as a professor of English, creative writing and Native American studies at the University of California at Davis. He was also an expert on the work of John Steinbeck.
        He is survived by his wife; their daughters, Elizabeth and Alexandra; his father, Hoey Owens; his brothers Gene, Troy and Richard; and his sisters Judy Wallravin, Linda Westphal, Juanita Larsen and Brenda Nallonee.
