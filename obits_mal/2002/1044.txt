        Richard A. Clarke, a former chairman and chief executive of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, died on Dec. 14 at his home in San Rafael, Calif. He was 72.
        The cause was complications of Lou Gehrig's disease, the company said in announcing his death.
        Mr. Clarke led Pacific Gas and Electric from 1986 until 1995 and remained on its board until 2001. Under him the company instituted programs to encourage more efficient energy use, clean-air transportation and the development of alternative energy sources.
        In 1991, President George Bush presented Mr. Clarke with the Environment and Conservation Challenge Award and appointed him to the President's Council on Environmental Quality.
        The next year the company established the Richard A. Clarke Environmental Leadership Award in recognition of his achievements.
        Richard Alan Clarke was born in San Francisco on May 18, 1930, and educated at the University of California at Berkeley and at the Boalt Hall School of Law before joining Pacific Gas and Electric as a lawyer. In time, he worked his way to the top corporate posts.
        The positions he held included vice president and assistant to the chairman of the board, executive manager and general manager of utility operations, and president of Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
        He served on boards of several other corporations and institutions, including the BankAmerica Corporation, CNF Transportation and the Nature Conservancy of California.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Dell; two daughters, Suzanne Clark and Nancy Stephen; and a son, Douglas.
