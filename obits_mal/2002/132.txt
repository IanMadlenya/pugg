        Walter Bolden, a jazz drummer who came through the Hartford jazz scene, moved to New York in the early 1950's and played with many of the top names in the field, died on Feb. 7 at a Manhattan hospital. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said his niece, Carol Graham.
        Mr. Bolden studied music at the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, and one night helped catapult his  career. In 1950 Stan Getz arrived in Hartford on a tour and played with a pickup band at the Sundown Club, led by the pianist Horace Silver, with Mr. Bolden on drums.
        Getz liked the band so much that he took it on tour and made recordings with it for the Roost label, thus spurring Mr. Silver and Mr. Bolden to relocate to New York. Soon Mr. Silver became one of the most influential pianists in jazz history; Mr. Bolden got a lot of work.
        In 1951 he played on Gerry Mulligan's first album in a 10-piece band; later he recorded with Coleman Hawkins, J. J. Johnson, Jackie McLean, Junior Mance, Howard McGhee and others.
        Mr. Bolden was a first-generation bebop drummer, influenced by Max Roach, Kenny Clarke and Art Blakey; he was also a composer, and his music was recorded by Mr. McGhee and Arthur Taylor.
        He also taught, giving master classes at the University of Hartford, and worked on the staff of Jazzmobile, the nonprofit education and performance project that brings jazz to  streets and parks in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Mabel, of Manhattan; and a brother, Madison, of Bloomfield, Conn.
