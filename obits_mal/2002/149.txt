        Dr. David Walter Barry, who studied infectious diseases and helped develop what was regarded as the first effective treatment for AIDS, died on Jan. 28 on a business trip to San Francisco. He was 58 and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Triangle Pharmaceuticals of Durham, N.C., the company he founded in 1995. Dr. Barry was its chairman and chief executive.
        While a senior research scientist at the Burroughs Wellcome laboratories, Dr. Barry played a major role in developing AZT as the first tool to fight AIDS. An antiviral drug, AZT  had previously been tried as a cancer cure and ruled ineffective. But researchers, with Dr. Barry in the forefront, found that AZT acted against viruses by controlling their growth. Their work led to its use to manage the symptoms of AIDS.
        David Barry was born in Nashua, N.H., and earned undergraduate and medical degrees from Yale. In 1977 he began an 18-year association with Wellcome; he ended as president of its research laboratories.
        Dr. Barry is survived by his wife, Gracia Chin Barry; a son, Christopher; a daughter, Jennifer B. Baucom; his parents, Walter and Claire Barry; two brothers, Thomas and Jerome; and a granddaughter.
