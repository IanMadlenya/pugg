        Tom Mallow, a leading producer of Broadway's touring shows, died on June 6 at a medical center in Deerfield Beach, Fla. He was 71 and lived in Lighthouse Point, Fla.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Jan.
        Beginning in the early 1960's, Mr. Mallow produced more than 60 Broadway shows on the ''bus and truck'' circuit -- the touring productions that crisscross the country, stopping in small cities and towns. His shows included ''Hello, Dolly!,'' ''Sweeney Todd,'' ''Cabaret,'' ''A Chorus Line'' and ''La Cage aux Folles.''
        He also produced ''No Sex Please, We're British'' on Broadway in 1973 and was co-producer with the Shubert Organization of the Broadway revivals and touring productions of ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God'' in 1980 and ''The Wiz'' in 1984.
        With their company, American Theater Productions, and its subsidiary, Janco Productions, Mr. Mallow and his partner, James Janek, greatly expanded the national touring circuit beyond major cities like Boston, Chicago and San Francisco. They brought touring shows to areas like North Dakota, Florida and Kentucky in a manner widely regarded in the industry as highly organized and professional.
        In 1975 Mr. Mallow founded a transportation company, Janco Ltd., whose fleet of trucks gave him greater control over the movement of props, sets and equipment around the country.
        The company is still in operation, in Wayne, N.J.
        Mr. Mallow was born in Carlsbad, N.M., and worked as a bandleader in Albuquerque before becoming a booking agent for MCA in Chicago, where he organized tours for Liberace and Harry Belafonte.
        He is survived by his wife; his daughters Catherine, of Niwot, Colo., Pamela, of Ho Ho Kus, N.J., and Jill, of Boca Raton, Fla.; seven grandchildren; and a sister, Virginia Ann Close of Denver.
