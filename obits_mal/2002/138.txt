        Wendell L. Marshall, who played bass with Duke Ellington from 1948 to 1955, died on Feb. 6 at his home in St. Louis. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Joan M. Marshall.
        Wendell Lewis Marshall was a cousin of the famed bassist Jimmie (sometimes Jimmy) Blanton, who was a star with the Ellington orchestra. Influenced by Mr. Blanton's work, Mr. Marshall began playing bass professionally in the late 1930's with local bands in St. Louis.
        After his stint with Ellington, he recorded with many top jazz artists of his era, including Ella Fitzgerald, Mary Lou Williams, Ray Charles, Coleman Hawkins and Dizzy Gillespie. In all, Mr. Marshall appeared on more than 150 albums, said Patricia Willard, a jazz historian.
        After leaving Ellington, Mr. Marshall played in the orchestras of a number of Broadway shows, including ''Fiddler on the Roof'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.'' In 1970 he started an insurance business in St. Louis.
        Mr. Marshall was divorced from the former Yvonne Fairbanks. In addition to Joan Marshall, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., he is survived by two other daughters, Cynthia A. Marshall of Queens and Carol E. Pettus of St. Louis, and two grandsons.
