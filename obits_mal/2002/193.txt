        Lee Jackson, a New York-born painter who made the city the subject of many of his paintings, died on Feb. 19 in Southampton, N.Y., his family said. He was 93 and lived in Southampton.
        Mr. Jackson studied at the Art Students League under John Sloan and George Luks, who were members of the Eight, a group of painters who came to be known as the Ashcan School; the group also included Robert Henri, Arthur B. Davies and Maurice Prendergast.
        The Eight's images of ordinary, working-class urban scenes had a strong influence on Mr. Jackson, whose early work often focused on subjects like outdoor markets in the Bronx and workhorses on the street.
        After a trip to Spain in the 1950's, Mr. Jackson's interests turned to color and movement. Mr. Jackson had his first solo exhibition in New York at the Babcock Gallery in 1941.
        He is survived by his wife, Adele.
