        Henry J. Kasperowicz, whose work for Allen B. DuMont Laboratories in Passaic, N.J., resulted in one of the early patents for a color television tube, died on March 31 in his home in Vista, Calif. He was 84.
        Mr. Kasperowicz was a young laboratory worker at DuMont when the patent on his invention was issued in 1950 to DuMont, which no longer exists. It was one of the companies developing color television technology in that period.
        When the patent was issued, DuMont announced the invention of an all-color, all-electronic television tube that could ''be applied to any existing color or black-and-white television system without obsolescence of existing receivers.''
        DuMont's director of research, Dr. Thomas T. Goldsmith, said at the time that the new cathode-ray tube would provide high-definition images of large size.
        The patent was bought later by RCA.
        Other technological contributions by Mr. Kasperowicz helped locate German submarines during World War II and made it possible to view radar screens clearly even in the sun-drenched cockpit of a fighter plane.
        Henry John Kasperowicz was born in Hoboken, N.J., and graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology there.
        His 1935 marriage to Rita Gertrude Matthews ended in divorce in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria, whom he married in 1972; eight children from his first marriage: five daughters, Virginia Kasperowicz, of Lancaster, Calif.,; Roserene Cappello, of Wyckoff, N.J.,; Elena Patry, of Port Saint Lucie, Fla.,; Mary Meacham, of Felton, Calif.,; and Kitty Daniel, of Lynchburg, Va.; three sons, Steven, of Hawaii; Kevin, of Suffern, N.Y.; and Peter, of Bloomingdale, N.J.; 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
