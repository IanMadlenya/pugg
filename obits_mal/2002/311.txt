        Elmer Angsman, who set a National Football League postseason rushing record when his Chicago Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1947 championship game, died last Thursday in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 76.
        Angsman, who lived in Juno Beach, Fla., and Chicago, had a heart attack while playing golf, his son, John, said.
        Playing in the Cardinals' unit known as the Dream Backfield, together with quarterback Paul Christman, his fellow halfback and the future Hall of Famer Charlie Trippi, and fullback Pat Harder, Angsman had a key role in the franchise's only championship.
        Angsman had two 70-yard touchdown runs in the Cardinals' 28-21 triumph over the Eagles in the 1947 championship game on a frozen field at Comiskey Park. He gained 159 yards on 10 carries. His rushing average (15.9) in that game established a still-standing postseason-game record for 10 or more rushing attempts.
        Angsman, a native of Chicago, played halfback for Notre Dame from 1943 to 1945 before joining the Cardinals. He played with them from 1946 to 1952. He was later a color commentator for college and pro football broadcasts and owned food and paper-product companies.
        In addition to his son, John of Indianapolis, he is survived by his wife, Diane; a stepson, Shawn Moss, and a stepdaughter, Shannon Moss, both of Chicago; a sister, Joan Granbom of Itasca, Ill.; five grandchildren; and two stepgrandchildren. His first wife, Suzanne, died in 1979.
