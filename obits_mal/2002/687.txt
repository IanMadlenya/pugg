        John Mather Lupton, a Connecticut politician and educator who had a Manhattan advertising agency, died on March 16 in Orange City, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Orange City.
        A memorial was held recently in Mattituck, N.Y., his hometown.
        Mr. Lupton, a Republican, served two terms in Connecticut's General Assembly and five terms in the State Senate. In 1962, he failed in a bid to be Connecticut's representative at large in the United States Congress. He was director of the state's Republican presidential campaign in 1964, when Barry Goldwater was the candidate.
        In 1967, Mr. Lupton became executive director of the Choate School Foundation. He was involved in bringing together Choate, a boys' school in Wallingford, Conn., with Rosemary Hall, a girls' school in Greenwich, Conn. They became one coeducational school, Choate Rosemary Hall.
        He became a fund-raiser for Yale, then was the University of New Haven's vice president for external affairs and development. He retired and moved to Savannah, Ga., in 1982.
        Mr. Lupton was born in Mattituck, and he spent a year at the University of Minnesota in the Depression. After holding advertising and sales jobs, he had his own advertising agency in New York, the John Mather Lupton Company, from 1944 to 1962, when he sold it to spend more time on politics.
        Surviving are his wife, Mavis Wort Lupton; three sisters, Ann Wickham and Margaret White, both of Cutchogue, N.Y., and Elizabeth Hammel of Stockholm, Wis.; three daughters, Nan L. Dietrich and Penny L. Love, both of Naples, Fla., and Deborah C. Lupton of Redwood City, Calif; two sons, John M. III, of Atlanta, and Josiah E., of Hartland, Vt.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.
