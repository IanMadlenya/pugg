        William A. Moses, a New York City real estate executive who was active in organizations representing small landlords, died on Jan. 3 in his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
        His health had been declining, his family said.
        He founded the Community Housing Improvement Program in 1966. The trade organization represents owners of apartment buildings in all five boroughs.
        Mr. Moses was a longtime opponent of rent control. He successfully lobbied the state government in the early 1970's to end rent control and rent stabilization, but three years later the Legislature rescinded the change.
        He had been a vice president and a member of the executive committee of the Rent Stabilization Association since 1978. In the 1970's and 1980's, he and a friend, Sheldon Katz, effectively controlled the association.
        For more than 30 years, Mr. Moses owned the Henry and William Company, which owns and manages apartment properties.
        A Brooklyn native, Mr. Moses grew up there and in Manhattan. He was in the Navy in World War II and received degrees from Syracuse University and Columbia University.
        His marriages to Joan Tiger Morse, Hannah Kaufmann Moses and Bernice Schwartz ended in divorce.
        He is survived by two sons, Henry and Andrew; a daughter, Cynthia Moses-Manocherian; three granddaughters; and a brother, Robert.
