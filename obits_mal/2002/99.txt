        Nala Najan, an American-born choreographer and performer who also wrote about the traditional dances of India, died on Jan. 7. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Katharine Cunningham, a friend.
        Mr. Najan, born Roberto Rivera, trained in violin, piano and Western dance forms. Attracted to Indian dance after seeing performances by Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis and later by Ram Gopal and Uday Shankar, he traveled to India as a teenager to study Bharata Natyam, the masked martial dance form, and traditional music as a disciple of the guru Muthukumara Pillai.
        He later settled in New York and began to perform at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Massachusetts. He often spoke and wrote of the importance of the spiritual over technical virtuosity in Indian dance. ''It takes all the international discipline of a yogi to create that spiritual empathy in an audience,'' he told Ms. Cunningham in a 1969 interview in The Berkshire Week, ''not the personal virtuosity or physical charm so accepted as an intrinsic value in the Western dance.''
        Mr. Najan also promoted American performances by Indian artists and organized the first American tour of Chhau dance. He wrote for and edited Arabesque magazine for many years and in recent years was a critic and correspondent for other publications.
