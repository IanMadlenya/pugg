        James John Peters, the executive director of the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association and a national voice to further research and treatment of spinal cord injuries, died Sept. 6 at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 57 and lived in Huntington Station, N.Y.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, the organization said.
        Mr. Peters, who was born in Brooklyn, sustained such a spinal cord injury in an officers training accident at the Army Engineering College in Springfield, Mass., in 1967. He joined the association as deputy executive director in 1969 and assumed the directorship two years later.
        Working with regional and national organizations, he raised funds and supported clinical research and recognition of spinal cord damage as a medical specialty. His efforts helped establish the Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research at Yale University and the Department of Veterans Affairs' national Spinal Cord Injury Service.
        Mr. Peters is survived by his wife, Mary Ann, and two sisters, Rose Correll of Medford, N.Y., and Judy Conroy of Brooklyn.
