        Wallace C. Dayton, a businessman, conservationist and environmental philanthropist, died on Sunday at his Wayzata, Minn., home. He was 81.
        In 1950 Mr. Dayton and his four brothers inherited the family's department store in Minneapolis, and they added others. In the late 1960's, Mr. Dayton retired from business and became an enthusiastic conservationist.
        He was on the Nature Conservancy's national board for 14 years and on its Minnesota board for 17 years.
        His family donated $1.5 million to the Nature Conservancy of Minnesota, and the money was used in 1999 to acquire almost 10,000 acres in northwestern Minnesota. The preserve has been named the Wallace C. Dayton Conservation and Wildlife Area.
        He was active in the creation of a revolving loan fund, the Land Preservation Fund, that assists the conservancy's work by furnishing money for buying land. He was on the fund's board from 1987 to 1997.
        Wallace Corliss Dayton was born in Minneapolis and grew up near Excelsior, Minn. He graduated from Amherst College and served in the Navy in World War II. He is survived by his wife, Mary Lee Lowe Dayton; four daughters, Sally Clement of New York City, Katherine Nielsen and Ellen Sturgis, both of Minneapolis, and Elizabeth Dovydenas of Lenox, Mass.; three brothers, Bruce and Douglas, both of Wayzata, and Kenneth, of Minneapolis; and nine grandchildren.
