        Carter L. Burgess, who had served as president of Trans World Airlines, ambassador to Argentina and president of the Foreign Policy Association, among other posts, died on Sunday in Roanoke, Va., where he lived. He was 85 years old.
        He suffered two strokes this summer, The Roanoke Times and World News reported.
        Mr. Burgess became president of T.W.A., then the nation's fourth-largest airline, in January 1957, but he resigned as of Jan. 1, 1958, over what he and Howard Hughes, then T.W.A.'s largest stockholder, described as a friendly disagreement over airline policy.
        In 1968, Mr. Burgess was appointed ambassador to Argentina by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served during a time of unrest in the country, including the bombings of the United States library. In 1969, President Richard M. Nixon appointed a replacement ambassador.
        From 1974 to 1980, Mr. Burgess served as president and chairman of the Foreign Policy Association, which stimulates discussions on the United States' role in foreign affairs.
        Carter Lane Burgess was born on Dec. 31, 1916, in Roanoke, and he received a bachelor's degree from Virginia Military Institute.
        During World War II, he was an assistant to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and rose to the rank of colonel. He was also administrative secretary of the Allies' Casablanca Conference in 1943 and an aide at the San Francisco conference that drew up the United Nations charter.
        At one time he was president of American Machine and Foundry, and he also served as head of the National Corporation for Housing Partnerships.
        Mr. Burgess married May Gardner in 1941; she died in 1990.
        He is survived by five daughters, Jane Kelly of Salem, Va.; Mary McTighe of Charleston, S.C.; Nan Keegan of Beverly, Mass.; Sue Burgess of Chevy Chase, Md.; and Beth Smith of Hingham, Mass.; a son, Carter Jr., of Pelham Manor, N.Y.; 11 grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
