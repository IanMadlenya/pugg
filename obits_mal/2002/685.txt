        Alexander Klein, an author whose spy thriller ''The Counterfeit Traitor'' was made into a Hollywood movie in 1962, died at his home in Manhattan on Aug. 13. He was 83.
        ''The Counterfeit Traitor,'' published by Henry Holt in 1958, was based on the life of a Swedish oil executive, Eric Erickson, who spied for the allies during World War II while posing as a pro-Nazi businessman. The New York World Telegram and Sun called it ''one of the very best books of World War II.''
        The movie, released by Paramount, starred William Holden and Lilli Palmer.
        Mr. Klein also edited several volumes on social and urban issues, including ''The Empire City'' (Rinehart, 1955), the unusually punctuated ''Natural Enemies??? Youth and the Clash of Generations'' (Lippincott, 1970) and ''Dissent, Power and Confrontation'' (McGraw Hill, 1972).
        Houghton Mifflin published several of Mr. Klein's stories in its annual ''Best American Short Stories'' collection during the 1940's and 1950's.''
        Alexander Klein, the son of a rabbi, was born in Szibo, Hungary, on Nov. 12, 1918.
        He came to the United States with his family when he was 5 and grew up in New Jersey and New York. He graduated from City College and worked as a screenwriter, speechwriter and advertising and public relations executive. He also taught writing at City College and Fordham University.
        He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Janis Klein.
