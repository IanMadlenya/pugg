        Rogers Albritton, a philosophy professor at the University of California at Los Angeles and Harvard who was known for probing and engaging lectures in which he rarely came to a definitive conclusion about a question, died on May 21. He was 78.
        The cause was chronic emphysema, said his sister, Heloise Frame.
        Dr. Albritton's penchant for always questioning a conclusion led him to avoid the permanency of the written word. He published only four papers over his 36-year career.
        ''He was always ready to rethink whatever it was he had come up with most recently,'' said John Cooper, a professor of philosophy at Princeton who studied under Dr. Albritton as an undergraduate student in the early 1960's.
        A passionate speaker in discussions, arguments and lectures, Dr. Albritton attained high positions in his academic field without the usual necessity of publishing.
        Rogers Albritton was born in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 15, 1923, the son of a physiologist and a chemist. His undergraduate studies were interrupted for three years by his service in the Army Air Forces in World War II. He returned to St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., and graduated in 1948.
        He received a master's in philosophy from Princeton in 1952 and a doctorate in 1955. He was an instructor at Cornell in 1956, then was hired as an assistant professor at Harvard. He was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and to professor in 1962. He was the chairman of the philosophy department from 1963 until he left Harvard in 1970.
        Dr. Albritton began teaching at U.C.L.A. in 1972, and retired in 1991.
        His interests included the philosophy of language, the philosophy of religion, ancient philosophy and the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein.
        Dr. Albritton is survived by his sister, Mrs. Frame, of East Meredith, N.Y.
