        Roy F. Katz, a deputy New York City fire commissioner who managed the Fire Department's construction program for the last six years, died on Wednesday at Cornell Medical Center. He was 48 and lived in Hollis Hills, Queens.
        The cause was complications after a bone marrow transplant, his family said.
        Mr. Katz, as one of nine assistant commissioners, oversaw projects like the construction of the new Fire Department headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn and a modern training center on Randalls Island and the building or renovation of dozens of firehouses, Emergency Medical Service stations and communications centers in all five boroughs. He was promoted to deputy commissioner in July; five others hold that rank.
        Born in Brooklyn, Roy Fredric Katz graduated with a degree in political science from the State University College at New Paltz and received a master's degree in management sciences at SUNY-Stony Brook before joining the Mayor's Office of Management and Budget in 1980.
        He transferred to the Fire Department three years later. Rising through the management ranks, he was named assistant commissioner for the Bureau of Support Services in 1996.
        Mr. Katz is survived by his wife, Marcia Stadtmauer Katz; two children, Samantha and Michael; his mother, Betty Storch of Boca Raton, Fla.; a brother, Louis, of Rochester; and three stepbrothers, Robert Storch of Boca Raton, Larry Storch of Orlando, Fla., and Jeff Storch of Doylestown, Pa.
