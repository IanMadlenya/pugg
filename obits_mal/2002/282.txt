        Herbert Kesner, a former head of the news broadcast desk at The New York Times, died on Monday at a hospital in Lebanon, Pa. He was 89 and lived in Manheim, Pa.
        For many years, Mr. Kesner headed the staff that wrote news broadcasts for The Times's classical radio station, WQXR, which it acquired in 1944. The broadcast desk prepared hourly newscasts, drawn from the resources of the paper, from 7 a.m. to midnight.
        Mr. Kesner dropped out of high school in Brooklyn at 16 and joined the merchant marine. He traveled throughout the world and on his return had a choice between jobs as a delivery boy for a butcher or a copy boy at The Times.
        He retired in 1972 after 37 years at the paper, when The Times reassigned the contingent of radio editors and writers and the station began to use news agency newscasts.
        Mr. Kesner's first wife, Helen McNicholas Kesner, died in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Constance Lehman Kesner; two daughters by his earlier marriage, Anne Abplanalp of Seabrook Island, S.C., and Ruth Butler of St. Thomas, V.I.; a stepson, James McNicholas, of Buffalo; two stepdaughters, Janice Garrett of Manheim and Patricia Gregory of Germantown, Md.; five grandchildren; four stepgrandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren.
