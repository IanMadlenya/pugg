        Donald Wilson, a scriptwriter and BBC producer who had the idea of making a television version of ''The Forsyte Saga,'' which became an international success, died on March 6 at his home in Gloucestershire, England. He was 91.
        In 1965, he and three other writers began work on a script that extended to 300,000 words and 1,500 pages. Production began in 1966.
        The 26-week series was first broadcast in 1967 in Britain, where John Galsworthy's three-novel series ''The Forsyte Saga'' has been in print since 1922. The books deal with the Forsytes, a large, materialistic English family with recently acquired wealth and success. The plot spans more than 50 years as the family is torn apart beneath its appearance of respectability.
        The television series had its American premiere in 1969. By 1977 it had been shown in 55 countries from Russia to Zambia. The series's audience around the world has been estimated at 160 million.
        Donald Boyd Wilson was born in Dunblane, in Scotland, went to school in England and attended the Glasgow School of Art. After writing for newspapers in Glasgow, he entered the British movie industry.
        He served in the British Army in Europe in World War II, and returned to filmmaking afterward. He joined the BBC in the mid-1950's. Later he retired to Gloucestershire.
        His wife, Helena, died two years ago. He is survived by their two daughters.
