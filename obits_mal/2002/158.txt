        Heinrich Dietrich Schutz, an art dealer and fine art publisher, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 79 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        The cause was vascular disease, said his wife, Suzanne.
        Mr. Schutz was born in Munich and came to New York as a child. He graduated from Harvard in 1944 and served with the Marines in the Pacific during World War II.
        After the war Mr. Schutz joined the New York Graphic Society, a publishing house founded in 1925 by his father, Anton Schutz, an artist. The company, the largest art book publisher of its time, issued limited-edition prints, monographs and catalogues raison√©es, and other books,  including ''The Complete Letters of Vincent van Gogh'' in 1958.
        In 1966 Mr. Schutz became the president and editor of the house, which later became a subsidiary of Time Inc. The company is now owned by Richard Fleischmann and is based in Norwalk, Conn.
        In 1983 Mr. Schutz and his son Prescott Dietrich Schutz founded Schutz & Company Fine Art, with offices in New York and Greenwich. The firm dealt in 19th- and early-20th-century American and European art.
        Prescott Schutz died in 1990.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Schutz is survived by his daughters, Leslie Schutz Panayotopoulos of Athens,  and Suzanne Stewart Schutz McCloy of London; two children from a previous marriage, Peter A. Schutz and Jeffrey H. Schutz, both of Denver; and seven grandchildren.
