        Robert Giard, a photographer who took hundreds of portraits of gay and lesbian writers, died on July 16 en route to Chicago. He was 62 and lived in Amagansett, N.Y.
        He was traveling by bus from Minneapolis and died of what appeared to be a heart attack, said his companion, Jonathan Silin.
        Since beginning his project in 1985, Mr. Giard took nearly 600 black-and-white portraits of gay literary figures ranging from Allen Ginsberg and Quentin Crisp to Andrea Dworkin and Howard Cruse.
        More than 180 of his pictures were included in a 1997 book, ''Particular Voices'' (M.I.T. Press), which was also the basis for a New York Public Library exhibition a year later.
        Mr. Giard, who never learned to drive, traveled the country by airplane, bus and train to photograph the writers he admired.
        He posed them in comfortable, uncomplicated environments, usually at home and surrounded by the things they loved. Ginsberg is seen holding his own photograph of William Burroughs delicately around the edges; Tony Kushner is splayed on a sofa surrounded by pillows with illustrations of Karl Marx.
        In recent years Mr. Giard widened the scope of his project to include sites like Oscar Wilde's grave in Paris and gay bars in San Francisco. He also took pictures of women for a group called the Thanks Be to Grandmother Winifred Foundation.
        Besides Mr. Silin, he is survived by his parents Robert and Antoinette, and a sister, Cynthia, all of West Hartford, Conn.
        Mr. Giard was born in Hartford, received degrees from Yale and Boston University, and taught school before teaching himself photography in the early 1970's. He first focused on landscapes and nudes.
        But in 1985, after seeing ''The Normal Heart,'' Larry Kramer's play about the AIDS crisis, he conceived of his portrait project and never stopped pursuing it. He was on his way to a portrait session in Chicago when he died.
