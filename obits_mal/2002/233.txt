        Alonzo Galloway Decker Jr., who made Black & Decker into a household name by putting power tools on the do-it-yourselfer's work bench, died Monday at his home in Earleville, Md. He was 94.
        The idea underlying the company's success came to him during World War II when he was vice president for marketing. He found out that workers in war production took their Black & Decker tools home from the job to work with them around the house after hours.
        From this sprang his concept of producing and selling portable electric tools for use in the home, yard and garden. The concept worked and eventually turned Black & Decker into the world's leading maker of power tools.
        In 1961, Mr. Decker took the next step by bringing out what the company billed as the world's first cordless electric drill.
        During 11 years as chief executive, from 1964 to 1975, Mr. Decker guided the company at a time of robust growth. Sales rose to $650 million a year from $100 million, and employment increased to more than 20,000 worldwide from 7,000. Last year,  Black & Decker, based in Towson, Md., reported sales of $4.33 billion.
        Born in Baltimore County, Mr. Decker studied engineering at Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University in 1929. He started doing odd jobs for his father at age 14. Hired full time in 1930, he began as a consulting engineer in export sales, traveling for the company in Europe.
        In 1932, he was laid off along with many of his fellow workers during the Depression. Once rehired, he worked his way up in engineering, research and manufacturing.
        He became a director in 1940, executive vice president in 1956 and president in 1960, a position he held until 1972. He retired as chief executive in 1975 and as chairman in 1979.
        Mr. Decker is survived by his wife, Virginia Gent Decker.
