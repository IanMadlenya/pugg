        The Rev. James P. Mahoney, a retired auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, died on Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 76 and had lived in the residence for retired priests at Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains.
        The cause was cancer, said the Rev. Joseph P. Tierney, the director of vocations for the archdiocese and a longtime friend.
        In 1971, Father Mahoney became vicar general of the Archdiocese of New York, in effect making him its chief administrator under Cardinal Terence Cooke. A year later, Pope Paul VI elevated him to the rank of bishop, and he served as an auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese.
        He was also vicar of northern Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties and pastor of several churches in the archdiocese.
        He retired as an auxiliary bishop in the early 1990's after serving under Cardinal Cooke and his successor, Cardinal John O'Connor.
