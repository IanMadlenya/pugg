        Hal Simms, for decades one of the most frequently heard announcers on CBS television, died on July 2 in a nursing home in Brookline, Mass., his family said. He was 83.
        From the early 1950's until his retirement in 1992, Mr. Simms was a familiar offstage presence on shows like ''Beat the Clock,'' ''The Guiding Light'' and ''The Frank Sinatra Show.'' He said, ''CBS presents this program in color,'' countless times and often filled in on news and sports.
        Mr. Simms was born in Boston and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1940. He worked at CBS affiliates in New England and Philadelphia before moving to New York.
        He is survived by his three children, Adam Simms of Boston; Dr. Hank Simms of Old Brookville, N.Y.; Sarah Simms Rosenthal of New York City; and three grandchildren.
