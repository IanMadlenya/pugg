        Warren Steibel, producer and director of the television program ''Firing Line,'' whose host was the conservative commentator William F. Buckley Jr., died on Jan. 3 in Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Frances Bronson, a longtime aide to Mr. Buckley.
        The program, distributed to PBS stations for most of its run, began in 1966 and was broadcast weekly for 33 years. Mr. Steibel was its director for most of the first several years, and was its producer and director concurrently for the remaining years. His work won him an Emmy Award.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Steibel grew up in Manhattan and held degrees from the University of California and Columbia.
