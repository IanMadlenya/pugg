        Bob Grossman, an automobile enthusiast who drove racing cars, sold foreign cars and liked to draw cars, died last Monday in a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 79 and had lived in Southampton, N.Y.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, said a member of the staff of the W. S. Clancy Memorial Funeral Home in Branford.
        Grossman drove in car races for a quarter-century and repeatedly won in the United States and elsewhere.
        In 1963 he was president of the Road Racing Drivers Club, an elite group that included a number of the most highly skilled sports car drivers in the United States. By that year he had been among the top 10 finishers in the Le Mans 24-hour race in France for four years in a row and had twice been a class champion in the Sports Car Club of America.
        By 1960 he was a national champion in various production sports car classes. In the 1960 Le Mans race for sports cars, ice cubes were inventively used to cool his radiator.
        Grossman took up sports car racing in 1952. After World War II he also became a highly regarded dealer in foreign automobiles. By 1957 he was running two automobile sales centers, one in Nyack, N.Y., and the other in West Nyack.
        His work as an artist included doing magazine covers for a number of news and sports publications.
        Grossman was born in Philadelphia and attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art. He was a professional singer (a baritone) and served in the Army in Europe in World War II.
        His survivors include a brother, Jon, of Branford.
