        Buddy Kaye, a songwriter and lyricist who wrote hits for Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Dusty Springfield and others, died on Thursday in Rancho Mirage, Calif., where he lived. He was 84.
        Among Mr. Kaye's songs were ''Till the End of Time,'' written with Ted Mossman, which was based on a Polonaise by Chopin and was included in the 1945 film ''A Song to Remember,'' about Chopin. When Como recorded the song, it became his first big hit, selling two million copies. It also became a hit for Les Brown, with Doris Day singing.
        Often collaborating with other songwriters, Mr. Kaye also wrote '' 'A' -- You're Adorable (The Alphabet Song),'' which became a No. 1 hit for Como and the Fontaine Sisters in 1949.
        Another of his successes was ''Full Moon and Empty Arms,'' which was adapted from a theme in Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto and became a hit for Frank Sinatra in 1946.
        Other songs included ''I'll Close My Eyes,'' which was recorded by Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerland and many others, and ''Little by Little'' and ''All Cried Out,'' hits for Dusty Springfield.
        He was the co-writer of the theme song to the television show ''I Dream of Jeannie'' and produced a record of ''The Little Prince,'' read by Richard Burton, which won a Grammy Award for best children's album in 1975.
        Born Jules Leonard Kaye in New York City in 1918, he is survived by his wife, Lillian; three children, Richard, Barbara and Ronnie; and three grandchildren.
