        Squire Newland Bozorth, a New York lawyer who specialized in estate matters and who was a longtime adviser to major charitable organizations, died Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        After graduating from New York University Law School in 1961, he joined the firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, becoming a partner in 1970 and a consulting partner in 1995, a position he held at his death.
        As a young associate he joined the legal staff of the Rockefeller Family Offices for three years in the early 1960's. He later came to represent a number of family members and their estates, including the estate of Nelson A. Rockefeller, the vice president and governor of New York.
        Through his representation of the Rockefeller family, he became an adviser to charitable institutions associated with them and was chief legal adviser to Rockefeller University from 1967 to 1995.
        He was a trustee of the Diocese of New York from 1995-98 and of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine from 1999 until his death.
        Mr. Bozorth is survived by his wife, the former Louise Crosby Mathews, a son, Squire Mathews Bozorth of Portland, Ore., and a daughter, Caroline Rutgers Sayan of New York City.
