        Charles H. Mullen, chairman and chief executive of the American Tobacco Company at a difficult time, died Sunday at a Stamford, Conn., hospital. He was 74 and lived in Darien, Conn.
        The family did not announce a cause of death.
        He retired in 1992 as chairman and chief executive of the company, a subsidiary of American Brands Inc.
        In 1988, he was elected to those posts after rising through the ranks of the company, which he joined as a salesman in 1950.
        From 1987 to 1991 he was also president of the company. In 1991, the company, based in Stamford, had annual sales of more than $1.6 billion and was No. 5 in its industry.
        Analysts said then that the company was generally doing well, despite a slump in the domestic tobacco industry. But they warned that its market share could dwindle in the next several years and that it needed to attract consumers from 25 to 40 years old, because older smokers were giving up smoking more quickly.
        The company and its competitors were also troubled by lawsuits claiming that they were liable for cancer caused by smoking.
        Two years after he retired, B.A.T. Industries of Britain bought American Tobacco from American Brands and merged it with B.A.T.'s subsidiary, the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, based in Louisville.
        Mr. Mullen was active in civic and charitable affairs and received awards from B'nai B'rith, the Boy Scouts and other organizations.
        He was born in Brooklyn and went to public schools there. He attended Fordham University.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; a daughter, Claudia H. Mullen, of Hinsdale, Ill.; a son, Geoffrey G., of Fairfield, Conn.; and five grandchildren.
