        As the South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, Daniel Pearl moved to Bombay after spending time in London and Paris. But for much of his career he was based on the East Coast, where he wrote articles on land use and transportation, and built a reputation on the witty strength of his feature stories.
        Colleagues and friends said that the work the 38-year-old Mr. Pearl left behind shows where his talents lay: in doggedly pursuing and explaining obscure topics, or superficially simple ones, with sensitivity and nuance. He saw that as his mission, friends said, and he died pursuing it.
        ''Danny was a reporter's reporter,'' said Lewis Cuyler, Mr. Pearl's editor at The Berkshire Eagle, where he worked in the late 1980's. ''He really got wrapped up in it and it drove the managing editor nuts because Danny was reporting it right until deadline.'' He added that Mr. Pearl ''always had another call to make. I had to tell him, 'Dammit,  Danny, write! No more calls.' He always wanted to make more calls because there were so many dimensions of the story he was curious about.''
        Mr. Pearl took his first reporting job at The North Adams Transcript in western Massachusetts, where he wrote a series of articles on a local hotel's collapse. They caught Mr. Cuyler's eye at The Berkshire Eagle, and he followed Mr. Pearl's career when he joined a nearby paper, The Union-News in Springfield, in 1987.
        Once Mr. Pearl was recruited to The Eagle the next year, he had the chance to specialize on business topics for the first time, Mr. Cuyler said. ''He really showed a flair for that kind of reporting,'' Mr. Cuyler said. ''He wanted to master one area.''
