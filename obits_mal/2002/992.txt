        Dr. Robert C. Schlant, a leading medical educator who was director of cardiology at Emory University from 1962 to 1988, died on Thursday at his home in Atlanta. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Besides teaching, Dr. Schlant edited 19 medical books and was co-editor of ''Hurst's The Heart,'' a well-known reference in cardiology.
        Dr. Schlant was born in El Paso on April 16, 1929. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt University in 1948 and served his medical internship and assistant residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He was in the Army from 1953 to 1955, stationed in South Korea and Japan. He joined Emory in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria; a brother, Gilbert, of Riverside, Calif., a daughter, Stephanie St. Onge, of Bernardsville, N.J., and four grandchildren.
