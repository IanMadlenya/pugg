        Lorian L. Marlantes, president of Rockefeller Group International, a corporation with interests in commercial real estate and telecommunications, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side after a long illness. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn.
        The family did not disclose the cause.
        Mr. Marlantes held executive positions with the Exxon Corporation and the Penn Central Corporation before he joined the Rockefeller Group in 1982 as vice president for strategic planning and analysis. After a subsequent stint with the telecommunications services division of the Rockefeller Group, he was named in 1990 to head the subsidiary that manages Rockefeller Center.
        In 1995, Mr. Marlantes was named president and chief executive of Rockefeller Group International. In that position he sought to widen the company's involvement in commercial real estate beyond the Midtown complex that was built in the 1930's.
        He oversaw its national growth as a developer as well as the operations of its worldwide subsidiary, Cushman & Wakefield. He was also on the board of the Rockefeller Group, of which the Mitsubishi Estate Company, one of the world's largest real estate companies, became the majority shareholder in 1989.
        Lorian Louis Marlantes grew up in Oregon and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in economics from the University of Washington in 1965. After a year in India as a Fulbright scholar, he earned a master's in economics at Stanford University. He received a Ph.D. in business economics from Stanford in 1971.
        Mr. Marlantes is survived by his wife of 34 years, Carol Weida Marlantes; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Washington, and Catherine, of Manhattan; his parents, Leo and Elna, of Seaside, Ore., and a brother, Karl, of Seattle.
