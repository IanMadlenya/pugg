        Wesley J. Howe, the former chief executive, president and chairman of Becton Dickinson & Company, a major maker of medical devices and diagnostic systems, died on March 30 at his home in Franklin Lakes, N.J. He was 80.
        He had suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, The Star-Ledger of Newark said.
        Mr. Howe joined Becton Dickinson, which is now based in Franklin Lakes, as a plant layout engineer in 1949. He rose through its ranks and held his highest posts mainly in the 1970's and 1980's. He resigned as chairman for health reasons in 1992.
        During his tenure, he blocked a hostile takeover attempt in 1978 by the Sun Company, an oil company based in Radnor, Pa.
        He also streamlined Becton Dickinson during the 1980's, helping turn the company into a competitive global medical technology company.
        The company's revenue grew almost tenfold from 1972, when he became president, until his retirement.
        Born in Jersey City, Wesley Jackson Howe received two degrees from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and became chairman of its board of trustees.
        Stevens founded its School of Technology Management in 1997 and named it for Mr. Howe after he pledged a gift of $6.3 million.
        He served in the Army during World War II and the Korean War.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Suzanne Rodrock, whom he married in 1946; two sons, Marc and Richard; and a daughter, Suzanne Howe-Comerford, all of Franklin Lakes; eight grandchildren; and a brother, Robert, of Dunellen, Fla.
