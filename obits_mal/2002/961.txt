        Bob Berg, the tenor saxophonist, was killed in a traffic accident yesterday in East Hampton, N.Y., where he lived. He was 51, and had played with Miles Davis, Horace Silver and Chick Corea, among others.
        His solo albums included ''Enter the Spirit'' and ''Back Roads,'' which was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993. The album was inspired by the East End, he said. Mr. Berg was born in New York and attended the High School of the Performing Arts and Juilliard. His wife Arja, 52, was injured in the crash.
