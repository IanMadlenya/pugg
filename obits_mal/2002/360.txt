        A. Searle Pinney, a former Connecticut state Republican chairman, died April 30 at his home in Brookfield, Conn. He was 81.
        A lawyer and former state legislator, Mr. Pinney was a retired senior partner of Pinney, Payne, Van Lenten, Burrell, Wolfe & Dillman, in Danbury. He was a co-founder of one of its predecessor firms in 1948. He specialized in estate planning and administration.
        A native of New Milford, Conn., he graduated from Tufts University in 1942. He was a second lieutenant in the Army Air Forces in World War II, flying as a navigator on B-24 bombing missions over Europe.
        He received his law degree at Harvard in 1948, thanks in part to the G.I. Bill. That year he joined two state judges, T. Clark Hull of State Supreme Court and Louis George, to form George, Hull & Pinney in Danbury.
        He was the Brookfield town counsel from 1951 to 1975. Entering politics, he was a member of the Connecticut House of Representatives from 1955 to 1961, spending the last two years as minority leader.
        He became state Republican chairman toward the end of 1961, and resigned after the party suffered a crushing electoral defeat in November 1966 that left the party deeply divided.
        Mr. Pinney was active in civic affairs at the local and state levels. He became a trustee of the state university system in 1979 and was chairman of its board from 1991 through 1995.
        Mr. Pinney is survived by a sister, Alma Jean Hayman of Roanoke, Va. His wife, Evelyn Roberts Pinney, died about 10 years ago; they had no children.
