        Morris Herbert Shamos, a nuclear physicist and science educator who attracted attention with his arguments that only those seeking careers in science should have to wrestle with a full scientific curriculum, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 84.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Shamos, a resident of the Riverdale area of the Bronx, had long argued that many important concepts in science were beyond most people and that trying to master them was an impossible and unnecessary task. He condensed his views in ''The Myth of Scientific Literacy,'' published in 1995.
        He also wrote ''Great Experiments in Physics: Firsthand Accounts From Galileo to Einstein,'' (1995), which remains in print.
        Dr. Shamos spent his academic career at New York University, where he received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees. He joined the faculty in 1942 and took emeritus status as professor of physics in 1983.
        He was president of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1982 and the National Science Teachers Association in 1967. He also was an executive at the Technicon Corporation, a maker of hospital laboratory equipment in Tarrytown, N.Y.
        He was born in Cleveland.
        Dr. Shamos is survived by his wife of 59 years, Marion Cahn Shamos; their son, Dr. Michael, of Pittsburgh; and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  May 10, 2002, Friday  An obituary on Wednesday about Morris Shamos, a nuclear physicist and science educator, misstated the year that his book ''Great Experiments in Physics'' was first published. It was 1959, not 1995.
