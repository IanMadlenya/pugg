        Turk Van Lake, a jazz guitarist and arranger of the swing era, died on Sept. 1 at a Staten Island nursing home. He was 84.
        Under his original name, Vanig Hovsepian, he was a classical composer.
        In the 1940's, he began to tour as an arranger, composer and guitarist with bands that included those of Charlie Barnet, Lionel Hampton and Buddy Rich.
        His playing was heard on recordings with Sarah Vaughan, and it complemented the Benny Goodman Orchestra on its famous Russian tour in 1962.
        Vanig Rupen Hovsepian was born in Boston. He grew up in New York and graduated from Tottenville High School before studying 12-tone composition at the Boston Conservatory. He retired in 1993 as an adjunct music professor at the College of Staten Island.
        Mr. Hovsepian's survivors include two daughters, Armene Hovsepian and Angelique McKee, and three grandchildren.
