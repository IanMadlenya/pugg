        Jerome M. Rosow, the founder and chairman of the Work in America Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on productivity and workplace issues, died on Oct. 11 at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 82 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        As assistant secretary of labor during the Nixon administration, Mr. Rosow took part in the development of the landmark Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. From 1971 to 1984, he was chairman of the President's Advisory Committee on Federal Pay.
        He founded the Work in America Institute, based in Scarsdale, in 1975. The institute, which was started with the help of a $1 million grant from the Ford Foundation, brings together leaders from business, labor, education and government to study productivity. The institute's studies support the idea that the best way to improve productivity is to give employees more say in the decisions affecting their jobs.
        Mr. Rosow, who had been an executive at Standard Oil and Exxon, wrote numerous articles and books on management, productivity and human resources.
        Jerome Morris Rosow was born in Chicago on Dec. 2, 1919, and was a graduate of the University of Chicago. His wife, Raye, died last year. He is survived by two sons, Michael, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Joel, of Scarsdale, and four grandchildren.
