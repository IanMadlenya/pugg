        Eric Hoskins, the rapper known as Money Ray who performed with the Cold Crush Brothers, an influential early rap group, died on Oct. 3 in the Bronx. He was 38.
        The cause was liver cancer, his sister, Deborah Hoskins-Simmons, said.
        Mr. Hoskins joined the Cold Crush Brothers in 1981 as one of two dancers called the Smurf Twins who appeared before the main act. In 1986, while he was working as a security guard for the group and attending its performances, Mr. Hoskins learned the rhymes of each rapper. He began to fill in occasionally, and in 1988 he replaced a member who left the group.
        Eric Reynard Hoskins was born on Sept. 3, 1964, in Charlotte, N.C. He continued to perform with Cold Crush until he became ill in September. He was also an elevator mechanic for the New York City Housing Authority.
        His marriage to Modesta Ortiz ended in divorce.
        In addition to his sister, of Charlotte, N.C., he is survived by two sons from his marriage, Eric Reynard Hoskins Jr. and Jonathan Hoskins; a daughter, Rayshawna Hoskins; another son, Eric Richardson; and his parents, Shirley Hoskins and Robert Posey.
