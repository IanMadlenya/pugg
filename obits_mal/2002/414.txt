        Charles W. Roll Jr., a political polltaker for prominent leaders like Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York and co-author of a classic text on polling, died on May 12 at a hospital in Trenton. He was 73 and lived in Lawrenceville, N.J.
        The cause was coronary and vascular complications, his family said.
        Mr. Roll and Albert H. Cantril, a public opinion analyst, wrote ''Polls: Their Use and Misuse in Politics'' (Basic Books, 1972), which The New York Times Book Review characterized as a ''sensible book about public opinion polling by two pros.''
        It analyzed, among other things, the impact of polls on primary races and how they could make a good candidate drop out of the race. Mr. Roll and Mr. Cantril also discussed polltakers who provided favorable figures for public show but reserved the more realistic numbers for their clients.
        While polling methods have evolved since its publication, the book presented general observations that endured and assured it a niche on the bookshelves of professionals in the field.
        Charles Weissert Roll Jr. was born in Trenton and graduated from Princeton University in 1950. He was study director for the Gallup Organization from 1958 to 1977. In the 1970's he was president of Political Survey and Analysis, a firm founded by Archibald M. Crossley, who, along with Dr. George H. Gallup and Elmo Roper, developed the first system of using a scientifically selected random sample to gauge the opinions of an entire population.
        Mr. Roll helped devise procedures to determine which respondents in early polls were likely to vote. Until 10 years ago he directed the Pennsylvania Poll of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which was highly regarded for its accuracy in forecasting election outcomes.
        Mr. Roll is survived by a sister, Lenora R. Lloyd of Oldwick, N.J.
