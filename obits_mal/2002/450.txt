        Alan M. Kranowitz, whose knack for bipartisan politics during his tenure as chief Congressional liaison for Ronald Reagan helped further the president's second-term legislative agenda, died on June 3 at a hospital here. He was 61 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        He died after a long battle with lung cancer, his wife, Carol, said.
        Mr. Kranowitz was deputy assistant to the president for legislative affairs and later led that office. Some considered him one of Mr. Reagan's legislative frontmen on fiscal issues.
        ''It was absolutely unbiased, straightforward advice,'' said Ken Duberstein, a former chief of staff for Mr. Reagan. Mr. Kranowitz's advice ''was fundamental to how we could do anything legislatively in the last couple of years of the Reagan White House.''
        Mr. Kranowitz began his career in the offices of former Senator Thomas J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and in 1971 became a Senate liaison for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In the Ford administration, he served as assistant director for legislative affairs in the Office of Management and Budget.
        Before joining the Reagan administration in 1985, Mr. Kranowitz served as chief of staff to former Representative Thomas G. Loeffler, Republican of Texas.
        At the end of Mr. Reagan's second term, Mr. Kranowitz served briefly as an aide to Dick Cheney, who was then the House minority whip. When Mr. Cheney was appointed secretary of defense, Mr. Kranowitz accepted a position with the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, where he finished his career as senior vice president.
        Born in New Britain, Conn., Mr. Kranowitz graduated from Yale in 1963 and studied international relations at Georgetown University. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Jeremy and David; and a granddaughter.
