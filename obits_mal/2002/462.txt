        Rodney Howard Hilton, an influential British Marxist historian who was an expert on medieval social history, died on June 7 at his home in Birmingham, England. He was 85.
        His scholarship focuses on life of the townspeople and the peasantry of England in the Middle Ages. He was professor of medieval social history at the University of Birmingham from 1963 to 1982.
        Dr. Hilton, who joined the Communist Party during his studies at Oxford, quit the party in 1956 but explored social issues of the Middle Ages through a Marxist lens, as the product of class conflict. Gertrude Himmelfarb, an American historian, praised him for recasting Marx's analysis of the feudal peasantry to ''make them worthy of sympathy and respect.''
        Both for himself and his students, he emphasized research, in the archives and with the use of new techniques of historical archaeology.
        His books include ''Class Conflict and the Crisis of Feudalism: Essays in Medieval Social History'' and ''Bond Men Made Free: Medieval Peasant Movements and the English Rising of 1381.''
        Dr. Hilton was born in Lancashire and described his background as lower middle class. He received a bachelor's degree and a doctorate from Oxford, and was in the British Army in World War II.
        His first two marriages ended in divorce. His survivors include his wife, Jean; a son, Tim, from the first marriage; and two children from the second marriage, a son, Owen, and a daughter, Ceinwen Hilton.
