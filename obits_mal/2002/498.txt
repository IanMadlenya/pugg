        Henry J. Latham, who represented Queens in Congress for 14 years and was a New York State judge for two decades, died on Wednesday at his home in Southold, N.Y. He was 93 and had lived in the Queens Village section of Queens.
        A conservative Republican with a strong anticommunist stance, Representative Latham was first elected to Congress in 1944 and represented the Third and, later, the Fourth Congressional Districts in Queens until 1958. He was on the powerful Rules Committee and favored strengthening the United States armed forces and providing United States arms to Taiwan, then known as Formosa.
        He served as a State Supreme Court justice and in the Appellate Division and was on the bench from 1959 until he retired at 70.
        He was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1940, served a two-year term and then was ordered to report to the Navy for training.
        He was a naval officer in World War II and served again briefly during the Korean War.
        He took his seat in Congress in 1945, after being elected in absentia while in the Navy in the Pacific.
        Henry Jepson Latham was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens. He graduated from St. John's University and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Brooklyn Law School.
        His wife, the former Elizabeth Schwarze, died in 1984.
        Surviving are a son, Stephen G., of Southold; and three grandchildren.
