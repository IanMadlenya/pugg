        Maxwell M. Rabb, former United States ambassador to Italy, died on Sunday at the New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. He was 91 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        He died of injuries suffered in a fall while he was walking to his law office, his wife, Ruth, said.
        Mr. Rabb, a Republican lawyer, was secretary to the cabinet in the Eisenhower administration. He was appointed ambassador to Italy by President Ronald Reagan and took up his post in Rome in 1981. Later that year he was hastily flown out of Italy after reports of a Libyan plot to assassinate him, but he returned after security measures were increased.
        He stayed on in Italy as ambassador until 1989, when he stepped down and resumed practicing law in the United States.
        Mr. Rabb acquired valuable experience in public service during the Eisenhower era in posts including associate counsel to the president, with special responsibilities in the fields of civil rights, immigration and labor. He also was a liaison to Jewish groups.
        In the 1960's, when he was president of the United States Committee for Refugees, a private organization, he was active in securing the release of Americans in detention in communist East Germany, including Ronald V. Wiedenhoeft, a Columbia University art history instructor, who spent nine months awaiting trial on espionage charges.
        Mr. Rabb was an important figure in Mr. Reagan's campaigns in New York for the Republican nomination and in the 1980 presidential election.
        Maxwell Milton Rabb was born in Boston and grew up there. He graduated from Harvard and Harvard Law School and served in the Navy in World War II.
        Besides his wife of 62 years, he is survived by a son, Bruce, of Manhattan; three daughters, Sheila Weidenfeld of Washington; Emily Livingston of Brookline, Mass.; and Priscilla Ayres of Alexandria, Va.; five grandchildren; and a brother, Warren, of Boston.
