        Tanjore Viswanathan, a flutist and teacher who was one of the most influential south Indian musicians in the United States, died on Sept. 10 in Hartford. He was 75 and lived in Middletown, Conn.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for Wesleyan University, where he taught for more than 25 years.
        A master of the Carnatic style, one of the oldest musical traditions in India, Mr. Viswanathan was born in Madras to a family of musicians and dancers. His grandmother, Veena Dhanammal, was a renowned player of the veena, a fretted lute; his sister, Tanjore Balasaraswati, and his niece, Lakshmi Knight -- known as Lakshmi -- were both dancers.
        Mr. Viswanathan first came to the United States in 1958 on a Fulbright scholarship to study ethnomusicology at the University of California at Los Angeles. He returned to India to direct the music department at the University of Madras from 1961 to 1966. He later taught at U.C.L.A., the California Institute of the Arts and, since earning his Ph.D. there in 1975, at Wesleyan. He developed a descriptive teaching style to overcome language barriers, founded Wesleyan's Navarati Festival and was the first Indian musician to be named a national heritage fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts.
        Mr. Viswanathan toured widely, often with his brother, Tanjore Rangathan, who died in 1987, and recorded albums and film music.
        He is survived by his wife, Josepha Cormack Viswanathan; his daughter, Jayasri, of Washington; and his sons, Kumar, of Jarratt, Va., and Kerey, of Middletown.
