        Arthur Stark, who was appointed by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan to major labor arbitration panels, died on Dec. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.

        He was named by President Eisenhower to a three-man board of inquiry in 1956 during a longshoremen's strike that had paralyzed shipping in East Coast and Gulf ports for seven days. Before long the full force of longshoremen returned to the docks.
        In 1961 Mr. Stark was appointed by President Kennedy to a three-man commission during a wildcat strike by flight engineers against six major airlines. Soon after the formation of the board, which had only advisory powers, the strike ended.
        In 1983 President Reagan named Mr. Stark to a three-man emergency board during labor troubles with the Long Island Rail Road. The board chose the railroad's final offer on wages and working conditions for settlement with four shop craft unions.

        He was a former executive director of New York's State Mediation Board and a former field examiner and acting regional director of the National Labor Relations Board.
