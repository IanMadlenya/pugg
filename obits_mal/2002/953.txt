        George Hall, a character actor who performed for more than six decades on Broadway and stages elsewhere, on television and in movies, died on Oct. 21 in Hawthorne, N.Y. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, said Christopher Alden, a friend.
        Mr. Hall's last role was in the Broadway revival of the Rodgers and Hart musical ''The Boys From Syracuse,'' presented by the Roundabout Theater Company, which opened on Aug. 18 and closed on Oct. 20. Mr. Hall performed in it until two weeks before he died.
        A native of Toronto, he was a graduate of the Neighborhood Playhouse School. Early in his career he performed in vaudeville.
        In 1946 he started out on Broadway in ''Call Me Mister.'' He went on appear in more than a score of Broadway productions, including ''Lend an Ear,'' ''High Button Shoes,'' and ''Touch and Go.'' He was in highly successful Broadway productions of ''Bent'' and ''Noises Off.''
        His work in television included the role of the very elderly Indiana Jones in George Lucas's series ''The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'' on ABC and the part of Tom Eldridge in ''Remember WENN,'' a series that ran for five years on the American Movie Classics cable channel.
        His wife, Cordelia, a Broadway dancer, died in 1969.
        No immediate family members survive.
