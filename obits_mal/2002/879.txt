        Glen S. Rosengarten, a grocery-chain executive who packed the aisles of Food Emporium supermarkets with imported and specialty foods, died on Saturday at his Greenwich, Conn., home. He was 54.
        The cause was complications from lymphoma, his family said.
        In 1980, Mr. Rosengarten, whose grandfather founded Food Emporium's parent company, Shopwell, Inc., in 1919, proposed recasting an early Food Emporium in Rye, N.Y., as ''the Bloomingdale's of super markets'' to make grocery shopping ''less boring.'' The early attempts to entice shoppers were focused on Westchester and southern Connecticut and later spread to New York City.
        By the next year, under the direction of Mr. Rosengarten and his brothers Richard and Jay, Shopwell was experimenting with the specialty foods aspect of its six Food Emporiums.
        Mr. Rosengarten said at the time, ''We've found there is a large segment that isn't as price-oriented as you might think,'' but, ''One thing we must never forget is that we're a supermarket.''
        The Food Emporiums went on to be a chain combining quality produce, fish and meat, delicacies and one-stop shopping.
        Besides his brothers, he is survived by his father, Martin; and three daughters, Danielle B. Rosengarten, Michelle J. Rosengarten and Haley R. Rosengarten.
