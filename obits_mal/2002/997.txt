        Leonardo Mondadori, chairman of one of Italy's largest publishing houses, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, died on Friday at his home in Milan. He was 56.
        The cause was cancer, said Piera Cusani, a spokeswoman for the publishing house.
        Mondadori publishes several Italian-language magazines and books, including translations of works by American authors like Saul Bellow, E. L. Doctorow, Barbara Tuchman and William Styron.
        Beginning in 1982, Mr. Mondadori was personally involved in the acquisition of works by Gabriel García Márquez a few months before Mr. Márquez was awarded the Nobel Prize.
        In 1994, on Mr. Mondadori's initiative, the company published ''Crossing the Threshold of Hope'' by Pope John Paul II, which became one of the most widely read Italian-language books ever published.
        Mr. Mondadori told his colleagues that his decision to publish the pope's book was inspired by his own conversion to Catholicism.
        Leonardo Mondadori was born on Sept. 26, 1946, in Milan. He was the grandson of Arnoldo Mondadori, who founded the family publishing empire some 70 years ago.
        After graduating with a degree in philosophy from the University of Milan in 1972, he joined the firm and, in 1981, became general manager of the book division.
        He was named chairman of the Mondadori Group in 1991.
        In 1991, Mondadori became part of Fininvest, a holding company that owns a substantial share of Italian commercial television and is controlled by the family of the Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi.
        Mr. Mondadori's marriage to Paola Zanussi ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Martina, from that marriage.
        His second marriage, to Katherine Price, also ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons, Francesco and Filippo, from that marriage.
