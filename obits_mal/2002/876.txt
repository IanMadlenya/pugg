        James B. Chapin, a political analyst and historian who advised Mark Green when Mr. Green was public advocate for New York City, died on Monday in Andover, N.J., at a Chapin family residence. He was 60 and lived in Queens.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to United Press International, where Mr. Chapin had worked since 2000.
        Mr. Chapin held a doctorate in history from Cornell and had taught history at Yale and Rutgers. Long involved in Democratic politics, he advised Mr. Green, also a Democrat, from 1994 to 2000.
        The singer Harry Chapin, who died in 1981, was James Chapin's younger brother and a founder of World Hunger Year, a national organization dedicated to eliminating hunger. James Chapin was the organization's longtime chairman. He had also been president of the Queens Borough Public Library board.
        Mr. Chapin, a native New Yorker, is survived by his mother, Elspeth Hart; his wife, Diana; two sons, James D. and David S.; two brothers, Tom and Steve; and several half-siblings.
