        The Rev. David S. Toolan, a Jesuit priest, theologian, editor and author who explored the connection between science, the environment and religion, died on Tuesday at the Jesuit infirmary at Fordham University in the Bronx. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was colon cancer, according to a fellow priest, the Rev. Robert Keck.
        Father Toolan was an associate editor of the national Catholic weekly, America, since 1989. Before that, he was an associate editor and book review editor of the independent Catholic magazine, Commonweal.
        His first book, ''Facing West From California's Shores'' (Crossroad, 1987), explored contemporary spiritual movements through a combination of personal memoir and reflections on Eastern religions and theoretical physics. His second, ''At Home in the Cosmos'' (Orbis Books 2001), argued that the environment is a religious issue that calls for ''a new social contract with nature'' based on a Christ-centered faith.
        Father Toolan was born in 1935 in Portland, Me., the son of a former New Jersey state senator, John E. Toolan, and Gertrude Maher. In the summer of 1958, after he received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, he worked at his father's law office and then entered Columbia Law School. Much to his family's surprise, he left law school after a year and entered a Jesuit seminary. He was ordained in 1967.
        Father Toolan had master's degrees from Fordham University and Woodstock College and a doctorate from Southern Methodist University.
        Father Toolan was on the Georgetown University Board of Regents from 1993 to 1999. In the late 1980's, he was the religious superior of the West Side Jesuit Community in Manhattan.
        He is survived by a sister, Maureen Toolan of New Orleans and by three nephews.
