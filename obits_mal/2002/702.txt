        Phillip Oesterman, a Broadway producer and director who worked extensively with Tommy Tune and whose bawdy musical ''Let My People Come'' was a long-running hit in the 1970's, died on Tuesday at his home in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 64.
        The cause was heart failure, said his publicist, Pete Sanders.
        Mr. Oesterman collaborated with Mr. Tune on more than 20 productions, starting in the late 1960's when the two friends moved to New York from Texas.
        Among Mr. Oesterman's shows with Mr. Tune were ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' which won six Tony Awards in 1991. Mr. Oesterman was the show's associate director.
        He also collaborated with Mr. Tune on ''Nine,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''My One and Only'' and ''Tommy Tune Tonite!'' He was also a co-librettist of Mr. Tune's adaptation of ''Easter Parade,'' the Irving Berlin musical, which had workshops in New York and Australia but never made it to Broadway.
        Mr. Oesterman produced and directed ''Let My People Come,'' a so-called ''sexual musical'' that began in a downtown nightclub in early 1974, eventually moved to the Morosco Theater on Broadway and had a long life as a touring show.
        ''Let My People Come'' never officially opened, according to theater records, because critics were never invited to a performance. But a critic from The New York Times, Mel Gussow, went anyway, ''in the interest of reader service,'' and in his review described the show's couplings ''in a variety of combinations, simulated onstage.''
        Mr. Oesterman directed Yoko Ono's Off Broadway musical ''New York Rock'' in 1994, ''Bus Stop'' with Jerry Hall in London, and regional theater in Florida.
        At his death, he was working on an adaptation of the 1980 film ''Urban Cowboy.''
        He is survived by his companion, Nakies Constantinou.
