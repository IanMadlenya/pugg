        Robert G. McGruder, the executive editor of The Detroit Free Press, died of cancer on Friday at a hospice in a Detroit suburb. He was 60.
        Mr. McGruder was known for his efforts in breaking down racial barriers in the newspaper industry by encouraging newspapers to hire staffs that reflected the racial makeup of the communities they covered.
        He also led The Free Press during most of a five-and-a-half-year strike in the 1990's, which he called ''easily the most painful time in my life as a newspaperman.''
        Mr. McGruder was born in Louisville, Ky., in 1942. At 6, he contracted polio but recovered after months in a hospital and a rehabilitation center.
        He graduated from Kent State University in 1963 and the same year became the first black reporter for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland.
        Before becoming an editor at The Free Press, he was a negotiator for the Newspaper Guild and helped lead a lengthy strike, the newspaper said.
        In 1996, he became the first black executive editor of The Free Press, a year after becoming the first black president of the Associated Press Managing Editors.
        He was also a board member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and was a Pulitzer Prize nominating judge for several years.
        Last year, Mr. McGruder won the John S. Knight Gold Medal, the highest honor given to an employee of Knight Ridder, the parent company of The Free Press.
        ''I am the messenger and the message of diversity,'' Mr. McGruder said in a speech at the time.
        ''I represent the African-Americans, Latinos, Arab-Americans, Asians, Native Americans, gays and lesbians, women and all the others we must see represented in our business offices, newsrooms and our newspapers if we truly want to meet the challenge of serving our communities.''
        He is survived by his wife, Annette; his mother; a stepdaughter; and a grandson.
