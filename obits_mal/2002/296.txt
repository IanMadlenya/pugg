        Hans J. Frank, a former partner in the international law firm now called Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson and a tax expert who helped fellow victims of Nazism, died on March 29 at his home on the West Side of Manhattan. He was 90.
        Mr. Frank came to the United States from Germany in October 1933. He received an American law degree from New York University and became an expert in international tax matters. For almost four decades, beginning in the mid 1940's, he was a partner at Fried, Frank.
        In his last 10 years, he mainly pursued legal efforts to obtain restitution of the property of Jews that had been seized by the Nazis. He became the lawyer for a number of Jews seeking reparations from the German government; all the cases he completed were successful.
        Mr. Frank was also prominent in Selfhelp Community Services and United Help, organizations in the United States that helped refugees from the Third Reich.
        He was born in Magdeburg in central Germany and studied law at the universities of Heidelberg and Berlin, where he graduated in 1932, the year before Hitler came to power. He became a government law clerk in Prussia but was dismissed, because he was a Jew, from his country's civil service early in Hitler's reign.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Brimberg, whom he married in 1970; two children from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce, his daughter, Susan Breitzer, of Lansing, Mich.; and his son, Steven, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
