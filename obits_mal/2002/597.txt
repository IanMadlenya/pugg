        Richard T. Liddicoat, an executive of the Gemological Institute of America who was behind the four C's method of grading diamonds now familiar to couples around the world, died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 84.
        Mr. Liddicoat's legacy was a grading system ''used by jewelers all over the world,'' said Ralph Destino, the chairman of the institute board and a former president of Cartier. It is based on cut, color, clarity and carat weight.
        The institute, with headquarters in Carlsbad, Calif., is involved with research, education and laboratory services.
        In the early 1950's, when jewelers wanted a standardized diamond grading system instead of fanciful and sometimes inconsistent descriptive names, Mr. Liddicoat was executive director of the organization. The institute's journal, Gems & Gemology, said he and four colleagues ''tackled the problem'' and developed what became known as the International Diamond Grading System.
        Mr. Liddicoat and a colleague taught the first one-week classes about the system in 1953 in Manhattan.
        Mr. Liddicoat, who retired as president of the institute in 1983, wrote books like ''The Handbook of Gem Identification'' (1947, Gemological Institute of America). He was editor of GIA Diamond Dictionary (1993, Gemological Institute of America) and editor in chief of Gems & Gemology from 1952 until his death.
        For some years, he was the institute's director of education and worked on developing its education program. He also helped develop techniques and instruments to test gems.
        Richard Thomas Liddicoat Jr. was born in Kearsarge, Mich., and received a bachelor's in geology and a master's in mineralogy from the University of Michigan.
        He served with the Navy in the Pacific in World War II.
        His wife, the former Mary Imogene Hibbard, died in 1995.
