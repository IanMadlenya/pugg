        Edward H. Tuck, a New York lawyer who specialized in international business and helped advance the development and application of international business law, died on Oct. 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said Bryan Close, a spokesman for Shearman & Sterling, the law firm where Mr. Tuck worked for nearly 50 years.
        Mr. Tuck joined the firm in 1953 and was a partner there from 1962 until 1986. He continued to work for the firm until his death. He set up its first overseas office, in Paris, in 1962. During six years there, he was involved in a number of major negotiations, including the representation of Sonatrach, the state-owned oil and gas company of the newly independent Algeria, in its dealings with Western oil companies.
        He was a founder, in the 1970's, of the French-American Foundation, which is committed to strengthening ties between the two countries. Mr. Tuck was awarded the French Legion of Honor for his service to French-American relations.
        Edward Hallam Tuck was born in Brussels and attended boarding schools in Britain and the United States. He served in the United States Navy in World War II and received a bachelor's degree from Princeton and a law degree from Harvard.
        Surviving are his wife, Liliane; two sons, Edward and Matthew, both of Manhattan, and a daughter, Jessica Tuck of Los Angeles, all from a previous marriage to Linda Barnes; three stepsons, Josiah Emery of Los Angeles, Dana Emery of Larchmont, N.Y., and Matthew Emery of Dallas; seven grandchildren; and two sisters, Dorita Bigelow of Charlottesville, Va., and Emily Mills of Twyford, England.
