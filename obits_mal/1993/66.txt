        Thomas A. Priestley, a photographer, producer and director of award-winning television documentaries, died on Thursday in New York City. A resident of Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I., he was 75.
        He died of a heart attack en route to his physician's office, said Ann Garfield Black, his companion. They were to have been married this weekend.
        Known professionally as Tom Priestley, he was born in Fort Lee, N.J., and attended St. John's University. Starting his career as a newsreel cameraman for Universal Pictures, he was a pool photographer assigned to Gen. George S. Patton's command in Europe during World War II.
        His wartime work included filming the liberation of the Buchenwald concentration camp. Later, sent to the Far East, he documented the Japanese surrender on the deck of the battleship Missouri on Sept. 1, 1945.
        In his postwar career with the NBC and ABC networks, Mr. Priestley worked on more than 300 news and cultural programs, nine of which won Emmy Awards. His credit line appeared on such noted documentaries as "The Louvre," "John Steinbeck's America and the Americans," "Sahara," and "Venice Be Damned!," a portrait of a magnificent city in slow decay narrated by Jose Ferrer.
        "The Killing Ground," broadcast as an ABC News Closeup in March 1979, offered a chilling survey of toxic waste dumps. It won an Emmy, was nominated for an Academy Award and received an hourlong update, which he also directed, in August 1980.
        Mr. Priestley's first wife, Geraldine, died in 1963.
        Mr. Priestley's survivors include his son, Thomas Jr., of Cliffside Park, N.J.; Ms. Black and her daughters, Andrea, of Hong Kong, and Alison, a student in Paris; a brother, Jack, of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Boyd, of Freeport, L.I., and four grandchildren.
