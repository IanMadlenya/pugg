        Melvin M. Swig, a developer and philanthropist, died Sunday at his home in San Francisco. He was 75.
        The cause of death was cancer, his New York office said.
        Mr. Swig was chairman of the Swig Weiler and Dinner Development Company of San Francisco and Manhattan, a family-owned real estate company whose holdings include the Fairmont Hotel chain.
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Brown University in 1939. He served in the United States Army in World War II, after which he moved to San Francisco.
        He was active in civic and charitable work. He was a president of the Jewish Community Federation and the Jewish Community Endowment Fund, both in San Francisco. He was also chairman of the University of San Francisco, where he established a program for Judaic studies.
        Mr. Swig is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Maillard; three sons, Steven and Robert of San Francisco and Kent of Manhattan; a brother, Richard, of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.
