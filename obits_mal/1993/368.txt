        Zolton Ferency, retired professor at Michigan State University, former Democratic state chairman and perennial crusader for liberal causes, died on Tuesday at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich. He was 70 and lived in East Lansing.
        His son Mark of Bath Township, Mich., said the cause was cardiac arrest.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Ferency was trying to change the state's form of government. As a member of the East Lansing City Council, he was completing work on a proposal to establish a unicameral proportional legislature, which would open the way for a much broader range of political opinion.
        Mr. Ferency started to champion liberal causes at the age of 11, when he marched beside Walter Reuther in a labor protest. As state Democratic chairman in 1967, he opposed President Lyndon B. Johnson over the Vietnam War and urged him to withdraw American troops unilaterally.
        Mr. Ferency served as chairman of the state Democratic Party from 1963 to 1968. Although he ran unsuccessfully against Gov. George Romney in 1966, he won re-election as chief of Michigan's Democratic organization for a third term.
        He broke with the Democratic Party in 1970 to found the Human Rights Party, made up largely of anti-war Democrats. After running unsuccessfully twice for the state Supreme Court and again for governor, he rejoined the Democratic Party in 1976.
        Joining the faculty of Michigan State in 1971, he taught criminal justice until his retirement in 1990.
        He was born and reared in Detroit. He graduated from Michigan State University and earned a law degree from Detroit College of law.
        He is survived by his wife, Ellen; another son, Michael, of Williams Township, Mich.; a brother, John, of Grosse Isle, Mich., and three grandchildren.
