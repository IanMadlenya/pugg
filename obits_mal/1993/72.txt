        George L. George, a film director whose "Toward Independence" won the Academy Award for documentary short subjects in 1948, died on Thursday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 85 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his granddaughter, Emily George.
        Mr. George was a director for independent producers of documentaries, educational and industrial movies and television commercials. In the early 1940's, he was among the organizers of the Screen Directors Guild of New York and was active in 1957 in setting up the group's successor, the Screen Directors International Guild. He was the organization's executive secretary from 1958 to 1963.
        When the organization merged with the Hollywood-based Directors Guild of America in 1966, Mr. George was elected to the group's Eastern Directors Council and remained in office until he retired in 1989.
        Born in Moscow on July 31, 1907, he was educated in Paris and moved to the United States in 1933 as a correspondent for French periodicals.
        Mr. George was married to Elaine Hellinger, who died in 1989.
        He is survived by a son, Robert H., of Irvington, N.Y.; a daughter, Dr. Laura George Jayson of Manhattan; two sisters, Mila Deutsch of Nice, France, and Diane Foy of Paris, and six grandchildren.
