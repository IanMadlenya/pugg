        The Rev. John A. St. George, a Jesuit who helped develop FM radio in New York City and more recently was an executive at the Jesuit-run Vatican Radio outside Rome, died on Friday in Evanston, Ill. He was 73.
        The Chicago Province of the Society of Jesus said that since undergoing cancer surgery last year, Father St. George had been in Evanston at the Canisius House Jesuit Community, which he helped found in 1955.
        A native of Syracuse, Father St. George joined the Jesuits in 1939 and was ordained as a priest in 1952. His studies in communications at Northwestern University then led to his appointment as chairman of the communications department at Fordham University in 1956. Experiment With FM
        The position put him in charge of Fordham's radio station, WFUV, which two years later went stereophonic with WFUV-FM. It was the first educational station licensed to experiment with the method, frequency modulation, and the first station to use it for stereo programming for the general public.
        Father St. George worked in Rome for 27 years. In 1972, he became director of the Press and Information Office of the Society of Jesus at the Jesuits' international headquarters.
        Starting in 1967, he was also assistant director of Vatican Radio for 15 years, during which he began its Studio A. The medium-wave program, which combined modern and classical music interspersed with scriptural and literary readings in English and Italian, won the Vatican new listeners from the Azores to the Aegean Islands.
        Father St. George also taught communications at Gregorian University. For the last six years he was executive director of Multimedia International, a communications research organization that assists religious orders and congregations.
