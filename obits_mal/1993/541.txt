        Jack Damlos, senior production manager for annual events at Macy's, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        His family said the cause was complications from AIDS-related pneumonia.
        Mr. Damlos joined Macy's in 1983 and was involved in the production of the Thanksgiving Day parade, Fourth of July fireworks and Christmas events until his death.
        He graduated from Georgetown University in 1970 and moved to New York, where he appeared in several off-Broadway productions and did radio and television commercials. He was road manager for the national touring company of the Paul Taylor Dance Company from 1974 to 1976.
        He is survived by his parents, Fred and Kathleen Damlos, and four sisters, Nancy Silva, Kathe Nelson, Terry Damlos-Mitchell and Barbara Damlos, all of the San Francisco Bay area.
