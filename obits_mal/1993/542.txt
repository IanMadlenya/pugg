        Joseph G. Robbins, the first layman to serve as the Assistant Chancellor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, died on Tuesday in Orlando, Fla., where he had retired. He was 71.
        His first career was at the Community Counseling Service, an international fund-raising and public-relations company in Manhattan, where he became the controller and corporate secretary.
        In 1969, he joined the archdiocese, starting as deputy director of finance and then as director of finance. John Cardinal O'Connor named him Assistant Chancellor in 1985.
        Over the years he also served as a trustee of the New York Medical College, Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center, St. Vincent's Hospital, Mary Manning Walsh Home, St. Rose's Settlement, Cardinal Cooke Memorial Foundation, Cardinal Spellman Memorial Foundation, the archdiocese's Department of Education and its Catholic High School Association.
        He continued as a financial adviser to the archdiocese after retiring in 1986. That same year Pope John Paul II named him a Knight of St. Gregory.
        Mr. Robbins, a native of the Bronx, graduated from St. Joseph's Seminary and College in Yonkers. During World War II, he served in the Marine Corps.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Moser; a son, Mark, of Manhattan; four daughters, Elyse Sneed of Winter Park, Fla., Ursula Anderson of San Diego, and Regina Gilson and Helene Sinclair, both of Fremont, Calif.; a sister, Harriet Robbins of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
