        Swen Swenson, a Broadway dancer who also performed on television, died on Wednesday at Midway Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 63 and lived in Hollywood.
        The cause was AIDS, his sister, Carolyn Dougherty, said.
        Mr. Swenson was best known for a show-stopping solo in the 1962 musical "Little Me," in which he performed a striptease to "I've Got Your Number." Mr. Swenson won a Theater World Award for the dance, which was choreographed by Bob Fosse.
        Mr. Swenson was born on a farm in Inwood, Iowa. He trained in theater and dance with Mira Rostova and at the School of American Ballet. He made his Broadway debut in 1950 in "Great to Be Alive!" and also appeared in the Broadway musicals "Wildcat," "Destry Rides Again," "Annie," "No, No, Nanette," "I Remember Mama" and the 1981 revival of "Can-Can."
        Mr. Swenson also performed with the modern-dance company of Valerie Bettis and with Lee Theodore's American Dance Machine, and he created a leading role in the premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's "Unicorn, Mantagor and Gorgon." He appeared in the films "Monte Carlo Baby" and "Nez de Cuir," and he performed in television variety shows.
        In addition to Mrs. Dougherty, of Albuquerque, N.M., Mr. Swenson is survived by another sister, Marce Matthius of Sioux Falls, S.D.
