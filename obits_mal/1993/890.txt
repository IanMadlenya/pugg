        Daniel P. Warner, a founder and a former executive director of a Los Angeles group that helps AIDS patients, died Monday on his 38th birthday at his home in San Francisco.
        The cause was complications of AIDS, said Tom Christie, a friend in Los Angeles.
        In 1983, Mr. Warner and others founded the Los Angeles chapter of the Shanti Foundation, which trains volunteers to care for AIDS patients. He served as its executive director until March 1991.
        Mr. Warner was also a consultant to television news programs and movies dealing with AIDS.
        He is survived by his companion, Matt Satterlund; his parents, Jay and Simone Warner; four brothers, Greg, David, Jim and Paul, and a sister, Monique, all of St. Louis.
