        Prof. Howard Davis Eberhart, who designed artificial limbs and other prosthetic devices, died of a heart attack on July 18. He was 86.
        He died while riding in a car being driven from Arizona to his home in Santa Barbara, Calif., said an official at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was professor emeritus of civil engineering.
        Professor Eberhart, who was born and reared in Lima, Ohio, was an architecture graduate of the University of Oregon in Eugene and earned a master's degree in civil engineering at Oregon State College.
        A freak accident that resulted in the amputation of his left leg below the knee in 1944 led to his interest in prosthetic research and design.
        When America's combat casualties began to mount in World War II, the Government set up a Committee on Artificial Limbs. Dr. Verne Inman, the orthopedic surgeon who had amputated Professor Eberhart's leg, was asked to conduct research for the committee, and he later invited Professor Eberhart to collaborate.
        Together they founded the Biomechanics Laboratory to study human locomotion, muscle action, joint movements and foot pressure. The results of their studies led to many of the principles used today in designing artificial lower limbs and braces.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a son, Howard D. Eberhart 2d of Concord, Calif.; a sister, Mary Ellen Henderson of Eugene, and two grandsons.
