        Leon M. Block, the retired president of Dunhill Tailors, died last Wednesday at his residence in the Ritz Tower Hotel. He was 83.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Rainer Greeven, a friend.
        Co-founded by Mr. Block's father, William Block, Dunhill opened in 1923 on lower Fifth Avenue and eventually settled at 65 East 57th Street. Mr. Block reitired in 1985 and sold the business to Alfred Dunhill of London.
        Mr. Block is survived by his wife, Mercedes, of Manhattan.
