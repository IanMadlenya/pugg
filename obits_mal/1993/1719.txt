        William R. Martin of Manhattan, who staged commercial shows throughout the country for the electronics and clothing industries, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. He was 59.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Michael McConkey, a business partner.
        Mr. Martin established Martin Shows Inc., which has its headquarters in Manhattan, 20 years ago to serve corporate clients. He graduated from the University of Connecticut and Catholic University in Washington, with degrees in theater.
        He is survived by a sister, Barbara Martin of Burke, Va.
