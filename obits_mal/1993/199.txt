        Fred Norman, an arranger who worked with major jazz orchestras and vocalists, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82.
        His niece Ruby Johnson said the cause was pneumonia.
        Mr. Norman was born in Leesburg, Fla. He began his career in 1932 as a trombonist and singer with the Claude Hopkins Orchestra. In the late 1930's and early 40's, he was a music arranger for Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Jack Teagarden, Artie Shaw and Tommy Dorsey, among others. The Benny Goodman Orchestra recorded his composition "Smoke House Rhythm" in 1938.
        In the 1950's he was a music director with several recording companies and worked closely with singers including Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington.
        Besides Ms. Johnson, of New York City, he is survived by another niece, Kathryn Fullins of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
