        John R. Fernbach, a New York lawyer specializing in theater and intellectual property cases, died on Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Loretta McCarthy.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Fernbach graduated from City College, where he was president of the student council, and from Harvard Law School in 1942. In World War II he served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy.
        In the early 1950's, he became a founding partner of the theatrical law firm of Colton Gallantz & Fernbach. More recently he practiced largely on his own.
        Over the years, his clients included the Tony Awards, producers Alexander H. Cohen and Harold Prince, Frank Langella, George C. Scott, Tennessee Williams, Richard Rodgers, Columbia Records and RCA Records.
        Among the scores of Broadway productions he represented were "The Homecoming," "Beyond the Fringe," "An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May" and the plays of Peter Ustinov. An expert in clearing rights for the reproduction of creative properties, he successfully defended the producers of "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine" against a suit brought by the estate of Groucho Marx.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Fernbach's survivors include a daughter by a previous marriage, Caroline B. Pinkney-Baird of London, and two stepchildren, Shelley Miller and Jefferson Miller, both of Manhattan.
