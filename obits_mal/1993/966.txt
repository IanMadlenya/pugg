        Dr. William Furst, psychiatrist and founder of the Community Psychiatric Institute in East Orange, N.J., died on Sunday in the St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 81 and lived in West Orange, N.J.
        His wife, the former Barbara Horowitz, said the cause was brain cancer.
        At his death, Dr. Furst was medical director of the Community Psychiatric Institute, the nonprofit mental health center that he founded in East Orange in 1972. He was also senior attending psychiatrist at St. Barnabas Medical Center and emeritus senior attending psychiatrist at the East Orange General Hospital. Caring for Emotionally Ill
        Calling the community institute a pilot program for the "floating population" of the emotionally ill, Dr. Furst said in a 1979 interview that the outpatient center was "an attempt by the private sector to provide continuity of care necessary to prevent the recurrence of illness."
        He opened his own psychiatric practice in Newark in 1946, then moved to East Orange and then West Orange. In 1981, he joined Associates in Psychiatry in West Orange as a partner, retiring last April.
        He was born in Newark, graduated from Lafayette College and received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1937. During World War II, he was a division surgeon with the 75th Infantry Division, with the rank of major, and saw action in the Battle of the Bulge.
        Dr. Furst was also a past associate clinical professor in psychiatry at the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. In 1961, he served as a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging. In 1987, he received the Golden Merit Award from the American Medical Association in honor of 50 years of service.
        Besides his wife, survivors include two sons, Alan N., of Short Hills, N.J., and Henry F., of West Orange; a daughter, Cathy R. Shmalo of Miami Beach; a sister, Bernice Davis of Sunrise, Fla., and six grandchildren.
