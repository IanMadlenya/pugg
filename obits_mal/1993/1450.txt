        Dr. Gerald Oster, a biophysicist who used his discoveries in photochemistry in the 1960's to pursue a career in art, died at his home in Sud Cabaret, Haiti, on Oct 8. He was 75 and had lived in Haiti for more than 10 years.
        He died of injuries suffered when he was attacked during a robbery three months earlier.
        Dr. Oster was primarily a biochemist who studied the application of physical chemistry to biology and medicine. He held a number of patents in the field of dye-sensitized photopolymerization. Some of his experiments in the structure of the eye and light involved the eyes and what is "seen" when they are closed and gently pressed. Works Displayed
        Dr. Oster found some of the effects, which can include dancing dots, spirals, circles and other geometric shapes, so visually delightful that he decided to make art of what he saw. The results were displayed in galleries and museums in the mid-1960's, when Op Art was a popular form. In 1966, his painted interpretations were displayed at the Howard Wise Gallery in Manhattan.
        Dr. Oster was born in Providence, R.I., and received his bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1940 and a doctorate in chemistry from Cornell University in 1943. From 1951 until 1969 he was a professor of polymer science at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. In 1968 he became professor of biophysics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
        After retiring to Haiti, Dr. Oster and his wife, Selmaree Greene Oster, a research biologist, founded a clinic to serve the rural population near Sud Cabaret. He was also experimenting with farming techniques in an effort to help local people better cultivate their land.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Oster is survived by two sons, Alexander of Sud Cabaret and Felix of Los Angeles, and by a daughter, Tatiana of Berlin.
