        Harold Henry Beverage, a radio engineer and RCA scientist whose research advanced communications technology, died on Wednesday at the John T. Mather Hospital in Port Jefferson, L.I. He was 99 and lived in Stony Brook.
        Mr. Beverage held more than 40 patents in his field. He was a co-inventor of the wave antenna and the diversity system for high-frequency reception.
        In awarding him its Lamme Gold Medal in 1957, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers cited him "for his pioneering and outstanding achievements in the conception and application of principles basic to progress in national and worldwide radio communications."
        In 1938, the Radio Institute of America presented him with its Armstrong Medal for his work in the development of aerial systems. The Beverage antenna, the citation said, was "the precursor of wave antennas of all types."
        In 1923, when he was just 30, he received a Morris Liebmann Memorial Prize for his contributions to the development of trans-oceanic radio.
        Mr. Beverage, who was born in North Haven, Me., graduated from the University of Maine in 1915 and went to work for General Electric Company the following year as a radio-laboratory assistant. In 1920, at the age of 27, he was placed in charge of developing receivers for trans-oceanic communications at the RCA Corporation.
        In 1929, the company named him chief research engineer of communications, a position he held until 1940, when he was promoted to vice president in charge of research and development at RCA Communications Inc., a subsidiary of the Radio Corporation of America. He retired in 1958 from that position and as director of radio research but continued to work in communications as a consultant.
        Mr. Beverage's wife, Patricia, predeceased him. He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
