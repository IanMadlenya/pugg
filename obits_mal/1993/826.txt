        Abraham Nowick, a certified public accountant who became one of the closest friends and confidants of Mayor David N. Dinkins, died suddenly on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 68 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, his family reported.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Nowick was senior partner in the Manhattan firm of Weber Lipshie & Company. He played a crucial role in Mr. Dinkins's mayoral campaign in 1989 when he served as campaign treasurer. Family friends for 15 years, they were also tennis partners.
        Mr. Dinkins, who is to deliver a eulogy at a service this afternoon, noted that through their friendship he grew more involved in issues important to the Jewish community just as Mr. Nowick involved himself in the concerns of black New Yorkers.
        Mr. Nowick was active in Democratic Party affairs in both New York and Washington. He raised money for candidates from the City Council to the United States Senate and helped in their campaigns.
        He also took a prominent role in the American Jewish Congress, serving for many years as national treasurer and senior vice president.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Nowick graduated from City College. He was in night school in 1943 studying accounting at what is now Baruch College when he went to work for Harry Weber & Company, predecessor firm of Weber Lipshie. He spent his entire career with the company, working until he was hospitalized a week before his death.
        Mr. Nowick's first wife, the former Roslyn Abzug, died in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Baer Bernstein; a daughter, Barbara Greenwald of Kingston, N.Y.; a son, Irwin, of Sacramento, Calif.; two stepsons, Dr. Lawson F. Bernstein of Pittsburgh, and Richard D. Bernstein of Bethesda, Md., and six grandchildren.
