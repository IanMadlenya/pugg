        The Rev. Peter M. Rinaldi, who fostered interest in the Shroud of Turin and encouraged scientific investigation of its authenticity, died on Sunday at a hospital in Turin, Italy. He was 82 and lived in Turin and Port Chester, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure, church associates said.
        As an altar boy at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, he learned about the shroud kept there, which some people believe to be Jesus Christ's burial cloth. It bears the imprint of a human body and bearded face, with marks corresponding to wounds from the crown of thorns described in the Bible.
        Father Rinaldi publicized the shroud to Roman Catholics in America in a 1934 magazine article and a 1940 book, "I Saw the Holy Shroud."
        Father Rinaldi was born in Lu near Turin. At the age of 15 he came to the United States, joining two older brothers. He graduated from Fordham University and the Don Bosco International Theological Institute in Turin.
        His survivors include two sisters, Sister Philomena Rinaldi and Filippina Rinaldi Mortara, both of Italy.
