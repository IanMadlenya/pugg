        Ramon F. Berger, an executive and camping consultant for several Jewish philanthropies in New York and Rhode Island, died on Wednesday at Hospice Care of Rhode Island in Providence. He was 64 years old and lived in Providence.
        The cause was esophageal cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Berger was the associate director of the Surprise Lake Camp, in Cold Spring, N.Y., from 1957 until 1963, and the Usdan Center for the Creative and Performing Arts in Wheatley Heights, L.I., from 1972 to 1974. Both are summer day camps operated by the New York Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. He was also director of the Kutz Camp Institute of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
        Mr. Berger lived in Buffalo and Manhattan before moving to Providence in 1977 to work as the executive director of the Jewish Community Center of Rhode Island. From 1984 to 1991, when he retired, he was a business broker.
        He is survived by his wife, Anita; his parents, Graenum and Emma Berger, of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Gideon S., of Chicago; a daughter, Elizabeth H., of Manhattan, and a brother, B. Michael, of Vienna, Va.
