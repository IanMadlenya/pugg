        Kenneth Gaburo, a composer, writer and teacher, died on Tuesday at his home in Iowa City, Iowa. He was 65.
        He died of bone cancer, said Philip Blackburn, a friend.
        Mr. Gaburo was a prolific composer of experimental vocal, chamber and instrumental works. He began his career as a proponent of Schoenberg's 12-tone system of composition, but later developed his own theory of "compositional linguistics," which explores the components of language as musical elements. Among his works are "On a Quiet Theme," which won the Gershwin Memorial Contest in 1954, and a set of "Antiphonies," which reflect his interest in electronic music.
        Mr. Gaburo was born in Somerville, N.J. He earned a master's degree from the Eastman School of Music and a doctorate from the University of Illinois, and studied in Rome on a Fulbright Scholarship. He won awards from the Rockefeller, Guggenheim, Koussevitsky and other foundations.
        He founded the New Music Choral Ensemble in 1960 and the Lingua Press Publishing Company in 1974, both of which focused on 20th-century experimental music. He also established the Institute of Cognitive Studies, in 1982, and taught at several colleges, including the University of California at San Diego and the University of Iowa.
        He is survived by his companion, Carmen Grier; two sons, Mark, of Brookings, Ore., and Kirk, of Minneapolis, and a daughter, Lia, of Los Angeles.
