        David D. Seltz, an expert on sales and retail franchises, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        His family said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Seltz wrote hundreds of articles and about 30 books dealing with the art of selling and franchising. His final book, "How to Get Started in Your Own Franchise Business," was published shortly before he retired five years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, David, of Manhattan; two daughters, Anne, of Boston, and Laura, of Binghamton; two brothers, Benjamin, of Chicago, and Morton Selz, of Chicago, and a sister, Jenny Kohler, of Chicago.
