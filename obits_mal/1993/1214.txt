        Arthur J. Katzman, who was sometimes called "the conscience of city government" during 29 years as a member of New York's City Council, died on Sunday at his home in Mountain View, Calif. He was 88 years old.
        He died in his sleep after a brief illness, his family said.
        An advocate of strict ethics in government, Mr. Katzman brokered the adoption of what supporters called the most sweeping reform in a municipal campaign finance law in the nation when he served as chairman of the Government Operations Committee.
        "His positions were always responsible and rational, but not always politically correct," said former Mayor Edward I. Koch. "He never lost his sense of humor, and his judgment and his mind were always clear." Practiced Law 65 Years
        Born in an area of Russia that is now in Byelorus, Mr. Katzman emigrated to the United States with his family when he was 5 years old, settling in Brownsville, Brooklyn.
        He graduated from Brooklyn Law School, and practiced law in New York City for 65 years, mostly as a sole practitioner. For 25 years, his practice was based in Forest Hills, Queens, the area he represented in the City Council.
        Mr. Katzman, a Democrat-Liberal, joined the Council in 1962 and retired in 1991 at the age of 86.
        In 1990, while chairman of the Education Committee, Mr. Katzman was the target of protests when he said in a newspaper interview that "there appears to be no liking of learning among black and Hispanic children." He apologized later for the remark, saying he had been insensitive and had meant merely to make a point about poverty.
        Mr. Katzman is survived by a daughter, Marcia K. Allen of Mountain View, Calif., and three grandchildren.
