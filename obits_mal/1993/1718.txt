        Dr. Sylvan Bloomfield, an expert on glaucoma who practiced ophthalmology in Manhattan for many years until retiring in 1987, died yesterday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 82.
        The cause was heart disease, said his son, Steven Bloomfield.
        Dr. Bloomfield was affiliated with the Mount Sinai Medical Center since he was an intern in 1936. He retired in 1986 as a clinical professor of ophthalmology. At times he was also affiliated with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, from which he graduated in 1935. He was president of the New York Society for Clinical Ophthalmology from 1967 to 1968.
        Surviving are his wife, Blanche; two sisters, Elaine Mandel of Cedarhurst, L.I., and Esther Sank of Sarasota, Fla.; three sons, Donald, of Sea Cliff, L.I., David, of Brooklyn, and Steven, of Concord, Mass., and a daughter, Susan Bloomfield of Falls Church, Va.
