        Blanchard W. Bates, a scholar of Romance languages and literature and a conservationist, died at home on Wednesday. He was 85 and lived on Chebeague Island, Maine.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Bates taught at Princeton University for nearly 40 years. He directed its European civilization program, was active in its Princeton in France program, served on the university's Council of the Humanities, served as acting chairman of Romance languages and helped to build the library collection in his field.
        He was a scholar of French Renaissance literature and a devotee of Italian Renaissance works. He wrote "Literary Portraiture in the Historical Narrative of the French Renaissance" (1945), edited Montaigne's "Selected Essays" (Modern Library, 1949) and served on the board of the journal "Symposium."
        After retiring in 1976, he founded the Cumberland Mainland and Islands Trust to preserve the Casco Bay area of Maine. He also served as president of the Chebeague Island Council and on the Cumberland County Planning Council.
        Dr. Bates was born in Portland, Me. He earned his bachelor's degree at Bowdoin, a master's degree in Romance languages and literature at Harvard and a doctorate in modern languages and literature at Princeton.
        After a year of teaching in La Rochelle, France, he taught at the Fresnal Ranch School in Tucson, Ariz., then joined Princeton's faculty in 1937.
        In World War II he served in the Office of Strategic Services at the headquarters for the Italian theater.
        He was married 52 years to the former Margaret Andrews, who died in 1987.
        His survivors include two daughters, Leila Thayer Bisharat of Manhattan and Barbara Bates Marshall of Bedford, N.H.; a son, George W. of Tallahassee, Fla.; seven grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
