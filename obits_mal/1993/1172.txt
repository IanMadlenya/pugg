        Claude Rimington, a British biochemist who suggested that King George III had suffered from an inherited abnormality, died on Aug. 8 in Askeroy, Norway, the British press said last week. He was 90 and had retired to Norway in 1968.
        Professor Rimington held a chair in chemical pathology at University College Medical School in London from 1945 until 1967. He was an authority on the biochemistry of porphyrins, pigments that are vital components in hemoglobin, an element in blood.
        In the 1960's he helped investigate a hypothesis by two psychiatric historians, Ida Macalpine and Richard Hunter, about George III, who lived from 1738 to 1820 and was seen as a tyrant by many American colonists.
        It was long thought that the King had bouts of insanity. As a British historian, Sir Charles Petrie, once wrote, "It is said that at one time, while driving at Windsor, he alighted and shook hands with a branch of an oak tree under the impression that it was the King of Prussia."
        Drawing on historical evidence, Professor Rimington and the two psychiatric historians became the co-authors of a 1968 paper on the King. In it, they suggested that George was plagued by an inherited abnormality of porphryin metabolism, variegate porphyria, in which porphryins build up in the body. Left untreated, the disease can cause delirium and psychotic behavior.
        Sir Charles said the hypothesis that George was actually suffering from porphyria would explain the King's erratic behavior as well as his physical ailments. Dr. Macalpine and Dr. Hunter later wrote a book suggesting that other members of the royal families of Europe, including some living today, were plagued by the disease.
        Professor Rimington was born in London and was educated at the University of Cambridge. He married Soffi Andersen in 1929 and they had a daughter.
