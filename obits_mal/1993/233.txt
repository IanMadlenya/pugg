        Edward Myers, the director of the Nashville Ballet and a former principal dancer with the Pennsylvania Ballet, died on Monday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. He was 42 and lived in Nashville.
        His companion, Richard Steinhart, said the cause of death was AIDS.
        From 1974 to 1987, the years in which Mr. Myers danced with the Pennsylvania company, he became known as a stylish, low-keyed dancer who was equally at home in pyrotechnical and acting roles. His classical repertory included Siegfried in "Swan Lake," Albrecht in "Giselle" and Franz in "Coppelia"; his character roles included Dr. Coppelius in "Coppelia" and Madge the Witch in "La Sylphide."
        Mr. Myers was born in Westminster, Md. He trained with Frederic Franklin, Lupe Serrano, Edward Caton and Margaret Craske, and performed with the National Ballet of Washington and the Maryland Ballet before joining the Pennsylvania troupe. He retired from performing in 1986 but served as a member of the state arts councils in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He also worked as a master teacher, coach and choreographer.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his parents, Norman and Ethel Myers, and a brother, Joe, all of Westminster.
