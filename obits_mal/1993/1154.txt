        Jeremiah Kaplan, a former president of two New York-based publishing companies, the Macmillan Publishing Company and then Simon & Schuster Inc. died yesterday in New York Hospital. He was 67 and had homes on the East Side of Manhattan and in Holden, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, said John G. Ekizian, director of publicity at the Free Press, a division of the Macmillan Publishing Company.
        Mr. Kaplan was president of the Macmillan Publishing Company from 1965 to 1973 and from 1977 to 1986. He was president of Simon & Schuster Inc. from 1987 to 1989.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Kaplan graduated from Seward Park High School in Manhattan but did not go to college. In 1947, when he was 20, he and Charles Liebman founded The Free Press, which then specialized in books on religion and the social sciences. In 1958 he was a co-founder of Meridian Books, a paperback book-publishing company that was later bought by World Publishers. Sold in 1960
        The Free Press was sold in 1960 and was then merged into the Macmillan Publishing Company, and Mr. Kaplan, who had remained with The Free Press, was put in charge of a new Macmillan division, which included The Free Press -- it now publishes a wide range of nonfiction books -- and Macmillan's college books and professional books divisions and Macmillan Trade Books. He then rose to be president.
        In 1974, Mr. Kaplan moved to London and became managing director of Cassell & Collier Macmillan Publishers Ltd., which was then a subsidiary of Macmillan Inc., of which the Macmillan Publishing Company is a unit. He returned to New York in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Charlotte R. Larsen; a sister, Millicent Kaplan of Elmwood Park, N.J.; three daughters, Ann Kaplan Fippinger and Susanna Lenzi, both of Manhattan, and Margaret Allard of Knoxville, Tenn; a son, David, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
