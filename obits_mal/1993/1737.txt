        Harry Rubenstein, the general director of the Joyce Trisler Danscompany, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said Regina Larkin, the artistic director of Danscompany.
        Mr. Rubenstein, who was born in Plainfield, N.J., enlisted in the Army after graduating from high school and received a Bronze Star for service in the South Pacific during World War II. He lived in Paris for about 10 years, working with the impresario of the Olympia Theater and managing touring performers, including Katherine Dunham, whom he represented for 10 years, and Judy Garland.
        Mr. Rubenstein lived for several years in Tel Aviv, where he opened the city's first music hall in the late 1960's. After returning to New York, he managed artists in musical theater. One of his clients was Ms. Trisler, with whom he worked until her death in 1979. Mr. Rubenstein had also served as the director of the New York Dance Group, one of New York's major dance schools.
        He is survived by two sisters, Fay Feldman of Edison, N.J., and Ida Darman of Highland Park, N.J.
