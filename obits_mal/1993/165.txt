        Dr. Mark Ellingson, educator and president of Rochester Institute of Technology for 33 years, died at his home in Rochester on Feb. 12. He was 88.
        Complications from a stroke caused his death, William McKee, the spokesman for the institute, said.
        During Dr. Ellingson's lengthy tenure in office from 1936 to 1969, enrollment in day and evening classes rose from 2,250 to 16,000. The endowment increased from $1.5 million to about $22 million and total assets climbed from $2.4 million to about $111 million. Introduced New Programs
        Through Dr. Ellingson's vision, the institute built the present 1,300-acre campus in Henrietta, a suburb of Rochester. Under his direction, new programs were introduced in science, engineering, printing, photography, the crafts and business administration.
        One of his first acts as president was to incorporate into the institute the Empire State School of Printing, founded by Frank E. Gannett. Dr. Ellingson also brought to the university the School for American Craftsmen in 1950 and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf in 1966.
        He joined the faculty of the Rochester Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute, forerunner of the Rochester Institute of Technology, in 1926. He served as an economics instructor for 10 years before becoming president.
        Born in Magrath, Alberta, Canada, he graduated from Gooding College (Idaho), receiving a master's degree from the University of Rochester and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marcia Cooke Randall; three daughters, Laura Kathryn Allen of Carlsbad, Calif., Louise, of Rochester, Karen Marie Trueheart of Pittsford, N.Y.; a son, Jon Eric, of Missoula, Mont., and nine grandchildren.
