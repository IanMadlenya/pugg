        Romeo Muller Jr., a television writer who created family Christmas favorites including "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," "Frosty the Snowman," "The Little Drummer Boy" and "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," died on Wednesday at his home in High Falls, N.Y. He was 64 years old.
        He died in his sleep, said his brother, Eugene E. Muller.
        In December, Mr. Muller released his last animated Christmas story, "Noel," a story about a glass Christmas ornament. The story was broadcast on NBC after Mr. Muller had told it on the radio in High Falls for years.
        He also wrote screenplays for several animated Easter and Thanksgiving specials. He wrote the script for the animation of J. R. R. Tolkien's "Hobbit," which received a Peabody Award. He also wrote the first three animated "Strawberry Shortcake" specials.
        Mr. Muller grew up in Merrick, L.I. At age 12, he put on marionette shows in schoolyards and libraries, using a portable stage his father had built.
        Besides his brother, Mr. Muller is survived by his father, Romeo Muller Sr.
