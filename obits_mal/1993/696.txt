        Ian Mikardo, a former chairman of the British Labor Party and a Member of Parliament for 37 years, died Thursday in a hospital in Stockport, near Manchester, England. He was 84 years old and lived in Cheshire, in western England.
        Mr. Mikardo, known as Mik, was a prime mover behind a left-wing movement, led by Aneurin Bevan, that temporarily split the Labor Party in the 1950's and 60's. He went on to become chairman of the party in 1970 and 1971, during a long career in Parliament, representing various constituencies, from 1945 to 1959 and from 1964 to 1987.
        One British newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, said Friday of the left-wing movement, "It was Mikardo's relentless energy and organizing skill that molded a disparate group of prima donnas into a national force."
        Mr. Mikardo's father was from Poland, and his mother from Ukraine. Mr. Mikardo was born in Portsmouth, on the Channel coast, and spoke mainly Yiddish until he began school. He went on to attend Portsmouth Municipal College, to work his way up from low-paying jobs and to become active in the trade union movement.
        During World War II he worked as a designer in the aircraft industry and as a management consultant. Afterward, he worked in a liaison role in East-West trade.
        He and his wife, Mary, had two daughters.
