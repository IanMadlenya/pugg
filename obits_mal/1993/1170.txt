        Jack Brusca, a painter who worked with an airbrush in acrylic paint, died on Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 56 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Samantha LePage, a friend.
        Mr. Brusca won critical praise when he had his first one-man show, in 1969 at the Bonino Galleria on West 57th Street, for painting that came out of Leger and the mechanistic tradition but was not enslaved to those origins.
        At a 1973 show in that gallery, he was lauded by one critic as being "just about as sharp as they come" in the illusionistic representation of sleek three-dimensional forms through a mixture of surrealism, pop and hard-edged neo-realism.
        His last one-man show, in 1989, was at the Paraty Gallery in SoHo. His paintings were also shown at several museums and acquired by the Whitney Museum and others.
        Mr. Brusca also designed sets and costumes for ballet. His costumes for Louis Falco's ballet "Escarpot," performed by Alvin Ailey Dance Theater at City Center in 1991, won critical praise. He also designed jewelry.
        Mr. Brusca was born in Flushing, Queens. He graduated from Flushing High School and studied at the University of New Hampshire and the New York School of Visual Arts.
        He is survived by his companion, Mark O'Connor; his father, Joseph, of Jupiter, Fla., and five brothers: Bob, of Queens; Bill and Kenneth, both of Manhattan; Donald, of Boston, and Richard, of Coral Springs, Fla.
