        Dr. Reiner Schurmann, professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research and past chairman of the Graduate Faculty in its Department of Philosophy, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 52 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS-related, said Judith Walz, a longtime friend.
        Dr. Schurmann, born in Amsterdam of German parents, contributed scores of articles and commentaries in French and English.
        One of his most notable books was "Heidegger on Being and Acting: From Principles to Anarchy" (Indiana University Press, 1986), originally published in Paris four years earlier.
        His other books included one, in French and English, on the writings of Meister Eckhardt, the founder of German mysticism. The English version became "Meister Eckhardt: Mystic & Philosopher" (Indiana University Press, 1978.) He edited "The Public Realm: Essays on Discursive Types in Political Philosophy" (S.U.N.Y. Press, Series in Philosophy; 1988).
        Dr. Schurmann was educated in Germany and Paris, where he also pursued religious studies.
        He came to the United States in 1969 and taught at Catholic University in Washington and then Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. In 1975 Hannah Arendt and Hans Jonas -- prominent figures at the New School of their day -- invited him to join its Graduate Faculty of Philosophy.
        He became one of Professor Jonas's successors as department chairman, serving from 1977 to 1984 when he was appointed a full professor. From 1980 until his death he organized the twice-yearly Hannah Arendt Memorial Symposia in Political Philosophy at the Graduate Faculty.
        Dr. Schurmann is survived by his mother, Emma Schurmann; two sisters, Monika Berenger and Renate Maslowski; and a brother, Thomas.
