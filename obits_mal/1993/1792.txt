        Frederick L. Zimmerman, a political science teacher at Hunter College for more than 30 years, died on Tuesday at the Highgate Manor Nursing Home in Troy, N.Y. He was 87.
        He had a long illness, said his son, Lloyd K. Zimmerman of Coxsackie, N.Y.
        Mr. Zimmerman graduated from Columbia College in 1928 and two years later, at age 22, he was elected to the first of six terms in the New York State Assembly from the Sixth District in Queens. He was an authority on interstate compacts, writing legislation that led to the creation of the New York State Joint Legislative Committee of Interstate Cooperation.
        Mr. Zimmerman joined the Hunter College faculty as a lecturer in 1937, became a professor in 1959, and retired as chairman of the political science department in 1971.
