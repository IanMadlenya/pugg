        Joseph William Coyle, who gained fame after picking up $1.2 million that tumbled from an armored car in 1981, was found dead yesterday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 40.
        Mr. Coyle, an unemployed longshoreman who spent large amounts of the money that he and two friends picked up, hanged himself with an electrical cord, said Robert Whalen , a detective with the Philadelphia police, according to The Associated Press.
        Police officials said relatives described Mr. Coyle as still deeply grieving for his mother, who died in 1981. In addition, Mr. Coyle, who was known as Joey, had recently been convicted in a drug case. It was his sixth drug conviction, and he was to be sentenced next month.
        A movie based on Mr. Coyle's experiences will be released Sept. 10. Its director, Ramon Menendez, has said he wanted the film to illustrate "what it means for a kid like that to find money." He added, "He thinks he has choices, but the money makes him paranoid."
        It was Feb. 26, 1981, when Mr. Coyle and two friends were driving behind a Purolator Armored Services truck as its back doors swung open and two money bags fell out.
        Mr. Coyle then became a local folk hero for passing out $100 bills around his neighborhood. He was arrested at Kennedy International Airport as he was checking in for a flight to Acapulco, Mexico; at the time, he was carrying $105,000 in 21 envelopes with $5,000 each. The envelopes were stuffed around his ankles in the tops of elastic socks. The two friends, who told the authorities about the incident, were not charged.
        In February 1982, a jury found Mr. Coyle innocent of theft by reason of temporary insanity. The armored car company recovered all but roughly $196,000 of the money.
        He is survived by a sister.
