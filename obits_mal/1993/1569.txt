        Jimmy A. Williams, a former Hollywood stuntman who became one of the nation's leading trainers of Olympic riders and horses, died on Sunday at the Hospital for the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. He was 76.
        The cause of death was respiratory failure, said Alan F. Balch, president of the Flintridge Riding Club in La Canada, Calif., where Mr. Williams had been riding master since 1956.
        Mr. Williams was the first West Coast horseman to succeed in national equestrian championships and taught such equestrians as Mary Mairs Chapot, Robert Ridland, Mason Phelps Jr. and Susan Hutchison. He doubled for Tyrone Power in the movie "Jesse James."
        Mr. Williams, who was married six times, is survived by Miss Hutchison, his companion; and by a daughter, Linda Rae Simons.
