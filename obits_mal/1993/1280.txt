        Read Viemeister, an industrial designer, died on Sunday at his home in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He was 70.
        His family said he had had an extended illness.
        Mr. Viemeister designed for print media, packaging, products and architecture. In 1947, he was among a group of designers assembled by Preston Tucker in Detroit to design the innovative but financially ill-fated Tucker automobile. In 1949, Mr. Viemeister founded the Department of Industrial Design at the Dayton Art Institute.
        He graduated from Pratt Institute in New York City in 1943. Fifty years later, in May of this year, Pratt awarded him its Alumni Achievement Award.
        He moved to Yellow Springs in 1947, where he and Budd Steinhilber established Vie Design Studios in a converted chicken coop.
        Mr. Viemeister is survived by his wife, Beverly; two sons, Tucker, of New York City, and Kris, of Virginia; two daughters, Heidi, of Yellow Springs, and Roslyn, of New York City; two brothers, Lathrop and Peter; a sister, Jill, and three grandchildren.
