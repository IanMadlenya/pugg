        Rabbi Samuel Freilich, who helped organize an escape of Jewish men from the Nazis during a forced march to Auschwitz in 1945 and later established a network of schools for Jewish orphans in Hungary, died Thursday in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 91.
        He had had a long illness, his family said.
        Rabbi Freilich served the Ohave Sholom Synagogue in Gardner, Mass., from 1961 until he retired and moved to Riverdale in 1978.
        Born in Hungary and educated at Charles University in Prague, he completed rabbinical studies in Prague and in Brunn, Czechoslovakia, before serving as a district rabbi in Bohemia, Czechoslovakia.
        Early in World War II, he was drafted into a Jewish slave labor battalion by the Nazis and participated in a forced march of prisoners from Minsk to the Russian front. Three-quarters of the 60,000 marchers died. He later wrote a book about his experiences, "The Coldest Winter," published by Holocaust Books in 1988.
        After escaping from the Nazis several years later, he survived as a worker on an Austrian farm until the war was over. He returned to Hungary and eventually became superintendent of Hebrew elementary schools and high schools.
        In 1947, he married Ella Weider, a survivor of Auschwitz, in Prague, and the two emigrated to the United States when the Communists took over Czechoslovakia in 1949.
        Rabbi Freilich served as rabbi of Ohave Sholom for two years and then as rabbi of Temple Beth Sholom in Lake Worth, Fla., from 1958 to 1961. He returned to Ohave Sholom when he was given lifetime tenure as rabbi there.
        He is survived by his wife; a son, Ary of Englewood, N.J.; a daughter, Hadassah Lieberman of New Haven, and four grandchildren.
