        Allan Hoover, the son of President Herbert Hoover, died on Thursday in Portola Valley, Calif. He was 86 and had lived much of his life in California.
        Mr. Hoover died after a brief illness, The Associated Press reported.
        Allan Hoover, who also lived for a time in Greenwich, Conn., was active in the affairs of the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace in Palo Alto, Calif., which was established in 1919 as the Hoover War Library by Herbert Hoover, and of the Herbert Hoover Foundation, which was founded in 1955 to advance the educational, scientific and public welfare principles of the former President.
        Allan Hoover also had a leading role in the restoration of President Hoover's birthplace, a house in West Branch, Iowa. The site is now the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.
        Over the years, he was an owner and operator of farm and ranch properties, a mining executive and an investment banker. He was for some years the president of Compania Minera de Guatemala S.A.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, Allan Jr. and Andrew; a daughter, Lou Henry, and six grandchildren.
