        Fred B. Black Jr., an aerospace lobbyist who became ensnared in a political scandal in the early 60's, died Friday at a nursing home in Wheaton, Md. He was 80 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Black was widely known in Washington as a friend of politicians in his role as a consultant for military contractors in the post-World War II arms and space races.
        His downfall stemmed from his secret partnership with Robert G. Baker in the Serv-U Corporation, a vending machine business. Mr. Baker was Secretary of the Senate and a longtime aide to Lyndon B. Johnson.
        In 1963 a rival vending company's lawsuit against Serv-U disclosed Mr. Baker's and Mr. Black's partnership. That prompted a Senate investigation into Mr. Baker's dealings with a lobbyist, and both men were also prosecuted on income tax evasion charges.
        In 1964, Mr. Black was convicted of evading $91,000 in taxes and sentenced to up to four years in prison. But the conviction was later overturned and Mr. Black was acquitted in a second trial.
        In 1982, Mr. Black was prosecuted on charges involving a scheme to launder more than $1 million in Colombian cocaine money. He served seven years in prison.
        Mr. Black was born in Webb City, Mo., and grew up in nearby Carterville. He went to Washington as an acquaintance of Harry S. Truman, then a Senator from Missouri.
        His marriage to the former Nina Lunn ended in divorce. He is survived by a son, Fred 3d, of Annadale, Va., and two daughters, Nina Black of Washington and Nola Murphy of Bethesda.
