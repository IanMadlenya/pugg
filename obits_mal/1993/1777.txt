        Patrick Kelly, a dancer and writer, died at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan on Friday. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Richard Dworkin.
        Born in Portland, Ore., where he began his dance training and received a degree in nursing from Oregon Health Services University, Mr. Kelly danced in the corps de ballet of companies including the Portland, San Francisco and Cleveland Ballets. He also performed as the ballerina Doris Videnya in the all-male Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo.
        Mr. Kelly wrote about dance for New York Native and Dance Magazine. He worked as a psychiatric nurse and supervisor at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was the founder and president of the Village Dive Club and Diving for Life, a national scuba-diving organization active in AIDS support services.
        In addition to his companion, Mr. Kelly is survived by his parents, Tyke and Joseph Kelly; two sisters, Gale Edwards and Anne Bateman, and two brothers, Michael and Casey, all of Portland, and his maternal grandmother, Wyona Larson, of Alameda, Calif.
