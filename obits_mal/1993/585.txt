        John F. Ryan, an early union organizer and officer in the New York Newspaper Guild, died on Thursday at a hospital in Glen Cove, L.I., where he lived. He was 85.
        Mr. Ryan, a former reporter and editor on Long Island, joined the union staff in the 1930's. He became its general organizer, then was elected executive vice president. He was involved in recruitment, grievances, negotiations and strikes of news and business employees at newspapers and magazines.
        He was part of a so-called left-wing guild administration of many years that was eventually ousted amid charges of Communism.
        After Milton Murray, the union's international president, accused him of being a Communist, Mr. Ryan was voted out of office in 1947. The guild's Representative Assembly elected him to the union's executive board in 1948, but after several months he resigned.
        Called before the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee in 1955, he denied being a Communist then, but declined to say whether he had been one earlier. He also declined to talk about colleagues accused by Winston Burdett, a CBS correspondent.
        After leaving the union, Mr. Ryan was the editor of a new labor paper, March of Labor, then worked in public relations.
        His wife, the former Madeline Hallowell, is deceased. He is survived by two sons, Mark, of Glen Cove, L.I., and John Jr., of Shirley, L.I.; two brothers, Thomas, of Brooksville, Fla., and Franklin, of Manhattan; a sister, Kate Sander of Sagaponack, L.I., and three grandchildren.
