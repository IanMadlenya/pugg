        William J. Dorvillier, founder, editor and publisher of The San Juan Star, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for distinguished editorial writing, died yesterday at Concord Hospital in New Hampshire. He was 85 and lived in Concord.
        He died of cancer, said his daughter-in-law, Deanna Inez Dorvillier.
        Mr. Dorvillier, a Roman Catholic, was awarded the Pulitzer for his editorials criticizing the Roman Catholic bishops of Puerto Rico for interfering in the 1960 election for governor. Voters defied the bishops' threat of ex-communication and voted against the bishops' candidate to elect Luis Munoz Marin.
        A native of North Adams, Mass., Mr. Dorvillier worked as a journalist in Puerto Rico for nearly four decades. He was editor of The Puerto Rico World Journal from 1940 to 1945. He then went to Washington as White House correspondent for a San Juan daily, El Mundo, returning to Puerto Rico in 1953 to found the Dorvillier News Agency.
        With backing from Cowles Magazines, he founded The San Juan Star, an English-language daily, in 1959. He served as editor-publisher and president of Star Publishing Company until 1967.
        After retiring in 1979, Mr. Dorvillier moved to Concord.
        In the late 1930's, The Associated Press sent him as correspondent to the Caribbean and he took up residence in Puerto Rico in 1939.
        He was the author of "Workshop U.S.A., the Challenge of Puerto Rico," published in 1962.
        Mr. Dorvillier is survived by his son, William Clay Dorvillier of Concord, and six grandchildren.
