        Kiyoshi Hayakawa, a Tokyo publisher who introduced Western writers to Japanese readers, died on July 9 at Hitachi Hospital in Tokyo. He was 80.
        He had suffered a heart ailment, his American literary scouts said in reporting the death in New York.
        He helped his father in a manufacturing business before founding Hayakawa Publishing in 1945. Mr. Hayakawa, an economics graduate of Senshu University, was still chairman and chief executive at his death.
        The company carries a long list of titles of American, British, French and German writers in Japanese translation. The 100-page catalogue for 1993 presents a cross section of Western literature, although the Japanese public appears to prefer mystery and science fiction as the best sellers of the Hayakawa offerings.
        Mr. Hayakawa often used movie tie-ins to add to his list, as he did with "The Third Man" by Graham Greene, "The Godfather" by Mario Puzo, and "Balzac" by Stefan Zweig.
        Mr. Hayakawa is survived by his wife, Ayako; two sons, Hiroshi, president and chief operating officer of the publishing house, and Akira; two daughters, Sumiko and Haruko, and eight grandchildren.
