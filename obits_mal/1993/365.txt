        Frank A. Barrera, a Brooklyn lawyer who specialized in real estate and probate law since 1931, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85.
        The cause of death was a brain tumor, his family said.
        Mr. Barrera, who was born in Brooklyn, earned his law degree from Georgetown University and practiced on Court Street in Brooklyn. Over the years, he was a president of the Brooklyn Bar Association, counsel to the Real Estate Board of Brooklyn and chairman of the zoning committee of the Metropolitan Association of Real Estate Boards.
        He was a member of New York City's Conciliation and Appeals Board, which administered the rent stabilization law, and often spoke for real-estate interests at public hearings on zoning laws, rent control and other matters affecting owners and tenants. Led Social Service Agency
        For the last 56 years, Mr. Barrera was also active in the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, a social service agency that helps the crippled, the blind, and the emotionally and mentally disabled. Mr. Barrera was elected to the bureau's board of directors in 1954. He served as the agency's president from 1973 to 1978, and remained a director at the time of his death.
        Mr. Barrera had two wives who died before him. He is survived by five daughters, Francine Rexer of Huntington, L.I., Margaret Parkes of Manhattan, Anne-Marie Barnes of Fredericksburg, Va., Jeannine Macko of LaCosta, Calif., and Genevieve Bonadonna of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; two sons, Stephen, of Garden City, L.I., and Michael, of Miami; 15 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
