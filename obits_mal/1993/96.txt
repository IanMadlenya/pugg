        Alexander Neuwirth, an investment banker who opened the first Tokyo office for Burnham & Company, died on Thursday at New Milford Hospital in New Milford, Conn. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complication from myelodisplasia, an illness that makes it difficult for the blood to clot, said his wife, Marjorie.
        A graduate of Cornell University and the Harvard Business School, Mr. Neuwirth joined Burnham & Company in 1959. He opened its Tokyo office in 1971 and left the firm in 1977, four years after it became Drexel Burnham Lambert through a merger.
        In 1982, he started his own company, Hemisphere Management Corporation in Manhattan. In addition, Mr. Neuwirth was a trustee of the University of the Americas in Mexico City and the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan. He was also a member of the Cornell Council, which conducts studies and other projects for the university.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Andrew and Philip, and his mother, Pauline Neuwirth, all of Manhattan.
