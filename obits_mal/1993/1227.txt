        Max Henry Fisher, a British merchant banker and who as the editor of The Financial Times in the1970's turned it into a European journal of information and opinion, died Sunday, the paper reported yesterday. He was 71.
        The cause was not given.
        Born in Berlin, Mr. Fisher, a Jew, fled Hitler's Germany. He joined The Financial Times in London in 1957 and spent 23 years with the paper, as a reporter, foreign editor, assistant editor and deputy editor. He was editor from 1973 to 1980.
        His predecessor, Sir Gordon Newton, had transformed the paper from, essentially, a stock market data sheet into Britain's leading source of business information. He also peopled the rapidly growing paper with writers of high academic caliber, and Mr. Fisher was one of his recruits. Went Into Banking
        After he left the paper in 1980, Mr. Fisher went into banking and became a director of the international, London-based banking house of S.G. Warburg & Co. Ltd. He retired from the board in 1989 but continued as a consultant.
        Mr. Fisher, known as Fredy, attended school in Berlin until his family fled to Switzerland. He was sent to school in England where, still in his teens, he was interned as an enemy alien and sent to Australia. When policy changed, he volunteered for the British Army and served in Europe. Expanded World Coverage
        He graduated from Oxford University and spent seven years at the Foreign Office editing documents on German foreign policy.
        As a reporter at The Financial Times, he came up with scoops on Britain's position as related to the rest of Europe. As foreign editor, he expanded international coverage, and as assistant editor he added a Management Page and increased industrial coverage. He served as deputy editor for two years before taking the top editor's post.
        Mr. Fisher's Australian-born wife, Rosemary Maxwell Fisher, survives. They had two sons and a daughter.
