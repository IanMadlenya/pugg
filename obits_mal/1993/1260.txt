        James T. Griffin, vice president and general counsel of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of the nation's richest, died on Saturday at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Ill. He was 60 and a resident of Chicago.
        The cause was complications related to cancer therapy, the foundation said.
        At his death, Mr. Griffin was responsible for legal and tax concerns of the foundation and its assets of $3 billion. He joined the foundation as chief counsel in 1988 but had already spent much of his legal career serving it and its founder, John D. MacArthur, the insurance and real estate billionaire.
        Mr. Griffin graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1955 and then spent three years as an officer in the Marine Corps. He received his law degree from Loyola University in 1961 and joined the Chicago firm of William T. Kirby, which managed many of Mr. MacArthur's legal matters.
        When the firm became Hubachek, Kell, Rauch & Kirby, his field expanded into a commercial practice that involved extensive work for Bankers Life and Casualty, whose stock was the original sole asset of the MacArthur Foundation. On Mr. MacArthur's death in 1978, Mr. Griffin helped establish the asset base of the foundation and its twin, the Retirement Research Foundation.
        In 1980 he co-founded the firm of Burke, Griffin, Chomicz & Weinke, now Burke, Wilson & McIlvaine, another principal outside counsel to the foundation.
        Mr. Griffin is survived by his wife, Eileen Hennessy Griffin; a daughter, Sheila Griffin of Chicago; four sons, James, Martin and Daniel, all of Chicago, and Paul, of Washington; a brother, Jack, of Three Lakes, Wis.; a sister, Mary Schwaba of Glenview, Ill., and four grandchildren.
