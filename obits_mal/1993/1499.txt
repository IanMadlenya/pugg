        Michael L. Cipriano, a display designer whose work was shown at Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Barneys, died on Oct. 8 at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 33 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, his family said.
        From 1985 to 1990, Mr. Cipriano was a display manager for Chelsea Passage, the gift area at the Barneys downtown store. After leaving, he was a consultant to the store, helping to design decorative table settings twice a week. His designs were influenced by late 19th century decorative styles. He was also a collector of Victorian porcelain and sterling silver spoons and trowels.
        He was born in Waterbury, Conn., and educated at the University of Connecticut.
        He is survived by his companion, Thomas Shoemaker; his mother, Evelyn Piperas of Waterbury, and his father, Michael of New Britain, Conn.
