        Jonas Hollander, manager of the Los Angeles advertising office of The New York Times, died yesterday at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Before joining The Times in 1974, Mr. Hollander was the sales promotion manager of the May Company of California, advertising director for John Wanamaker of New York, and assistant advertising manager for Bonwit Teller.
        He is survived by his wife, Vivian, and two sons, John and David.
