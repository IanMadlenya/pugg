        Dr. Edward E. Jones, a social psychologist who developed theories and conducted studies on how people perceive themselves and others, died on Friday while on vacation in Emerald Isle, N.C. He was 66 and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Jones had been a professor at Princeton since 1977 and was a former chairman of the psychology department at Duke.
        He was a past president of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology and won the American Psychological Association's award for distinguished scientific contribution, the Society for Experimental Social Psychology's distinguished scientist award and a book publisher's award for his contribution to the Century Psychology Series.
        His work specialized in "person perception," the study of how people view one another's moods and motives. He wrote "Ingratiation" (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1964) and "Interpersonal Perception" (W. H. Freeman, 1990) and was co-author of "Foundations of Social Psychology" (Wiley, 1967) and "Social Stigma" (W. H. Freeman, 1984).
        Dr. Jones was born in Buffalo. In World War II he served in the United States Army. After earning bachelor's and doctoral degrees at Harvard, he joined the Duke faculty in 1953.
        His survivors include his wife of 46 years, the former Virginia Sweetnam; four daughters, Sarah Jones Cuskley of Chappaqua, N.Y., Caroline Jones of Cambridge, Mass., Amelia Jones of Los Angeles and Janet Jones of Princeton; two sons, Todd and Jason, both of Durham, N.C.; two brothers, Richard J., of Chicago, and Llewellyn H., of Los Alamos, N.M., and six grandchildren.
