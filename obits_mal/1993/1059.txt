        Robert Hall, a prominent college football figure and former athletic director at Yale, died Wednesday in North Palm Beach, Fla., where he lived. He was 86.
        The cause of death was Parkinson's disease and pneumonia, according to his son Robert Jr.
        Hall was a founder and longtime director of the National Football Foundation and the College Hall of Fame. He had been a Yale quarterback and later a scout for the varsity team while attending Yale Law School.
        While practicing law in Philadelphia, he was the radio broadcaster for Philadelphia Eagles games. That led to the founding of Tel-Ra, a film company that produced a syndicated college football highlight show for television, with Hall and Harry Wismer as the announcers.
        Hall was athletic director at Yale from 1950 to 1953. During that time, he headed the television committee of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which began an embargo of the local televising of games not sold out in home stadiums. The National Football League later adopted the policy.
        In addition to his son Robert Jr., he is surived by his wife, Ann; his son Charles, and a grandson.
