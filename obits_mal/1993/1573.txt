        Bernard Martin Decker, a retired Federal judge in Chicago who upheld an Illinois town's right to ban pistols and a neo-Nazi band's right to march in the suburban village of Skokie, died on Tuesday in a Lake Forest nursing home. A longtime resident of Waukegan, Ill., he was 89.
        Judge Becker, a Republican appointed by President Kennedy in 1962, presided over the long battle over injunctions involving Skokie ordinances that impeded the Nazis' parade in the late 1970's. It pitted the heavily Jewish village against a neo-Nazi group whose right to free speech and assembly was argued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
        At one point Judge Decker said it was better to let hatemongers "expend their venom in rhetoric" than to let government decide what citizens might say and hear. The march eventually took place.
        The judge also drew national attention when he ruled that Morton Grove, Ill., had not violated the state or Federal constitutions when it banned the sale and possession of handguns. His finding in 1981 upheld the country's toughest gun-control law, which was fought by the National Rifle Association.
        A native of Highland Park, Ill., Judge Decker graduated from the University of Illinois magna cum laude and from Harvard Law School. He was in private practice until 1951, when he became an Illinois circuit judge. He was a presiding circuit judge when President Kennedy put him on the bench for the Northern District of Illinois. He retired as a senior judge at the end of 1987.
        He was a past president of the Harvard Law Society of Chicago and the Waukegan Board of Education.
        Judge Decker is survived by his wife of 65 years, Louise Armstrong Decker; a daughter, Janine Collins; a son, Martin C.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
