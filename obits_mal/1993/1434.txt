        Brother Augustine Philip Nelan, who was the 15th president of Manhattan College from 1953 to 1962, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 87 and lived at the Christian Brothers Center in Riverdale.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery, the college said.
        As president, he was responsible for introducing new programs and for building Jasper Hall, a residence, and Thomas Hall, a student center. The Bronx college was founded by the Christian Brothers in 1853 and remains affiliated with the order.
        He initiated programs in the liberal arts, nuclear physics and forensic psychology. He also created a department of chemical engineering and a full-time faculty in theology.
        Brother Philip was a Christian Brother for 70 years. He became a novice in 1922 and took vows the next year. A graduate of Manhattan College, he held master's and doctoral degrees from New York University.
        He joined the faculty as a professor of English in 1933. After leaving the presidency, he did several other assignments for the order.
        At 72, in 1978, he began a new career working with the National Restaurant Association to place handicapped men and women in jobs in the food industry. He continued this, traveling coast to coast, until 1992.
        Last year he rejoined Manhattan College as curator of its art collection and an assistant in the development office. He was a past president of the Conference of Catholic Colleges and Universities of New York State.
        He is survived by a sister, Helen Schweitzer, and two brothers, John and Philip, all of the Bronx.
        Correction:  October 9, 1993, Saturday
        An obituary headline yesterday about Brother Augustine Philip Nelan, the president of Manhattan College from 1953 to 1962, who died on Tuesday, referred to him incorrectly. He was a Christian brother in the Roman Catholic Church, not a monk. Christian brothers devote themselves to education.
