        Richard Dicker, a former chief executive of the Penn Central Corporation, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He had a brief illness, the company reported.
        Mr. Dicker graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia University Law School, and started his career with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington. He joined the Equitable Life Assurance Society in 1953 and became a vice president and deputy general counsel.
        While there, he headed an institutional creditor group for the 1970's bankruptcy proceedings involving what had once been the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1978, when Penn Central emerged from bankruptcy after eight years of reorganization, he was elected board chairman and chief executive.
        As the chief officer, he negotiated a cash settlement in which the Federal Government paid $2.1 billion for railroad properties transferred to Conrail in 1976. Penn Central now is a holding company dealing in property and casualty insurance, based in Cincinnati.
        Mr. Dicker retired as the company's chief officer in 1982 but remained a director until 1991. At his death he was a director of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, an aerospace and industrial concern, and chairman of the board of the Post-Graduate Center for Mental Health in New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Vivian, and a son, Owen, and a brother, Milton, both residents of New Jersey.
