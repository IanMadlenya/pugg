        Gino Robusti, a founder and former owner of the New York restaurant Quo Vadis for more than 30 years, died on Saturday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. He was 82 and lived in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
        He died after a long illness, said Gilberte Breslin, his daughter.
        Mr. Robusti founded the restaurant with his lifelong partner Bruno Caravaggi in 1946, after both came to the United States from Spa, Belgium, to work for the restaurant of the Belgian Pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair.
        In 1981 they sold the restaurant, which was on 63d Street between Madison and Park Avenues, but after the new owners declared bankruptcy, Mr. Robusti and Mr. Caravaggi resumed its operation until it closed in 1985.
        Mr. Robusti is survived by his wife, Gilberte; two daughters, Gilberte Breslin of Garrison, N.Y., and Claudette Giani of Huntington Station, L.I.; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
