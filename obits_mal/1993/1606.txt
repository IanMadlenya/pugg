        James Yates, who went from the cotton fields of Mississippi to the battlefields of the Spanish Civil War and the New York civil rights fights, died on Sunday in Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Yates was a longtime resident of Chelsea in Manhattan. He chronicled his journey in "Mississippi to Madrid: Memoir of a Black American in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade." Published first in 1986 by Shamal Books (New York), it was reissued three years later by Open Hand (Seattle).
        Mr. Yates became a familiar figure on Greenwich Village street corners, selling his book from a table and sharing the story of his life with passers-by.
        The son of sharecroppers in Quitman, Miss., Mr. Yates made his way north as a young man. Working on the Pennsylvania Railroad, he helped to organize the Dining Car Waiters Union in the 1930's. He was among a handful of blacks to volunteer for the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and, as an ammunition and ambulance driver, was wounded twice.
        In World War II, he served in the Army. He studied electronics under the G.I. Bill, but later found it difficult to find a job during the McCarthy era because he had fought for the leftist Loyalists in Spain.
        Mr. Yates is survived by a daughter, Louise Rush of Lansing, Mich.; a sister, Annie Reynolds of Chicago; two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
