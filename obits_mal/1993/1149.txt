        Dr. Ralph William Sleeper, a specialist in American philosophy and emeritus professor at Queens College of the City University of New York, died on July 25 at his home in Sanbornton, N.H. He was 68 and had lived in Queens and on Long Island before his retirement.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Sleeper gained professional prominence beyond CUNY in 1986 with the publication of "The Necessity of Pragmatism: John Dewey's Conception of Philosophy" (Yale University Press). Critically well received, it is considered an important addition during the last three decades to the interpretations of Dewey's philosophy, as well as a challenge to some Dewey commentators during that period.
        He also published many articles in scholarly journals. Taught at Cambridge
        Dr. Sleeper taught philosophy at Queens College from 1951 to 1982, when he retired and was awarded emeritus status. Over the years, he also lectured at other colleges and took part in community affairs in both New York and New Hampshire. In the mid-1960's and again in 1986 he was a visiting scholar at Cambridge University.
        A native of Concord, N.H., he graduated from Dartmouth College and earned his master's and Ph.D. degrees at Columbia University.
        In World War II, he was a bombardier-navigator in the United States Army Air Corps in Europe. He was awarded five air medals and two battle stars. A first lieutenant, he was shot down over France but rescued by the French Resistance. That made him a member of the "Caterpillar Club," made up of airmen who went through that experience.
        Dr. Sleeper is survived by his wife of 46 years, Louise Cotter Sleeper; three daughters, Christine M. Driscoll of Ipswich, Mass., Elizabeth Sleeper Dicey of Cato, N.Y., and Susan M. Sleeper of Brattleboro, Vt., and three grandsons.
