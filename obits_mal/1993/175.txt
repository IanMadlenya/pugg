        Eugene Blanc Jr., who practiced law in Manhattan for 65 years, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 88 and lived in Manhattan.
        His death followed a brief illness, said Leonard Spielberg, a colleague and former partner.
        Mr. Blanc, a native of Manhattan, graduated from City College. He was admitted to the Athletic Hall of Fame there for his prowess in swimming and fencing, a lifetime passion. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1927, the year he went into practice.
        His specialty became real-estate law, although in recent years he concentrated on estate and trust law, practicing at home. He previously had been with several law firms, most recently as senior partner in the firm of Blanc & Spielberg.
        For more than 20 years, Mr. Blanc, a French-American, was general counsel to the Societe Culinaire Philanthropique, the organization of French chefs in New York. He succeeded his father as president of French Hospital in Manhattan in the early 1950's and kept that position until a merger with Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan 10 years later. That institution no longer exists.
        Mr. Blanc joined the New York Fencers Club in 1922, served as its president until well into his 70's and remained an active member.
        He is survived by a daughter, Diane Blanc Barnhill of Chestertown, Md.; a sister, Estelle Orteig of New York City, and six grandchildren.
