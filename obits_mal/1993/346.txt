        Daniel Arje, a director of fashion and furnishings displays in New York for 40 years, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from renal cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Arje was display director for Bonwit Teller from 1960 to 1973, and his store windows became a "gallery" for promising young artists such as Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. The designers he worked with included Calvin Klein, Pauline Trigere and Marc Bohan. The National Association of Display Industries named him its man of the year in 1970.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Arje (pronounced AR-jay) served with the infantry in the South Pacific in World War II and graduated from Cooper Union in 1948. That year he joined the display staff at Bonwit Teller.
        Mr. Arje decorated the White House Christmas tree when Lyndon B. Johnson was President, designed the altar for Lynda Bird Robb's White House wedding and decorated fund-raisers for Lady Bird Johnson's National Wildlife Research Center.
        After leaving Bonwit, Mr. Arje worked for Wamsutta Pacific, the linens manufacturer, and Frances Denney, the cosmetics concern. Since 1983 he was creative director at Dan River, another linens maker, and in recent years also served as a consultant to Time Warner, Tishman-Speyer and the French Tourist Board.
        He is survived by two brothers, Dr. Sidney Arje of Ashfield, Mass., and Erich Arje of Boca Raton, Fla.
