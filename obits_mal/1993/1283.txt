        Leslie N. Gay Jr., a retired official of the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, died last Saturday while on vacation in Dalton, Mass. He was 71 and lived in Baltimore.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a son, George.
        Mr. Gay started with the bureau in 1963 and was instrumental in carrying out the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968. He was named chief of the bureau's tribal government branch, a position in which he became an expert on Indian self-government. He championed Indian sovereignty in land disputes.
        When he retired in 1978, he received the Meritorious Service Award of the Department of the Interior, of which the bureau is a part.
        Mr. Gay attended the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., graduated from Yale University in 1945 and received a master's degree in public affairs from Princeton University in 1950. In World War II he was a captain in the Army. He later worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.
        Mr. Gay's wife, Tessie Harper Gay, died in 1988. In addition to his son George E. H., of Easton, Md., Mr. Gay is survived by two other sons, Leslie N. 3d, of Los Angeles and John L., of Clifton, Va.; two daughters, Katherine C., of Baltimore and Sarah J. Levin of Tijeras, N. M., and eight grandchildren.
