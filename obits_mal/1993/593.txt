        Bernie Wayne, the composer of "There She Is, Miss America," the beauty-contest theme song, died on Sunday at his home in Marina del Rey, Calif. He was 74.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said Ervin Drake, a friend.
        Mr. Drake was a prolific composer who calculated in the mid-1960's that he had written about 1,000 songs, among them "Blue Velvet," "Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside," "Patch of Blue" and "The Magic Touch." Two of his best-known pieces of music were not hit songs: the Miss America theme, first heard at the contest in 1955, and a commercial jingle, "Chock Full O'Nuts Is the Heavenly Coffee."
        Mr. Wayne also wrote the music and lyrics for several musicals, including "Listen to Liz," "Torero!" and "Skits-oh-Frantics," in the 1950's and 60's. For several years he was the artists and repertory director at 20th Century Fox Records, where he produced the soundtrack recordings for "Zorba the Greek" and "Patch of Blue."
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis Michele.
