        Dave (Java) Gotkin, a high-scoring St. John's guard from 1932 to 1936, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Plantation, Fla. Mr. Gotkin, who lived in East Rockaway, L.I., was 83.
        The cause of death was septic shock, said his son, Michael.
        Although he was a starter for the St. John's team that played the first official college basketball game at Madison Square Garden, on Dec. 29, 1934, his greatest contribution to basketball came off the court. According to his son, it was Mr. Gotkin who introduced his St. John's teammate, Frank McGuire, to his older brother, Harry Gotkin, the scout who helped set up the famous pipeline that sent New York players to McGuire's North Carolina teams in the 1950's.
        Mr. Gotkin is survived by his wife, Pauline; his twin brother, Maxwell; two sisters, Lillian Trister and Dora Gross; his son; a daughter, Ellen Cotliar, and four granchildren.
