        Walter F. Sheehan, headmaster for 25 years of the Canterbury School in New Milford, Conn., died on Saturday at the Candlewood Valley Care Center in New Milford. He was 83.
        He had had a long illness, the school said.
        Mr. Sheehan took over as headmaster of the Roman Catholic boarding school in 1948. He oversaw the construction of several buildings on campus, including an infirmary, a gymnasium, a chapel, two dormitories and Hume Hall, a classroom building. He also supervised the school's transition to a co-educational institution in 1971. Shortly after he retired in 1973, a dormitory for senior boys was renamed in his honor.
        Born in Holyoke, Mass., he was educated at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., where he excelled as an athlete and was twice chosen to the All New England College Basketball Team. After earning his bachelor's degree, he taught English at Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., until 1946. He then became dean of freshmen and director of athletics at Williams College before taking over as headmaster at Canterbury.
        He earned his master's degree in 1944 from Amherst College and a doctorate from the University of Portland in 1964.
        After moving to Canterbury, he was also active in New Milford community affairs, serving on a committee to study improvements in the town's government and as a member of the board of trustees of New Milford Hospital.
        He is survived by two sons, Peter J., of Charlotte, N.C., and Kevin E., of Nashville, Ind.; a daughter, Monica M., of Manhattan, and four grandchildren. His wife, the former Lillian Fontaine, died in 1991.
