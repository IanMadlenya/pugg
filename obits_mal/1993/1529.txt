        William F. Souder Jr., a former chairman of the board and chief executive of Marsh & McLennan Companies, an insurance brokerage in New York, died on Friday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 82.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Souder joined the company in 1952 after a firm he founded, the Souder Insurance Agency in Indianapolis, Ind., merged with Marsh & McLennan. He was named president and chief executive of the company in 1969 and was elected to the additional post of chairman of the board of directors in 1971. He retired from active management of the company in 1976, but continued as a director until 1983.
        Born and raised in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Souder attended the University of Virginia before joining the Army during World War II. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel while serving with the Army Air Force in Italy.
        He is survived by his wife, Susanna Jacobus; two sons, Scott, of Delray Beach and William, of Chicago, and a daughter, Suzanne Morrone of Westport, Conn.
