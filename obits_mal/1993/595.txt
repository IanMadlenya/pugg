        Edward Burk Henning, the retired chief curator of modern art at the Cleveland Museum of Art, died Sunday at his home in Cleveland Heights. He was 70.
        The museum said the cause of death was complications from a stroke.
        Mr. Henning, who was born in Cleveland on Oct. 3, 1922, spent most of his professional life at the Cleveland Museum, primarily overseeing the expansion of the museum's holdings in modern and contemporary art.
        After serving in the United States Army during World War II, he earned a bachelor's degree from Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1949, and a master's degree in 1952; he studied painting at the Academie Julian in Paris for a year between degrees. In 1952, he joined the Cleveland Museum, working first in the education department and then becoming assistant to Sherman E. Lee, then the director of the museum. Made Important Acquisitions
        In 1962, Mr. Henning was placed in charge of the museum's growing collection of contemporary art, and his acquisitions included works by Picasso, Braque, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Jasper Johns. He was appointed curator of modern art in 1972, when the department was enlarged to include works by all artists born after 1830, and in 1979 he was named chief curator of modern art.
        Mr. Henning organized and wrote catalogues for many exhibitions, including "Paths of Abstract Art" (1960), "50 Years of Modern Art (1966), "The Spirit of Surrealism" (1979) and "Creativity in Art and Science, 1860-1960" (1987). After his retirement, in 1985, he worked on cataloguing the museum's collection of modern art.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Margaret Revacko; two sons, Eric, of Grand Isle, Vt., and Geoffrey, of Cleveland; a daughter, Lisa, of St. Louis, and four grandchildren.
