        The Rev. Howard Pearson Kellett, a former Massachusetts prison chaplain long active in social causes, died on Saturday in a hospital in York, Me. He was 86.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        A former resident of Cambridge, Mass., he lived in Kennebunk, Me., in retirement.
        Mr. Kellett, a native of Lawrence, Mass., graduated from the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge and was ordained a priest in 1934. He first served at St. Paul's Church in Boston and, concurrently, as chaplain to the Deer Island House of Correction there.
        From 1941 to 1959, he was executive secretary of the Diocesan Department of Social Service and Protestant chaplain to Charlestown State Prison. During that time he became one of his church's leading penal experts, established rehabilitation services, campaigned for an end to the death penalty and helped eliminate solitary-confinement cells in the maximum security unit at Charlestown.
        His wife of 59 years, the former Lois Newton Perry, died last year. He is survived by two sons, William P., of Guilford, Conn., and Roger B., of Brooklin, Me.; two brothers, Dr. Harry R., of Salem, N.H., and the Rev. Dr. Norman L., of Kennebunk Beach, Me., and five grandchildren.
