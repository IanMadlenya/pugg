        Royce Franklin Ward, a civil engineer who helped develop the Watergate complex in Washington, died on Saturday at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. He was 84 and lived in Alexandria.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, his family said.
        He was born in Brooklyn, the son of Charles Ward, a former city Commissioner of Public Works. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1932..
        As president of the New York firm of Hageman-Harris, he helped developed the Foggy Bottom area of the capital, starting with Washington's first cooperative apartment complex, Potomac Plaza. In 1959 he joined forces with Societa Generale Immobiliare of Italy to create the Watergate apartment, hotel and office complex, which was completed in 1975.
        Mr. Ward is survived by his wife of 52 years, Margaret Duffley Ward; two sons, Michael R. and Peter C., both of Alexandria; one grandson, and two granddaughters.
