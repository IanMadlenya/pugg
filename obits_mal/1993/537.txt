        William B. Crist, a retired public-relations counselor to schools and colleges, died on Thursday at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. He lived in Manhattan and Woodstock, N.Y., and was 81.
        He had a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Crist was born in Newport, R.I., and attended Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. He worked for several years in engineering and for the newsreel division of Paramount Pictures before turning to public relations as an account executive.
        He left a post as director of development at Sarah Lawrence College in 1958 and opened his own public-relations firm in New York City. He served liberal-arts institutions through his Midwest College Council.
        In 1971, he founded Campus/New York, which offered the city as a second "campus" in low-cost, weeklong programs for students wanting to take advantage of New York's cultural and career opportunities. He retired in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife of 45 years, Judith Crist, the film critic and journalist, and a son, Steven, of Hempstead, L.I., who writes about thoroughbred racing.
