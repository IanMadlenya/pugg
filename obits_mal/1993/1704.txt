        Frederick J. Harlfinger 2d, a retired Vice Admiral, died on Tuesday at his home in Sarasota. The Admiral, who was known as Fritz, was 80.
        The cause was complications from respiratory problems, his family said.
        Admiral Harlfinger, who was born in Albany, was a 1935 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He served on the battleship Arizona for two years and later transferred to submarine duty.
        Along with the rest of the crew, he earned the Silver Star for his service as a lieutenant aboard a submarine that that was used to remove a large part of the negotiable reserves of the Philippines in 1942. The cache, which included several tons of gold, silver and securities, was loaded at Corregidor almost within sight of Japanese batteries on the southern shore of Manila Bay.
        During the Korean War he worked in research and development for the commander of naval operations. In 1968 he was named chief of naval intelligence and the director of command support systems. He retired in 1974.
        Survivors include his wife, Beverly M. Harlfinger; two daughters, Frances M. Hyde and Dorothy M. Beidleman; two sons, Frederick J. 3d and Clarke A.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
