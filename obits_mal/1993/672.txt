        Dr. Hayim Leaf, a Hebrew scholar and writer and professor emeritus of Hebrew literature at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Bronx. He was 79 and a resident of the Bronx.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he had suffered late last year, Yeshiva said.
        Dr. Leaf served on the faculty for 36 years, from 1942 until he retired as University Professor of Hebrew in 1978. He also edited Bitzaron, a scholarly Hebrew quarterly published by New York University and the Hebrew Literary Foundation.
        Born in Russia, Dr. Leaf came to the United States in 1928. He graduated in 1945 from Yeshiva University, where he received his doctorate in Hebrew literature in 1968.
        He wrote extensively and edited many publications. He was co-editor with Naomi Ben-Asher of "The Junior Jewish Encyclopedia" for teen-agers, for which he received a Jewish Book Council Award in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Chava Susskind; a son, Shalom, of Manhattan; a daughter, Adah Radzin of Flemington, N.J., and three grandchildren.
