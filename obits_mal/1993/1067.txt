        Jacques Chazot, a French dancer, choreographer and wit, died on Monday at a friend's chateau in Seine-et-Marne department in north central France. He was 64 and lived in Paris.
        According to the British newspaper The Independent, the cause was throat cancer.
        Mr. Chazot was a star dancer at the Opera Comique in Paris from 1956 to 1963 and choreographed or produced many ballets. His wit made him a popular guest on television talk shows.
        He was also known for his satirical writing about Parisian high society, symbolized by a fictional young snob named Marie-Chantal. He was a perennial figure in that society, and he used to say, "People love me because when I enter a room I create the effect of a sudden shower of rainbow confetti." He was a close friend of the writer Francoise Sagan, whom he reportedly almost married in 1964, despite his avowed homosexuality, and was often in the company of people like Maria Callas, Princess Grace and Marie-Helene de Rothschild.
        Mr. Chazot was born in Locmiquelic, Brittany. As a willowy teen-ager -- his adult height was six feet four inches -- he was an artists' model in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris, inspiring, among others, Giacometti and Bernard Buffet.
        He then began studying ballet at the Paris Opera and went on to partner Ludmila Tcherina, Zizi Jeanmaire and other famed ballerinas. He once caused a furor and delighted critics by dancing on point disguised as a woman in the lead role of "Giselle."
