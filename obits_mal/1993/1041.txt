        Hans Hopf, a German tenor who specialized in Wagnerian roles during a long career at the Munich Opera, died on June 25 near his home in Germany. He was 76.
        A friend of the family said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Hopf made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1952 as Walther in "Die Meistersinger." A review in The New York Times said that he had a "fine voice of marked sonority, more inherently dramatic than lyric." A decade later, reviewing Mr. Hopf's performance as Siegfried in "Gotterdammerung" at the Met, Harold C. Schonberg wrote that he was "strong-voiced, well-routined, and as good as anybody around."
        Mr. Hopf studied with Paul Bender in Munich and with Ragnvald Bjarne in Oslo. He sang in German companies from 1939 to 1943, and in Oslo in 1944 and 45. He joined the Berlin Opera in 1946 and the Munich Opera in 1949 and sang Walther at Bayreuth in 1951. He returned to Bayreuth between 1961 and 1966 to sing Siegfried, Tannhauser and Parsifal. His repertory also included the tenor roles in Verdi's "Aida" and "Otello" and the Emperor in the Richard Strauss work "Die Frau ohne Schatten."
        He can be heard on recordings of "Die Frau," "Meistersinger" and "Tannhauser" and of Weber's "Freischutz" and Beethoven's "Fidelio" and Ninth Symphony.
        Mr. Hopf is survived by his wife, Ilse, and two sons, Bjorn and Gunnar.
