        Stanley P. Rock, a chemist and food-industry executive, died on Friday at his home in Fort Lee, N.J. He was 57.
        His death was a result of natural causes, said his son, Dr. Craig Rock.
        Mr. Rock was a graduate of City College of New York and earned a master's degree at New York University. In 1955, he joined DCA Food Industries Inc., which now has headquarters in Garden City, L.I., as a chemist. He held a patent on Shugarwhite, a sugar white that sticks to donuts without melting.
        At the time of his death, he was DCA's vice president-international, dealing with the Far East and Australia, and chief operating officer of its bakery division.
        Besides his son Craig, of Manhattan, Mr. Rock is survived by his wife of 35 years, the former Bernice Auslander; another son, Neil, of Manhattan; his parents, Mae and Benjamin Rock, and a sister, Barbara Stern, all of the Bronx.
