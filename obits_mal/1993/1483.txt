        William Seabrook Papworth, publisher of The Journal of Taxation and other specialized tax journals for lawyers, accountants and estate planners, died of cancer on Oct. 6 in Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 82 and lived in Hampton Bays, L.I., and Sarasota, Fla.
        He began his first tax journal in 1953. In 1964 he bought a home on Shinnecock Bay called Bamboo Bay, which over the years became a gathering place for professionals, diplomats, academics and artists from at least 16 different countries.
        Mr. Papworth, a graduate of Syracuse University, served as a naval air combat intelligence officer in the Pacific.
        He is survived by two sisters, Cynthia Coursen and Nancy Marshall, both of Manlius, N.Y.
