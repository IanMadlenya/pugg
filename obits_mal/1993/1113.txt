        Carlo Lifavi Menotti, a voice coach whose students included Judy Garland, Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett and Bobby Darin, died on Friday in Poconos Medical Center in East Stroudsburg, Pa. He was 84 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said Gasper Como, a friend.
        Mr. Menotti, who was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, to Italian parents, wrote "The Art of Modern Singing" (1968) to set out his approach to instruction.
        He studied music theory and piano at St. Cecilia Conservatory in Rome before moving to New York City, where he studied voice culture and opera. He appeared at Town Hall as a baritone before becoming a vocal coach. Among his other students were Julius LaRosa, Connie Francis, Pat Boone and Nancy Sinatra.
        He is survived by a sister, Gioconda Lifavi LaMagna, and a niece, Maria LaMagna Salvato, both of Port Jefferson, L.I.
