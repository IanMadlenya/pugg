        Edouard A. Stackpole, a leading expert on whaling, an author and curator, died on Thursday at Nantucket Cottage Hospital in Nantucket, Mass. He was 89.
        He died of complications following a stroke, his family said.
        A descendant of a family of whalers, Mr. Stackpole was born in Nantucket and graduated from Roxbury Latin School in West Roxbury, Mass., before working for several years as a printer, reporter and editor at newspapers in Nantucket.
        In 1931, he published the first of 28 books and monographs, largely about whaling and the history of Nantucket. "The Sea Hunters," published in 1953, is considered one of the best histories of whaling between the 17th and 19th centuries. In a review of the book in The New York Times, Orville Prescott wrote, "Everything about whaling that Herman Melville couldn't cram into 'Moby-Dick' is now crammed into 'The Sea Hunters.' "
        Mr. Stackpole was curator of the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Conn., from 1951 to 1966. He later returned to Nantucket, where he was director of the Peter Foulger Museum from 1969 until 1986, when illness forced him to retire.
        He is survived by his second wife, Florence; two daughters, Eugenie Eyster of Marshfield, Mass., and Anita Rezendes of Nantucket; three sons, Renny, of Thomaston, Me., Christopher, of Westerly, R.I., and Matthew, of Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, 22 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren.
