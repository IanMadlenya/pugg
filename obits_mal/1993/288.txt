        Angelo Fosco, the general president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, died Thursday at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla., where he had a winter home. He was 71 and lived in Chicago.
        The union said he died after a brief illness.
        Mr. Fosco, who was born in Chicago, had been the chief executive of the 600,000-member laborers' union since 1975. Under his leadership, the union broadened its historic base in the construction business, organizing in growing sectors like the service and waste-cleanup industries.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie; two sons, Peter and Paul; a daughter, Marycarm; seven stepchildren, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
