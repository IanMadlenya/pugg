        Richard DeFabees, an actor who appeared in productions on Broadway and off, died on Nov. 18. He was 46.
        The cause was AIDS, said Norman Rothstein, a friend.
        Mr. DeFabees appeared in the original Broadway production of "Torch Song Trilogy," alternating in the lead role, as Arnold, with the play's author, Harvey Fierstein. His Broadway credits also include "Whose Life Is It Anyway?," "The Skin of Our Teeth" and "Summer Brave." Off Broadway, he won praise for his work in the plays "Monsters" and "Creeps." He also appeared in "36," a comedy presented by the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1980, and acted in the films "Short Eyes," "A Chorus Line" and "City Out of Wilderness."
        He is survived by his parents and a sister.
