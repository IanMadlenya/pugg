        Glen W. Fortinberry, a leader in the advertising industry and a supporter of civic causes, died yesterday at a hospital in Detroit. He was 65 and lived in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
        The cause of death was leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Fortinberry was the chairman and chief executive officer of the Ross Roy Group, the nation's 17th-largest advertising agency, and was the former chairman of two major trade associations, the American Advertising Federation and the American Association of Advertising Agencies.
        For 16 years, he worked at J. Walter Thompson, which was the largest advertising agency in the world, where he rose to vice chairman. He left Thompson in 1980.
        Under his leadership, the Ross Roy Group's annual billings grew to more than $700 million from $180 million. Its clients included Chrysler and Kmart.
        Mr. Fortinberry encouraged advertising agencies to donate their talent for public service advertising for causes like preventing drug abuse.
        He was active in the Boys and Girls Clubs and on the advisory council of the African Development Foundation and the national board of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. He was also the Michigan chairman of the United Negro College Fund.
        Mr. Fortinberry was born in Monticello, Miss. He was a graduate of Northwestern University and served in the United States Navy Aviation Service.
        Surviving are his wife of less than a year, the former Christa Meighan Heather; three sons, Glen Jr., of Silver Spring, Md.; Charles, of Clarkston, Mich., and Richard of Bronxville, N.Y.; a stepson, Matthew Heather, of Bloomfield Hills; a brother, Lane of New Canaan, Conn., and four grandchildren.
