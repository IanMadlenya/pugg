        Professor Jerome Blum, a former historian at Princeton University, died on Friday at the University of Maryland Hospital Medical Center in Baltimore. A Baltimore native and resident, he was 80.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Professor Blum was the chairman of Princeton's History Department in the 1960's. A 1933 graduate of Johns Hopkins University, he received his Ph.D. there in 1947. In World War II, he served four years in the United States Army, Field Artillery, rising from private to captain.
        He joined the Princeton faculty as an instructor in 1947. He became an economic historian and specialized in the history of agriculture, especially in central and eastern Europe.
        Promoted to full professor in 1961, he served as chairman of the Department of History from then until 1967. He was named Henry Charles Lea Professor of History in 1966 and reached emeritus status in 1981.
        He was the author of several books, including "Noble Landowners and Agriculture in Austria, 1815-1848" (Johns Hopkins, 1947); "Lord and Peasant in Russia From the Ninth to the Nineteenth Century" (Princeton, 1961), and "The End of the Old Order in Rural Europe" (Princeton, 1978).
        Professor Blum is survived by a brother, Samuel D., and two sisters, Estelle and Horty, all of Baltimore.
