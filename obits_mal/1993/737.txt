        Henry Bradford Arthur, professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and an expert on agribusiness and business ethics, died on Sunday at his home in Belmont, Mass. He was 89.
        He had been ill for a long time, the business school said yesterday.
        Professor Arthur joined the Harvard faculty at age 56 after a career as an economist in industry and government. He joined Harvard in 1960 as its first George M. Moffett Professor of Agriculture and Business. Until his retirement in 1970, he developed courses on agribusiness management and created doctoral and executive-education programs.
        In recognition of his work, the business school established a Henry B. Arthur Fund for Business Ethics to support research and teaching in ethics and corporate responsibility.
        A native of Gloversville, N.Y., he graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., where he majored in mathematics and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After receiving his master's and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard, he started a career at Swift & Company, the food processor, and became its chief economist in 1939.
        He took leave from the company to hold Federal positions. In the late 1940's, he was chief of the Marshall Plan's program review division in Paris, and he was appointed to the Wage Stabilization Board during the Korean War.
        Professor Arthur's first wife, the former Charlotte Beals, died in 1980. He is survived by his second wife, Eunice P. Howe; a daughter, Janice Arthur McCoy of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; a son, Bradford, of San Francisco; a brother, Richard S., of Schenectady; two stepdaughters, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
