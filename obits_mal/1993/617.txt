        Richards W. Hannah, a Family Court judge who also held several senior positions in New York State government, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 88 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause of death was pneumonia and kidney failure, said his daughter, Dr. Mary Elizabeth Hannah.
        Mr. Hannah was born in Auburn, N.Y., and graduated from Yale College and Columbia Law School. Early in his career he worked as a lawyer for a number of insurance and financial services companies, specializing in negligence cases.
        In 1955 he was appointed director of the New York State Development Corporation. The following year he was named deputy state comptroller, and two years later he moved to the State Lottery Commission, where he was chairman.
        From 1962 to 1974, Mr. Hannah was a Family Court judge. He served as president of the Brooklyn Trial Lawyers Association and was a member of many other professional, religious and fraternal organizations.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Alice Tulley McGehee.
