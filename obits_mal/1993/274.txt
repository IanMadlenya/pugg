        Donald Lloyd Miller, the artist whose mural dominates the main lobby of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library in Washington, died on Sunday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. He was 69 and had lived in Montclair since he was a child.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Miller was born in Jamaica and was brought to this country as an infant. He trained at Cooper Union and the Art Students League. His life's work was interpreting the black experience in the United States, the West Indies and Africa. His oils and watercolors were frequently exhibited in this country and in Jamaica and are in the permanent collections of the Newark Museum, Smithsonian Institution and other museums.
        Much of Mr. Miller's work reflected the spirit of the emerging civil rights movement. His magnum opus, the "King Mural," depicts the life and work of Dr. King. Seven feet high and 56 feet long, it was commissioned by the library and was unveiled in January 1986 for the first observance of Dr. King's birthday as a national holiday.
        The artist also produced illustrations for books at his studio in Montclair, which was called the Don Miller Studio.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife of 40 years, Dr. Julia Miller; two sons, Eric, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, and Craig, of West Orange, N.J.; his mother, Rhena Miller of Montclair; two brothers, Claude, of Plainfield, N.J., and Kenneth, of Cranford, N.J.; a sister, Ethel Henderson of West Paterson, N.J., and one grandson.
