        W. Rice Brewster, a New York lawyer specializing in corporate law and business finance, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, he was 94.
        The cause of death was heart failure following a brief illness, his family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Brewster was a consulting partner in the Manhattan-based international law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. He was associated with Milbank, Tweed and its predecessor firms for more than six decades.
        Mr. Brewster was born in Brooklyn.  He was a 1921 graduate of Yale University and received his law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1924. In 1935, he was one of three incorporators of the General Telephone and Electronics Corporation -- now known as GTE -- and for many years, he represented the company's investment bankers.
        He was a past governor of the Society of Mayflower Descendants, a trustee of the New York Infirmary-Beekman Downtown Hospital and a president of the William Hale Harkness Foundation.
        Mr. Brewster is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Dorothy Gatins; a son, Walter R. Jr., of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Ethel Chapin of Manhattan and Hope Connors of Denver; one granddaughter, and six stepgrandchildren.
