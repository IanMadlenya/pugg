        Ralph Berton, a teacher and writer on jazz, died last Wednesday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 82 and lived in North Bergen, N.J.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son John, of New York City.
        Mr. Berton developed a love for jazz as a child. A drummer, he led his own five-piece band at the age of 15.
        Deciding he was not destined for a musical career, Mr. Berton was briefly a professional boxer, a writer for radio and Hollywood, and an artist. But in 1939, he returned to his first love and developed his own radio show, "Jazz University of the Air," for WNYC. He also gave lectures on jazz, eventually teaching at the New School, Middlesex County College and other schools.
        Mr. Berton's biography of the cornetist Bix Beiderbecke, "Remembering Bix, a Memoir of the Jazz Age," was published in 1974.
        In addition to his son John, he is survived by his wife, Katharine Rennie; another son, Thomas, of New York City; and a daughter, Barbara Landry, of Westwood, Mass.
