        Ralph P. Wattley, a New York graphic-arts designer, died last Thursday at High Ridge House in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 67 and lived in Englewood, N.J.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Wattley retired earlier this year as president of Draper Associates, graphic designers in Manhattan, after 34 years with the firm.
        A native of Manhattan, he attended Columbia University for three years, playing on the baseball and track teams. He then trained at the Art Students League and with Amedee Ozenfant, a French modern painter and writer who operated the Ozenfant School of Art in New York at the time.
        Mr. Wattley served in the Army in Europe in World War II. His career as a designer began at Lippincott & Margulies of New York before he became associated with Ballantine Books and Signet Books as an art director in the early days of mass-produced paperback fiction.
        In 1959, he joined Draper, which specializes in commercial literature and corporate reports. He became a partner in 1970 and president in 1980, but remained its chief designer until his retirement. He and the firm won numerous awards for graphic designs and production for such companies as American Express, Avon Products, Bank of New York, Continental Insurance and Merrill Lynch.
        Mr. Wattley is survived by his wife of 23 years, Marianne Milnes Draper; and a brother, Robert L., of Glastonbury, Conn.
