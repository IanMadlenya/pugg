        John MacKenzie Anderson, a Cincinnati lawyer and breeder of Scotch Highland cattle, died Monday at Jewish Hospital in Cincinnati. He was 54 and lived in East Walnut Hills, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati.
        He died of complications from cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Anderson was regarded as an expert on public-finance law. He was a senior partner in Peck, Shaffer & Williams, a firm he joined 30 years ago.
        He was born and reared in Newark, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and a law degree from Yale in 1963.
        He was a member of the bar in Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Indiana, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States and the Bar of the City of New York. He served on the Continuing Legal Education Committee of the Ohio Supreme Court. Democratic Fund-Raiser
        Mr. Anderson was active in philanthropies, civic affairs and the Democratic Party. He was a fund-raiser and treasurer for Democratic candidates and a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in New York in 1976. He served as president of the local chapter of the English Speaking Union and trustee of the Cincinnati Council on World Affairs.
        He owned two farms, in Ohio and Kentucky, where he bred Scotch Highland beef cattle. From 1977 to 1987 he was president of the 700-member American Scotch Highland Breeders' Association, which keeps a national registry of the cattle, a hardy breed native to Scotland and Wales and characterized by long horns and long, shaggy, reddish hair.
        Mr. Anderson was the author of "West Highland Cattle: The Grand Olde Breed," which he published in 1985 as a comprehensive account of the livestock. He also wrote two works of fiction and left several unfinished manuscripts.
        He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Jane Shelton Anderson; three sons, Graham, of Houston, Gregory, of Chicago and Jonathan Anderson of New York City, and a grandson.
