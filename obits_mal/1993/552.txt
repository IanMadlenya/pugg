        Rear Adm. Victor E. Tyson Jr., a retired chief of staff at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the shoreside manager for three America's Cup yacht racing teams, died on Tuesday at the Medical Center of Ocean County in Point Pleasant, N.J. He lived in Allenwood, N.J., and was 76.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Admiral Tyson was associated with the academy at Kings Point, L.I., his alma mater, for 34 years. A native of Wheeling, W.Va., he graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in biochemistry in 1940.
        He took the entrance examination for the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps the day before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He served on convoys on the Murmansk run and took part in the initial Allied assault in North Africa.
        He retired from Kings Point in 1976. He then managed shore activities for Ted Turner's America Cup team in 1977 and 1980 and for Dennis Connor's crew in 1983.
        Admiral Tyson's first wife died in 1978. In 1984, he married June Gross, who survives; as do a daughter, Barbara Dickie of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, John, of Flemington, N.J., and four grandchildren.
