        Michael Marsh, an author and Quaker leader, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Washington. He was 75 and lived in Washington.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Marsh, who was born in New York and graduated from Swarthmore College, started as an economist for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington in 1938. As a conscientious objector in World War II, he volunteered for work in a mental hospital and to be a subject in medical experiments on hepatitis.
        After the war he was a European correspondent for McGraw Hill Publications, then became a staff researcher for the Democratic National Committee and for 27 years was a writer and editor of Labor, a magazine for railroad unions.
        After retiring from his union job in 1980, he earned his doctorate in philosophy at Catholic University and taught religious philosophy at the Sidwell Friends School and the Friends Meeting of Washington, of which he was a trustee.
        Dr. Marsh wrote "A Matter of Personal Survival: Life after Death" (Theosophical, 1985) and a novel, "The Rudelstein Affair" (Ariadne, 1981).
        Surviving are his wife of 50 years, the former Caryl Amsterdam, a psychologist; two daughters, Susan Marsh Mauer of Holden, Mass., and Anna Marsh Scarpelli of Brookeville, Md.; a sister, Ursula Marsh Scott of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two grandsons.
