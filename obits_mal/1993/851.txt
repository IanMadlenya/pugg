        Salvator Attanasio, a translator of more than 200 works of literature, history and philosophy, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Barbara Kennedy, the executor of his estate.
        Mr. Attanasio was born in Newark to Italian immigrants. A high school dropout, he used the public library to teach himself Spanish, French and German; he added Russian as an adult. During World War II he served with Army intelligence in Europe, and he worked briefly in Germany as a journalist after the war.
        In the late 1940's Mr. Attanasio worked toward a Master's Degree at the New School for Social Research in New York City; his thesis was on the Italian literary theorist Benedetto Croce. He began working as a freelance translator to support himself.
        He eventually became one of Greenwich Village's more distinctive characters, known for his wit and erudition. Although an ardent Communist, he developed a subspeciality in translations of religious works, including "Structures of the Church," by Hans Kung.
        His translations include "Freedom and Domination: A Historical Critique of Civilization," by Dankwart A. Rustow, and Marlene Dietrich's autobiography, "Marlene" (1989).
        He is survived by a brother, Alfred Anthony of Bestal, N.Y.
