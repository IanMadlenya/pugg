        J. Nevins McBride, a pioneer in the development of suburban industrial and office parks, died on Wednesday at home in Franklin Lakes, N.J. He was 85.
        His son David said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. McBride, the former chairman and president of McBride Enterprises Inc., expanded his father's mechanical construction business into one of the largest land development companies in northern New Jersey.
        His first major project, Fair Lawn Industrial Park, begun in the early 1950's, was the first industrial park in New Jersey. As the state's suburbs grew, McBride Enterprises constructed industrial and office parks in Rockleigh, Oakland, Wayne, Totowa and Mahwah.
        Mr. McBride also built one of the state's first planned residential communities, Urban Farms at Franklin Lakes.
        Having purchased land in the area, he was also a strong advocate of the construction of a section of Interstate 287 through Franklin Lakes. This project, set for completion in 1994, links Bergen County with the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway in New York.
        His last project, Ramapo Ridge, at Mahwah, is a planned residential community combined with an office and commercial development.
        Mr. McBride was born in Paterson, N.J. He graduated from Georgetown University and was a licensed professional engineer.
        Among his many civic activities, he was a trustee of both Farleigh Dickinson and Seton Hall universities. He was also a former police and fire commissioner of Paterson.
        Besides his son David of Franklin Lakes, survivors include his wife, Mary Katherine; two other sons, J. Nevins Jr. of LaJolla, Calif. and W. Peter of Franklin Lakes; two daughters, Katherine Kruckel and Moira McBride Murphy, both of Franklin Lakes; a brother, Joseph A. of Frankin Lakes; 18 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild.
