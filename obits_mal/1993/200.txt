        George M. How, an architect who helped to design the new NASA headquarters in Washington, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 35.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Oren Makov.
        Mr. How was a senior designer at the firm of Kohn Pederson Fox Associates in Manhattan, where he worked on the NASA headquarters, a 600,000-square-foot building at 300 E Street S.W. that opened last year. The project was a melange of Art Deco and post-modern styles.
        He graduated from Cornell University in 1981 and then worked for Paul Segal Associates in Manhattan, where he contributed to the design for the Gotham Bar and Grill at 12 East 12th Street in Greenwich Village. He later was in private practice before he joined Kohn Pederson in 1989.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his parents, Janet and Brian How of Ithaca, N.Y., and two sisters, Sarah How of Ithaca and Kate Conschafter of Ashville, N.C.
