        William Bentinck-Smith, an administrator and historian of Harvard University, died Tuesday at the Nashoba Community Hospital in Ayer, Mass. He was 79 and lived in Groton, Mass.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Phebe.
        Mr. Bentinck-Smith served Harvard in various administrative posts under three presidents, James Bryant Conant, Nathan Pusey and Derek Bok, for more than 40 years. He was an editor of the Harvard Alumni Bulletin, now Harvard Magazine, for many years.
        He was the author or editor of numerous books on Harvard's history. These included The Harvard Book, an anthology about Harvard College and its history, first published in the early 1950's and periodically revised, and books on Harvard's faculty and library system. At his death Mr. Bentinck-Smith had completed two volumes of a three-volume history of Harvard's nearly 300 endowed professorships.
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard College in 1937. He received a master's degree from the Columbia School of Journalism in 1938 and was a reporter for The Boston Globe for two years before being named managing editor of the Harvard alumni magazine.
        He served in the Navy in World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Bentinck-Smith is survived by two daughters, Judy Covin of Sacramento, Calif., and Nancy Soulette of Brookline, Mass.; two sons, Michael, of Milton, Mass., and Peter, of Sudbury, Mass.; six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
