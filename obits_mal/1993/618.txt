        Walter W. Karakawa, a microbiologist at Pennsylvania State University who conducted research into a bacterium that causes infections in hospital patients, died on Tuesday in Rockville, Md. He was 61 and lived in Pennsylvania Furnace, Pa.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Judy Kane Karakawa.
        Dr. Karakawa was born in Honolulu and received degrees in microbiology from the University of Dubuque in Iowa and the University of Iowa. He also studied at Washington University in St. Louis.
        In the early 1960's he helped develop the first screening test for babies suffering from phenylketonuria, a genetic disorder that causes severe mental retardation. From 1973 until his death, he served as an associate professor in the department of cellular and molecular biology at Penn State in State College, Pa.
        In recent years, he worked on a vaccine for the bacteria staphylococcus aureus. The vaccine is now undergoing clinical tests.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Susan, and three sisters, Dorothy Karakawa and Kathrine Ortiz, both of California, and Jane Karakawa, of Honolulu.
