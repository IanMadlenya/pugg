        Roger B. Dooley, a writer, teacher and film scholar, died on Oct. 29 at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Roger Jr.
        Mr. Dooley was born in Buffalo and was a graduate of Canisius College, where he subsequently taught English and American literature. He also taught at Iona College, St. John's University and Queensborough Community College. In 1964, he was appointed the dean of humanities and chairman of the English department at Manhattan Community College, where he taught until his retirement in 1985.
        He was the author of four novels about the experiences of Irish-Americans in Buffalo: "Less Than Angels" (1946), "Days Beyond Recall" (1949), "The House of Shanahan" (1952) and "Gone Tomorrow" (1961). He also wrote "From Scarface to Scarlet" (1981), a study of American films of the 1930's.
