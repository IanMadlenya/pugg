        Dr. Charles Cutler Leighton, a research scientist and senior officer at Merck & Company, the pharmaceutical giant, died Tuesday at his home in Ambler, Pa. He was 54.
        The cause had not been determined, a spokesman for Merck said yesterday.
        At his death, Dr. Leighton was senior vice president in charge of medical and regulatory affairs, worldwide, at Merck Research Laboratories. The laboratories, in Rahway, N.J., and West Point, Pa., employ 5,000 people. In his work Dr. Leighton often dealt with Government agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.
        A native of Boston, he graduated from Colby College and Harvard Medical School. He started at Merck as an education writer in 1965, entered a training program and embarked on a managerial career that brought him to the senior vice president's post in 1988.
        He served on the National Committee to Review Current Procedures for Approval of New Drugs for Cancer and AIDS. In 1990, the panel said that faster Government approval of experimental AIDS and cancer drugs for "desperately ill patients" was justified.
        Dr. Leighton is survived by his wife of 30 years, the former Pamela White; two daughters, Wendy of Tarrytown, N.Y., and Kristine Angelone of Erie, Pa.; a son, Christopher, of Brunswick, Me.; and his parents, Dr. Herbert T. and Jeannette C. Leighton of Newtownville, Mass.
