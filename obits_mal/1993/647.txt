        George Smith Watchetaker, a Comanche elder, painter and longtime American Indian dance champion, died on Thursday in a hospital in his hometown, Lawton, Okla. He was 77.
        Mr. Watchetaker, a student of Comanche history and performing, was a five-time American Indian national dance champion and five-time world dance champion. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth after a command performance, and performed for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman.
        Mr. Watchetaker acquired his reputation in summer Powwow dance contests throughout the Midwest and Southwest, becoming known as the contests developed from local to national events in the 1950's. He retired from competition in 1966.
