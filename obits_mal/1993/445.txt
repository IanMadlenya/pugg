        George V. Patterson, who rose from a meter reader to head the nation's largest investor-owned producer of electric power, died on Thursday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 81 and resided in nearby New Providence.
        He died of complications after surgery for an aneurysm, his family said.
        Mr. Patterson had served as president of the American Electric Power Company. Among the nation's electric producers, American Electric's system is second in size only to the federally sponsored Tennessee Valley Authority. Its subsidiaries include Kentucky Power, Michigan Power, Ohio Power and Wheeling Electric.
        After graduating from Ohio State University in 1934, Mr. Patterson started reading meters in Canton, Ohio. By 1954, he was assistant general manager of Ohio Power. In 1960 he transferred to American Electric's headquarters. He was promoted to president in 1972. He retired in 1977.
        Mr. Patterson was born in Cherry Valley, Ohio. His wife of 50 years, the former Margaret Jones, died in 1988.
        He is survived by two daughters, Carol Schroppe of Chatham, N.J., and Sharon P. Newhard of Norfolk, Va.; two brothers, John of Jenson Beach, Fla., and Myron of Venice, Fla.; a sister, Florence Thornton of Canal Fulton, Ohio, and three grandchildren.
