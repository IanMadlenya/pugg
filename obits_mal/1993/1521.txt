        F. William Scott, a retired art director at The New York Times, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 62 and lived in Upper Black Eddy, Pa.
        He had had a brief illness, said a friend, Donn Talenti.
        Mr. Scott was raised in Kentucky. He was a graduate of the Cincinnati Conservatory. He also attended the Art Students League of New York and Columbia University.
        Mr. Scott worked for The Times from 1952 to 1990. As an art director for the daily newspaper, he designed dozens of picture layouts every week, including the front page of the second section and the fashion and style pages.
        Mr. Scott is survived by a sister, Jane Balser, and a brother, Roger, both of Southgate, Ky. A memorial service is to be scheduled later.
