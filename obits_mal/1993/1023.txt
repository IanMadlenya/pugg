        Oleg Kerensky, a British-born writer on dance, music and theater, died yesterday at his Greenwich Village apartment. He was 63.
        The cause was AIDS, said a friend, Arthur Lambert Jr.
        Mr. Kerensky was a grandson of Aleksandr Kerensky, who led the Russian provisional government in 1917 in the brief interval between the Czarist and Bolshevik regimes. The writer's father, also named Oleg Kerensky, was a builder of bridges and highways in England, where members of the Kerensky family settled after the Bolshevik Revolution.
        Mr. Kerensky, who was born in London, attended Westminster School and Oxford University. He was a diplomatic correspondent for the BBC from 1955 to 1963 and deputy editor of The Listener from 1963 to 1968. He served as a ballet critic for The Daily Mail, The New Statesman and The International Herald Tribune, and over the years also contributed articles to The New York Times, Dance and Dancers, Music and Musicians and Ballet Review. He was the author of several books, including "Anna Pavlova" and "The New British Drama."
        In the late 70's, Mr. Kerensky began to divide his time between London and New York. He moved to New York permanently in the early 80's. He was a New York correspondent for the British publications Musical Opinion and The Stage, and was a guest teacher at New York University and Fairfield University.
