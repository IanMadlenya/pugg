        Ken Wilson, a longtime executive at The San Francisco Chronicle, died on Monday at his home in Santa Rosa. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wilson joined The Chronicle in 1953 as assistant news editor and later became news editor. When he retired in 1988, he was assistant to the publisher and was listed on the newspaper's masthead.
        Before joining The Chronicle, he was managing editor of the morning edition of The Press Democrat in Santa Rosa, where he grew up.
        Mr. Wilson is survived by his wife of 44 years, Verna Lee of Santa Rosa; two sons, Matthew, of Piedmont, and Daniel, of Merced; two sisters, and two granddaughters.
