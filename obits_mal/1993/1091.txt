        A. Edwin Kendrew, a retired senior vice president of the Colonial Williamsburg restoration project in Virginia, died on Sunday at his summer home in New Hampshire. He was 90 and lived in Williamburg.
        Mr. Kendrew had been associated with Colonial Williamsburg, the restored 18th century capital of Virginia, from its inception in 1926. The restoration was financed largely by the Rockefeller family.
        Mr. Kendrew began doing preliminary research and architectural work on the site when he was a member of the Boston staff of the architectural firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn. In 1930 he jointed the firm's Williamsburg office as chief draftsman, then headed the Colonial Williamsburg architectural department. Later, as vice president, he was also put in charge of construction, maintenance and landscaping. He was named resident architect in 1934.
        In 1937, he was asked to develop a master plan for the future development of the restoration project that was approved by John D. Rockefeller Jr. From 1946 to 1947 he worked with John D. Rockefeller 3d, then board chairman, on a new plan for visitor orientation and interpretation.
        Mr. Kendrew became senior vice president of Colonial Williamsburg in 1957. In 1964 he was transferred to the president's office. He retired in 1968.
        Mr. Kendrew was born in Canada and moved with his widowed mother and siblings to Boston in 1917. He later became an American citizen.
        He was a member of the Virginia State Art Commission from 1945 to 1967, serving as chairman from 1950 to 1967, and a consultant to many historic preservation projects.
        His wife, the former Melinda Rockwood Ide of Boston, died in 1987. He is survived by two daughters, Nancy Bell of Williamsburg and Lois Caporal of Brookline, Mass.; seven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
