        David Greig Rattray, a poet and translator and an editor for Reader's Digest, died on Monday at his home in Amagansett, L.I. He was 57.
        The cause was a brain tumor, for which he had been undergoing treatment for three months, said his wife, Carolyn.
        An editor for the Reader's Digest general books division since 1973, Mr. Rattray took the lead in the development of lexicographic and etymological projects.
        Mr. Rattray, who was fluent in Greek, Latin, French and German, among other languages, is best known for his translations of work by the 20th-century French writers Antonin Artaud, Rene Crevel and Roger Gilbert-Lecomte.  Read Poetry in Cafes
        Mr. Rattray's poems appeared in literary magazines and as a book, "Opening the Eyelid" (Diwan, 1990). He was also a familiar voice at poetry readings in East Village cafes over the last two decades.
        His book of collected stories and essays, "How I Became One of the Invisible" (Semiotexte, 1992), which is largely autobiographical, spanned both the scholarly classics and the contemporary avant-garde.
        As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, Mr. Rattray gained wide attention in the mid-1950's when he interviewed the poet Ezra Pound for The Nation. He received a Diplome des Etudes Superieures des Langues Classiques from the Sorbonne in 1959 and a master's degree in comparative literature from Harvard in 1965.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mary Geis of Highland Falls, N.Y., and a sister, Mary Rattray of Amagansett.
