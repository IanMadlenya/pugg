        Warren P. Knowles, a Republican Governor of Wisconsin who in 1969 drew national attention by calling out National Guard troops to curb campus protests, died Saturday at Black River Memorial Hospital in Black River Falls, Wis. He was 84 and lived in Milwaukee.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Julie Huber, the coroner of Jackson County, which includes Black River Falls. The former Governor was stricken after a day of fishing on a local lake.
        Mr. Knowles, who was trained as a lawyer at the University of Wisconsin, was elected to three two-year terms as Lieutenant Governor before being elected to three two-year terms as Governor, from 1965 to 1971.
        It was in February 1969 that he called out more than a thousand National Guard troops to the University of Wisconsin's Madison campus to subdue disruptive protests in support of demands like the admission of more black students and giving students power to hire and dismiss faculty members for a black studies program.
        That action by the Governor was viewed as one of several indications of mounting confrontation nationwide in response to student protesters.
        As Governor, Mr. Knowles also oversaw efforts to protect his state's environment, including measures to safeguard wetlands, fight water pollution and expand state forests and parks.
        After leaving office, having chosen not to run again, he became chairman of Wisconsin Land Use, an environmental group. He was also chairman of the Heritage Wisconsin Corporation, a Milwaukee bank holding company.
        Mr. Knowles's marriage to Dorothy C. Guidry in 1943 ended in divorce in 1968.
