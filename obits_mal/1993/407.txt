        Robert S. Enright, a leading tax lawyer and senior executive of Pepsico Inc., died Wednesday in Australia during a business trip. A resident of Riverside, Conn., he was 46 years old.
        Reporting the death, the company said it occurred in a swimming accident off a beach near Brisbane, Queensland.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Enright graduated summa cum laude from Georgetown University and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School in 1974. Before joining Pepsico in 1988, he was a partner in the New York law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, specializing in corporate tax law.
        He was Pepsico's vice president in charge of all domestic and international tax matters for the company. The National Law Review recently listed him among the country's top 50 tax lawyers.
        Mr. Enright is survived by his wife, Maureen, and two daughters, Jessica and Katherine, all of Riverside; his mother, Mary Frances of Jackson Heights, Queens, and two brothers, Vincent, of New Providence, N.J., and John, of Mercerville, N.J.
