        Bertram F. Bonner, a real-estate developer and philanthropist, died on Saturday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 93.
        The cause was cancer, the family said.
        Mr. Bonner was a builder whose career spanned more than six decades and whose property interests extended from Massachusetts to Florida. From 1922 to 1986, he built more than 30,000 houses and apartments, mainly in New York, New Jersey and Virginia.
        In 1960, Mr. Bonner acquired 21 properties, valued at $20 million, from Peter Doelger Inc., the brewery company. The deal included a square block in the Sutton Place area and three tenements north of Lincoln Center in Manhattan as well as real estate in Brooklyn, Queens, Union City, N.J., and Springfield, Mass.
        During a 1954 Senate investigation into multimillion-dollar profits made by some builders with Government-insured loans, Mr. Bonner declared that it was "unfair" to criticize those who had responded to urgent appeals for housing. After President Truman defended the builders, the investigation was dropped. Financing Scholars
        In 1987, Mr. Bonner and his wife established the Corella and Bertram F. Bonner Foundation in Princeton, with an endowment commitment of $100 million. Under its crisis-ministry program, the foundation provides $3 million annually to 2,500 churches to help finance 15 million meals.
        In one of the largest private scholarship programs in the country, the foundation supports 900 scholars at 22 small liberal arts colleges and plans to support up to 2,000 each year. Bonner scholars contribute 600 hours of service to the community, generally by tutoring.
        Mr. Bonner was born in Brooklyn, and lived in Virginia and Florida, before moving to Princeton in 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Corella A.; a son, Bertram F. Bonner Jr., of Westfield, N.J.; a daughter, Carol A. Wolfe of Wellington, Fla., and a grandson.
