        The Rev. Daniel C. Thomas, a retired vice president and past trustee of Princeton Theological Seminary, died on Tuesday at the Princeton Medical Center. He was 73 and lived in Princeton.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Starting in the 1940's, Mr. Thomas served as pastor to several large Presbyterian churches in the East and Middle West, including North Avenue Presbyterian Church in New Rochelle, N.Y.; First Presbyterian Church in Binghamton, N.Y., and Webster Groves Presbyterian Church in Webster Groves, Mo. He was born to missionary parents on Hainan Island in China and, a fourth-generation Christian minister, graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1944.
        He then served as a Navy chaplain in the Pacific and, after the war, earned a master's degree at Columbia University. Throughout his career, he sat on national boards and agencies of the Presbyterian Church.
        He was elected alumni trustee of Princeton Theological Seminary in 1969 for a three-year term and a permanent trustee after that. In 1980 he became a vice president and the secretary of the seminary. He retired in 1987.
        Mr. Thomas is survived by his wife, Lois A.; a daughter, the Rev. Marcia J. Thomas of Jackson, Mich.; three sons, Dale E., of Chicago, the Rev. Daniel C. Jr., of Canton, Ohio, and the Rev. Mark P., of Port Huron, Mich.; two brothers, the Rev. David, of Houston, and the Rev. Robert, of Riverside, Calif.; a sister, Jean Griffith of Amarillo, Tex., and six grandchildren.
