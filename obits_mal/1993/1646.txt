        L. Damon Gadd, founder of the Sugarbush ski resort in Vermont, died on Nov. 7 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        In 1958, assisted by his wife, Sara, and Jack Murphy, manager of a nearby ski resort, Mr. Gadd started and developed Sugarbush on Lincoln Mountain in Warren, Vt. He was credited with such innovations as an enclosed Italian-built gondola lift to protect against winter winds, improved safety standards for chairlifts and a ski school with instructors from a variety of countries.
        Sugarbush was one of the first resorts to provide a cocktail lounge in the base lodge.
        The Gadds, who were also familiar figures in the winter resorts of Europe, sold Sugarbush in 1977 and retired to Florida.
        Mr. Gadd was born in Manhattan, the son of a New York developer. He graduated from Yale University in 1949 and then went to Hawaii, where he helped organize the state's visitors bureau. After traveling to write, ski and do photographic work, the Gadds settled in Vermont in 1954.
        In addition to his wife, Sara Rohm Gadd, Mr. Gadd is survived by two daughters, Megan Damon Gadd of Concord, Vt., and Victoria Gadd Eardensohn of Palm Beach and Sugarbush, and two grandchildren.
