        Ben G. Elliott, a professor of engineering at the University of Wisconsin who conducted groundbreaking research on the automobile engine in the early years of this century, died Wednesday at St. Marys Hospital in Madison, Wis. He was 104 and lived in Madison.
        He had pneumonia, said Jeff Iseminger, a spokesman for the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
        Mr. Elliott was born in North Platte, Neb., and in his youth knew Buffalo Bill Cody. He received a master's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Wisconsin and, in 1917, became a professor there. He retired in 1959.
        Mr. Elliott advised Henry Ford at his factory in Dearborn, Mich., and was co-author of "The Gasoline Automobile," which was published in 1915 and used by the Army in World War I. The book went through five printings.
        He is survived by two daughters, Dorothy Sneed of Milwaukee and Georgia Ann Handt of Midland, Mich., and three grandchildren.
