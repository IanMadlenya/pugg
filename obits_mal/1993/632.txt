        Joseph Epstein, emeritus professor of philosophy at Amherst College, died Sunday at Cooley Dickenson Hospital in Northampton, Mass. He was 76 and lived in Amherst.
        He died after a brief illness, the college said.
        Professor Epstein taught at Amherst for 35 years until he retired in 1987 as the George Lyman Crosby Professor of Philosophy. But he continued to teach through the term that ended this month and held a freshman seminar, "The Causes of History."
        Aside from philosophy and history, Professor Epstein had an interest in science, and worked in physics for the Army Signal Corps in World War II. In recent years he studied problems of logic and the philosophy of science, particularly the pragmatic philosophy of C. S. Peirce, the physicist, mathematician and logician.
        At Amherst he taught logic, the philosophy of science, epistemology, pragmatism, meaning and reference.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Goldberger; two sons, Joshua M. Epstein of Washington, and Samuel D. Epstein of Cambridge, Mass., and a granddaughter.
