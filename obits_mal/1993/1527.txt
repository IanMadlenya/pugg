        Henry J. Opperman, a former television producer and advertising executive who helped produce such early television shows as "Captain Video and His Space Rangers," died at his home in Raleigh, N.C., on Nov. 14. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Paul.
        Mr. Opperman joined the DuMont Network in New York shortly after serving in the Army during World War II. The network owned what is now WNYW-TV, Channel 5, in New York, and broadcast some of television's first regularly running shows.
        As director of program planning and development, Mr. Opperman served as a liaison between the network and the advertising agencies that created such shows as "The Goldbergs," a situation comedy that began on radio, and "The Plainclothesman," a detective show.
        "Captain Video," whose actors patrolled the universe in their spaceship called Galaxy, was one of the first children's shows on television.
        After the DuMont Network was sold in 1955, Mr. Opperman worked in television advertising, first for Wade Advertising, which created the Speedy Alka-Seltzer commercials. He later worked for Ted Bates & Company and then for Grey-North Advertising. He later worked in Florida in advertising and development for the Knight-Ridder newspaper chain.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, Charles, of Raleigh, and Paul, of New York, and three grandchildren.
