        Barry K. Wade, an editor and director of W. W. Norton & Company, died on March 3 at his home in Manhattan at the age of 41.
        The cause of death was liver failure, said his companion, George Dumbadze.
        In his 17 years at the Norton publishing company, Mr. Wade worked with such authors as A. Bartlett Giamatti, the poet Adrienne Rich and Maynard Mack, who wrote "Alexander Pope: A Life" (1988).
        He also edited many textbooks, anthologies and literary collections widely used at colleges and universities. Those works include "The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces," which has sold 2 million copies.
        Mr. Wade, a native of Clifton Forge, Va., graduated from Yale and did graduate work at Brown.
        Besides his companion, his survivors include his parents, Richard and Urcyl Wade of Valdosta, Ga.; a sister, Judith Harrington of Valdosta, and a brother, R. Alan, of Jacksonville, Fla.
