        Fritz A. Gross, designer and developer of radar systems, died Tuesday at his home in Westwood, Mass. He was 82 and until recently lived in Weston, Mass.
        He died of cancer, said the Raytheon Company in Lexington, Mass., from which he retired as vice president of engineering in 1976.
        Mr. Gross held 31 international patents, including many in the marine-electronics field. He continued as a consultant for Raytheon until his death. A native of Germany, he graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1932 and two years later became only the second engineer hired by the budding electronics concern.
        Starting with amplifiers for early movie theaters and electronic gear for the Navy, he spent 41 years in various engineering and management positions at Raytheon.
        Mr. Gross helped to develop microwave search radar that enabled ships to "see" at night and first played a vital role in the American naval victory at Guadalcanal in World War II. He had a hand in devising smaller radars for use on PT boats and landing and patrol craft.
        After the war, he headed Raytheon teams that engineered marine-radar systems for small vessels and bright-light radar displays for use on the bridges of large ships, among other projects.
        As vice president of engineering and later as consultant, he supervised the design and development of the Raytheon collision-avoidance radar system, or Raycas, which can track up to 20 ships at a time and is in wide use today.
        Mr. Gross is survived by his wife of 55 years, Olive; three daughters, Jane Gross and Martha Kapp of Newton, Mass., and Susan Gross Bratman of Palo Alto, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
