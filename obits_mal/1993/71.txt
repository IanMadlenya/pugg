        Dr. Emanuel Appelbaum, a specialist in infectious diseases who served on the staff of Bellevue Hospital for more than 70 years, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 98.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his physician, Dr. Harry Taube.
        Dr. Appelbaum contributed to the discovery of the value of sulfadiazine in treating meningococcic meningitis, said Dr. Saul J. Farber, dean and provost of the Medical Center at New York University. Dr. Appelbaum was professor of clinical medicine at the medical center at the time of his death.
        Born in Russia, he immigrated to the United States as a youth and attended Columbia College on a Pulitzer scholarship. After graduating in 1916, he attended Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, again as a scholarship student, and received his medical degree in 1918.
        He began his study of infectious diseases in 1921 as a pathologist for New York City's Department of Health, where he worked on the diagnosis and treatment of meningitis, encephalitis and poliomyelitis.
        In 1943, Dr. Appelbaum reported the efficacy of sulfdiazine in treating meningitis, an inflammation that attacks the membranes enveloping the brain or spinal cord.
        His wife of 62 years, the former Ruth Albert, died in 1989. He is survived by a son, David, of Omaha; a daughter, Arline Levinson of Emeryville, Calif.; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
