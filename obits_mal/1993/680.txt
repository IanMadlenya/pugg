        Allen Grover, a retired vice president of Time Inc. and former personal aide to Henry R. Luce, the company's founder, died on Monday at home in Manhattan at 92.
        He died in his sleep, his family said.
        Mr. Grover, whose close relationship with Mr. Luce earned him the sobriquet "vice president in charge of Henry Luce," started with the company when he was 30.
        After beginning as a contributing editor for business and finance at Time magazine in 1931, he transferred to Fortune the next year and rose to assistant managing editor. In 1936 he became Mr. Luce's personal assistant and in 1939 was promoted to vice president. He retired in 1962.
        In his 31-year career at Time, Mr. Grover helped to keep Mr. Luce apprised of corporate developments, accompanied him on meetings with world dignitaries and even made discreet suggestions on table manners.
        Mr. Grover was born in St. Louis, the son of a bank president, and graduated from Yale University in 1922.
        He joined United American Steamship Lines in Manhattan as an assistant to its chief, W. Averell Harriman, who later was Governor of New York and a diplomat. Mr. Grover next worked as an analyst at the brokerage firms of J. G. White & Company and Pynchon & Company on Wall Street.
        Surviving are his wife of 61 years, the former Beatrice Beard; a son, Robinson A., of Simsbury, Conn.; a daughter, Loraine Wallace of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.
