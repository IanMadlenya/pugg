        Prof. John M. Wallace, an authority on 17th-century poetry at the University of Chicago, died yesterday at his home in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago. He was 65 years old.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Professor Wallace's major work, "Destiny His Choice: The Loyalism of Andrew Marvell," published by Cambridge University Press in 1968 and issued in paperback in 1980, was praised by many scholars for its treatment of the relationship between politics and literature in the 17th century.
        Born in London and educated at Trinity College at Cambridge University, from which he graduated in 1950, Professor Wallace became a United States citizen in 1964. Before coming to the United States in the mid-1950's, he taught English at the elementary and secondary school level in England and Italy. He received a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1957 and taught at Cornell University and then at Johns Hopkins before moving to the University of Chicago as a professor of English in 1970.
        He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship from 1967 to 1970 and was named a fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1980.
        Professor Wallace's marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Audrey Lauer of Chicago; two sisters, Mary Wallace of Cambridge, England, and Angela Strahan of Suffolk, England, and a granddaughter.

        An obituary headline yesterday about Prof. John M. Wallace, an authority on 17th-century poetry at the University of Chicago, misstated his age in some copies. He was 65.
