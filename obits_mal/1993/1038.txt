        Thomas H. Odiorne, president and chief operating officer of the Celgene Corporation and a former senior executive at Johnson & Johnson, died on Saturday at the Doylestown Hospital in Doylestown, Pa. He was 52 and lived in New Hope, Pa.
        The cause was a heart attack, the family said.
        Mr. Odiorne was named president of Celgene, a chemical biotechnology company based in Warren, N.J., last April, succeeding John L. Ufheil. Mr. Ufheil, the company's chairman, has taken over Mr. Odiorne's duties until a new president and chief operating officer is appointed.
        Celgene, a spinoff of the Celanese Corporation, is developing processes to reduce pollutants in hazardous waste and to make drugs safer.
        Before going to Celgene, Mr. Odiorne was with Johnson & Johnson for 24 years, starting as a sales representative. He headed McNeil Pharmaceuticals, a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary in Spring House, Pa., from 1985 to 1989.
        He was born in Beaumont, Tex., and graduated from Lamar University in 1965.
        He served as chairman of the Delaware Valley United Way campaign in 1988 and 1989. Earlier, he served on the board of the Y.M.C.A. in Doylestown.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Diane Swanzy; three daughters, Kristen A. Speiss of North Wales, Pa., Kim D. Hansen of Watertown, Mass., and Kathryn L. Odiorne of New Hope; his mother, Dorothy Hayes Odiorne of Liberty, Tex.; two brothers, Jack and Donald, both of Devers, Tex.; a sister, Connie Rousch of Lumberton, Tex., and one grandson.
