        Bernard S. Myers, an art historian and editor who wrote on German expressionist and Mexican art, died on Sunday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 84 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Peter, also of Brooklyn.

        His own books included "Modern Art in the Making," "Mexican Painting in Our Time," "The German Expressionists" and "Problems of the Younger American Artist." With the help of his wife, Shirley D. Myers, he edited the five-volume McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Art. He also served as a consulting editor for the 16-volume McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Art.
        He was a president of the Alumni Association of the Institute of Fine Arts and a fellow of the Bollingen and Rockefeller foundations.
