        Robert L. Jennings, a retired president of the United States Woolworth division of the F. W. Woolworth Company, died on Thursday at a hospital in his hometown, Edgewater, N.J. He was 64.
        His doctor said the cause was a heart attack or stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Jennings started his 38-year career at the company in 1951 as a management trainee in a Woolworth store in Jersey City.
        Working his way up, he was promoted in 1983 to executive vice president for merchandising of United States Woolworth, which runs the company's stores in this country. The next year he became the president and chief executive and served in those posts until his retirement in 1989.
        Mr. Jennings was born in Jersey City. He attended the University of Miami and served in the Marines.
        He is survived by his wife of 21 years, the former Telka Kitz; his three daughters and two sons by a prior marriage, Margaret Mary South of La Canada, Calif., Elizabeth Ann Jones of Princeton, N.J., Maureen Jennings of Santa Monica, Calif., Robert L. Jr., of Cedar Knolls, N.J., and Harold S. Jennings of Billings, Mont., and five grandchildren.
