        Warren L. Jones, who as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard many cases involving segregation, school integration and minority voting rights in the South, died on Thursday in Riverside Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 98.
        Mr. Jones was appointed to the appeals court, in New Orleans, by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955 and was almost immediately enmeshed in legal cases intended to end segregation. In 1961, for example, he was a member of a three-judge panel that voted to quash an effort by the State of Alabama to challenge the 1960 Federal Civil Rights Act.
        In 1962 he was one of five Federal judges who enjoined the University of Mississippi from taking any action that would prohibit a black student, James H. Meredith, from continuing as a student at the university.
        And in a noted civil liberties decision, he wrote the majority opinion in a 1964 decision that threw out the Federal conviction of William Worthy, a black journalist, for going to Cuba without a passport, a technical violation of United States law.
        He is survived by three grandchildren, Lauren Shakely of Brooklyn, William W. Shakely of Harrisburg, Pa., and Susan Keenan of Basalt, Colo.
