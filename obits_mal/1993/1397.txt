        Lou Miller, a former sportswriter whose penchant for practicing the sports he covered peaked when he became an accomplished harness driver in the 1950's, died on Monday at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 78.
        His family said he died of cardiac arrest.
        It may have seemed odd for a 40-year-old sportswriter to scrimmage with Navy before the 1955 Sugar Bowl, or to interview premier milers while running alongside them, but Lou Miller never knew any other way.
        He began his career with The New York World-Telegram in 1933, covering the Bronx high school football games he played in.
        After winning Game 6 of the 1957 World Series with a four-hitter over the Milwaukee Braves, Bob Turley of the Yankees startled locker-room interviewers by declaring: "I wasn't much of a pitcher until Miller taught me how to breathe."
        Mr. Miller reached the apotheosis of his double-edged career when he began covering harness racing in 1957. Although he drove in his first harness race as a lark, bringing a 10-1 shot to a second-place finish in 1959, his racing skills served him well when the paper he last worked for, The New York World Journal Tribune, folded in 1966. Three years later, he was the leading trainer at Yonkers Raceway.
        He is survived by his wife, JoAnn Forster; a daughter from a previous marriage, Rita J. Miller of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Ellen Glazier, and a step-granddaughter.
