        Andrew S. Zysman, a doctor who campaigned in San Francisco and nationally for accelerated AIDS research, died on Tuesday in the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 38.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said a spokesman for the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights, an organization of gay and lesbian doctors and medical students.
        Dr. Zysman encouraged hundreds of doctors to support Act Up, the gay-rights protest group, at fund-raising events he sponsored. He served on the governing board of the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights and led a successful drive to have the Burroughs Wellcome Company put a ceiling on the price of acyclovir, an antiviral drug used to treat people with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
        He was an opponent of mandatory testing of health workers for H.I.V.
        Dr. Zysman was an emergency-room physician at Kaiser Hospital in Redwood City until he retired in 1989.
        He is survived by his parents, Eva and Michael Zysman of Union, N.J., and a brother, Dr. Jules Zysman of Honeoye Falls, N.Y.
        Correction:  October 20, 1993, Wednesday
        An obituary on Friday about Andrew S. Zysman, a doctor in San Francisco who campaigned for accelerated AIDS research, described the use of the antiviral drug acyclovir incompletely. It is prescribed to treat herpes, both in patients with HIV infections and in others.
