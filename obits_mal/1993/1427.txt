        Joseph Warren, a character actor who appeared in dozens of plays and films, died on Friday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his wife, Anna. He had lived in the nursing home since suffering a stroke in 1990.
        Mr. Warren made his Broadway debut in 1951 in Maxwell Anderson's "Barefoot in Athens" and subsequently appeared in "One Bright Day," "The Hidden River," "The Advocate," "Philadelphia, Here I Come," "Borstal Boy," "The Lincoln Mask" and "Monday After the Miracle."
        At the New York Shakespeare Festival he appeared in "Little Black Sheep," "Measure for Measure," "The Ballad of Soapy Smith" and "Hamlet." He also acted in productions of "The Show-Off," "Of Mice and Men," "The Aristocrats," "An Enemy of the People" and "Brecht on Brecht." He was a founding member of the Pearl Theater Company and appeared in many productions with that group.
        His feature films included "Mommie Dearest," "Taxi Driver," "Me, Natalie," "Thieves" and "Bang the Drum Slowly."
        Mr. Warren was born in Foxboro, Mass., and was a graduate of the University of Denver.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Joseph Jr. and George, both of Massachusetts; a stepson, Michael Minot of New Orleans, and several grandchildren.
