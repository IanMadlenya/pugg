        R. Tyler Gatchell Jr., a theatrical general manager and producer long associated with the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, died on Thursday en route to Kennedy International Airport. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his companion, Mark Shannon.
        Gatchell & Neufeld, the management and production company that Mr. Gatchell founded with Peter Neufeld in 1969, managed or produced more than 100 shows in the United States and abroad, many of them on Broadway. The company's association with Mr. Lloyd Webber dates from the Broadway opening of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 1971.
        Mr. Gatchell and Mr. Neufeld served as executive producers of "Evita," "Cats," "Song and Dance," "Starlight Express" and "Aspects of Love," and of two Lloyd Webber musicals headed for Broadway. These are a revival of "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" and the new "Sunset Boulevard," which Mr. Lloyd Webber has dedicated to Mr. Gatchell's memory.
        Mr. Gatchell was born in Princeton, N.J., where he attended Princeton High School and worked at the McCarter Theater. He took his senior year at the Professional Children's School in New York City. After working as an assistant casting director and as the assistant box-office director of the Sheridan Square Playhouse in New York, he was hired by the production company Wolsk & Azenberg, where he met Mr. Neufeld.
        In addition to Mr. Shannon, Mr. Gatchell is survived by his father, R. Tyler Gatchell of Princeton; his mother, Patricia Leadley of Denver; two sisters, Alix Leadley of Denver and Lucy Gatchell of Princeton, and a brother, Harry D. Gatchell of Princeton.
