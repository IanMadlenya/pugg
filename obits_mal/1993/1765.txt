        Dr. Cranston W. Holman, a retired thoracic surgeon who was one of the nation's leading tennis players in the 1920's, died yesterday at New York Hospital, where he helped perform one of the first heart-lung transplants in 1969. He was 86.
        His daughter, Martha Paul, said he died of injuries caused by a fall at his home in Manhattan on Thursday.
        Dr. Holman, who was born in San Francisco, received his undergraduate and medical training at Stanford, where he excelled at tennis. Won National Title
        Although he was once the nation's eighth-ranked player, Dr. Holman, who in 1925 became the first West Coast player to win the national junior championship, chose medicine over sport.
        Except for his World War II service, Dr. Holman, who won a Bronze Star for his work as a surgeon in the Pacific, spent virtually his entire medical career at New York Hospital and its affiliated Cornell University Medical College.
        By the time he retired in 1975, he had held 6 teaching appointments, 16 hospital appointments and been portrayed as Dr. Russell Stevens in William Nolen's 1970 book, "The Making of a Surgeon." Led a Transplant Team
        He also participated in one of the world's first heart-lung transplants, on Dec. 25, 1969, when he and Dr. C. Walton Lillehei led a team of 12 doctors in transplanting the heart and lungs of a 50-year-old woman into a 43-year-old man suffering from emphysema. The patient survived for a week.
        Dr. Holman, whose first wife, Marion Nicholas, died in 1986, is survived by his wife, Dr. Constance Friess; two children from his first marriage, Mrs. Paul, a landscape designer in Westport, Mass., and Eric W. Holman, a professor of psychology at U.C.L.A., and two grandchildren.
