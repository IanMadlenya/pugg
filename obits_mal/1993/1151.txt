        Arthur Armijo, a leading performer with the Susan Marshall Dance Company, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 33 and lived in Brooklyn
        The cause was AIDS, his sister Christina said.
        Mr. Armijo was a modern dancer with a hypnotic presence and calm, and a way of investing even simple steps or poses with a quiet grandeur. He received a 1990 Bessie Award for what the award citation described as "an ever-unfolding drama of humanity by a superlative dancer and partner" in Ms. Marshall's choreography.
        Mr. Armijo was born in Albuquerque, N.M. He came to New York in 1981 and joined the Marshall company the following year. He also performed with Dan Wagoner, Charles Moulton, Ruby Shang and Codanceco. His last performance was on June 3 in Ms. Marshall's "Standing Duet," which was dedicated to Mr. Armijo by the choreographer in recognition of his "profound artistry and unceasing inspiration."
        In addition to his sister Christina, of Santa Fe, N.M., Mr. Armijo is survived by his parents, Cecilia and Eutimio Armijo of Albuquerque; two brothers, Diego, of San Diego, and Victor, of Albuquerque, and another sister, Victoria, of Fort Worth.
