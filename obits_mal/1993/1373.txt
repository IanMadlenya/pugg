        Paolo Bortoluzzi, an Italian dancer and choreographer, died on Oct. 16 in a hospital in Brussels. He was 55 years old.
        The cause was a stroke following viral pneumonia, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported.
        At his death, Mr. Bortoluzzi was the ballet director at the Grand Theatre in Bordeaux, France. He had held that post since 1990 and had choreographed several ballets there.
        From 1972 to 1981, he was a guest artist with American Ballet Theater in New York. Over the years he danced with many other leading companies.
        In appraising his career last week, Le Figaro pointed out that Mr. Bortoluzzi was celebrated for the beauty of his dancing and for his suppleness and elegance. He had learned a lot, he used to say, from watching cats landing on the ground after leaping. First Choreographed for Bejart
        He was born in Genoa, studied dance there and made his debut at a festival in Nervi, six miles away, in 1957. He then danced for a time with the Baletto Europeo. In 1960, he joined Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the 20th Century, in Brussels, as a soloist. He went on to become a principal dancer with the Bejart troupe, co-starring with Rudolf Nureyev in "Songs of a Wayfarer." His other roles in that company included leads in "Bolero" and "Romeo and Juliet" (1966), and it was while he was working with Mr. Bejart that he choreographed for the first time.
        He left the company in 1973 and went on, in the late 1970's, to become an etoile and ballet master at La Scala in Milan.
        He also danced, choreographed and directed ballets in Vienna and elsewhere before becoming director of a ballet in Dusseldorf for six years, beginning in 1984.
        Mr. Bortoluzzi is survived by his wife, the dancer Jaleh Karendi, with whom he opened a ballet school in Turin in 1973; a son, Alexis, and a daughter, Vanessa.
