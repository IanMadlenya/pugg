        Robert A. Matthews, who served 25 years as a judge on a series of state courts in New Jersey, died on Wednesday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 73.
        The cause was complications after cancer surgery, said his wife, Karen Thompson Matthews.
        In the 1960's Mr. Matthews presided over many of the tangled legal proceedings involving the disappearance of 160 million pounds of soybean oil from storage tanks in Bayonne. Eventually, Anthony DeAngelis, the central figure in what came to be known as the salad oil swindle, was sent to prison in a fraud case that mounted into the tens of millions of dollars and caused 16 companies and two brokerage houses to declare bankruptcy.
        A graduate of the University of Notre Dame and of the Rutgers Law School, Mr. Matthews practiced law in Newark before being appointed in 1960 to the Essex County Court. In 1963 he became a judge in Superior Court, where he served in the Chancery Division of Bergen, Hudson and Passaic Counties.
        Mr. Matthews is survived by his wife, of Princeton; a son, Robert P., of Williston, Vt., and a daughter, Barbara A. Matthews of Silver Spring, Md.
