        William Kivlan, an investor and investment consultant to the transportation industry, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications after recent heart bypass surgery, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Kivlan attended Columbia University and, after military service, worked for a number of securities firms before founding Caltran Systems Inc., a transportation holding company, in 1972.
        He was its president and chief executive until 1979 when he became president of Kivlan, Stabb & Montagu Ltd., a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. He held that position until 1985, after which he worked mostly as a consultant.
        Mr. Kivlan is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Stribling Kivlan, and their daughter, Elizabeth Ann.
