        Cedric Messina, a television producer whose work included plays by Shakespeare, died on April 30 in London, the British press reported last week. He was 72.
        The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Messina produced television dramas for the BBC in the 1960's and 1970's. They included a six-year series titled "The Shakespeare Plays," which began running on American public television in the late 1970's.
        The Daily Telegraph last week gave Mr. Messina credit for originating the undertaking, which it called the BBC's most ambitious drama project. Mr. Messina was in charge of production for the first two years.
        Mr. Messina was born in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and had his schooling in Johannesburg. He moved to Britain shortly after World War II and became well known there initially as a producer of classical dramas for the radio.In more recent years, he worked as an independent producer.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and a daughter.
