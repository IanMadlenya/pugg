        Mortimer Brandt, a former New York art dealer who had been living in retirement in Baltimore, died there on Monday. He was 88.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Sandra Waters.
        Mr. Brandt was an art dealer who operated a gallery at 15 West 57th Street in Manhattan for 30 years.
        His interest in art and antiques began while he was living in Canada in the 1920's, and continued into a full-time professional career. A dealer mainly in Old Master paintings and drawings, he returned to New York in the early 1930's. He continued in business here until the 1960's and moved to Baltimore 10 years ago.
        During World War II, Mr. Brandt concentrated on modern art. In 1944 his show "Color and Space in Modern Art" displayed works by Matisse, Braque, Kandinsky, Picasso, Miro and Calder. Shortly afterward he gave Mark Rothko his first exhibition.
        In addition to his daughter, of Baltimore, he is survived by his wife, Hilda Brandt of Baltimore; another daughter, Pamela Denniston of Webb City, Mo., and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  September 10, 1993, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about Mortimer Brandt, a New York art dealer who retired to Baltimore, misstated the address of the gallery he operated in Manhattan for 30 years. It was 15 East 57th Street, not West 57th.
