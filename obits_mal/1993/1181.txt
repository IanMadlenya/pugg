        Belmont Towbin, an advisory director of Lehman Brothers, and an investment banker who successfully marketed the stock offerings of many small, rapidly growing companies, died yesterday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 83.
        Mr. Towbin died of heart failure, the family said.
        As a partner in C. E. Unterberg Towbin Company, he helped arrange the initial share offerings of many small, rapidly growing companies in the 1940's and 1950's, a time when new ventures often had to turn to lesser-known firms charging huge commissions to get their stocks to the public. Unterberg Towbin gave such start-up companies the more generous terms offered to established corporations and thereby built a following and a growing roster of clients.
        Among the companies that made their stock market debuts through the firm was Intel, today the world's largest maker of computer chips. In 1971, when Mr. Towbin arranged Intel's first stock offering, the company was barely profitable and had revenues of only $4.2 million.
        In 1977, the firm merged with L. F. Rothschild & Company to become L. F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin, with Mr. Towbin as a limited partner. He and other partners left in 1986 after a policy dispute and he joined Shearson Lehman Brothers, now known as Lehman Brothers, as an advisory director.
        Mr. Towbin was born in Brooklyn. After earning degrees at Johns Hopkins and the Harvard School of Business, he went to work as a trader, bookkeeper and analyst for C. E. Unterberg & Company, owned by his friend, Clarence Unterberg, in 1933. After service in the Navy during World War II he rejoined the firm in 1946 as a partner.
        Mr. Towbin and his wife, the former Phoebe Jacobs, had a summer home in Woodstock, N.Y., and were active in the Woodstock Artists Association.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two brothers, Robert of New York City and Jess of South Plainfield, N.J.
