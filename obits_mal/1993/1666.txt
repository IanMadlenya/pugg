        William H. Todd 2d, an investment adviser who lived in Rye, N.Y., died yesterday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, said Martha Todd, a daughter-in-law.
        Mr. Todd was a managing director of White Oak Capital Management in Manhattan. He previously had been an investment banker with Kuhn, Loeb & Company and with Mackay Shields Financial Corporation.
        He was a former director of the Todd Shipyards Corporation in Brooklyn, which was founded by his grandfather, William H. Todd. During his career the younger Mr. Todd served as a governor of the Securities Industry Association and as president of the Bond Club of New York.
        He also served as a trustee of the Arthritis Foundation in Atlanta and was an officer of its chapter in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, June Todd of Rye; two sons, William H. 3d, of Greenwich, and Peter D., of Rowayton, Conn., and a daughter, Judith H. Todd of Cos Cob, Conn.
