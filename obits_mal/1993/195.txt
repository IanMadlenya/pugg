        John Joseph Walsh, the founder of Black Swan Books, a publisher of important works on literary analysis and art, died on Monday at his home in Redding Ridge, Conn. He was 49.
        His wife, Patricia, said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Walsh graduated from Manhattan College in Riverdale, the Bronx, in 1965 and received a master's degree and a doctorate from New York University. He also received a master of library science degree from Southern Connecticut State University.
        Mr. Walsh founded Black Swan Books in 1978 and quickly earned a reputation for publishing highly regarded works of literary analysis about authors including Ezra Pound, Rainer Maria Rilke, Hilda Doolittle and Lawrence Durrell.
        One of his more important publications, a previously unpublished novel by D. H. Lawrence called "Quetzalcoatl," is to appear in the fall. The manuscript, owned by the University of Texas, was the first draft of Lawrence's "Plumed Serpent" (1926). But "Quetzalcoatl" is "quite different from the final work" and "will add significantly to the known works of Lawrence," said Louis Martz, a professor of English at Yale University, who wrote the introduction.
        Black Swan has also published art books, including "Vision of Harmony: Sculptures of Saul Baizerman," by Melissa Dabakis; "The Grace of Sense: The Sculptures of Joan Sovern," by Dena Merriam, and "Byzantium: Poems of W. B. Yeats," by David Finn.
        In 1980, the Walshes founded the magazine Visual Resources, which featured scholarly articles on esthetics. The magazine was later sold to Gordon & Breach Publishers.
        Mr. Walsh is survived by his wife.
