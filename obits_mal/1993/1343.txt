        Nicholas J. Sciarra, district manager of Community Board 7 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, died on Wednesday during a meeting at the board's offices at 44th Street and Fourth Avenue. He was 41.
        He died apparently after choking while eating a sandwich, said people who were at the meeting and staff workers of the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden. The cause is still under investigation, the Medical Examiner's Office said.
        Mr. Sciarra began a career in neighborhood politics in 1975 when he joined the community board unit at Mr. Golden's office, fielding complaints from residents about various issues, including street signs and water quality. He became district manager in 1988.
        Mr. Sciarra attended Bishop Ford High School in Bensonhurst and graduated with a bachelor's degree from St. Francis College in Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda, and by three sisters, Denise Trapani, Donna Becker and JoAnn Sciarra, all of Staten Island.
