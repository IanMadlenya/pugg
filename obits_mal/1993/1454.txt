        After receiving a doctorate in German literature from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1975, Dr. Elmore was assistant professor of German at Haverford College and taught German language and literature as well as a writing course at Bryn Mawr and Vassar. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Erlangen in Germany in 1971 and studied at the University of Vienna in 1965.
        Dr. Elmore is survived by his mother, Lillian S. Elmore of Andalusia, Ala.; a brother, Jerome Elmore, and a sister, Marlene Melvin, both of Atlanta.
