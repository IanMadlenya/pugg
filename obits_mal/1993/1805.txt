        Tommy Wonder, a principal dancer in the "Ziegfeld Follies of 1943," died last Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 78 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause was heart failure, said his business partner, Don Dellair.
        A native of Montana, Mr. Wonder grew up in California and started dancing when he was 3. An adopted child, he and his sister Betty were put on the vaudeville stage by their mother, Tillie Wonder, when her husband died not long after the adoption.
        He was one of the children in the "Our Gang" comedies and went on to work as an actor in pictures as well as a dancer onstage.
        The 1943 version of the Follies turned out to be one of the most successful, running for more than a year. The cast was headed by Milton Berle and Ilona Massey, and Mr. Wonder's partner was Nadine Gae. He and Mr. Berle were among the few principals who stayed for the entire 14-month run.
        Among his film credits were "Gangster's Boy" with Jackie Cooper, and "Once in a Lifetime" with Betty Grable and Dorothy Lamour. When he stopped appearing on the stage in 1970, he turned to managing as a partner in Tommy Wonder & Don Dellair Artist Management, on Madison Avenue. Mr. Dellair was the singer in a trio that also featured Maggie Banks, Mr. Wonder's dancing partner and wife. The marriage ended in divorce.
