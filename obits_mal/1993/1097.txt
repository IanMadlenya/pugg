        Boris G. Moishezon, a mathematics professor at Columbia University who defected from the Soviet Union in 1972 and came to the United States five years later, died Wednesday. He was 55 and lived in Leonia, N.J.
        Dr. Moishezon had a heart attack while jogging and was pronounced dead in Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J., said his wife, Natalia.
        Dr. Moishezon was among the foremost experts in algebraic geometry. He began his career 30 years ago in Moscow, tutored by the Soviet mathematician Igor Shafarevich at the Steklov Institute of Mathematics. But he made his international reputation at Tel Aviv University and at Columbia.
        Born in Odessa, Ukraine, he received a doctorate in physical and mathematical sciences from Moscow State University and became a senior scientist at the Central Institute of Mathematical Economics in Moscow. Emigre Driven by Frustration
        Dr. Moishezon belonged to a growing contingent of young intellectuals who felt their Jewishness barred them from the top echelons, especially in mathematics and physics. He and nine peers signed a public statement in 1972 decrying the high fees for exit visas imposed on holders of doctoral degrees. The fees, as much as $25,000, were intended by the Soviet Government as repayment for the emigres' education.
        By then the 10 were in the midst of the complicated process of seeking passage to Israel during the Soviet drain brain of the 1970's. Dr. Moishezon got his exit visa in 1972 and took the post of professor of mathematics at Tel Aviv University. He came to the United States as a visiting professor at the University of Utah in 1977, the year he was appointed a professor of mathematics at Columbia.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Moishezon leaves a daughter, Hanna, of Tel Aviv; a son, Tsvi, of Leonia; and a half-brother, Friedrich, of Yalta, Ukraine.
