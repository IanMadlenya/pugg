        Charles N. Feidelson Jr., an authority on American literature and on literary modernism, died on Thursday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 75 and had recently moved to Cambridge from New Haven.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his son, John.
        Professor Feidelson (pronounced FIE-del-son) retired as the Bodman Professor of English Literature at Yale University in 1988.
        Dean Sidney Altman of Yale College said, "He has stood at the head of the study and the teaching of American literature and of literary modernism for 35 years."
        Professor Feidelson joined the Yale faculty in 1947 and was chairman of the American Studies program, consisting of both undergraduate and graduate courses, from 1977 to 1980. Fulbright Scholar
        His best-known book, "Symbolism and American Literature," which came out in 1953 and is still in print from the University of Chicago Press, focuses on the 19th-century American writers Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman and Emerson. The Kenyon Review praised the book for having been written with great spiritedness, skill and learning.
        Professor Feidelson's other writings include an annotated edition of Melville's "Moby-Dick" that was first published in 1964 and is still in print, from Macmillan. He was awarded Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships.
        He was born in Savannah, Ga., grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Yale in 1938. He then studied for a year at Cambridge University in England and went on to earn a Ph.D. from Yale in 1948, after serving in the Army as a lieutenant in Europe during World War II.
        His 1947 marriage to Kathryn Van Raalte ended in divorce in 1973.
        In addition to his son, John, of Boston, his survivors include two daughters, Emily Feidelson of Durham, N.C., and Anne Feidelson of Boston; a sister, Adeline Kahn of Birmingham, a brother, David Feidelson of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
