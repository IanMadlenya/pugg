        Irving Blumberg, an advocate for the mentally ill who helped found the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, died last Thursday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 86.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Jean Ross.
        Mr. Blumberg started his work for the mentally ill in New York, serving as a president of the New York State Association for Mental Health and as a volunteer consultant and board member for several statewide committees on mental health.
        From 1965 to 1975, he worked as a consultant on mental health issues to Mary Woodard Lasker and her sister Alice Fordyce, administrators of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards, given for significant achievements in basic and medical research.
        Beginning in the 1970's Mr. Blumberg expanded the scope of his work, helping to organize the first international conference on psychiatric rehabilitation, held in Helsinki, Finland, in 1971. And in 1981, he helped found the World Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, which now has chapters in more than 70 countries that lobby for improved treatment and rehabilitation programs for the mentally ill.
        In 1990, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo awarded Mr. Blumberg a special citation for outstanding service to New York State for his efforts to improve the lives of the mentally ill.
        A native of New York, Mr. Blumberg graduated from City College of New York in 1928.
        His first wife, the former Hannah Levine, died in 1974.
        He is survived by his second wife, Celia, of Manhattan; a daughter, Jean Ross of Princeton, and one grandson.
