        Lester W. Smith, an architect who specialized in the design of schools, died on Saturday at Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in Hanover, N.H. He was 84 and lived in Etna, N.H.
        The cause was amyloidosis, a blood-plasma disease, his family said.
        Mr. Smith was a founding partner of the Sherwood, Mills & Smith architecture firm in Stamford, Conn., now S.M.S. of New Canaan, Conn. He designed the American School in Guatemala, the Ridge School in Ridgewood, N.J., the high school in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and elementary schools in Bedford, N.Y., and Chappaqua, N.Y.
        He also designed the American Radiator Building at the 1939 World's Fair and was the chief designer and site planner for the Caribbean Architect-Engineering Company in Trinidad, working on military installations. Early in his career, he assisted in the designing of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan and the Westminster Choir School in Princeton, N.J.
        Mr. Smith, who was born in Brooklyn, earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Princeton, then studied at the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in France on a fellowship. Later, he served on the advisory council of Princeton's school of architecture.
        In World War II, he was a captain in the Army Air Corps in Asia.
        Mr. Smith is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, William W., of Hong Kong; two daughters, Anne Smith Goodhue of Sudbury, Mass., and Josephine Smith Koehne of Meyersville, N.J., and three grandchildren.
