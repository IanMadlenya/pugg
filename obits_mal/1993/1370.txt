        Irving Torgoff, a star college basketball player and a leading pro player in the early days of the National Basketball Association, died on Thursday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 75 and lived in Lighthouse Point, Fla.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        "He was really the first player who became known as a sixth man in basketball," said Red Auerbach, who coached him on the Washington Capitols in the 1940's. "Torgoff was the kind of player who could come off the bench and was as good as any of the starters. He could turn a whole game around. He was one of the great players."
        Aided by Torgoff's versatility, the Capitols won 17 straight games in 1948, a record that stood for many years. All-America at L.I.U.
        Born in Brooklyn, Torgoff learned the game in Brownsville's schoolyards and played at Tilden High School. He was 6 feet 3 inches, fairly tall for players of his era, and was recalled by Auerbach as "a well-built guard with a great shot."
        Under Coach Clair Bee at Long Island University, Torgoff became a two-time all-America. As a senior, he was the leading scorer on the 1939 team, which won the National Invitation Tournament championship against Loyola University.
        After college, Torgoff served in the Army Air Force, then entered pro ball in 1946. After he left basketball in 1949, he became a salesman in Manhattan's garment district and later was a fabrics and yarns retailer.
        He is survived by his wife, Bess; two daughters, Carole Ash and Elaine Rosenberg, both of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Martin, of Manhattan; a sister, Grace Ertischek, of Sunrise, Fla., and five grandchildren.
