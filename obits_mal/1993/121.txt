        Tad Danielewski, a theater, film and television director and acting teacher, died last Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 71.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Throughout his long career Mr. Danielewski was dedicated to the training of actors. He established the Tad Danielewski Actors' Workshop in New York in the late 1950's, and a branch in Los Angeles some 20 years later. Among his students were James Earl Jones, Mercedes Ruehl, Martin Sheen and Sigourney Weaver.
        Born in Poland on March 29, 1921, Mr. Danielewski spent a year in a Nazi labor camp during World War II. After the war he directed more than two dozen plays for the Polish and British army theaters, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. A Director on 'Omnibus'
        He moved to the United States in 1948, attended Ohio State University, and began his American career as a television director. In the mid-1950's he directed more than 20 features for the "Omnibus" series on CBS, and then became head of new program development for NBC.
        He was a producer and director of "Africa," a four-hour Emmy Award-winning documentary that was telecast by ABC during the 1967-68 season.
        In 1957 Mr. Danielewski founded Stratton Productions, a company that staged many productions in New York, Los Angeles and London. He collaborated with Pearl S. Buck on several projects, including "The Guide," a film about India. In 1962 he directed a film version of Jean-Paul Sartre's "No Exit" that starred Viveca Lindfors, Rita Gam and Morgan Sterne.
        He was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Directors Guild of America, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers.
        He is survived by his wife, Lillian D'Arc; two sons, Mark, of Los Angeles, and Christopher, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Annie, of Los Angeles.
