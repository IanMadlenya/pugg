        Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Friedman, the founder and former spiritual leader of the Garment Center Synagogue in Manhattan, died on May 25 at the Aishel Avraham nursing home in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He was 95.
        Rabbi Friedman lived for 50 years in Washington Heights in Manhattan.
        He was a rabbinical graduate of Yeshiva University's Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. He was ordained in 1921 and, a decade later, founded the Garment Center Synagogue. The synagogue, at 205 West 40th Street, was established primarily to serve the many Jews who worked in the garment trade.
        Born on Nov. 13, 1897, in Jerusalem, Rabbi Friedman came to the United States with his mother and brother in 1918 to escape famine in his homeland. His father had arrived a year earlier. Trained as a scribe, Rabbi Friedman began his rabbinical studies in 1919.
        After his ordination, he was appointed rabbi of Congregation Ezrath Israel in Ellenville, N.Y., a position he held for four years before moving to Brooklyn. In 1931, after serving at several synagogues in New York City, Rabbi Friedman founded the Garment Center Synagogue. In the mid-1950's, he was named rabbi emeritus.
        Rabbi Friedman's wife, Charlotte, died in 1980.
        The rabbi is survived by two sons, Harold, of La Mirada, Calif., and Sigmund, of Jerusalem, and a brother, Oscar, of New City, N.Y.
