        James Milton Voss, former chairman of the Caltex Petroleum Corporation, died on Monday at his home in Cedar Creek, Tex. He was 76.
        He died of complications from kidney failure, said Paul T. Murphy, director of corporate affairs at the company's headquarters in Dallas. Caltex is a joint venture of the Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc.
        Mr. Voss was elected president of Caltex in 1964, when it was based in New York City. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1970, a post he held until he retired in 1981.
        He joined Caltex in 1946 as a lawyer and was first sent to Shanghai, then transferred to Hong Kong. He negotiated the company's first marketing operation in the Ryukyu Islands, the Western Pacific island chain that includes Okinawa.
        Moving to Japan, Mr. Voss handled the legal work for Caltex's interests with the Nippon and Koa Oil Companies. He later served as managing director of Caltex's Australian office. He returned to New York in 1961 as a divisional vice president.
        Mr. Voss was born in Bastrop, Tex., and graduated from the University of Texas, receiving a law degree in 1939.  In World War II he served with the Air Force for two years in China.
        He was a former vice chairman of the Japan Society and a trustee of the Asia Society, both in New York. He also served as a director of Texas Instruments, the Bank of Tokyo Trust Company and various trade organizations.
        Mr. Voss is survived by his wife, Mary; two daughters, Susan Voss of Austin, Tex., and Phyllis Culbert of San Antonio; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
