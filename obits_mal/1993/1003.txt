        Dr. Louis Henry Hempelmann Jr., an authority on radiation biology who directed studies on the effects of radiation exposure at the Government's nuclear weapons laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., died early yesterday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. He was 79 and lived in Rochester.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said Robert Loeb, a hospital spokesman.
        Dr. Hempelmann was chairman emeritus of the University of Rochester's radiology department.
        In World War II in the race to create an atomic bomb, Dr. Hempelmann was part of the Manhattan Project. In 1943, he became director of the health division at the nuclear laboratory.
        Dr. Hempelmann's most renown study was of the accidental radiation exposure of workers in an uncontrolled fission reaction at Los Alamos in 1946.  His scientific and medical report on the radiation exposures and their consequences appeared in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 1952.
        He left Government service in 1948 to become a medical research associate at Harvard University, but continued to be a special assistant to the Atomic Energy Commission, now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
        Dr. Hempelmann joined the medical faculty at the University of Rochester in 1950. He taught radiology and became department chairman in 1960, retiring in 1979.
        Born in St. Louis, the son and grandson of physicians, he graduated from Washington University and received his medical degree there in 1938.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Elinor Wickham Pulitzer.
