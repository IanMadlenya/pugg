        John P. W. Vest, who was a leader in Navy aviation, an executive in the helicopter industry and Governor of the Marshall Islands Trust Territory, died on Sunday at his home in Centreville, Md. He was 91.
        Captain Vest's 30-year career in the Navy began after he graduated from the Naval Academy in 1922. He became an aviator in 1926 at the age of 25. He flew from the Navy's first aircraft carrier, the Langley, and helped in the aerial mapping of the Aleutian Islands in the early 1930's.
        During World War II he served on the staff of Admiral E. J. King as the director of Naval Air Training. Captain Vest also commanded the Croatan, an escort carrier that began night flights to counter German U-boat attacks under the cover of darkness. The Croatan sank four enemy submarines.
        After the war, as skipper of the Franklin D. Roosevelt, a carrier, he supervised the Navy's first helicopter operations.
        In the late 1940's, while commanding a local naval station in the Marshall Islands, Captain Vest also served as governor of the territory. During that time the islanders developed a legislature. He was also in charge when Eniwetok was evacuated to make way for the testing of nuclear weapons.
        He left the Navy in 1952, joined the Sikorsky Aircraft Company in Stratford, Conn., as chief of engineering and worked closely with Igor Sikorsky, the head of the company, in designing and developing helicopters. He retired in 1966.
        He was a past president of the American Helicopter Society.
        Captain Vest, a native of Washington, was married for 59 years to the former Frances Howell Neville, who died in 1984.
        His survivors include two sons, Wendell N., of Norfolk, Va., and George G. of New Canaan, Conn.; a daughter, Joan Withington of Centreville, and seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
