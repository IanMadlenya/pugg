        Pierce Paley, a corporate lawyer and real-estate developer, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 56.
        The cause was stomach cancer, a family member said.
        Mr. Paley was a counsel to the firm of Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent & Friedman and a contributing editor to The New York Law Journal and Real Estate Weekly. He wrote frequently about his specialty, the conversion of commercial and private buildings into cooperatives and condominiums.
        He was a graduate of New York University and the University's School of Law. He also was active in local Republican politics and twice campaigned unsuccessfully for office, in 1965 for state senator and in 1962 for state assemblyman.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Rosenblum; two daughters, Gail Fox of Great Neck and Jennifer Paley of Manhattan; his parents, Morrison and Esther Paley of Manhattan, and a brother, Winston Paley of Roslyn, L.I.
