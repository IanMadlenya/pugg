        E. Barry Ryan, horseman, former owner of Normandy Farm in Lexington, Ky., and one of the founders of Classic, a magazine about horses and horse raising, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        A daughter, Margot Ryan Winger, said the cause was pneumonia.
        Mr. Ryan trained his own Thoroughbreds, including Quick Pitch, one of the country's leading steeplechase horses.
        Besides Mrs. Winger, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Ryan is survived by another daughter, Sandria Parsons of Marion, Mass., and seven grandchildren.
