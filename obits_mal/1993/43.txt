        Mr. Lafore died of a stroke, said the kennel club, which reported his death.

        A native of Penn Valley, Pa., Mr. Lafore graduated from Swarthmore College in 1926. He was a Commander in the Navy in World War II and served in the Pennsylvania Legislature after the war until 1957, when he won a special election as Representative of the state's 13th Congressional District. A Republican, he was elected to a full two-year term in Washington in 1958 but was defeated in 1960.
        He was a member of many dog clubs, including the Collie Club of America, the Keeshond Club of America and the Kennel Club of Philadelphia.
