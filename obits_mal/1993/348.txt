        Joseph Martin Chomski, a Washington lawyer who was a representative of the interests of Alaska natives, died Thursday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 46 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        He died of leukemia, said a law partner, Eric A. Eisen.
        A member of the Washington law firm, Birch, Horton, Bittner & Cherot since 1976, Mr. Chomski represented a variety of Alaska's native corporations. He was instrumental in securing Congressional recognition of the corporations as disadvantaged businesses under Federal small-business preference programs.
        In 1988, he represented Pribilof Islands natives when they won a major claim from the Department of Interior for the unreimbursed use of property. He was also an architect of the Pribilof Islands Trust Agreement in 1983, which preserved the natural habitat and furthered the development of the islands' infrastructure.
        A principal participant in drafting the 1983 amendments to the Fur Seal Act, Mr. Chomski served as American adviser to the North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty negotiations in 1987 and 1988. He was also counsel for the Alaska Teamsters Union Pension Trust for many years.
        Born in New York City, he graduated from George Washington University, where he also received a law degree in 1970.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Kathleen Brown; a daughter, Cara Brown Chomski; two sons, Bennett Isaac Chomski and Adam George Chomski, all of Bethesda, and his mother, Masha Chomski of Manhattan.
