        Dr. Paul S. Roller, an inventor and research chemist in the fields of water purification, waste-water treatment and particle-size analysis, died on Friday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. A resident of Manhattan, he was 91.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, Dr. Roller was educated at the Polytechnic Institute in Brooklyn and at Columbia University, where he studied with Harold Urey, the Nobel Prize winner. He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1929.
        He rose from assistant to senior chemist at the Nonmetallic Minerals Experimental Station of the United States Bureau of Mines in New Brunswick, N.J., from 1928 to 1947.
        He later headed his own company in Washington, the Liquids Process Company, to pursue his research and inventions. He is credited with more than a dozen patents, one for a particle-size analyzer used for industrial and construction materials. Measuring and sorting particles is important in many industries, from coal-fired power plants to cement manufacturing. Other patents applied to water purification and desalination.
        He was 82 when he received a patent for a process to detoxify waste water. He retired from full-time research in 1985. He had dissolved his Washington company.
        Dr. Roller's wife, the former Ella Gale, died 24 years ago. He is survived by a son, David of Ontario, Calif.; two daughters, Jane R. Darnell of Larchmont, N.Y., and Dr. Ann R. Massar of Brussels; a sister, Lee R. Hirsch of Roosevelt Island, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
