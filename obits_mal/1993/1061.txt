        Joseph Gould, a movie publicist who organized a clandestine American mission against Nazi Germany in World War II, died on Sunday at the Hospice of Washington, in Washington. He was 78 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        The cause of death was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Gould attended New York University, where he studied German and edited the campus newspaper, and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism, where he graduated in 1935.
        He began a career as a writer and editor for United Features Syndicate but switched to do publicity for several film studios.
        During the war, Mr. Gould enlisted as an officer in the labor branch of the Office of Strategic Services. Stationed in London, he was an agent controlling a team of expatriate German trade unionists who were smuggled into Berlin to join the underground. Later, he worked in Berlin for the military government's manpower division, helping to rebuild German labor unions.
        He returned to New York as a publicist, advertising manager and partner in a firm representing Hollywood studios. He was elected as the first president of the Screen Publicist Guild (East). He moved to the Washington area in 1981 and was director of public affairs for the Center for Defense Information from 1984 to 1989.
        Mr. Gould is survived by a daughter, Barbara Gould Plesser of Washington; a son, Jonathan Gould of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
