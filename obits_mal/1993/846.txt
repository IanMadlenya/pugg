        Edmund J. McRickard, a retired commercial real-estate executive and past president of the Real Estate Board of New York, died on Sunday at the Brandywine Nursing Home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. A 45-year resident of Briarcliff Manor, he was 79.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        A native of the Bronx, Mr. McRickard graduated from Fordham University with a degree in business administration. He worked as a mortgage broker from 1951 until his retirement in 1985.
        In 1955 he joined the Manhattan firm of Brooks, Harvey & Company, mortgage specialists and consultants. He became a partner two years later and helped arrange financing for many large office and commercial buildings around the country.
        Brooks, Harvey was acquired in 1969 by Morgan Stanley & Company to become the brokerage house's real-estate affiliate. Mr. McRickard was named its president in 1976. Two years after Mr. McRickard's retirement, Brooks, Harvey became what is now Morgan Stanley Realty Inc.
        Besides serving in the 1960's as president of the Real Estate Board of New York, a trade group that represents most of the city's builders and landlords, Mr. McRickard held leading positions in the New York chapter of the Society of Industrial Realtors, the New York Metropolitan District chapter of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers and the New York Metropolitan Association of Real Estate Boards.
        Mr. McRickard is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Katherine Lundberg; a daughter, Wendy Traulsen of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and one granddaughter.
