        Sunil K. Roy, a retired Indian diplomat and former Consul General in New York, died Monday in New Delhi. He was 73.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said a friend, David Challinor of Washington.
        During the 1960's and 70's Mr. Roy served India in a variety of international posts: Ambassador to Poland, then Mexico, and High Commissioner to Nigeria, as well as Consul General here about 30 years ago.
        Before his service here, he had been a foreign affairs expert in the Government of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. He later served as India's director of tourism and wildlife. In recent years he had served as an environmental consultant to the World Bank.
        He is survived by his wife, Aruna Roy, and a daughter, Inca Roy, both of New Delhi.
