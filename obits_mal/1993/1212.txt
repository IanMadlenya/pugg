        Luciano Charles Scorsese, a raspy-voiced garment worker who appeared in eight films directed by his son Martin, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. He was 80 and lived in New York City.
        He died after a long illness, said Elizabeth Petit, a spokeswoman for his son.
        Charles Scorsese was a presser for 40 years and retired a dozen years ago, after which he did more film work. In his son's "Goodfellas" (1990), he played a gangster who becomes a hit man. He also appeared in "The King of Comedy," "The Color of Money" and "Cape Fear" and in Brian De Palma's "Wise Guys." His last role was in "The Age of Innocence," a Martin Scorsese film scheduled to open in September. He was also a wardrobe consultant.
        Martin Scorsese said in a 1991 interview that his father and his mother, who has also appeared in his films, provided historically correct details for his movies, like the card game Charles Scorsese plays in "Raging Bull," his son's 1980 movie based on Jake LaMotta's prizefighting career.
        Charles Scorsese and his wife of 60 years, the former Catherine Cappa, are the subjects of Martin Scorsese's "Italianamerican," a 1974 documentary.
        The elder Mr. Scorsese was born in lower Manhattan and attended Public School 21.
        Besides his wife and his son Martin, of Manhattan, he is survived by another son, Frank, of Staten Island; two brothers, Joseph, of Staten Island, and Gandolfo, of Farmingdale, L.I.; a sister, Fanny DiGiovanni of Jamesburg, N.J., and five grandchildren.
