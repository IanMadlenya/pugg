        Harold Wright, principal clarinetist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Marlboro, Vt. He was 65 and also had a home in Newtonville, Mass.
        A spokeswoman for the orchestra said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Wright was born in Wayne, Pa. He began studying the clarinet at the age of 12 and was a graduate of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Before joining the Boston Symphony in 1970 he was a member of the Houston and Dallas symphonies, and was principal clarinetist of the National Symphony in Washington.
        He was a participant in the Casals Festival in San Juan, P.R., for seven years and played at the Marlboro Festival from 1952 to 1970, and again in 1974 and 1990. He also toured with both the National Symphony and Music From Marlboro.
        Mr. Wright taught at the New England Conservatory of Music and at the Tanglewood Music Center.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and two sons, Karl and Alexander, both of Marlboro.
