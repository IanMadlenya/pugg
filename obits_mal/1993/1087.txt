        Albert Holland Jr., of Tappan, N.Y., a civil rights leader in Rockland County who practiced law in New York for 40 years, died on Sunday at the Jack D. Weiler Hospital of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. He was 68.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, said his wife, Dr. Jacqueline L. Holland.
        Until last year, when he transferred his office to Tappan, Mr. Holland practiced law in Manhattan, most recently maintaining an office at Columbus Circle.
        At various times he served as the general counsel to the Bedford-Stuyvesant Development Corporation, a vice president of the Harlem Lawyers Association and a member of the national judicial council of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. He graduated from Columbia College in 1948 and Columbia Law School in 1952.
        Mr. Holland is survived by his wife, a retired educational administrator; a son, Laurence Holland of Spring Valley, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Holland-Kocher of White Plains; three brothers, Laurence Holland of Orangeburg, N.Y., Jackson Holland of the Bronx, and Robert Holland of Stony Brook, L.I., and a grandson.
