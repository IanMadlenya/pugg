        Thorkild Jacobsen, an archeologist who was an expert on Sumerian tablets and conducted excavations in Iraq, died Sunday at a hospital in Lebanon, N.H. He was 88 and lived in Bradford, N.H.
        The cause was a ruptured tumor, his family said.
        Dr. Jacobsen retired last week as president of the American Oriental Society, an organization of scholars.
        In his first field work, he directed the 1930's excavation of the 2,600-year-old Sennacherib aqueduct at Jerwan, Iraq, which at that time was the world's oldest-known aqueduct.
        In 1950 he helped to unearth Sumerian clay tablets and translate cuneiform compositions written 3,800 years earlier. He compiled dictionaries, wrote on ancient hymns, poems and epics and edited professional journals.
        He helped to translate the oldest-known record of a murder trial, in which three Sumerians were sentenced to death in 1850 B.C.
        In 1954 his team discovered a 100-mile-long, 6,000-year-old irrigation canal parallel to the Euphrates River and records showing that the ancients produced higher grain yields than modern Iraqi farmers.
        He retired as a professor of Assyriology at Harvard University in 1974.
        His first and second wives died. He is survived by his wife of 27 years, the former Katryna P. Hadley; four step-daughters, Dana Perrone of Washington, Pamela Pastacaldi of Pisa, Italy, Caroline Hadley Apfel of Takoma Park, Md., and Katryna Hadley of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Karen Klixbuwl of Copenhagen, and six grandchildren.
