        Dr. S. K. Fineberg, a New York internist specializing in obesity and diabetes, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was complications from cancer, his family said.
        He wrote and lectured extensively at home and in Europe. In the early 1970's he was among the first researchers to recognize obesity as a disease.
        Over three decades, he was called on to evaluate often controversial drugs to combat anorexia, which induce a loss of appetite, and their function in treating obesity. His clinical research on oral diabetic drugs led to more than 50 papers in medical journals and many exhibits at medical congresses.
        Seymour Koeppel Fineberg, a native of Manhattan, graduated from the University of Arkansas and from its Medical School. In World War II he was a flight surgeon in the Army Air Force.
        He was with Harlem Hospital from 1950 to 1966 as chief of metabolic services and its diabetes and obesity clinics, as well as acting director of the hospital in the early 1960's. From 1968 to 1978 he was chief of the same clinics at Metropolitan Hospital in Harlem.
        Dr. Fineberg, a clinical professor of medicine at New York Medical College and Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital, was director of medicine and cardiology at Prospect Hospital in the Bronx from 1961 and 1988 and president of its medical board from 1967 to 1988. After retiring from Prospect, he continued in private practice in Manhattan until 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Seena Hamilton; a son, Bryan of Palm Desert, Calif., and two sisters, Rita Dix of Margate, Fla., and Adrienne Rubin of Hamden, Conn.
