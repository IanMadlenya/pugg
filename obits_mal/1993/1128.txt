        Arthur Pearlroth, a Port Authority executive responsible for promoting minority contractors in the construction industry, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Pearlroth was deputy executive director of the Regional Alliance for Small Contractors, which was formed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to increase business opportunities for contractors headed by women and minority employers. Now an autonomous nonprofit body, it is partly financed by the Port Authority and other agencies. In May, it cited him for starting innovative programs in the fields of education, training and financing.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Pearlroth graduated from the University of Southern California and attended the Ecole International at Geneva. He served in the Army in World War II and worked as a freelance film and television reviewer for The New York Herald Tribune and The Village Voice.
        Mr. Pearlroth is survived by a son, Jonathan, and a daughter, Ariana, both of Manhattan.
