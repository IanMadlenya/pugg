        His parents, Thomas James and Bobbie Ross, said he died of pneumonia.
        Mr. Ross, who was born in Dallas and graduated from Southern Methodist University in that city, studied with the pianist David Bar-Illan at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. He won second prize in the 1980 International Organ Competition in Chartres, France.

After moving to Orlando in 1987 he served as the pianist in the Florida Symphony Orchestra and the Orlando Opera Company, and as the accompanist for the Florida District Auditions of the Metropolitan Opera Council.
        In addition to his parents, he is survived by two brothers, Marshall, of Birmingham, Ala., and Rob, of Tallahassee, Fla.
