        Karl Laufkotter, a tenor who sang at the Metropolitan Opera in the late 1930's and early 40's, died on Dec. 14 at his home in Ojai, Calif. He was 93.
        Edyth Wagner, a friend, notified The New York Times about his death in a letter that arrived yesterday.
        Mr. Laufkotter was born in Dusseldorf, Germany. He sang with companies in Berlin and Stuttgart and then internationally from 1923 to 1950, specializing in German opera. He was engaged by the Metropolitan in 1936 and was a leading lyric tenor there for a decade, touring nationally and internationally with the company. His most celebrated role was Mime in Wagner's "Siegfried."
        Mr. Laufkotter's other roles at the Metropolitan included Vashek in "The Bartered Bride," Narraboth in "Salome," Walther in "Tannhauser," Valzacchi in "Der Rosenkavalier," Monostatos in "The Magic Flute" and Jacquino in "Fidelio." After retiring from opera, he toured the United States doing recitals.
        He also taught singing from the early 1940's to the late 70's at Adelphi University in New York City and at the University of Southern California, among other institutions. He was named to the advisory council of the Lauritz Melchior Heldentenor Foundation in 1965.
        He is survived by a daughter, Eva Bracken of Santa Barbara, Calif., two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, all of San Diego.
