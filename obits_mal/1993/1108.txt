        Richard J. Furgatch, an insurance executive in New York for 37 years died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Furgatch was chairman and chief executive officer of the P.S.M. Insurance Companies, underwriters of commercial real estate in the New York metropolitan area, with headquarters in Manhattan. He had been chief executive since 1977.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Furgatch graduated from Rutgers University and started his career as an agent for Equitable Life, where he achieved million-dollar sales figures in the 1960's. In 1968, he joined Public Service Mutual in its underwriting division and held various management positions before he was named chairman and chief executive.
        He volunteered as a fund-raiser for, among others, United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, State of Israel Bonds and the National Conference of Christians and Jews, which presented him with a Brotherhood Award five years ago.
        Mr. Furgatch is survived by his wife, Audrey Spellman Furgatch; a daughter, Lisa, and a son, Andrew, all residents of Manhattan.
