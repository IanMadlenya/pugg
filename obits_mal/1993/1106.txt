        Kenneth P. Landon, a former Federal official and a specialist on Southeast Asia, died on Wednesday in the Hermitage, a retirement home in Alexandria, Va. He was 90.
        He died of cancer, his son William said.
        Mr. Landon was director of the Center for South and Southeast Asian Studies at American University, in Washington, from 1965 to 1974, when he retired.
        He worked as an adviser to the National Security Council in the Eisenhower Administration. From 1943 to 1955, Mr. Landon was a specialist in Southeast Asian affairs for the State Department, studying and writing about the effects of Western religion on what was then Burma and Siam, now Myanmar and Thailand.
        He was born in Meadville, Pa., and after graduating from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1927, he set out with his wife, Margaret, to work as a Presbyterian missionary in southern Siam, where they remained for 10 years. His wife used her experiences there to write "Anna and the King of Siam," from which the musical "The King and I" was adapted.
        Mr. Landon was the author of three books about Southeast Asia, in which he contended that Western religious thought, although a strong influence on the region, had been woven into the traditional spiritualism in much the same way Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism had before it. In 1953, he was awarded the second class of the Exalted Order of the White Elephant, one of the highest awards given to foreigners by the Thai Government.
        In addition to his wife of 67 years, Mr. Landon is survived by two daughters, Margaret Schoenherr of Palos Heights, Ill., and Carol Pearson of Clinton, S.C.; two sons, Kenneth of Washington, and William of Bellevue, Wash.; 13 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.
