        William T. Stansbury, a retired official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, died on Sunday at a hospital in the Philadelphia suburb of Springfield, Pa. He was 84 and lived in Springfield.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Born in Media, Pa., he graduated from Howard University in 1932 and earned a law degree at Temple University. He began his career in the real estate and insurance business with firms in the Philadelphia area.
        Mr. Stansbury then began a 25-year career with the Government in Washington and Philadelphia, where he started in 1952 as regional intergroup-relations adviser for what was then the Federal Housing Administration. In that capacity he worked with minority groups, government agencies and private organizations to overcome discrimination and develop housing legislation that would insure equality for minorities. Won Service Award
        For his work coordinating agency operations on urban renewal and housing projects he received the agency's Distinguished Service Award.
        Transferring to Washington in 1963, he helped organize the agency's international division, which was involved in housing projects overseas under foreign aid programs, and served as its director.
        Mr. Stansbury returned to Philadelphia in 1966 as assistant regional administrator. Two years later, he was placed in charge of administering the operations of regional offices in Delaware, Washington, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia. He retired in 1977.
        Mr. Stansbury is survived by his wife, Armenia White Stansbury; a nephew, William D. Waynes, and a step-granddaughter.
