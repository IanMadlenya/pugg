        Albert J. Smith, who while mayor of Skokie, Ill., a heavily Jewish suburb of Chicago, led efforts to prevent neo-Nazis from parading on Hitler's birthday in 1977, died at his home there on Tuesday at 78.
        He had cancer, a funeral home spokesman said.
        Mr. Smith, a commodity trader, held the part-time post of mayor for 12 years until retiring at the end of 1977.
        Earlier that year the National Socialist Party of America, a neo-Nazi group, sought to march in Skokie, infuriating residents, especially the village's many Holocaust survivors.
        Mayor Smith, a Roman Catholic, led efforts to thwart the march, using a village ordinance prohibiting the display of Nazi uniforms and the distribution of material deemed offensive.
        The parade applicants went to Federal court and, backed by civil liberties groups, won the right to march. Mr. Smith then supported a move by Jewish groups to hold a counterdemonstration. In the end, the Nazis dropped their plans for a march.
        Mr. Smith, who was born in Chicago and grew up in Evanston, Ill., was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame. He inherited his father's seat on the Chicago Board of Trade and was a soybean broker for 42 years until retiring in 1979.
        A civic leader, he helped organize the Skokie Caucus Party, which in the late 1950's oversaw Skokie's transition to a village-manager form of government. He was elected a trustee in 1959 and mayor in 1965.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Angela Nadolny; a daughter, Mary Bridget Jennings of Chicago; a son, Albert Jr., of Milwaukee, and four grandchildren.
