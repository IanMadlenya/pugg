        Kenneth E. Oberholtzer, an educator who crusaded for the modernization of the nation's public schools, died last Friday at the Kaiser Hospital in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 89.
        His family said the cause was pneumonia.
        Dr. Oberholtzer was superintendent of schools in Long Beach, Calif., for 10 years before becoming superintendent of schools in Denver in 1947. In his 20 years in Denver he was widely credited with uniting competing interests within the city to create more funds for the schools.
        In speeches throughout the city, Dr. Oberholtzer described the faults of Denver's impoverished schools and repeatedly asked parents and other taxpayers one question: "Does it matter to you?" His efforts led to the overwhelming adoption of a bond issue that paid for the building of new schools and the refurbishing of existing buildings. Flexible Curriculum Favored
        He then turned his attention to the curriculum, emphasizing a solid general education but one that was flexible enough to allow students to explore a variety of subjects.
        His work in upgrading the Denver schools came as public education in the United States was perceived as rapidly declining in quality. In 1951, Dr. Oberholtzer was one of 20 prominent educators who said national security was endangered by inadequate support for public schools.
        He also insisted that tax money be used only for public schools. A dual system of public and private schools, he said, is "divisive."
        Dr. Oberholtzer was president of the American Association of School Administrators in the early 1950's. He graduated from the University of Illinois and received his doctorate from Columbia University. He retired to Danville, Calif., in 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, and three sisters, Esther Fuller of Arroyo Grande, Calif., Helen Oberholtzer of Houston and Louise Walker of Stanford, Calif.
