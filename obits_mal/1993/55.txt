        Kim Foltz, a reporter and columnist for The New York Times, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 44.
        Mr. Foltz, a resident of Manhattan, died of AIDS. After he learned he had the virus that causes AIDS, he wrote about his experiences as a man infected with H.I.V. in an article for The Times Magazine on Jan. 5, 1992.
        A journalism graduate of the University of Utah, Mr. Foltz started his career as an associate editor and writer at Gentlemen's Quarterly. In 1980 he joined Newsweek magazine, where he worked as a business writer before moving to Adweek five years later, advancing to national editor in 1987.
        Mr. Foltz joined the staff of The Times in October 1989 as a reporter for the media department. He later wrote a daily advertising column and feature articles on advertising.
        He is survived by his companion, James N. Baker; his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. G. Foltz of Midville, Utah; a sister, Karen St. Clair, and a brother, Craig Foltz, both of Salt Lake City.
