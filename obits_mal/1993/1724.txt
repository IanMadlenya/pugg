        David Fisch, a decorative-arts painter and muralist, died on Friday, at his home in Manhattan. He was 43.
        The cause was AIDS, said Nancy Blechman, a friend.
        Mr. Fisch was born in Brooklyn and attended the University of Chicago. From 1978 to 1991, he was commissioned to work as a painter and muralist on more than 30 residential and commercial projects.
        His work appeared in Architectural Digest, House Beautiful, HG and Interiors and in a number of books. A one-man show of his work, entitled "Va Pensiero, paintings in oil, reflections on the AIDS crisis 1983-1992," was on exhibit earlier this year at the Derek Danton Gallery in Manhattan.
        Mr. Fisch was the co-founder of the Living Room meal program of the People with AIDS Coalition and cooked for the program for many years.
        His survivors include his brother, Robert, and his sister, Judy.
