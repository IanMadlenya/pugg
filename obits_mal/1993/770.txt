        James Beecher Stuart, former president of the Kinney Shoe Corporation and a director of the F. W. Woolworth Company, died on Saturday at the Medical Center of Princeton. He was 83 and lived in Hightstown, N.J., after being a longtime resident of Short Hills, N.J.
        The cause was heart failure, said a spokeswoman for the Glackin/Saul Funeral Home in Hightstown.
        Starting out as a shoe salesman for Kinney in 1927, Mr. Stuart rose to become general sales manager in 1957, executive vice president in charge of merchandise in 1965 and president in 1968. Retiring in 1974, he remained on the board of directors of what is now the Woolworth Corporation, parent company of Kinney.
        Kinney's successful Foot Locker chain of athletic shoe stores was begun during Mr. Stuart's presidency.
        Mr. Stuart was born in Chicago and attended the University of Minnesota.
        He was a ruling elder in the Wyoming Presbyterian Church in Millburn, N.J., and a former president of the Millburn/Short Hills Art Center.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Caroline Evans; a sister, Dorothy Stuart Boulware of Clemson, S.C.; three sons, all Presbyterian ministers, the Rev. Robert B. Stuart of Amagansett, N.Y., the Rev. Dr. Laird J. Stuart of Pittsburgh and the Rev. Bruce D. Stuart of New Malden, England; a daughter, Diane Westman of Evergreen, Colo.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
