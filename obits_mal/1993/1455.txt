        Oleg Pomerantzeff, a biomedical engineer and physicist at the Schepens Eye Research Institute in Boston who developed several innovative optical instruments and devices, died last Thursday in Toulouse, France. He was 83 and lived in Brookline, Mass.
        His family said the cause was heart failure.
        During his 33 years at the institute, Dr. Pomerantzeff invented an indirect binocular ophthalmoscope, which advanced retinal surgery by providing a three-dimensional perspective within the eye.
        He also developed devices that provide a 180-degree image of the retina, a laser scanner that gives a high resolution video image of the interior of the eye, and a laser used to halt bleeding in retinal blood vessels.
        Dr. Pomerantzeff is survived by his wife, Eugenia; three daughters, Marina Krivcove, of Staten Island, Irina Pomerantzeff, of Hoboken, N.J., and Anne Bohsack, of Sudbury, Mass.; a son, Andre Pomerantzeff of St. Petersburg, Fla.; a stepson, Peter Simeonides, of Toulouse; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
