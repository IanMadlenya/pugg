        Philip Pacy Cohen, a pioneer in the study of human metabolism and a former department head at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, died on Monday at a nursing home in Portland, Ore. He was 85.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his daughter, Julie Cohen Anderson.
        Dr. Cohen started his research while working as a National Research Council Fellow at the University of Sheffield in England in 1938, under Sir Hans Krebs, who later won the Nobel Prize for his research of the human digestive process.
        He joined the University of Wisconsin Medical School's department of physiological chemistry in 1941 and became chairman of the department in 1948, holding the post until 1975.
        He served as acting dean of the medical school from 1961 to 1963. Explaining Starvation
        His research centered on the way the human body converts ammonia into urea for passage out of the digestive system and contributed to the understanding of acidosis caused by diabetes. It also provided an explanation of the body's functions during fasting or as a result of starvation.
        His work led to the creation of a phylogenetic tree in the late 1960's in which animals were classified by the way in which they converted nitrogen into urea after digestion.
        Dr. Cohen published more than 200 scientific papers. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and lectured at universities in Japan, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Korea and Spain.
        He was born in Derry, N.H., and received his bachelor's degree from Tufts University. He earned both his medical degree and a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.
        His wife, the former Rubye H. Tepper, died last year.
        In addition to his daughter, of Lake Oswego, Ore., Dr. Cohen is survived by three sons, Philip, of San Francisco, David, of Fond du Lac, Wisc., and Milton, of Portland, Ore.
