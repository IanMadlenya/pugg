        Gustave E. Wiedenmayer, who spent 44 years with Midlantic Banks Inc. and helped build it into New Jersey's biggest bank holding company, died on Sunday at his home in Dorset, Vt. He was 85 and also had a home in Boca Raton, Fla.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wiedenmayer graduated from Dartmouth College in 1929 and that year joined what was then the National Newark and Essex Bank as a trainee. He was promoted to vice president by 1944, became president in 1961 and chairman and chief executive in 1970. He retired in 1973.
        The bank dates to 1804, when it started with a staff of four and first-day deposits of $4,000. Under his guidance, it grew into a $1.6 billion statewide holding company, then the state's largest. From Brewery to Ice Cream
        From 1957 to 1985 he was also board chairman of the Faber-Castell Corporation in Parsippany, N.J., office suppliers and the world's biggest maker of pencils.
        He was born in Newark, the site of the old Wiedenmayer Brewery, a family business established in 1880 when Newark was the country's beer capital. The company turned to ice cream and other dairy products during Prohibition. The family sold that business in the 1950's to Foremost Dairies and bought control of Faber-Castell, established in 1843 as the American branch of a German nobleman's company of that name.
        Mr. Wiedenmayer, who was active in civic affairs, was a founding member of the Newark Boys Club. He was also treasurer of the Episcopal Diocese of Newark.
        His first wife, Margaret Morse Wiedenmayer, died in 1972.
        He is survived by his wife of 19 years, Mary Winslow Kennett; two daughters, Margaret Smith of Mill Neck, N.Y., and Cary Smallhorn of Beverly Farms, Mass.; a son, Christopher M., of Bernardsville, N.J; six grandchildren, one great-grandchild, and three stepchildren.
