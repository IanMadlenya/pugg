        Steele L. Winterer, a retired New York carpet manufacturer, died on Sunday at the Moorings Park Health Center in Naples, Fla. He was 88.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, said his son, Philip S. Winterer.
        Mr. Winterer was the president and chief executive officer of A. & M. Karagheusian in Manhattan, one of the nation's largest carpet manufacturers. The company was acquired by J. P. Stevens & Company, and Mr. Winterer retired in 1969. He was a longtime resident of Short Hills, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, Esther, of Naples; one son, Philip, of Manhattan; a daughter, Mary Anne McNally of Montreal, and six grandchildren.
