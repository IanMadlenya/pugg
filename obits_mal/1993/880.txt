        Ian Thomas, a couturier for Queen Elizabeth, died on June 2, The Times of London reported last week. He was 64.
        He died in the Princess Grace Hospital in London after heart surgery.
        The Queen awarded Mr. Thomas a Royal Warrant as a dressmaker in 1973 and, as another British newspaper, The Independent, put it recently, she and "many members of society appreciated the restrained and understated elegance of his clothes."
        For Prince Charles's wedding to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, the Queen wore a dress, coat and hat by Mr. Thomas in bright aquamarine crepe de chine.
        In 1976, Mr. Thomas let it be known that he had a rackful of three-year-old garments belonging to the Queen, who he said wanted the hems let down. He also reported that the Queen had bought silk culottes for at-home evenings, which he called "quite a breakthrough" in her approach to fashion.
        Mr. Thomas was born in Middle Barton, Oxfordshire. He studied fashion at the Oxford College of Art and was personal assistant to the couturier Norman Hartnell -- whose clientele also included the Queen -- from 1953 to 1970. In that year Mr. Thomas opened his own business.
