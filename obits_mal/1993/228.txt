        Dr. Robert L. Pekarsky, a dentist and expert on dental litigation, died on Thursday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, his family said. He was 70 years old and lived on the Upper East Side.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Ellen.
        Dr. Pekarsky, an instructor at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, wrote a book on dental practice for trial lawyers and was an expert in plaintiff and defendant litigation practices.
        In 1978, he led a class-action suit against Hawaii's State Board of Dental Examiners charging racial discrimination against Caucasians who applied for licenses to practice dentistry in the state. Dr. Pekarsky, who had an apartment in Hawaii but lived most of the year in Manhattan, failed a licensing test twice and contended that it was because of his race.
        The suit was settled out of court for $325,000 in 1980, but also led the Hawaiian government to agree in 1979 to shift the licensing exam's grading system so that board members could not determine an applicant's identity.
        Dr. Pekarsky, a graduate of the University of Rochester and Case Western Reserve School of Dentistry, served as an oral surgeon in the United States Army in Korea during the Korean War.
        He was an oral surgeon at the Park Avenue Hospital in Rochester from 1949 to 1973, and later had a private practice in Manhattan. He had numerous teaching, consulting and hospital appointments.
        In addition to his wife, whom he married 42 years ago, Dr. Pekarsky is survived by a daughter, Donna Ann, also of Manhattan.
