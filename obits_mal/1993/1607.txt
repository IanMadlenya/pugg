        Louis Banks, a former managing editor of Fortune magazine and former editorial director of Time Inc., died on Sunday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 77.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, Fortune said in a statement issued yesterday.
        Mr. Banks started at Time in 1945 as a correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau. He was chief editor of Fortune from 1965 to 1970 and, as editorial director from 1970 to 1973, he held the second highest editorial position at Time Inc.
        He helped launch a number of new ventures, most notably Money magazine. He retired as a member of the corporate board in 1987 when he reached the age of 70.
        Mr. Banks was born in Pittsburgh and raised in Southern California, where he graduated in economics from U.C.L.A. During World War II, he served as a Navy pilot in the Pacific with the rank of lieutenant.
        In 1969 he took a sabbatical to study at Harvard University as a Nieman Research Fellow. He returned to Time Inc. when he was offered the editorial director's post along with a seat on the company's board.
        In 1973 he became a visiting professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Business Administration.
        Mr. Banks is survived by his wife, Mary Campbell Banks; four sons, Robert L., William C. and Theodore R.; a daughter, Margaret Banks Czekaj, and eight grandchildren.
