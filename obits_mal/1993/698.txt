        John Rouse Webster, a retired headmaster of Greenwich Country Day School in Greenwich, Conn., died on Friday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 89.
        The cause was an aneurism of the heart, his family said.
        Mr. Webster headed Greenwich Country Day, a coeducational independent school, from 1943 until he retired in 1969. Successive editions of "The Handbook of Private Schools," an annual descriptive survey of independent schools, have emphasized the growth of the school under his leadership.
        He was also for some years a trustee of the International College in Beirut, a secondary school founded by American missionaries in 1891. In addition, he headed the Allendale School in Rochester from 1937 to 1943 and taught at the Calvert School in Baltimore from 1924 to 1937.
        His wife of 30 years, the former Betty Van Voorhees, died in 1975.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Mary Ragan Adams, whom he married in 1979; a daughter, Betty Webster Bullard of Sandwich, N.H.; three stepsons, Bruce Adams of Bethesda, Md., Macgill Adams of Anchorage, and Charles Kimball of Boca Raton, Fla.; three stepdaughters, Mary Ragan Adamsof Fort Collins, Colo.; Susie Sugar of Lincoln, Mass., and Louise Ames of Manhattan, and 15 grandchldren.
