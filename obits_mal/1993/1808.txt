        Sam Wanamaker, the American actor-director who campaigned to rebuild Shakespeare's Globe Theater on the banks of the Thames, died yesterday at his home in London. He was 74 years old.
        He had suffered from cancer for five years, his family told Reuters.
        Mr. Wanamaker devoted much of his last 20 years to a crusade to see a replica of the wooden open-air theater rebuilt on the site where Shakespeare produced some of his greatest plays. But despite facing apathy from the British Government, Mr. Wanamaker raised more than $10 million for the project, which is due for completion next spring.
        Mr. Wanamaker, who was born in Seattle, began his acting career in Chicago, then broke in on Broadway in classical stage roles in 1942. In 1946, Mr. Wanamaker starred with Ingrid Bergman in the Maxwell Anderson play, "Joan of Lorraine," and he directed "Two Gentlemen from Athens" the next year.
        Moving to London in the 1950's, he directed the play, "Children from Their Games," in 1962, and for the next two decades, he was one of the most active producers, directors and actors in the British theater.
        Mr. Wanamaker made his film debut in "My Girl Tisa" in 1948.
        His film credits also include "The Concrete Jungle" (1962), "The Spy Who Came in From the Cold" (1965), "Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965)" and "Private Benjamin (1980)." In the 1970's, he directed episodes of such television series as "Colombo" and "Hawaii 5-0."
        In April, Mr. Wanamaker oversaw the first production in the half-built Globe Theater, which is scheduled for completion by Shakespeare's 430th birthday, in April 1994.
        He is survived by his wife, Charlotte, and three daughters, Abby, Jessica and Zoe Wanamaker, an actress, The Associated Press reported.
