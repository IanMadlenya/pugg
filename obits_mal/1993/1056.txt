        R. Arnold Kramer, managing partner of a Knoxville law firm and former general counsel to the Aluminum Company of America, died Wednesday at the University of Tennessee Hospital in Knoxville. He was 74 and lived in Knoxville.
        His son, Reed Kramer, said the cause was complications from a stroke.
        Mr. Kramer, whose father, grandfather, two uncles and brother were practicing lawyers, helped his father establish a law firm in 1948, now known as Kramer, Rayson, Leake, Rodgers & Morgan. For many years, the firm has represented the United Mine Workers of America as well as Alcoa's large Tennessee operations.
        As a director and general counsel, and eventually executive vice president of Alcoa, he presided over a large expansion of the company's legal department. He retired in 1984.
        Mr. Kramer was born in Maryville, Tenn. A graduate of Maryville College, he received his law degree from the University of Michigan in 1946.
        He was a chairman of the American Judicature Society and a life member of the Sixth Circuit Judicial Conference.
        Besides his son Reed of Durham, N.C., he is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Sara Lee Hellums; a daughter, Lynne Kramer D'Huyvetter of Marietta, Ga.; another son, Randall of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a sister, Emma Jane White of North Ridge, Calif.; a brother, Frank of Pittsburgh, and eight grandchildren.
