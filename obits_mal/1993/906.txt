        Martin Greene, a retired lawyer, state labor official and professor, died on Tuesday at his daughter's home in Belchertown, Mass. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan until he moved to Belchertown a few months ago.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Greene was appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Labor Relations Board and by Gov. Malcolm Wilson to the State Workers' Compensation Board.
        He also worked as an assistant state attorney general, an arbitrator and a labor relations hearing officer for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. And he taught at Pace University and New York Law School.
        Surviving are his wife of 58 years, the former Pauline Bressner; two daughters, Joan Greene of Manhattan and Ljuba Marsh of Belchertown; two brothers, Stanley, of Convent Station, N.J., and Frank, of Toms River, N.J., and two grandchildren.
