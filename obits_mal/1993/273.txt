        Stephen Augustine, a vice president of Bloomingdale's, died on Friday at New York University Hospital. He was 35 and lived in New York City.
        Friends said the cause was heart failure.
        Mr. Augustine had worked his way up in the clothing store business, beginning as a trainee at Bullock's in 1979.
        He became a department manager, a division manager and, in 1982, a buyer. He was made a junior divisional merchandise manager in 1987. In 1988, he joined Bloomingdale's as vice president and divisional merchandise manager.
        Mr. Augustine graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the State University of New York at Binghamton and attended the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        He is survived by his mother, June Augustine, and a brother, Charles Augustine, both of New York.
