        Rabbi Maurice Davis, the retired senior rabbi of the Jewish Community Center of White Plains and an authority on religious cults in the United States, died Tuesday at his home in Palm Coast, Fla. He was 72.
        The cause of death was complications from a stroke, said Jane Friedberg of the Jewish Community Center.
        In 1972, Rabbi Davis founded a group named Citizens Engaged in Reuniting Families. Its aim was to counsel children who had joined unorthodox religious groups to return to their families.
        Rabbi Davis testified before legislative groups about the hazards of cults and wrote extensively about their dangers to American society.
        A graduate of the University of Cincinnati and the Hebrew Union College, Rabbi Davis served in religious capacities in Cincinnati, Lexington, Ky., and Indianapolis before becoming the senior rabbi of the Jewish Community Center in White Plains in 1967. He became the congregation's rabbi emeritus in 1987 and retired to Palm Coast, Fla.
        He is survived by his wife, Marion Cronbach Davis of Palm Coast; two sons, Rabbi Jay R. Davis of Vero Beach, Fla., and Rabbi Michael A. Davis of Fort Pierce, Fla.; three siblings, Carlie Zimmerman, Hannah Feibelman and Albert Davis, all of Cranston, R.I., and three grandchildren.
