        Walter F. Blaine, a New York investment banker, died on Friday at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 96 and lived in Sea Girt, N.J.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Blaine, a native of Staten Island, took courses in finance at New York University and Pace University before going to work with Goldman, Sachs & Company in 1919 as a clerk. He was elected a general partner of the firm in 1942. His area of responsibility was the syndicate department, which steers security offerings through a national and international network of other firms in the industry. He also served on the management committee.
        A limited partner since 1969, he endowed a Walter F. Blaine scholarship fund at that time to help sons and daughters of Goldman, Sachs employees with their education. He also served on the board of governors of the New York Stock Exchange from 1955 until 1961 and was a past governor of the Jersey Shore Medical Center.
        His wife, the former Mona Lewis, died in 1976.
        He is survived by a daughter, Phyllis Blaine of Sea Girt; a sister, Lucy Blaine of Staten Island; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
