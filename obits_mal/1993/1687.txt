        John P. McCormally, editor of The Hutchinson (Kan.) News when it won a Pulitzer Prize for meritorious public service in 1965, died on Wednesday at his home in Burlington, Iowa. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. McCormally, who served in the Kansas Legislature from 1947 to 1949, was the editor of the newspaper when it won the Pulitzer for news articles and editorials on the apportionment of the Legislature.
        He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1949 and 1950, and later served as a Pulitzer Prize juror. He retired from journalism in 1989.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy, five sons, two daughters and nine grandchildren.
