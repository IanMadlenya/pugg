        Walker O. Cain, an award-winning architect whose designs included a Manhattan cathedral and a Smithsonian museum, died Tuesday at his home in Southhampton, L.I. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Elizabeth.
        Recognition came early to Mr. Cain, who was born in Cleveland. He held the Trustees' Scholarship at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland for five years, and the Schweinfurth Scholarship at Fontainebleau, France, during 1937.
        In 1939 he won the Henry Adams Prize of the American Institute of Architects, and was a finalist in the Paris Prize competition the same year.
        In 1938 and 1939, he won honorable mention in architecture in the competition for the Rome Prize of the American Academy in Rome.
        Then, in 1940, while a candidate for a master's degree in fine arts at Princeton University, Mr. Cain won the Rome Prize. After moving to New York City, he served as chairman of the board of the American Academy in Rome from 1974 to 1984.
        During those years he was an associate of the firm McKim, Meade & White. Later, he was a senior partner of Walker O. Cain Associates, a New York architecture firm.
        Among Mr. Cain's most notable buildings are St. Vartan Cathedral, the Armenian church at Second Ave. and 34th Street; the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology, in Washington; and the Jadwin Gymnasium and Computer Center at Princeton.
        In the 1970's, when Venice seemed threatened by the pollution caused by modern industry, Mr. Cain became chairman of the New York chapter of Save Venice, Inc.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Susan Gould of Reno, Nev., and Tamma Cain of New Milford, Conn., and a stepdaughter, Hollister Houghton of Boca Grande, Fla.
