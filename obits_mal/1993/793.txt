        Bernard Evslin, a playwright, screenwriter and mythologist from New Rochelle, N.Y., died on June 4 in Kauai, Hawaii. He was 77.
        He died of cardiac arrest while swimming in a pool, said his wife, Dorothy.
        In 1959, his comedy "The Geranium Hat" was well received on Broadway, but three years later his play "Step on a Crack" starring Rita Hayworth closed after only one performance at the Ethel Barrymore Theater. "Nightmares," Mr. Evslin said later, "are the penalty for dreams."
        Mr. Evslin then wrote for the movies, and eventually described his experiences as a screenwriter in a novel, "The Merchants of Venus."
        In 1967, Mr. Evslin turned to mythology, and wrote a number of books that are widely used in schools. In 1986 his book "Hercules" won the Washington Irving Children's Book Choice Award of the Westchester Library Association. "Heroes, Gods and Monsters of the Greek Myths" for young readers was also well received.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Evslin is survived by two sons, Lee, of Hawaii, and Tom, of Seattle; two daughters, Pamela Zino of Walkill, N.Y., and Janet Clinton of Clinton Corners, N.Y., and 14 grandchildren.
