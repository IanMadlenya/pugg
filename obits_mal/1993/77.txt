        Bruce King, a dancer, choreographer and teacher, died on Friday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS-related lymphoma, said Robert Herbert, a friend.
        Mr. King was born in Oakland, Calif., and studied at the University of California at Berkeley, and New York University. He also studied with Merce Cunningham, Hanya Holm, Martha Graham and Alwin Nikolais in New York.
        Mr. King performed with several modern-dance companies, including Mr. Cunningham's from 1955 to 1959, and presented solo and group works with his own Bruce King Dance Company in the 1970's. Over the years, he taught at Adelphi University and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, was artist in residence at many colleges and participated in many education projects.
        There are no immediate survivors.
