        Forrest A. Hainline Jr., a former automobile industry executive and longtime national and international tennis official, died yesterday at a hospital in Stuart, Fla., where he lived. He was 74.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Hainline's career began in 1948 when he joined the Detroit law firm Cross, Rock, Miller & Vieson, which represented the American Motors Corporation. He became the automaker's general counsel and vice president in 1971 and later added the title of corporate secretary. He helped negotiate the contract for American's merger with Renault. American was later bought by Chrysler. Mr. Hainline retired in 1984.
        A lifelong tennis player and fan, he served in many posts regulating the sport and helped redefine its distinction between amateur and professional.
        He was the chairman of the International Tennis Federation's Rules Committee from 1987 to 1990, the United States Tennis Association's Grievance Committee from 1970 to 1985 and its Constitution and Rules Committee from 1983 to 1986.
        He was also a director of the Men's International Professional Tennis Council from 1985 to 1987 and its arbitrator from 1977 to 1985.
        Surviving are his wife of 47 years, the former Nora Schrot; four sons, Forrest 4th, of Chevy Chase, Md., Jon, of Miami, Brian, of Queens, and David, of Annandale, Va.; three daughters, Patricia McKinley of Princeton, N.J., Judith Zeder of Miami and Nora Gates of Hampton, Va., and 13 grandchildren.
