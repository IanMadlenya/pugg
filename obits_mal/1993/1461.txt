        Vincent A. Kleinfeld, a lawyer in Washington who specialized in food and drug law, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 87 and had lived in Palm Beach since he retired last year.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Jane Fink.

Six years later he was appointed head of the general regulations unit of the criminal division of the Department of Justice.

        In 1951, he took a year's leave to be chief counsel for a select committee in the House of Representatives that investigated the use of chemicals in foods and cosmetics. His work contributed to the creation of laws in 1954 and 1958 that regulated food additives and the manufacture of pesticides. Adjunct Professor of Law
        Mr. Kleinfeld left Government service in 1953 and was a founder of Kleinfeld, Kaplan & Becker in Washington, one of the first practices devoted to food and drug law. During his years with the Justice Department and at the law firm, he was also an adjunct professor of food and drug law at the New York University School of Law and at the George Washington University School of Law.
        Born in New York City, he graduated from the City College of New York and received his law degree in 1929 from Columbia University.
