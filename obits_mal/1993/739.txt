        Stephen Van Rensselaer, a retired vice president of Citibank, died on Sunday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 88 and lived in Locust Valley, L.I.
        His wife, Lillie, said he had had a long illness.
        Mr. Van Rensselaer began his banking career in 1928 as a clerk with the First National Bank of the City of New York. He became manager of the credit department and then vice president, a post he held from 1953 to 1955.
        In 1955, the First National merged with the National City Bank of New York and Mr. Van Rensselaer remained a vice president of what then became the First National City Bank of New York, now known as Citibank.
        He retired in 1970 and devoted his later years to business consulting and private investments.
        Mr. Van Rensselaer, a native New Yorker, graduated from Harvard in 1928.
        He served on the board of governors of the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine of the New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, L.I. He was also a former president of the New York chapter of Robert Morris Associates, the national association of bank credit officials.
        Besides his wife, the former Lillie Langstroth, he is survived by a son, Stephen Van Rensselaer Jr. of Warren, R.I.
