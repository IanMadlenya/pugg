        Nicholas Kounovsky, a physical-fitness teacher who introduced European-style gymnastics to Americans and others, died on Friday at the Tolstoy Center in Valley Cottage, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.
        Born to Russian parents in Odessa, Mr. Kounovsky arrived in New York in 1940. He established gymnasiums in Manhattan, West Hampton Beach, L.I., and Hollywood, and trained a whole generation of instructors who then set up exercise studios across the country.
        He came to this country from Paris, where he studied aeronautics and trained as a gymnast. With his knowledge of engineering and fitness, he devised a system of exercise that divides the movements of the body into six basic factors of fitness -- endurance, suppleness, balance, strength, speed and skill or coordination. He called it "sixometry."
        He counted among his clientele prominent people from the worlds of business, politics, stage and screen, and fashion models by the hundreds. He sold his studios in 1977.
        He was the author of many magazine articles and three books, including "Instant Fitness: How to Stay Fit & Healthy in Six Minutes a Day" and "The Joy of Feeling Fit," which was published in seven languages.
        Mr. Kounovsky is survived by his wife of 58 years, Galina; a son, Nicholas Jr. of Norfolk, Va.; a daughter, Kyra West of Martha's Vineyard; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
