        In recent years he studied the treatment of disabled people in Soviet and Eastern Europe and was the coeditor of "The Disabled in the Soviet Union" (University of Pittsburgh, 1989). He was afflicted by progressive deafness in recent years and produced and appeared in a 1992 film on deafness, "Ben's Bridge."
