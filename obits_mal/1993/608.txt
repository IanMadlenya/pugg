        Howard Young, a producer of plays and musicals for Broadway, national tours and the Sacramento Music Circus, of which he was a founder, died on Monday at the Pleasant Care Convalescent Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 81.
        With his partner of many years, Russell Lewis, Mr. Young produced 8 shows on Broadway and 27 for national tours from 1945 to 1951. Among their Broadway productions were revivals of Noel Coward's "Tonight at 8:30," with Gertrude Lawrence; "Lady Windermere's Fan," with Cornelia Otis Skinner, and "The Desert Song." Their Broadway credits also include two plays by John Patrick, "The Trial of Mary Surratt" and "The Curious Savage."
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Young and Mr. Lewis founded the Sacramento Music Circus, for which they produced more than 300 shows in Sacramento and Fresno, Calif., over more than four decades.
        Mr. Young was a native of Chicago, and moved to California to attend the University of California at Los Angeles, at first intending to enter corporate law.
        He is survived by his wife, Charlotte; three daughters, Leslie Connor of Hailey, Idaho; Deborah Takikawa of Santa Ynez, Calif., and Erica Holten of Seattle, and five grandchildren.
