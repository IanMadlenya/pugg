        Edgar P. Berry, who was a leading plastic surgeon and a former president of the New York County Medical Society, died on Monday at a nursing home in Sandwich, Mass. He was 78.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, his family said.

        He was president of the medical society in 1973 when it took the unusual steps to investigate assertions that Dr. Max Jacobson had injected politically and socially prominent patients with amphetamines, enzymes and vitamins. Dr. Berry said at the time, "The eyes of the medical nation are upon us." Eventually state officials revoked Dr. Jacobson's license to practice. In Navy Medical Corps
