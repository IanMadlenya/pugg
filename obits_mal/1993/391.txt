        William P. Bohus, an import company executive, died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center at the age of 57. He lived in Manhattan.
        He had prostate cancer, his family said.
        Since 1986 he had been the president of Shalimar, a Manhattan company specializing in imported gloves. Earlier in the 1980's, he was the president of Ticket World, a company selling entertainment tickets at computerized booths that was bought out by Ticketmaster. For several years before that he worked for Revlon as a regional vice president.
        In 1992 Mr. Bohus appeared as a witness on a crucial piece of evidence at the second trial of Carolyn Warmus for the 1989 murder of her boyfriend's wife, Betty Jeanne Solomon. The prosecution charged that Ms. Warmus left a bloodstained glove, the only physical evidence linking her to the scene of the crime. A police photograph showed a glove near the body.
        But the glove was not produced at the first trial, which ended in a hung jury. Before the second trial, the dead woman's husband, Paul Solomon, said he had found the left-hand black cashmere glove at his house. Testimony at Trial
        Mr. Bohus testified that Shalimar imported 9,000 pairs of gloves of that brand, style and color for various stores. Filene's records showed that Ms. Warmus bought gloves of that brand and style in 1987.
        Defense lawyers, disputing that the glove in evidence belonged to her and was the one in the photograph, called Mr. Bohus to show that other people could have owned and used the glove. Ms. Warmus was convicted.
        Mr. Bohus was born in Trenton. He was a captain in the Marine Corps. After graduating from Rutgers University, he earned master's degrees in business at Rutgers and at Columbia.
        Surviving are two sisters, Evelyn Tomo of Pittsburgh and Pauline Bohus of Trenton, and a brother, Emil, of Medford, N.J.
