        Emanuel Zacchini Sr., who with his four brothers made a career out of performing a circus human cannonball act, died on Monday in Sarasota, Fla., where he lived. He was 84.
        Mr. Zacchini's 175-foot cannonball jump at 54 miles an hour in 1940 was a world record and made the act famous. Mr. Zacchini ended his jumping career after suffering a broken neck in an accident in 1951.
        Born in Italy, he was brought to the United States in 1934 by John Ringling, the circus owner. He started the cannonball act four years later with his brothers Mario, Teo, Bruno and Vittorio.
        In addition to Mario and Vittorio, survivors include two daughters, Flora Pfefferkorn and Delia Cristiani; nine grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
