        He suffered a massive heart attack after finishing a day's work at United Nations headquarters, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Toombs joined NBC News in 1961, originally as a news writer, then went on to work in Southeast Asia and at NBC's bureau in Beirut.
        In the 1980's he was a field producer in the northeastern United States. He became an editor on NBC's foreign desk in Manhattan before taking early retirement in 1990. Afterward he worked at the United Nations under contract to NBC.
        Mr. Toombs was born in Meriden, Conn. After studying at the University of Connecticut, he worked as a reporter for The Hartford Courant and as an editor at the London headquarters of the Reuters news agency.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Pechar, to whom he was married in 1991; a daughter by an earlier marriage, Siobhan, and a brother, David.
