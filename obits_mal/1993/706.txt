        Tom Prideaux, a former senior editor of Life magazine and author of several books on theater, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, said Joseph Kastner, a colleague.
        Mr. Prideaux began writing theater reviews for Life in 1938, when the magazine was two years old. He went on to become entertainment editor, retiring in 1970.
        His best known book, "Love or Nothing," (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1976) is a biography of Ellen Terry, the self-taught English actress who made eight successful tours to the United States.  He was also author of "World Theatre in Pictures; From Ancient Times to Modern Broadway" (Greenberg, 1954).
        He was born in Hillsdale, Mich., and graduated in 1930 from Yale, where he was editor of the Yale Literary Magazine and class poet.
        He is survived by two cousins, the actor Jason Robards of Southport, Conn., and Gary Hicks of Grand Rapids, Mich.
