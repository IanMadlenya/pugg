        Kenneth G. Hancock, director of the National Science Foundation's chemistry division, died on Sept. 10 while attending a science conference in Budapest. He was 51 and lived in Rockville, Md.
        A foundation spokesman said Dr. Hancock, who was found in his hotel room, died of a heart attack. Dr. Hancock was in Hungary to attend a workshop on environmental chemistry that the foundation helped sponsor.
        He had been head of the chemistry division since 1990 and with the Federal agency since 1977, serving as program director and then as acting and deputy director. Under his direction, the division promoted international collaboration among scientists.
        "He led scientific delegations that brought United States chemists together with colleagues in Central and Eastern Europe and in Russia," said William Harris, the foundation's assistant director for mathematical and physical sciences.
        Dr. Hancock received his Ph.D from the University of Wisconsin in 1968. He then became an assistant and later associate professor in the chemistry department of the University of California at Davis, remaining there until 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Diane Kerr of Rockville; two sons, Kenneth Scott of Nashua, N.H., and John Arthur Hancock of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Catherine Yvonne of Rockville; his parents, Kenneth Roy and Audrey Buddensick Hancock of Easton, Pa.; a brother, Arthur, of Libertyville, Ill., and a sister, Christine L. Fisher of Media, Pa.
