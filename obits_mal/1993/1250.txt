        Max Knight, a writer, editor and translator, died on Aug. 31 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 84.
        The cause was complications that developed after a heart bypass operation in February, said Joseph Fabry, a friend with whom Mr. Knight published many short stories in German under the joint pen name Peter Fabrizius.
        Mr. Knight was born in Pilsen, then part of Austria, and grew up in Vienna, where he was an editor and feature writer on the Neues Wiener Tagblatt. After the Nazi takeover, he worked for The Jewish Chronicle in London and the North China Daily News in Shanghai. In 1941 he immigrated to the United States and was a script writer and analyst for the Office of War Information in San Francisco.
        From 1950 to 1976, Mr. Knight was the principal editor of the University of California Press, overseeing the publication of more than 200 books. He translated plays by Bertolt Brecht, poems by Christian Morgenstern, the correspondence between Richard Strauss and Stefan Zweig and, most recently, works by Gottfried Benn. He also translated Ogden Nash into German.
        For his translations of the Austrian writers Karl Kraus and Johann Nestroy, he received the Golden Cross of Honor from Austria.
        His books include "The German Executive, 1890-1933" and "Return to the Alps." His last book was "Zany Zoo: Humorous Animal Verses" (Kalmar Publishing, 1993).
        He is survived by his wife, Charlotte, two sons, Anthony and Martin, also of Berkeley, and a granddaughter.
