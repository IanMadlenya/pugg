        George Bronson Farnam, a leader in the Connecticut dairy industry and former state legislator, died on Tuesday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 80 and lived in Wallingford, Conn., until 1980.
        He had been ill for a long time, his family said.
        A native of Cornwall, Conn., Mr. Farnam was a 1936 graduate of Yale University and operated a dairy farm at Wallingford for 32 years. He was a past president of Connecticut Milk for Health and the Dairy Herd Improvement Association, and a director of the Connecticut Milk Producers Association and the American Dairy Association.
        He was a past chairman of the Regional Planning Agency of South Central Connecticut and represented Wallingford for a term in the Connecticut General Assembly in the late 1950's. He also served on the Wallingford Planning and Zoning Commission and as president of the Day-Prospect Hill School and the New Haven Lawn Club.
        Mr. Farnam is survived by his wife of 55 years, Nancy Forgan Farnam; three daughters, Nancy Charles of Wallingford, Rosalind Dudden of Denver, and Margaret McKnight of Orlando, Fla.; two sons, George B. Jr., of Taipei, Taiwan, and James, of New Haven, and seven grandchildren.
