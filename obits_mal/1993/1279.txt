        Lee Wagner, the founder and original owner of TV Guide, died on Tuesday at the Eisenhower Memorial Hospital in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 83.
        His wife, Esta, said the cause was a stroke.
        In 1935, shortly after he began practicing law in Manhattan, Mr. Wagner started as an executive in the circulation department of McFadden Publications in New York, where he remained for 10 years. At one time he was the circulation director of Liberty, Screenland, Silver Screen and Movie Show magazines, all at the same time.
        In 1948, after a year of planning, he founded TV Guide-New York, later expanding it into regional editions for New England and the Baltimore-Washington area.
        He sold the three editions to Triangle Publications in 1953 but remained as editor. Mr. Wagner continued to bring out new regional editions of TV Guide for Triangle Publications until 1955, and remained as a consultant to the company until 1963, when he retired to Rancho Mirage.
        He is survived by his wife, Esta, of Rancho Mirage; a son, Neil, of Atlanta, and a brother, Sidney, of Glen Cove, L.I.
