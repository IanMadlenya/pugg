        Albert Prago, a scholar of Latin American history and Marxist economics and a Lincoln Brigade veteran of the Spanish Civil War, died on Tuesday at the Convalescent Care Center at West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 81 and lived in West Palm Beach.
        The cause was cancer of the spine, said his nephew, Clifford Irving, the novelist.
        Dr. Prago taught labor history and Latin American history in the adult division of the New School for Social Research in Manhattan from 1979 to 1982 and at Hofstra on Long Island from 1965 to 1969.
        In the 1970's he served as coordinator of the Long Island branch of the Cornell School of Industrial and Labor Relations, which at that time was in Farmingdale and is now on the State University of New York campus at Old Westbury.
        He was author of several history books, including "The Revolutions in Spanish America" (McMillan, 1970) and "Strangers in Their Own Land: A History of Mexican-Americans" (Four Winds Press, 1973).
        Born in New York City, he graduated from City College in 1934. In 1937 he joined about 3,300 other Americans who volunteered to form a brigade to fight in the Spanish Civil War for the Republican cause against the fascist forces. Eighteen months later, he returned home after being wounded by a mortar shell during fighting at Belchite.
        Surviving are his wife, Ruth, and four grandchildren.
