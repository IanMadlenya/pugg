        William Z. Schanz, co-founder and head of Regency Cruises, died on Wednesday at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was 70.
        Mr. Schanz had a stroke while working in his Manhattan office, said his wife, Olga.
        Regency operates a six-ship fleet. Mr. Schanz entered the tour business on his arrival from Europe in 1949, first managing a travel agency.
        In the 1950's, he bought the firm he was then working for, Trans Globe Travel, and in 1970 established and became the president of Paquet French Cruises in North America.
        In 1984 he became a co-founder of Regency Cruises, which has expanded into middle-price tourism and does $175 million a year in business. The company's ships cruise to ports of call in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, the Caribbean and South America.
        Born in Poland, Mr. Schanz, who was Jewish, was incarcerated in the Cracow ghetto at the age of 16. He survived the Plaszow concentration camp, worked in a slave labor factory in Moravia, and was freed by the Russians in 1945. He lived briefly in Paris and then moved to New York.
        Mr. Schanz is survived by his mother, Anna Moed; his wife of 35 years, who also lives in Manhattan; two daughters, Danielle Schanz of Larchmont, N.Y., and Bobbie Packard of Tiburon, Calif., and a sister, Janine Ameisen of Paris.
