        Dr. D. Lee Bawden, senior economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, who wrote more than 70 papers and books evaluating social programs, died on Wednesday at his home in Great Falls, Va. He was 56.
        The cause was cancer, the institute, a social and economic policy-research organization, said.
        Dr. Bawden joined the institute in 1974. Four years later he became director of its employment and labor policy division, now known as the Human Resources Policy Center.
        His principal subjects were poverty, welfare policies and employment and training programs for those without either. His most recent books, published by the institute, included "Rethinking Employment Policy," with Felicity Skidmore (1989); and, as editor, "The Social Contract Revisited: Aims and Outcome of President Reagan's Welfare Policy" (1984).
        Dennis Lee Bawden was born in Wolf Point, Mont. A graduate of Montana State University, he earned a doctorate in agricultural economics at the University of California at Berkeley. He served as a lieutenant in the United States Air Force.
        Dr. Bawden is survived by his wife, Carlene Crumpton Bawden; four children, Hilary A. and Darin L., both of Madison, Wis., Robert Crumpton Jr. of Lakeville, Minn., and Sharon R. Crumpton of Reston, Va.; his mother, Alice B. Bawden of Billings, Mont.; two brothers, John B., also of Billings, and James G., of Crown Point, Ind.; and a granddaughter.
