        Max Wechsler, a New York architect for more than 50 years, died on Friday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, family members said.
        Mr. Wechsler was the architect and designer of office buildings, hospitals, schools, nursing homes and luxury apartment buildings.
        The firm of Max Wechsler Associates was one of three involved in the Riverside Park Community Apartments, built in 1976 on Broadway between 133d and 135th Streets. Wechsler, Grasso & Menziuso designed two noteworthy renovations in lower Manhattan: converting the former Excelsior Power Company power house at 33 Gold Street into apartments in 1979, and transforming the former United States Army Building at 39 Whitehall Street into an office building, recladding and enlarging it in 1986.
        Mr. Wechsler is survived by his wife, Estelle, and a son and daughter, Paul and Gail, from a previous marriage.
