        Frederick Nicklaus, a poet, died on March 23 at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. He was 55 and had lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Two volumes of Mr. Nicklaus's poetry were published: "The Man Who Bit the Sun" (1964) and "Cut of Noon" (1971). The New York Times printed a dozen of his poems in the 1960's and 1970's.
        In 1980 he was a fellow at the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, N.H.
        Mr. Nicklaus, who was a cousin of the golf player Jack Nicklaus, was born in Columbus and graduated from Ohio State University. He moved to New York and while pursuing his career as a poet worked as an editor for book-publishing houses and as a consultant to a literary agent.
        He is survived by his mother, Effie, and a brother, James, both of Columbus.
