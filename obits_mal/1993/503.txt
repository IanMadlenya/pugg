        Richard B. Donchian, an early leader in the commodities futures market, died Saturday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 87 and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Donchian was a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers and a registered commodity trading adviser.
        In 1948 he started Futures Inc., the first commodities mutual fund. He also wrote a weekly market letter for Shearson, Hammill & Company. The commodity futures industry gives an annual award in his name.
        Mr. Donchian was born in Hartford. After graduating from Yale University in 1928, he started working on Wall Street. During World War II he was a statistical control officer in the Army Air Forces.
        He was a deacon of the Congregational Church in Scarsdale, N.Y., and an elder and trustee of the First Presbyterian Church of Pompano Beach.
        Surviving is his wife of 36 years, the former Alma Gibbs.
