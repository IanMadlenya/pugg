        James Leo Herlihy, a playwright and an actor and the author of the novels "All Fall Down" and "Midnight Cowboy," died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 66.
        He took an overdose of sleeping pills, said Joe Frazier, a friend.
        Mr. Herlihy, often described as a literary heir of Sherwood Anderson, wrote tough, gritty stories about troubled adolescents and marginal, beaten-down characters. He was praised as a master of characterization, with a fine ear for dialogue.
        He was born in Detroit, where his father worked as a construction engineer and an inspector for the city. He began writing short stories soon after graduating from John J. Pershing High School. From Sculpture to Theater
        From 1944 to 1946, he served in the Navy. After two years studying sculpture, painting, music and literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, he took aptitude tests that showed his talent lay in the theater. He attended Pasadena Playhouse College of the Theater in California from 1948 to 1950 and appeared in about 50 roles in theaters on the West Coast between 1948 and 1952.
        Mr. Herlihy's first play, "Streetlight Sonata," was produced in Pasadena in 1950, and three years later his "Moon in Capricorn" was produced Off Broadway. Between 1953 and 1958, he wrote television scripts.
        "Blue Denim," a play about two troubled teen-agers that he wrote with William Noble, ran on Broadway successfully in 1958 and was later made into a film. In 1959, he published a collection of short stories, "The Sleep of Baby Filbertson."
        "All Fall Down" (1960), about an adolescent boy's conflicts with his family and his obsession with an absent older brother, was widely praised as an unflinching, perceptive study of what would today be called a dysfunctional family. The novel was made into a film in 1962 starring Warren Beatty and Eva Marie Saint.
        In 1963, Mr. Herlihy appeared in the role of Jerry in Edward Albee's "Zoo Story" in Boston and Paris.
        "Midnight Cowboy," published in 1965, received respectful reviews, but it did not achieve the commercial success of "All Fall Down," and it was overshadowed by the 1969 film version, starring Dustin Hoffman and John Voight.
        From 1967 to 1968, Mr. Herlihy taught writing in New York at City College. 'Season of the Witch'
        Three of his one-act plays were produced Off Broadway in 1970 under the title "Stop, You're Killing Me." His last novel, "Season of the Witch" in 1971, was written in the form of a diary of a 19-year-old who heads to New York from the Midwest with her homosexual boyfriend.
        In 1981, Mr. Herlihy appeared in the film "Four Friends," directed by Arthur Penn.
        He is survived by a brother in the Midwest.
