        Norman E. Auerbach, who as a World War II veteran in need of a job became an accountant at Coopers & Lybrand at the age of 27 and retired 35 years later as chairman, died Sunday at Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. A Tucson resident and former New Yorker, he was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Dr. Gary A. Auerbach of Tucson.
        When he reached mandatory retirement age in 1982, Coopers & Lybrand laid claim to being the world's largest accounting and consulting concern. By then the firm, which has headquarters in Manhattan, had 450 offices worldwide, 27,000 employees to staff them and revenues of nearly $1 billion a year. Now its worldwide revenues are $5 billion.
        Mr. Auerbach, a native of Minneapolis, arrived at the University of Michigan in the midst of the Depression with $25 in his pocket. He earned his degree in economics and served in World War II, commanding a supply ship in the Pacific.
        He then finished his master's in business at Michigan and shelved his plan to practice law. Instead, he found work at what in 1947 still was Lybrand, Ross Brothers & Montgomery, took his law degree several years later at St. John's University and was admitted to the New York bar. By then his accounting career had taken off. Before his election as chairman and chief executive at Coopers & Lybrand in 1976, he was the firm's associate managing partner.
        After his retirement in 1982 he turned to his first ambition, the law, and joined his sons Roger and Richard in their Tucson practice.
        Besides his three sons, Mr. Auerbach is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Judy Genden; a brother, Milton, also of Tucson; three sisters, Evelyn Mandelcorn of Los Angeles, Esther Sahr of Schenectady, N.Y., and Sally Steinberg of East Schodack, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
