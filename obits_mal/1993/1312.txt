        Francis Warren Lawrence, a ranking tennis doubles player in the 1930's, a leading amateur golfer and an insurance executive, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Born in the Back Bay section of Boston, Mr. Lawrence, who was known as Bunty, was the son of Vincent Lawrence, an Oscar-winning screenwriter. He was a Hollywood agent in the 1930's and later formed a partnership with the producer Ray Stark.
        In World War II Mr. Lawrence served in the Marine Corps in the Pacific.
        After the war, he moved to New York City and became a close adviser to Dan Topping, the owner of the New York Yankees. He was also a director of the Baltimore Colts football team.
        In 1974 he joined the Frank B. Hall Insurance Company, now known as Rollins Hudig Hall, where he served as senior vice president.
        He is survived by his wife, Lily, whose father was Reza Fallah, head of the National Iranian Oil Company and a roving ambassador for the Shah of Iran, and a sister, Mary Newberry of Savannah, Ga.
