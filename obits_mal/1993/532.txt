        Harold M. Altshul, the former head of Ketchum & Company, a leading drug wholesaler, died on March 29 at the Westerly Hospital in Westerly, R.I. He was 83 and lived in Stonington, Conn.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his son, Dr. Victor Altshul of New Haven.
        Mr. Altshul, a native of New York City, attended Cornell University from 1928 to 1930. He went to work for Ketchum in 1931 and retired in 1988 as chairman, having also served as president and chief executive.
        Mr. Altshul was considered a leader in the industry and during his tenure Ketchum introduced a number of new medications, including Preparation H. The company was sold after he retired, and since 1991, it has been O.C.P. America of South Plainfield, N.J., a subsidiary of the French multinational, O.C.P. Group.
        Mr. Altshul's associations included the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, the National Wholesale Druggists Association and the American Arbitration Association.
        He is survived by another son, Lindsay Altshul of South Windsor, Conn.; a sister, Phyllis Spies of Monmouth, N.J., and five grandchildren.
