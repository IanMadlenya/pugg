        Eldon Dyer, who was mathematics editor for the Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years, died on Tuesday at his home in Katonah, N.Y. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, the City University of New York said. Professor Dyer was distinguished professor emeritus of mathematics at the Graduate School and University Center of the university.
        He helped to formulate the mathematics doctoral program at the graduate school. He was named a distinguished professor in 1971. Before joining the graduate faculty in 1966, he had taught at the University of Georgia, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago and Rice University.
        His specialty was in the field of mathematical topology and he edited several mathematical journals. He was a member of the Institue for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., in 1956 and 1957 and in 1973 and 1974.
        Professor Dyer received a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan; and two children from a previous marriage, LeClaire Wilkins of Austin, Tex., and James, of Berkeley, Calif.
