        James T. Clarke, a fashion designer whose clothing store, James T's, on Lexington Avenue near East 70th Street offered simply cut, classic clothing that was easy to wear, died on Friday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 49.
        His associates said he died of AIDS.
        Mr. Clarke started out as an architectural student at Howard University. But he transferred after two years to the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan, where he was graduated with honors and where one of his sketches won a fashion industry prize in 1967.
        He opened his boutique at 979 Lexington Avenue in 1974. His customers included Brooke Astor, Gloria Swanson, Teresa Wright, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Joan Fontaine, Anne Slater, Kathryn Crosby, Cindra Ladd, the wife of Alan Ladd, and Barbara Grant, the wife of Cary Grant.
        His reversible skirts and pants were among his most popular designs because they were easy to travel with and gave the wearers a leaner look.
        Mr. Clarke did all of the creative process himself, including selecting and cutting fabric, and sewing each piece of clothing. In addition to his store, he had wholesale distribution centers in Southampton, L.I., New York, Boston, Palm Beach, Fla., and Santa Barbara, Calif.
