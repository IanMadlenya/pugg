        Dr. James B. Townsend, a retired professor of English literature at the State University of New York at Buffalo, died on Monday at his home in Buffalo. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Clarissa Townsend.
        Dr. Townsend began teaching at the State University in 1957, retiring as a professor in 1983. He was also an art scholar who compiled and edited several books about American painters.
        In addition to the State University, Dr. Townsend taught at Yale University, from which he received a doctorate. He graduated from Princeton University in the class of 1940 and served with the Office of Strategic Services in Europe during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Jeanette Townsend of Buffalo; two daughters, Josephine Kaestner of Baltimore, and Clarissa Townsend of Manhattan, and two sons, Dr. Jackson Townsend of New Orleans, and Rhys Townsend of Worcester, Mass.
