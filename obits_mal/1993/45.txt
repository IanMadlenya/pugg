        Nelson T. Shields 3d, a founder of the advocacy group Handgun Control, died Monday at his home in Greenville, Del. He was 69.
        Mr. Shields, who was called Pete, died of cancer, said Susan Whitmore, a spokeswoman for the organization.
        The organization played a major role in the passage of Congressional legislation in 1986 that outlawed armor-piercing bullets and the importation of parts for cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials.
        Mr. Shields had been an executive of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company for 26 years when his son, Nelson 4th, was shot and killed in San Francisco in 1975, a victim in a series of racially motivated killings of whites by four blacks that came to be known as the Zebra killings.
        He took a leave of absence from Du Pont to help establish an organization to push for stronger gun-control laws. In December 1976 he resigned from Du Pont to become executive director of the National Council to Control Handguns, the predecessor to Handgun Control.
        He became its chairman in 1978 and retired in 1989. He was succeeded by Sarah Brady, whose husband, James Brady, President Ronald Reagan's first press secretary, was wounded in the 1981 attempt on Mr. Reagan's life.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Shields attended the Hotchkiss School and earned a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1949. He was a Navy fighter pilot in World War II.
        Mr. Shields is survived by his wife, Jeanne; a son, David, of Kennett Square, Pa., and two daughters, Leslie Lundgaard and Pamela Pragoff, both of Chadds Ford, Pa.
