        Alfred E. Munier, an engineer who contributed to the space and nuclear-fusion programs during his 47 years with the Grumman Corporation of Bethpage, L.I., died on Dec. 16 at the Carillon House Nursing Facility in Huntington. He was 78 and had homes in Lloyd Harbor, L.I., and Nantucket, Mass.
        He had had a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Munier was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the California Institute of Technology. He started his career as a civil engineer with a New York consulting firm where he worked on the designs of the Unisphere at the 1939 World's Fair and the Whitestone Bridge, among others.
        He joined Grumman in 1943 and helped design fighter aircraft for the Navy. From 1958 to 1969 he directed the company's Future Space Systems Group, which designed the prototype for the first lunar module. His group also designed space satellites for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which honored him in 1970 for the development of the Lunar Excursion Module, LEM, for Grumman. Honored by Princeton
        He later became director of Advanced Civil Systems, working on alternative energy sources such as solar power and nuclear fusion. This included collaboration with Princeton University in building the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, which recently elated scientists by firing bursts of up to 5.3 million watts of power -- a landmark for nuclear fusion. Princeton honored his work with its Plasma Physics Laboratory Award in 1983.
        He retired from Grumman three years ago.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Elizabeth Browning Munier; two sons, Denis, of Los Angeles, and Quentin, of Manhasset, L.I.; a daughter, Frances E. Ziegler of Columbia, Md., and 10 grandchildren.
