        Mr. Bass, a Democrat, was elected to the United States House of Representatives five times beginning in 1954. In 1964, he won the special election to fill the seat made vacant by the death of Senator Estes Kefauver. Mr. Bass defeated former Gov. Frank Clement in the primary and Howard H. Baker Jr. in the general election.
        When Mr. Bass sought a full Senate term two years later, he lost the primary to Mr. Clement, who lost the general election to Mr. Baker.
        Born in 1917, the son of a circuit-riding Methodist minister in rural Giles County, Mr. Bass graduated from Martin Methodist Junior College in Pulaski in 1938. He joined the Army Air Corps as a bombardier during World War II, achieving the rank of captain. After his discharge in 1945, he opened a florist shop here and was named postmaster of this south-central Tennessee town in 1946. He won his first seat in Congress at age 37, representing Tennessee's 6th Congressional District.
        His first marriage ended in divorce in 1967.
        In addition to Horace Bass of Nashville, survivors include his second wife, Jacqui Colter Bass, and a sister, E.V. McCarty of Fort Myers, Fla.
