        Carl Morris, an abstract painter whose work echoed the forces and forms of nature, died on Thursday at St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center in Portland, Ore. He was 82.
        He had recently had gallbladder surgery.
        Mr. Morris was born in Yorba Linda, Calif., but spent most of his career in Portland. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and in Vienna and Paris and was the director of the Spokane Art Center in Washington in the late 1930's. He moved to Oregon in 1941 with his wife, Hilda, a sculptor, and worked in the Portland shipyards during World War II. His paintings in those years were largely figurative, but after World War II he turned toward abstraction and shared ideas with the circle of artists that included Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko.
        Asked why he declined to take the advice of some of his artist friends and move permanently to New York City, which had become the headquarters of the abstract school, Mr. Morris told an interviewer that he found the city's atmosphere threatening rather than artistically stimulating. "Besides," he added, "I've always found the Northwest to be a marvelous studio."
        Mr. Morris's work was shown at museums around the country, among them the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago and the San Francisco Museum of Art. He also had shows at the Kraushaar Galleries in New York City.
        He is survived by a son, David, a sculptor, of New York City.
