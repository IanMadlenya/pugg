        David Weinstein, a professor of Judaic studies, died on Sunday in Sarasota. He was 66.
        He had a heart attack while playing tennis with his wife and son, his family said.
        From 1984 to 1987, Mr. Weinstein was the national director of "A Campaign to Remember," a drive to raise $100 million for the Holocaust Memorial Museum that opened this year in Washington.
        Mr. Weinstein left the Spertus College of Judaica in Chicago when Elie Wiesel, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and a Holocaust survivor and writer, asked him to head the museum's fund-raising drive.
        Mr. Weinstein had served as president of Spertus College (now Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies) from 1964 to 1980, and as chancellor from 1980 to 1984.
        Since 1991 he had been director of institutional planning for Johnson & Wales University in north Miami and maintained an apartment in Miami.
        In addition to his wife, Sandy, and his son, Noah, he is survived by a brother, Nathan, and a sister, Beatrice Kraft.
