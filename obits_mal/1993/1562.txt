        William L. Johnson, an international tax lawyer whose lawsuit led Trans World Airlines to open its frequent-flier program to gay and lesbian couples, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 46 and also lived in East Taghanic, N.Y.
        The cause of death was complications from AIDS, said his companion, William J. Hibsher.
        Mr. Johnson was born in Brooklyn and raised in Teaneck, N.J. He graduated from Amherst College in 1969 and Yale Law School in 1973.
        After practicing law in San Francisco and Los Angeles, he joined the New York firm of Quasha Wesley & Schneider in 1983. That year, he was also among the founders of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan. At the time of his death, he was a member of Brobeck Hale & Dorr International.
        In 1988, T.W.A. refused to issue a frequent-flier ticket to Mr. Hibsher, even though Mr. Johnson had accumulated enough mileage for two free tickets. The couple sued the airline in Federal District Court, charging discrimination. In settling the suit, T.W.A. changed its policy to allow "nontraditional" companions to benefit from the bonus program, as spouses and relatives would.
        Besides Mr. Hibsher, Mr. Johnson is survived by his mother, Estelle Johnson Silverman, of Teaneck, N.J., and a sister, Susan Azaria Kanrich, of Guttenberg, N.J.
