        Milton Frank, a former Ambassador to Nepal, died Wednesday at the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles. He was 73.
        The cause of death was cancer, said Adelphi University, where Mr. Frank was the chief aide to the president, Peter Diamandopoulos.
        Mr. Frank was born in Reno. He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and held a master's degree in public relations from Boston University. From 1942 to 1969 he worked at the Defense Department as director of communications-electronics and director of public affairs.
        For the next 16 years he was the public relations director of the 19-campus California State University system, where he was an adviser to the board and the chancellor.
        In 1985, when Mr. Diamandopoulos became president of Adelphi, in Garden City, L.I., he asked Mr. Frank to join him there. Mr. Frank took time out from that post in 1987 to serve under President Ronald Reagan as Ambassador to Nepal for two years.
        Mr. Frank is survived by his fiancee, L. Letty Chen of Garden City; his son, Christopher Duffield of Tucson, Ariz., and a sister, Leone Frank of San Francisco.
