        Charles S. Witkowski, a New Jersey lawyer for 60 years and former Mayor of Jersey City, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. A lifelong Jersey City resident, he was 86.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        In the convoluted politics of his traditionally Democratic city, Mr. Witkowski aligned himself with the independents, who did battle with the party machine every election year.
        In 1949, he joined the Freedom Ticket, which ended the 32-year-rein of Frank Hague as Jersey City boss. The ticket brought in John V. Kenny as Mayor, and Mr. Witkowski became Police Commissioner. But his independence led to a falling-out with Mr. Kenny, who stripped Mr. Witkowski of his office a few years later.
        Mr. Witkowski ran for mayor in 1953 as an independent but failed. He tried again in 1957 and won. He served four years as Mayor but came in third in the mayoral contest of May 1961.
        Mr. Witkowski graduated from the University of Villanova and received his law degree from John Marshall Law School. At Villanova he was an All-American football player.
        After his term as Mayor, he resumed his law practice.
        Mr. Witkowski's wife, Florence, died in 1989. He is survived by two daughters, Linda O'Connell of Manhattan and Marjorie Panayotopoulos of Jersey City; a brother, John J. of West Orange, N.J.; two sisters, Estelle Catlin of Hamburg, N.J., and Mae Pchola of Secaucus, N.J., and four grandchildren.
