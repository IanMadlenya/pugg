        Martin P. Levine, a sociologist and educator who specialized in research on homosexuality and AIDS, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 42.
        The cause was AIDS, his family said.
        Dr. Levine founded the Lesbian and Gay Caucus of the American Sociological Association and was its first chairman. At his death he was on sick leave from the faculty of Florida Atlantic University. From 1978 to 1990 he was an associate professor at Bloomfield College.
        He wrote or edited many articles and books on sexuality and AIDS, including "Gay Men: The Sociology of Male Homosexuality" (Harper and Row, 1976).
        He was a researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, directing a study financed by the National Institute of Mental Health on decisions about sexual activity among gay men in the AIDS epidemic.
        He also served on a National Academy of Sciences panel monitoring the social effects of the disease and developed one of the first college courses about AIDS.
        He was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from the State University of New York at Binghamton, he earned a master's degree and doctorate at New York University.
        His survivors include his parents, Herman and Annette, of Brooklyn; two sisters, Jacqueline Proulx of Brooklyn and Hope Schuering of Middletown, N.Y., who was his twin, and a brother, Steven, of New City, N.Y.
