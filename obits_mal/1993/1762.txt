        Jacob Brown, an administrator of Columbia University's School of General Studies, died on Tuesday at the Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 43.
        The cause was an AIDS-related illness, said Frank Wolf, associate dean of the School of General Studies.
        Before he took medical leave last year, Mr. Brown had been assistant dean of students for five years at the School of General Studies and director of the school's Higher Education Opportunity Program.
        Mr. Brown was a graduate of Nyack College and received master's degrees from New York and Long Island Universities.
        He is survived by his mother, Lennie Brown; a sister, Mary Boyd, and a brother, Joseph, all of Brooklyn, and a second brother, David, of Atlanta.
