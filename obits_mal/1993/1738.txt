        Paul Walker, a director, actor and teacher of drama at New York University, died on Sunday at New York Downtown Hospital. He was 41 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, said Eve Ensler, a friend.
        Mr. Walker, an instructor in theater technique in the graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts, had taught in the program since 1985 and was noted for his classes on improvisation and theater games.
        He also taught acting at Dartmouth, Vassar, Princeton, the New School, Colorado College, the City University of New York, Montclair State College and Balliol College, Oxford.
        With the Manhattan-based Acting Company, he toured as an actor in productions of "Twelfth Night," "Il Campiello, a Venetian Comedy," "The Country Wife" and "Waiting for Godot."
        In the 1980's Mr. Walker acted in regional productions in Minnesota, Portland, Ore., and Washington. In 1990, he toured Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union with the Acting Company in "Five by Tenn," a program of Tennessee Williams's one-act plays.
        Mr. Walker directed "Ladies," "Legacy" and "Short Takes" for the Music-Theater Group in Manhattan. He wrote several plays, including "A Passenger Train of 61 Coaches" at the Humana Festival in Louisville, Ky., "The Rivers and Ravines" at Arena Stage in Washington and "Under Control" at the 29th Street Repertory Theater.
        He is survived by two brothers, Alfred, of Huntington, L.I., and Perry, of New York City.
