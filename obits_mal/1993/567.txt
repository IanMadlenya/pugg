        Dieter Plage, a German wildlife film maker whose documentaries brought attention to African conservation issues, died in an accident while filming in the rain forest in Sumatra on April 3, said a spokesman for Survival Anglia Ltd., a British film company. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Plage, who was filming a documentary project for the National Geographic Society and Survival Anglia, fell 150 feet from a small airship, the spokesman said. He was trying to repair a jammed rudder on the craft, which he was using as a camera platform above the forest canopy.
        Mr. Plage's half-hour documentaries were featured on a syndicated television series, "World of Survival," and some of his hourlong films were broadcast on CBS television.
        He is best known in the United States for a profile of the Scottish zoologist Iain Douglas-Hamilton, who studied elephant behavior in Lake Manyara Park in Tanzania, and for a 1975 television film on the mountain gorillas of Zaire that was one of the first documentaries to bring attention to these animals' endangered status.
        Mr. Plage's autobiography, "Wild Horizons," was published in 1980 by Collins in London, and he and his wife, Mary Grant Plage, were co-authors of articles for National Geographic magazine.
        Mr. Plage, who was born in Beelitz, Germany, was buried in Darmstadt, near Frankfurt, on April 13. He is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1977.
