        Dillard Munford, the wealthy founder of a chain of convenience stores, died on Wednesday at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. He was 75.
        A family spokesman said that the cause was heart failure, and that until his death Mr. Munford continued to write editorial columns that appeared in 30 weekly newspapers in Georgia.
        Mr. Munford, who had homes in Atlanta, Highlands, N.C., and Delray Beach, Fla., was active in civic affairs in Atlanta. He was director of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and a trustee for more than 20 years at Morris Brown College in Atlanta, which awarded him an honorary degree in 1976.
        His interests were wide-ranging. Until his term ended in April, he was a trustee of the Freedom Forum and its predecessor organization, the Gannett Foundation. The forum is a nonprofit organization that promotes journalism education, assists minority journalism students and conducts international internship programs.
        Mr. Munford was born in Cartersville, Ga. He graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a degree in mechanical engineering.
        He founded the Munford Company to manufacture rock wool insulation, primarily for Sears, Roebuck & Company, and then ventured into retailing. The first Munford Do-It-Yourself store opened in 1952; 10 years later the chain merged with Atlantic Company. Acquisitions and mergers led to further expansion into a chain of 46 stores.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Danne Brokaw Shaw; four children, Page Mallory of Atlanta, Aubrey Morris of Big Canoe, Ga., Robert, of Cranbury, N.J., and Henry, of Atlanta; three stepchildren, Melissa Fleming of New York City and Deirdre Shaw and Crawford Shaw Jr., both of Atlanta; a brother, R. Sims, of Jackson, Miss., and a sister, Dr. Faith Price of Houston.
