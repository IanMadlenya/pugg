        William C. Sayres, a Columbia University professor who helped developing countries improve their education systems, died on Monday while flying from Cairo to Geneva for medical treatment after a heart attack. He was 65 and a resident of Bogota, N.J.
        A university spokesman reported his death yesterday and said Mr. Sayres was in Egypt as a consultant to its Ministry of Education.
        Dr. Sayres was a professor emeritus at Columbia's Teachers College and for 15 years coordinated its program in international education development. He formally retired last fall but remained active.
        In 1963, he joined Columbia's faculty and its advisory team for educational development in Peru. Among the projects he later worked on was the development of curriculum and textbooks for use in Afghanistan.
        Dr. Sayres, who was born in Detroit, was the author of more than 50 short stories and he wrote articles for magazines and two novels, "Sonotaw" (Simon & Schuster, 1959) and "Do Good" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1966).
        He graduated from Beloit College in Wisconsin in 1949 and earned a master's in anthropology in 1951 and a doctorate in 1953, both at Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife, Juanita; four sons, William, of Los Angeles, and Jason, Joel and Rory, all of Bogota; two daughters, Nicole and Kelli, both of Bogota; a brother, Tom, of Venice, Fla.; two sisters, Ann Williams of Clarkston, Mich., and Jeanne Counts of Nokomis, Fla.
