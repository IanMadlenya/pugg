        Jesse B. Spark, the owner of an export business with headquarters in Manhattan, died on Sunday at a hospital in Boston. He was 84 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Spark was the president of Richards International Ltd., an exporter of bakery supplies to Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. He founded the company in 1954 and remained active in it until he recently became ill.
        Mr. Spark was born in New York City. After graduating from City College and earning a master's degree in business administration at Columbia, he returned to City College to teach foreign trade.
        During World War II he went to Washington to work for the Federal Board of Economic Warfare. There he helped secure foreign supplies of cinchona bark, then the only source of quinine, which was the sole treatment for malaria for troops stationed in the Pacific.
        After the war he worked nine years for the Doughnut Corporation of America, helping to create its foreign trade division before starting his own company.
        He was married to Mona Rothenberg, who is deceased.
        His survivors include his son, Richard, of Westwood, Mass., and three grandchildren.
