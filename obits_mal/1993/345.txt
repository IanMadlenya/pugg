        Charles Alfred Specht, a retired corporate executive and business consultant, died on Friday at his daughter's home in Katonah, N.Y. A former resident of Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y., he was 78.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his daughter Sandra Rawlings said.
        Mr. Specht was born in Passaic, N.J., and graduated from Rutgers University and New York University Graduate School of Business. He held executive positions with Pfizer International and the Minerals and Chemicals Corporation of America in New York before becoming president of MacMillan Bloedel and Powell River Ltd., a leading forest products company, in Vancouver, British Columbia.
        He later served as president and chief executive of Consolidated Packaging Corporation in Chicago, retiring in 1973. He then worked as an independent business consultant and, until recently, remained active as a director of A.L. Laboratories Inc. of Fort Lee, N.J.
        Mr. Specht is survived by two daughters, Mrs. Rawlings and Sara Maddox of Plymouth, N.H.; a sister, Patricia Frank of Holderness, N.H.; two brothers, Dr. Robert Specht of Summit, N.J., and Alfred Specht of Atlanta, and five grandchildren.
