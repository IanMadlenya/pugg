        Arthur Mann, a chronicler of American reform politics, died Sunday at the University of Chicago's Bernard Mitchell Hospital. A resident of Hyde Park, Ill., he was 71.
        His family said his death came after a long illness.
        Dr. Mann was the emeritus Preston and Sterling Morton Professor of History at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty there in 1966, reached emeritus status in 1990 but continued as a faculty fellow until last year.
        He was best known for his two-volume biography of Fiorello La Guardia, New York City's combative Mayor from 1934 to 1945. As a biographer and historian, he earned equal praise for thorough scholarship and pithy language.
        His first book, "Yankee Reformers in the Urban Age" (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1954), told of the struggle for political reform in the 1880's and 1890's and was written in his trademark plain-spoken style.
        Dr. Mann's "La Guardia: A Fighter Against his Times, 1882-1933" (Lipincott, 1959), was similar in its approach and captured the man and the spirit of the age.
        A follow-up book, "La Guardia Comes to Power: 1933" (Lipincott, 1965), dealt with the La Guardia campaign.
        Dr. Mann wrote four other books, including "Immigrants in American Life" (Houghton, 1968), and "The One and the Many: Reflections on the American Identity" (University of Chicago Press, 1979).
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated summa cum laude from Brooklyn College and earned master's and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. He began his academic career at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in 1955 moved to Smith College, where he taught until 1966. He became Preston and Sterling Morton Professor in Chicago in 1971 at the age of 49.
        Dr. Mann is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Sylvia Blut; two daughters, Carol Mann of Brooklyn and Emily Mann of Princeton, N.J., and two grandchildren.
