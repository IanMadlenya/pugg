        Michael G. Smith, a professor emeritus of anthropology at Yale University, died Tuesday at Bristol Royal Infirmary in Bristol, England. He was 71 and lived in Glastonbury, England.
        Professor Smith died of a stroke, said Prof. Lambros Comitas, a friend and colleague.
        Professor Smith was an authority on the structure of power and political systems. He wrote more than 20 books on social and political developments in West Africa, particularly Nigeria, and in the Caribbean.
        His books included "The Plural Society in the British West Indies," published in 1965 by the University of California Press, and "Pluralism, Politics and Ideology in the Creole Caribbean," published in 1991 by the Research Institute for the Study of Man.
        He was born in Jamaica. He served in the Canadian Army during World War II. After the war he attended the University of London, where he earned bachelor's and doctoral degrees. He subsequently joined the faculty there and served as chairman of the anthropology department from 1969 to 1975.
        Professor Smith joined the Yale faculty in 1978 and retired from Yale in 1986.
        He maintained a lifelong interest in Jamaican life and in 1972 was named the first recipient of the Award of the Order of Merit, Jamaica's equivalent of knighthood.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and three sons; Daniel, of London, David, of Houston and Peter, of Glastonbury.
