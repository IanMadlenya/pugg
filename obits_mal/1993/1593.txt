        Lawrence H. Zahn, a retired packaging executive for the Ciba-Geigy Corporation, died on Thursday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 79 and a resident of New Vernon, N.J.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Blanche Phillips Zahn.
        Mr. Zahn graduated in mechanical engineering from Stevens Institute in 1936. Eight years later, he joined the Ciba Pharmaceutical Company in Summit, an offshoot of the United States subsidiary of the Swiss-based concern, as an industrial engineer. Later, as director of the purchasing and package-development division of Ciba-Geigy, it was his responsibility to uphold the company's reputation as an innovator in functional and convenient pharmaceutical packaging.
        He retired in 1989.
