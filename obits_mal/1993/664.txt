        George Spota, a writer, a producer and a talent manager, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said Peter Hyams, his son-in-law.
        Mr. Spota conceived, created and produced "Will Rogers U.S.A.," a one-man show that opened on Broadway in 1974 with James Whitmore portraying the humorist. He also produced a television special about the show for CBS. In 1976 he was co-producer of "Eleanor," a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt that starred Eileen Heckart. The next year, he produced "Bully!," a Broadway show about Theodore Roosevelt that also starred Mr. Whitmore.
        Mr. Spota managed the career of the comedian Jonathan Winters for many years. His other clients included Carol Burnett, Hugh Downs and Arlene Francis.
        He also worked in television as a writer, a producer and a director. Among the shows on which he worked were "You and the Law" and "When I Grow Up."
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Marie; a daughter, George-Ann Hyams of Los Angeles; three brothers, Nicholas, of Northville, N.J., and Thomas and Richard, both of Long Island, and three grandchildren.
