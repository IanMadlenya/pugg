        James A. Murphy, an architect and editor at Progressive Architecture magazine, died on Sunday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 54.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Diana.
        Mr. Murphy joined Progressive Architecture, a monthly magazine in Stamford, Conn., in 1970 and was the profession and industry editor at his death. He wrote many articles on architectural design and technology, including February's feature on the Holocaust Museum in Washington.
        Mr. Murphy was born in North Platte, Neb., and received a bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Nebraska. He worked with several firms in Lincoln, Neb., before joining Sherwood Mills & Smith of Stamford in 1965.
        He was active in the American Institute of Architects, and spoke frequently at chapter meetings and at universities.
        Besides his daughter Diana, of Brooklyn, he is survived by another daughter, Jody, of Rowayton, Conn.
