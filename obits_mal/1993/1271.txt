        John E. Lockwood, a lawyer who was formerly chief legal adviser to the Rockefeller family and chairman of the New York Public Library, died yesterday at his home in Bedford, N.Y. He was 89.
        He had been in declining health in recent months, said Squire N. Bozorth, a friend who is a partner in Mr. Lockwood's Manhattan-based law firm, Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
        Mr. Lockwood was a partner in the firm from 1937 to 1941 and from 1952 to 1969, and remained a consulting partner until his death.
        In 1971, Mr. Lockwood, as the library's chairman, was on a three-member management team that began reorganizing it to provide new work space for doctoral-degree candidates and undergraduates and other innovations and programs. In 1958, he was an adviser to Nelson A. Rockefeller in his successful campaign for election as Governor of New York.
        Mr. Lockwood was born in New York City and graduated from Williams College and the Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of The Harvard Law Review. He then became a law clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.
        Over the years, Mr. Lockwood was also chairman of the School of American Ballet, vice chairman of The Brookings Institution, secretary of the Rockefeller Institute and a director of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and of Rockefeller Center Inc.
        He is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Henrietta Ellery Sedgwick.
