        J. David Kuhn, a public-television journalist who raced vintage English cars for a hobby, died last Sunday when his car crashed at a meet. He was 50 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He was competing in the Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix at Schenley Park, Pa., when his MG-TD spun out of control in a single-car accident. He died at the scene.
        In 1970 he began working as a producer and executive at WGBH in Boston. A noted production was the series "The Constitution: That Delicate Balance." He also helped create documentaries for "World," "Frontline" and "Nova."
        Mr. Kuhn is survived by his wife, Julie, and two daughters, Melora and Lydia, all of Lexington; his mother, Nina, of Cincinnati, and a brother, Jeffrey, also of Cincinnati.
