        Roy J. Karrell, who founded a cosmetics company, died Monday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 44.
        The cause was complications of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Karrell was born in Boston. He began his career in 1969 as an apprentice makeup artist at the Elizabeth Arden counter of Bloomingdale's in Manhattan. Then he moved to Chanel and Lancome and was promoted to management. Later he became a vice president of Halston Orlane.
        In 1985 he founded his own cosmetic line, Visage Beaute, which he first marketed in beauty salons and at Nordstrom stores. After Revlon bought the company in 1988, he stayed on as the operation's president and chief executive for three years.
        His survivors include two sisters, Nadia Zogbi of Cleveland and Matia Karrell of Malibu.
