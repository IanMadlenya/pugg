        Guy Douvier, a Paris couturier who had worked in New York and was known for popular and reasonably priced designs, died on Sept. 7 in Paris, The Times of London reported last week. He was 65.
        He suffered a heart attack, the Guy Laroche fashion house announced.
        Mr. Douvier took over the designing of the house's ready-to-wear clothes in the early 1970's, under the direction of Mr. Laroche, and had been in charge of that area since Mr. Laroche died in 1989.
        The French news agency Agence France-Presse wrote recently that "Douvier continued the house tradition of discreet and refined designs at affordable prices, which exported well."
        Mr. Douvier was born in Noumea in New Caledonia and studied painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He went to work with Coco Chanel in 1955 and later with the house of Dior.
        In 1961, Dior transferred him to its Christian Dior-New York unit, in the garment district. He was the first of the Dior designers to be specifically assigned to Seventh Avenue, and he remained there until 1969, when he was succeeded by Gaston Berthelot.
        Early in his years in New York, Mr. Douvier observed: "In Paris, the women wear more gray, black and beige. They wear heavier fabrics because their rooms are colder." Americans, he said, preferred brighter colors and wanted lightweight fabrics.
        He is survived by his wife.
