        Marlo Lewis, a television producer who was co-creator of "The Ed Sullivan Show," died on Tuesday at a hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 77 and lived in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
        The cause was heart failure, said his sister, Monica Lewis of Beverly Hills, Calif.
        In 1948, with Ed Sullivan, Mr. Lewis created and produced "The Toast of the Town," which was soon renamed "The Ed Sullivan Show." A year later, he became executive producer of East Coast variety and comedy shows for CBS. He created or was instrumental in producing a number of successful shows, including "The Jackie Gleason Show," "The Sergeant Bilko Show" with Phil Silvers, and Dinah Shore's talk show. He also produced several musical specials for Perry Como in the mid-1960's.
        After acting as co-producer of "The Ed Sullivan Show" for 12 years, Mr. Lewis left in 1960 to set up an independent production company. One of his first projects was a television adaptation of the ballet "The Nutcracker," broadcast by ABC as a Christmas special in 1961.
        Mr. Lewis joined the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency in 1967 and was elected vice chairman the following year. He was a founder of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and shared the George Foster Peabody Award for Humanitarian Activities with Ed Sullivan. In 1992 he was elected to the Television Producers Hall of Fame.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife of 53 years, Mina Bess Lewis; two children, and four grandchildren.
