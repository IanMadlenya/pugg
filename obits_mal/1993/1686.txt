        Eric Estorick, a dealer in many varieties of modern art and a collector of 20th-century Italian paintings, died on Saturday at his home in London. He was 80.
        He had been suffering from a heart ailment, said his daughter, Isobel.
        Mr. Estorick and his wife, Salome, met the Russian-born Art Deco designer Erte in the mid-1960's, and the agency they founded, Seven Arts Ltd., of New York and London, became his exclusive representative until the artist's death in 1990.
        Mr. Estorick grew up in Brooklyn. He earned a doctorate in sociology from New York University, taught for a time at Columbia University and worked for the State Department during World War II.
        He began collecting art after the war, and served privately as a dealer for several Hollywood notables and other clients. In 1960, he and his wife opened the Grosvenor Gallery in the Mayfair district of London. The gallery is still operating.
        Mr. Estorick's writings include the books "Stafford Cripps: Prophetic Rebel" (1940), "Stafford Cripps: Master Statesman" (1949) and "Changing Empire: Churchill to Nehru" (1950).
        Mr. Estorick's wife died in 1989. In addition to his daughter, Isobel, of Los Angeles, he is survived by a son, Michael J., of London, and a grandchild.
