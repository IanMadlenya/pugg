        David B. Tyler, an American naval historian and retired professor, died on Friday at a nursing home in Riverhead, L.I. He was 93 and lived in Amagansett, L.I.
        He died of a heart failure after a long illness, his family said.
        His first volume on maritime history, "Steam Conquers the Atlantic" (Appleton-Century, 1939), was used for years as a text at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. The New York Times Book Review called his account "richly detailed and well written."
        Dr. Tyler wrote and edited several other books and won a Guggenheim fellowship for his work. He was on the boards of the Long Island and Richmond County Historical Societies.
        He started teaching history at Brooklyn and Hobart Colleges but spent most of his career at Wagner College on Staten Island, where he was on the faculty for 45 years.
        Dr. Tyler was born in Brooklyn and became interested in the sea in his youth while spending summers in Bellport, L.I., on the Great South Bay.
        After graduating from Williams College and Oxford University, he earned his doctorate at Columbia. He also studied at Yale Divinity School and for a time was a circuit preacher in the mountains of Colorado, riding horseback from one to church to another.
        During World War II, Dr. Tyler served as a Lieutenant Commander in the Naval Reserve, worked for the Office of Naval Records and wrote a history of the Maritime Commission's wartime role.
        His first marriage, to the former Katharine Haskell, ended with her death.
        His survivors include his wife of 34 years, the former Elizabeth Sloan; a son, John C. of Manhattan; a daughter, Sandra Rintoul Tyler of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
