        Guy Emerson Noyes, an economist who directed research and analyzed trends for the Federal Reserve Board and later for the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, died on Sunday at the Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 79 and lived in Naples.
        His wife, Irene, said the cause of death was massive infection.
        Mr. Noyes joined the Federal Reserve System in 1948 as an adviser to its board of governors and served as director of research and statistics from 1960 to 1965, when he joined Morgan Guaranty as senior vice president and economist.
        Reflecting on that move in an interview, he said, "After you have been pushing buttons in Washington for years to get the economy to behave the way you want it to, there's a certain intellectual fascination about wanting to try it on the other side -- to see how policy from Washington affects the private decision-making process."
        During his 13 years at Morgan he centralized its various economic analysis units and established the company's economic research unit as one of the strongest on Wall Street.
        Mr. Noyes, who was generally known as Jack, was a native of Columbia, Mo., and the son of the dean of the University of Missouri's Medical School. After graduating from Missouri he studied banking as a graduate student at Yale University.
        In World War II he served as Army Reserve officer in London. After the war he became a research director at the State Department, where he remained two years before going to the Federal Reserve Board.
        His first marriage ended with the death of his wife, the former Patricia Hartnett, in 1972. Besides his wife Irene, he is survived by a son, Guy Jr., of Seattle; a daughter, Pamela, of Great Falls, Va., and a grandchild.
