        George A. Kochevitsky, a concert pianist and music teacher, died on Tuesday at his home. He was 90, and lived in Manhattan.
        The author of two books on pianism, Mr. Kochevitsky continued to write and act as a consultant for performing artists until his health began to fail several months ago.
        He was born in Velikiye Luki in Russia and studied piano in Moscow and St. Petersburg. Later, he taught in schools and colleges around what had by then become Leningrad, but was arrested in 1933 and sent to Siberia for three years as a political prisoner.
        Mr. Kochevitsky made his way to Poland and Germany at the end of World War II. He reached New York in 1949 and started teaching the piano privately in his Manhattan study.
        His contributions to the periodical Bach led to an honorary membership in the Riemenschneider Bach Institute at Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, where the journal is published three times a year in conjunction with the American Bach Society. He also wrote "The Art of Piano Playing: A Scientific Approach" (1967), which explored the function of the central nervous system in piano technique and performance, and "On Playing Bach: Performing Bach's Keyboard Music" (1991).
