        DeWitt Clair Baldwin, a former Methodist missionary, educator and advocate of world peace, died on March 16 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 94 and lived in Rockville, Md.
        His son, Dr. DeWitt C. Baldwin Jr. of Chicago, said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.
        Dr. Baldwin was founder and director emeritus of the Lisle Fellowship, a student program intended to promote international understanding. For half a century, he directed the program, established in 1936 at Freedom House in New York City and now based in Toledo, Ohio.
        As early as 1958, Dr. Baldwin and his wife, Edna, led what was probably the first student exchange of the cold war to the Soviet Union. In the mid-1970's, he promoted the concept of a National Academy of Peace, which evolved into the 1984 United States Institute of Peace, set up to encourage scholarly studies of international diplomacy and conflict resolution.
        Dr. Baldwin was director of the Office of Religious Affairs at the University of Michigan from 1948 to 1968.
        He and his wife began their international work in 1923, as missionaries to Rangoon, Burma. Returning to the United States, he was secretary of student work for the Methodist Board of Missions and Church Extension in New York City from 1936 to 1945.
        Besides his son, he is survived by a sister, Virginia Kinney of Orange City, Fla., and two granddaughters.
