        Robert E. Harrah, an industrialist, died Wednesday at his home southeast of Willits. He was 77.
        His family said the cause was cancer.
        In 1942, Mr. Harrah began a lucrative business career that took him into corporate boardrooms across the United States by starting a sawmill with his three brothers. He soon after started Harrah Machine Works, a producer of sawmill equipment. He then founded Remco Hydraulics Inc. and Microphor Inc.
        Remco was acquired by Stanrey Corporation of Chicago in the early 1970's, and Mr. Harrah became chairman of the board and chief executive officer of that corporation.
        In 1977 Stanrey was acquired by the Abex Corporation of New York, and Mr. Harrah became a corporation director and special assistant to the Abex president. Mr. Harrah also served until 1987 as a director of Illinois Central Industries, the corporate parent of Abex.
        Until his death, Mr. Harrah served as chairman of the family-owned Harrah Industries.
        In 1988 Mr. Harrah and his wife, Jayne, donated the land and materials for construction of the Willits center for the elderly, which was later named in honor of Mr. Harrah's father, William F. Harrah. Mr. Harrah also served as chairman of the Frank R. Howard Foundation, the fund-raising arm of Howard Hospital in Willits, a town in Northern California.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Harrah is survived by two daughters, Margie Handley and Bonnie Dye; three sisters, Nancy Knick, Lillian Harrah and Julia La Bare; 6 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
