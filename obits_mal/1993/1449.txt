        Andrew A. Caffrey, a former chief judge of Federal District Court in Boston, died Wednesday in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he was attending a judicial conference. Judge Caffrey, who lived in Andover, Mass., was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        Among the trials over which Judge Caffrey presided were one against a draft card burner in the mid-1960's that went to the Supreme Court and a bid by a hockey player, Derek Sanderson, that led to his joining the new American Hockey League. He was also the presiding judge in a 1989 Boston voting rights case in which he ruled that districts redrawn to give voters more influence over City Council and School Committee elections violated the constitutional principle of one man, one vote.
        Born in Lawrence, Mass., Judge Caffrey graduated from Holy Cross College in 1941. He started studying law at Boston College Law School but interrupted his studies to serve in the Army Signal Corps' signal intelligence branch during World War II. Judge Caffrey graduated from Boston College Law School in 1948.
        Judge Caffrey taught law at Boston College until 1955, when he joined the office of the United States Attorney. In 1960 he was named to the United States District Court in Boston and in March 1972 was appointed chief judge of the court. In October 1986 Judge Caffrey became a senior judge of the court. He served on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation from 1975 until 1990.
        Judge Caffrey is survived by his wife, Evelyn, six children and 14 grandchildren.
