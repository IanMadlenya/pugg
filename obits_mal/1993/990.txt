        Don Drysdale, the Hall of Fame pitcher for the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers whose hopping fastball and brushback pitches put fear into batters during 14 major league seasons, was found dead in a hotel room in Montreal yesterday. He was 56.
        His death was announced by the Dodgers' management. A team broadcaster, Vin Scully, said during last night's broadcast: "He was found dead in his hotel room, obviously a victim of a heart attack."
        Drysdale was in Montreal for the weekend series with the Expos as one of the team's broadcasters.
        Drysdale was a star pitcher of his age, from 1956 to 1969. He amassed a career record of 209 victories and 167 losses. A Week After Campanella
        Drysdale, who led the National League in strikeouts three times, is the second Dodger Hall of Famer to die in the past week. Roy Campanella, who was Drysdale's catcher when the pitcher was a 20-year-old rookie in 1956, died of heart attack on June 26.
        Drysdale played in five World Series and was a member of the Dodgers' World Series championship teams in 1959, 1963 and 1965. Drysdale, a right-hander, and Sandy Koufax, a lefty, were regarded as the finest combination then in the game.
        In 1957, the Dodgers' final season in Brooklyn, Drysdale was the ace of the staff with a 17-9 record.
        His best season was 1962 when "Big D" had a won-lost record of 25-9 and received the Cy Young Award as the outstanding pitcher in the major leagues. He led the National League with 41 starts, 314 1/3 innings pitched and 287 strikeouts. He also was 23-12 in 1965. A Fastball Called Fear
        Drysdale was a pitcher of the old school whose brushback pitches have been curbed by rules and are virtually unknown in today's game.
        "I never hit anybody in the head in my life," he recalled. "But you have to move them off the plate; you have to get them out of there. This was part of the game and everybody accepted it as part of the game.
        "Once the manager came out to the mound and instructed me to walk a batter. I wound up hitting him instead. Why waste four pitches when one will do? Sooner or later you have to say it's my ball and half the plate is mine. Only I never let on which half of the plate I wanted."
        Drysdale was selected to 10 National League All-Star teams and set major league records of 6 consecutive shutouts and 58 consecutive scoreless innings in 1968.
        As a broadcaster, Drysdale was in his fifth season with the Dodgers and his 22d overall. His career included 10 years with ABC. He was inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame in 1984.
        Born in Van Nuys, Calif., Drysdale was a high school phenomenon whom the Dodgers signed in 1954 for a $4,000 bonus and a salary of $600 a month. In his first start, he beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6-1, striking out 9. He had a 5-5 record in 1956. A season later, he had a 17-9 record and earned a reputation as not being afraid to throw at old pros.
        Largely forgotten was Drysdale the hitter: he hit seven home runs in 1958 in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Dodgers' first home when they moved to Los Angeles. Drysdale batted .300 with 7 home runs in 1965 and had 29 career homers. A 'Free Agent' in 1966
        Drysdale and Koufax were teammates before free agency and player agents became part of the game. They held out in tandem in 1966, missing spring training before settling for more than $100,000 each, the first pitchers to reach six figures.
        In recent years, Drysdale had become a critic of modern-day players.
        "You have to wonder when two players of different teams have the same agent," he said. "Who are these players really loyal to, the agent or their teams? You don't see 15 guys going out for a beer anymore. You see 24 guys living in 24 different single rooms on the road, and in some instances, taking 24 different cabs to the stadium."
        Among his survivors is his wife, Ann Meyers Drysdale, a former all-America basketball player at the University of California at Los Angeles and a network broadcaster of basketball games. In February, she was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.
