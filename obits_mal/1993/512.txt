        Ray Haight, a former racing announcer who served as director of publicity for Monmouth Park from 1971 until his retirement in 1988, died Tuesday at his home in Oceanport, N.J. He was 67.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, a track spokesman said.
        Mr. Haight had been in racing since the age of 15, when he began helping his father, Walter, later a racing columnist for The Washington Post, as he called out positions of the horses on the track for Associated Press chartmakers.
        He later worked as a chart caller and eventually as a race announcer for various tracks in West Virginia and Maryland. For more than 30 years he also regularly announced the Belmont Stakes, the Preakness and other important stakes races for radio and television.
        Mr. Haight is survived by a son, Steven, and a daughter, Lynn.
