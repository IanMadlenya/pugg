        John S. Lampe, a senior vice president and director of advertising for Paine Webber Inc., the securities concern, died on Monday at his house on Nantucket Island. He was 65 and lived in Short Hills, N.J.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Jeffrey Z. Taufield, a spokesman for Paine Webber.
        Mr. Lampe (pronounced LAMP-ee) joined the Manhattan-based company as advertising director in 1974. Over the years, his responsibilities included overseeing public relations and special events.
        Under his supervision, the Marschalk Company, an advertising agency, created the "Thank You, Paine Webber" campaign in 1976, and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising created Paine Webber's "We Invest in Relationships" campaign, introduced in 1991.
        Mr. Lockwood was born in Manhattan, graduated from Yale in 1949 and was an Air Force pilot during the Korean War.
        He is survived by his wife of 12 years, the former Nancy Wilson; two sons from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce, John of South Hamilton, Mass., and Stephen of Wraysbury, England; his mother, Dorothy Van Gelder of Sun City, Ariz., and four grandchildren.
