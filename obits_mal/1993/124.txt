        Enzo Angiolini, 50, a designer of women's and men's shoes in the United States and Italy, died on Jan. 3 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He lived in Manhattan and Florence, Italy.
        He died of cancer, according to a statement issued by his shoe company's corporate parent, the Nine West Group in Stamford, Conn.
        Mr. Angioloni, who at the age of 15 started as an apprentice in a shoe factory in his home town of Montopoli, Italy, rose in the industry there and expanded his efforts to the United States.
        He designed shoe styles for Edison Brothers, McCann's and the United States Shoe Corporation's Bandolino brand. Since 1984, he had had a line of women's shoes in his own name. His designs ranged from dress to casual, influenced other designers and proved popular at leading stores.
        Early in his career he designed shoes for Domani, a Genesco brand, and later worked for Salvatore Montinaro. In 1978 he was recruited by the Marx & Newman division of United States Shoe to design the Bandolino line. Under his leadership, it grew from a $13 million-a-year business to a business of $120 million a year.
        Surviving are his father, Ugolino; two brothers, Remo and Bruno, and a sister, Rosanna Angiolini, all of Montopoli.
