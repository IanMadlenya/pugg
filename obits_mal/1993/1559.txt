        The Rev. Robert Miller Davidson, a former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) who recently retired as pastor of the West Park Presbyterian Church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, died on Saturday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had a rare blood disease, his church said.
        Mr. Davidson acquired a national reputation for his leadership on such issues as peace and social justice. He was chosen as Moderator of the United Presbyterian Church -- its chief elected officer -- in 1981 and played an important role in the later merger with its smaller Southern sister denomination, the Presbyterian Church in the United States. Together they formed the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
        A native of Queens, Mr. Davidson graduated from Queens College and Union Theological Seminary. He was ordained in 1953, and served as pastor and community organizer in New York City, the Chicago area and northern California.
        He returned to New York in 1974 to become spiritual leader of the West Park Presbyterian Church, at Amsterdam Avenue and 86th Street, and filled that post until his retirement on Oct. 1.
        Mr. Davidson is survived by a daughter, Emily Joan, a student in Seneca Falls, N.Y., and a son, James W., of Berkeley, Calif. His wife of 41 years, Evelyn Sickles Davidson, died last December.
