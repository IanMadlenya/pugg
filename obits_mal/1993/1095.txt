        Ray DeVoll, a tenor who specialized in early music and chamber works, died on Tuesday at a Boston gymnasium. He was 66.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his manager, Albert Kay.
        Mr. DeVoll was a frequent performer with the New York Pro Musica, singing everything from Elizabethan madrigals to music by Monteverdi and the role of the Archangel in a 13th-century Easter drama, "The Play of the Risen Christ." He also appeared in "The Play of Daniel" at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and "The Play of Herod" at the Cloisters.
        He was a professor of voice at the New England Conservatory.
        He is survived by a sister, Patricia Flynn, and a brother, Carl, both of California.
