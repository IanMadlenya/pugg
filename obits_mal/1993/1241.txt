        Carl Leff, co-founder of the National Spinning Company and a philanthropist, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 95 and had lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Leff, who graduated from Columbia dental school in 1919, joined his brother, Phillip, soon afterward in establishing their yarn-manufacturing company in New York City. The mills were in North Carolina.
        Mr. Leff was a founder of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York. He served as vice president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York and when the federation merged with United Jewish Appeal, he became a member of the combined executive committee.
        In the 1930's, he helped dozens of Jews escape the Nazis.
        Mr. Leff served on the board of the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn and was a trustee of the Long Island College of Medicine. He also was a fellow of Brandeis University and a founder of Shenkar College of Textile Technology and Fashion in Israel.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; two daughters -- Marjorie Miller of Scarsdale, N. Y., and Maxine Myers of West Orange, N.J.; a sister, Fannie Harris of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
