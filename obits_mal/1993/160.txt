        The Rev. Kent L. Kiser, pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Trenton for the last 33 years, died on Friday at his Trenton home. He was 77 years old.
        He had a heart attack, the family's physician, Dr. Scott Kolander, said.
        Mr. Kiser, a native of Russell County, Va., worked as a rural letter carrier before serving in the Army in the Pacific in World War II. He was ordained in the First Baptist Church in Richmond in 1949, graduated from the University of Richmond and received a master of divinity degree at Colgate Rochester Divinity School in 1952.
        Before coming to Trenton in 1960, he led congregations in Ontario, N.Y., and Pittsburgh. Under his leadership, Grace Baptist Church became racially integrated, and he remained an active civil rights advocate throughout his career. He was a member of the City Board of Education in Trenton from 1969 to 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Howie Bingham Kiser; a daughter, Melissa Kiser of Trenton; a sister, Virginia Kiser Fletcher of Kingsport, Tenn., and a grandson.
