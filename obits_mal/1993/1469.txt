        Richard A. Wolters, an expert on training hunting dogs, died on Saturday after he landed an ultralight aircraft that he had been piloting near his farm in Hanover, Va. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Wolters wrote a number of books on dogs, including three published by Dutton, "Gun Dog" (1961), "Family Dog" (1963) and "Beau, From Both Ends of His Leash" (1966), and "The Labrador Retriever" (Petersen Prints, 1982).
        Mr. Wolters was also a chemical engineer, a parachutist, a glider pilot, a teacher of art history and photography and a magazine editor who wrote extensively about dogs and field sports. He especially admired Labradors for their diligence, devotion, stamina, pleasant temperament and ability to become family pets.
        Mr. Wolters was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Pennsylvania State University.
        He is survived by his wife, Olive; a son, Roger, of Landrum, S.C., and a daughter, Gretchen D'Beck, of Ossining, N.Y.
