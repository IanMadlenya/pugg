        Gerald Ames, who wrote more than 50 children's books on science and magic, many of which were translated into other languages, died on Jan. 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife and co-author, Rose Wyler.
        Among the best-known of the Ames-Wyler books were the "Giant Golden Book of Astronomy" (1950), "Magic Secrets" (1954) and "Secrets in Stones" (1954).
        Mr. Ames was also a painter and exhibited regularly with the Port Clyde Arts and Crafts Society, in Port Clyde, Me., and with Arts Interaction, in New York City.
        Born in Rochester, Mr. Ames, whose original name was Gerald Otto, earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Rochester in 1929 and then moved to New York City.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Eva-Lee Baird of Manhattan; two stepsons, Joseph Kosok of Vancouver, Wash., and Karl Kosok of Silver Spring, Md., and seven grandchildren.
