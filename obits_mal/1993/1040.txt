        David E. Kirschenbaum, a leader against violence directed at gay people because of their sexual orientation, died on Sunday at home in Manhattan, at the age of 30.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Kirschenbaum was a board member and former deputy executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Antiviolence Project.
        He organized its system, which was copied elsewhere, for recording cases and statistics on violent attacks. The figures are used to lobby legislators for stronger laws and to pressure law-enforcement agencies to take the violence more seriously. Active in Rivera Case
        Mr. Kirschenbaum was active in seeking prosecution for the 1990 killing of Julio Rivera, a gay man from Queens who was stabbed with a knife and bludgeoned with a wrench and a claw hammer. After complaints that authorities were playing down the case, more serious charges were lodged against the suspects. Two were convicted of murder, and a third pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
        Before becoming the project's deputy director, he served as the director of finance and administration. He increased the project's grant income and organized a subway advertising campaign offering help for victims of domestic violence in gay relationships.
        He was also an early member and former treasurer of the AIDS advocacy group Act Up, a founder of the Gay Circles discussion group, a counselor for the National Gay/Lesbian Crisisline and a volunteer for the Fund for Human Dignity.
        Mr. Kirschenbaum was born in Brooklyn and grew up in New City, N.Y.
        He was a graduate of Wesleyan University.
        His survivors include his companion, Gary Clare; his parents, Audrey and Peter of New City, and a sister, Nancy Kopilnick of Montclair, N.J.
