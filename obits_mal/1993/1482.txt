        Walter B. Newman, who wrote the screenplays for "The Man With the Golden Arm" and "Cat Ballou," died on Thursday at his home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He was 77.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Connie.
        Mr. Newman was born in New York City. He earned a bachelor's degree at New York University and studied law at Harvard University. After working as a publicist in New York and serving in the Army during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles and began writing radio dramas, notably "The Halls of Ivy," with Ronald Coleman, and "Columbia Workshop." He was also a co-writer of the pilot episode for the radio series "Gunsmoke," which established the characters that were later popular in the television series of the same name.
        Three of his screenplays were nominated for Academy Awards: "Ace in the Hole," "Cat Ballou" (1965) and "Blood Brothers" (1978).
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Joshua, of Lafayette, Calif., and a daughter, Elizabeth, of Los Angeles.
