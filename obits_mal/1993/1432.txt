        Dr. Harold Zarowitz, a pioneer in the treatment of diabetes in the New York area, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. Dr. Zarowitz, a tive and resident of Brooklyn, was 70.
        The cause of death was complications from diabetes, said his son, Ronald. He said his father had been insulin-dependent from age 18.
        Dr. Zarowitz was one of the earliest advocates of the rigid-control concept of treating diabetes. That approach involves constant monitoring of insulin levels, and allowing insulin to be supplied in smaller doses to simulate the body's own insulin production rather than giving a single dose to last the day.
        Dr. Zarowitz graduated from New York University and its Medical School. He began his practice in the 1940's, becoming one of New York's first practitioners to specialize in diabetes.
        In the 1960's, he was named chief of the diabetes and pregnancy clinic at the Jewish Hospital and Medical Center of Brooklyn, now part of the Interfaith Medical Center. Under his guidance, the clinic succeeded in greatly reducing infant mortality among diabetic mothers. He retired in 1978 when his health began to fail.
        Besides his son, who lives in West Bloomfield, Mich., he is survived by his wife of 45 years, Barbara Wolfshaut Zarowitz, and two grandchildren.
