        Wallace M. Cohen, a retired Washington lawyer who was an expert in regulatory and administrative law, died on Saturday at Sibley Memorial Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Washington.
        A native of Norton, Va., he graduated from Harvard University. He began in private practice in Boston but moved to Washington in 1940 to work for the Government as a specialist in regulatory legislation.
        After World War II, he joined James Landis and Seymour J. Rubin in founding Landis, Cohen & Rubin. Mr. Landis, a former dean of Harvard Law School, was an architect of the legislation that created the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Over the following four decades, the firm dealt with such issues as immigration, restitution claims by victims of the Holocaust and the wartime internment of American citizens of Japanese descent. Mr. Cohen specialized in utilities regulation and the pricing of electric power production and transmission in North America.
        He and his family supported Clinch Valley College of the University of Virginia at Wise, a liberal, four-year college. Working through the Cohen Family Foundation, they supported cultural and educational activities and helped build the Chapel of All Faiths at the college.
        Mr. Cohen is survived by two sons, Edward S., of Washington, and David W., of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a daughter, Anne Winkelman of Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
