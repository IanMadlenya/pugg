        Dr. Anatol Dinbergs, who recently retired as Latvia's Ambassador to the United States, died on Tuesday at his home in Washington. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, the Latvian Embassy said.
        After entering the diplomatic service of Latvia in 1932, Dr. Dinbergs was first posted to the United States in 1937 as a vice consul in New York. After the Soviet invasion of the Baltic republics at the beginning of World War II, he was assigned to Latvia's legation in exile in Washington.
        He later became first secretary, counselor and then charge d'affaires in 1970. When Latvia regained independence in 1991, the legation was upgraded to an embassy and he was named Ambassador and delegate to the United Nations. He retired in December.
        Dr. Dinbergs, who was born in Riga, received a law degree from the University of Latvia and a degree from the French Institute in Riga. He did graduate work in political science at Georgetown University, where he received a Ph.D. in 1953.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two sons, Anatol of Rockville, Md., and Andre Michael of Geneva, and two grandchildren.
