        The Rev. Joseph I. Dirvin, retired secretary of St. John's University and biographer of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, died on Sunday at St. Catherine's Infirmary in Philadelphia. He was 75 and lived on the university's Queens campus until recently.
        The cause was heart failure, the university's announcement said.
        Father Dirvin, whose career at St. John's started in 1958, was a member of the Vincentian Order. He retired this year as vice president for university relations, special assistant to the president and university secretary. He had coordinated the departments of public relations, development and alumni relations since 1970.
        Born in Germantown, Pa., he graduated from St. Joseph's College in Princeton, N.J., and was ordained in Philadelphia in 1943. He took a variety of assignments before earning a master's degree at St. John's in 1956.
        He was the author of several books and served as editor in chief of the 15-volume "Writings of St. Vincent DePaul, French Saint and Social Reformer (1580-1660)." Among his biographies were "St. Catherine Laboure of the Miraculous Medal" (Farrar, Straus, 1958) and "Louise de Marillac" with an introduction by Terrence Cardinal Cooke (Farrar, 1970).
        The canonization of Mother Seton, the first American-born saint of the Roman-Catholic Church, in 1975 prompted a special reissue and fresh success for his book, "Mother Seton." First published by Farrar in 1962, it chronicles her conversion and dedication as the founder of American Sisters of Charity and an organizer of schools and orphanages.
        Father Dirvin is survived by a sister, Sister Marie Philippone of St. Teresa's Convent in Runnemade, N.J.
