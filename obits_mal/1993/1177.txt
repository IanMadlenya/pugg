        Dr. Hylan A. Bickerman, an internist who was an expert in chest diseases, died on Saturday at his home in Bayside, Queens. He was 79.
        He had been in poor health for months, said his son, Peter.
        Dr. Bickerman was a clinical professor of medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University's medical school, from 1978 until his retirement in 1981. He later was a special lecturer there.
        He was also a former chief of the asthma-emphysema clinic at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and a former director of the pulmonary function laboratory at Doctors Hospital, now part of the Beth Israel Medical Center. In 1990, Beth Israel named a wing of the former Doctors Hospital in his honor.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Bickerman grew up in Manhattan and Brooklyn. He graduated from Columbia College and earned a master's degree there in biochemistry. He received his medical degree from New York University Medical School in 1939.
        He served in the Army during World War II, rising to the rank of major. He became an instructor in medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1948 and an associate clinical professor of medicine in 1957.
        Survivors include his wife of 52 years, who practiced anesthesiology under her maiden name, Dr. Evelyn Apogi; his son, Peter, of Readfield, Me.; a daughter, Pamela, of Nissequogue, L.I.; a sister, Helen Shulman of Cincinnati, and four grandchildren.
