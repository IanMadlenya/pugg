        James Edward O'Driscoll, an administrator at the Institute of International Education in Manhattan, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. He was 57 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. O'Driscoll was director of placement and special education at the institute. His division evaluates the requirements of scholarship students and places them at suitable colleges and universities in this country and abroad.
        The institute was founded after World War I to promote international understanding through the exchange of students, scholars and ideas. It has grown into the largest private, nonprofit cultural and educational exchange agency in the United States, with a budget of more than $130 million.
        Mr. O'Driscoll taught in Columbia's American language program and, briefly, at City College before joining the institute in 1974 as a coordinator in its orientation program. He was director of the English and special services division before taking his most recent position in 1987.
        While at Columbia, he was president of the junior faculty and a member of the faculty senate.
        Mr. O'Driscoll is survived by his wife of 22 years, Dorothy Marie Miner, counsel to the New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission; his mother, Catherine E. O'Driscoll of New York City, and a sister, Patricia O'Driscoll Schulder of Harrisburg, Pa.
