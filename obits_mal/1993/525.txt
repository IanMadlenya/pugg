        Richard H. Growald, a columnist at The San Diego Union-Tribune and a former correspondent for United Press International, died Tuesday at his brother's home near Fort Worth. He was 61.
        The cause was lung cancer, his brother, Martin, said.
        Mr. Growald grew up in Fort Worth. He reported for the Fort Worth Press, which no longer exists, before leaving there in 1952.
        His 40-year career with U.P.I. took him from Boston to the wire service's bureaus in London, Germany and Moscow. He covered Vietnam and the White House before joining The San Diego Union in 1982.
        He is survived by his brother.
