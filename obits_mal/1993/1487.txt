        Peter Moore, a photographer known for his pictures of dance and performance art, died on Tuesday. He was 61.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Barbara, said.
        Beginning in the early 1960's, Mr. Moore documented a variety of avant-garde art, dance and theater performances, including the ephemeral events staged by artists associated with the Fluxus movement. In the process he assembled an archive of over half a million pictures of performances by George Maciunas, Allan Kaprow, Nam June Paik, Joan Jonas, Yvonne Rainer and many others.
        Mr. Moore, who was born in London, attended Haverford College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950's before going to work in the darkrooms of Life magazine. He later taught photography and wrote widely on the medium, and worked from 1978 to 1989 as a technical editor and columnist for Modern Photography magazine.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Moore is survived by his daughters, Robin, of Washington, and Rebecca, of New York City; his parents, Herbert and Alice, of Paradise, Calif.; and two brothers, Christopher, of Belmont, Mass., and Anthony, of Gibbsboro, N.J.
