        Dr. Robert Struthers Beekman, an internist and heart specialist, died on Friday at Greenwich Woods Health Care Center in Greenwich, Conn. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan and Southport, Conn.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Beekman was a retired senior attending physician at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Until he retired in 1981, he kept a private practice in addition to his hospital duties.
        As president of the medical board of St. Luke's Hospital, he played a central role in its 1979 merger with Roosevelt Hospital.
        He was born in New York City and graduated from Harvard College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. He was a direct descendant of William Beekman, who reached Manhattan in the mid-1600's with the Dutch West India Company.
        Dr. Beekman was active in civic and charitable causes and over the years served on the boards of many medical, community-service, cultural and educational organizations and foundations. He was a past secretary and vice president of the New York Historical Society and board president of Greer School in Milbrook, N.Y.
        He is survived by his son, William B., of Manhattan; two daughters, Isabelle and Mary, and six grandchildren.
