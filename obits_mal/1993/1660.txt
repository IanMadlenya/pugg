        Nixon Griffis, a conservationist, trustee of the New York Zoological Society and former owner of Brentano's book stores, died on Friday at Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Pa. He was 76 and lived in Naples, Fla., where he had moved from Manhattan about four years ago.
        He had had a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Griffis was born in Manhattan and was a 1940 graduate of Cornell University. He served as a lieutenant in the Army Signal Corps in World War II before joining the investment banking firm of Hemphill, Noyes & Company as a partner.
        His father, Stanton Griffis, was a principal in the firm. A financier and former chairman of Madison Square Garden, Stanton Griffis acquired control of Brentano's in 1933 from the Brentano family, who had founded it in 1870. His son, serving as president and chairman, expanded the chain to 16 stores and sold it to Crowell-Collier Publishers, now part of Macmillan Publishing Company, in 1962.
        After that, Mr. Griffis spent much of his time in the cause of conservation. He became an assistant to the director of the New York Aquarium and then a trustee of the Zoological Society.
        In that capacity he traveled the world to gather breeding herds of endangered species. He also sponsored underwater archeological explorations of Bronze Age and Byzantine wrecks off the coast of Turkey.
        He was a founding director and past president of the American Littoral Society and a member of the Explorers Club. He had a fish named after him: Holocanthus Griffisi, a type of angelfish discovered in the South Pacific about eight years ago.
        Mr. Griffis is survived by a daughter, Hethea Nye of Manhattan; two sons, Hughes, of New London, Conn., and Nixon S., of Palm Beach, Fla., and four grandchildren.
