        Donald A. Berreth, director of public affairs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, died yesterday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta. He was 57.

        He was born in South Dakota and graduated from South Dakota State University. In 1970 he joined the Food and Drug Administration and became a press officer. Five years later, he was named director of the public affairs office of the centers, a Federal agency.
        He is survived by his wife, Donna; a son, Nowell D.; a daughter, Emily M.; his parents, Albert and Ottelia Berreth of Eureka, S.D.; a sister, Carolyn Oster, also of Eureka, and a brother, James D. Berreth of Watertown, Minn.
