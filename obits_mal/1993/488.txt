        Francis J. Gaudette, executive vice president and chief financial officer at the Microsoft Corporation, died Friday at the Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle. He was 57.
        He died after an eight-month battle with cancer, said Marty Taucher, a spokesman for the software maker, which is based in Redmond, Wash.
        Mr. Gaudette, who joined Microsoft in 1984 as senior vice president of finance and administration and chief financial officer, became a member of the company's top management group when picked by the chairman, William H. Gates, as a member of a three-person office of the president in February 1992.
        He was born in Queens, attended Fordham University and received a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting from Southern Methodist University.
        Mr. Gaudette worked at Frito-Lay Inc., the Rockwell International Corporation, Informatics General and C3 Inc.
        He was chosen in 1984 to manage Microsoft's finances because of his experience with transforming privately held concerns into publicly owned corporations. He was instrumental in organizing Microsoft's successful initial public offering of stock in 1986.
        Mr. Gaudette is survived by his wife, Doris, and five children.
