        Prof. John Patrick Sullivan, a Latin scholar, literary historian and critic, died on April 9 at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 62.
        The cause was cancer, said Anthony James Boyle, a friend and colleague at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
        Professor Sullivan, who was born in Liverpool, England, began his career at Oxford University, where he taught ancient philosophy and classicial languages and literature. He came to the United States in 1961 to teach at the University of Texas, where he remained until 1969 and where he edited "Critical Essays on Roman Literature" (1962-63).
        From 1969 to 1978 he taught at the State University of New York, Buffalo, and published a collection of satirical verse, "The Jaundiced Eye" (1976). He also edited a critical anthology on Ezra Pound.
        Professor Sullivan moved to the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1978 and taught there until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Judy; a sister, Pat, and a brother, Denis.
