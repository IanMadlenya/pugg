        Sir Dermot Boyle, Marshal of the Royal Air Force who rose from pilot to chief of the British Air Staff during the Suez crisis of 1956, died Wednesday. He was 88 and lived in the county of Hampshire in southern England.
        He was born in Abbeyleix, Ireland, and attended St. Columba's College in Dublin before becoming one of the R.A.F.'s most skillful pilots in the 1920's.
        During World War II he rose to various high staff posts and operational commands, one of which involved overseeing tactical air support for Allied combat forces on the ground in part of western Europe.
        He was Chief of the Air Staff from 1956 to 1959 and in that post also successfully argued against the prediction by the Defense Minister, Duncan Sandys, that the advent of missiles would mean the end of the fighter aircraft. The British newspaper, The Independent, said Saturday that "Boyle's successful resistance to it was his greatest achievement."
        After leaving the R.A.F. he became vice chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Una Carey; two sons and a daughter.
