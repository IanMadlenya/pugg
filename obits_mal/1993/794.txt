        Frederick J. Streng, a scholar of religion and leader of religious organizations, died on Monday at his home in Dallas at the age of 59.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Streng was the president of the international Society for Buddhist and Christian Studies and the former president of the American Society for the Study of Religion and of the Society for Asian Comparative Philosophy.
        He had taught religion at Southern Methodist University since 1966. He wrote and edited several books, including "Understanding Religious Life" (Wadsworth, 1985), and wrote articles for journals and the Encyclopedia Britannica and the Encyclopedia of Religion.
        He was a board member of the Greater Dallas Community of Churches and past president of the North Texas Association of Unitarian Universalist Societies.
        Dr. Streng was born in Seguin, Tex. He earned a bachelor's degree at Texas Lutheran College, a master's in English at Southern Methodist and a bachelor of divinity and a doctorate in the history of religion at the University of Chicago. He studied at Benares Hindu University in India as a Fulbright scholar and also won Carnegie and Ford fellowships.
        Surviving are his wife of 12 years, the former Susie Blossom; his stepmother, Evelyn; two sons, Mark A. Streng and Steve Deane; two daughters, Elizabeth Ann Devoll and Lisa Evans; two brothers, Adolph Streng and Paul Collinson-Streng; a sister, Esther Staats, and one granddaughter.
