        Harold Maurice Marks, a retired New York real-estate and construction executive, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
        He had had a long illness, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Marks graduated from Cornell University's College of Engineering in 1927, after which he joined the Edgar Ellinger Construction Company. He worked as a chief project engineer at Alwyn Court, a historical landmark at 58th Street and Seventh Avenue, and built the original Normandie Theater on 57th Street.
        The company later concentrated on the management and ownership of properties, and Mr. Marks was its president in the 1960's. He retired from the real-estate business in 1980.
        After that he served as a volunteer at Lenox Hill Hospital, where he spent many hours in the engineering department. He was a member and past governor of the Real Estate Board of New York.
        Mr. Marks is survived by his wife, Ellen Simon Marks; a son, Frederick, and a daughter, Katherine Davis, both of Great Neck, L.I.; a stepdaughter, Ellen Manasse of Ridgewood, N.J.; a stepson, Kenneth Stuart of Purchase, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
