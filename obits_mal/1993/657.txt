        Roger MacDougall, a screenwriter and playwright, died on Thursday at Denville Hall, a residence and nursing home in Northwood, England, outside London. He was 82.
        Mr. MacDougall, John Dighton and Alexander Mackendrick wrote the screenplay for the 1951 comedy "The Man in the White Suit," which starred Alec Guinness. Reviewing the film in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote that the three writers "concocted a most ingenious fable of the mischief that scientists can do with their test tubes and curiosity in disturbing the status quo." It was based on a play script by Mr. MacDougall.
        He and Stanley Mann wrote the screenplay for the 1959 film "The Mouse That Roared," and Mr. Crow ther wrote, also in The Times, "They whip up a lot of cheerful nonsense that makes wild fun of the awesome instruments of modern war."
        Mr. MacDougall and Mr. Mann also wrote the play "Hide and Seek," about the moral problems of a nuclear scientist; it opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in 1957. Mr. MacDougall's other plays included the 1953 comedy "Escapade." Reviewing it in the Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Mr. MacDougall, the script's sole author, had "a sharp pen."
        Mr. MacDougall was born and grew up in Bearsden, near Glasgow. He studied at Glasgow University and moved to London, where he became a writer.
        During much of the 1960's and 70's, he lived in California, where he taught screenwriting for a time. He returned to England permanently in the early 1980's.
        Mr. MacDougall married Renee Dunlop in 1935; she died in 1977. He is survived by a daughter, Elspeth, of Manhattan; a son, Lindsay, of London, and two grandchildren.
