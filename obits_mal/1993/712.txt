        Lester del Rey, an editor and author of dozens of science-fiction novels, died on Monday at New York Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, he was 77.
        He had suffered a brief illness, according to Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett/Ivy, a division of Random House. Until his retirement just over a year ago, he was fantasy editor for the Del Rey Books imprint named after him.
        A native of Saratoga County, Minn., Mr. del Rey attended George Washington University and published his first story at the age of 22. He began to edit in 1947, turned to full-time writing in 1950 and wrote some 40 books of fiction and nonfiction on scientific topics.
        His stories appeared in numerous magazines under his name. He also wrote sports fiction, westerns, mysteries and other magazine pieces using various pen-names.
        Many of Mr. del Rey's books dealt with outer space or robots, and were written for both adults and young readers. But two of his most successful books were set on Earth. "Nerves" (Ballantine Books, 1956) was about an errant nuclear plant. "The 11th Commandment" (Ballantine, 1962) presented a world ruled by a militant religious cult.
        He joined the publishing house as fantasy editor in 1975 when his wife, Judy Lynn del Rey, was science-fiction editor. Del Rey Books was formed two years later with Mrs. del Rey as editor-in-chief and Mr. del Rey in charge of fantasy acquisitions.
        Judy del Rey died in 1986. Mr. del Rey continued to make the decisions on fantasy manuscripts at Del Rey Books until his retirement in February 1992.
