        Robert Hellendale, a retired chief executive in the paper manufacturing industry, died on Saturday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. He was 76 and lived in Riverside, Conn.
        His family said he had been ill for a long time.
        Mr. Hellendale joined the Great Northern Nekoosa Corporation in 1954 as a lawyer and company executive when it had headquarters in Stamford.  He became president and chief executive in 1979 and served as chairman from 1980 until his retirement in 1984. Great Northern Nekoosa was later absorbed by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Hellendale graduated from Wesleyan University and Harvard Law School. In World War II he served with an Army anti-aircraft battalion in the Pacific. Before he went into the paper industry, he practiced law with the New York firm of Carter, Ledyard & Milburn.
        As chief executive of Great Northern Nekoosa, he helped Federal and state officials settle Indian tribal claims to a large area in northern Maine, where the company ran a huge paper mill on the Penobscot River. The Wall Street Transcript named him "top chief executive officer of the paper industry" in 1980.
        Mr. Hellendale is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jill Hibben Hellendale; two sons, William C., of San Francisco, and Rufus P., of Blue Hill, Me., and a daughter, Missy Hellendale of Austin, Tex.
