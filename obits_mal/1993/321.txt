        Henry Stewart, a master tailor of fine men's clothing for more than seven decades, died on March 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
        He died in his sleep, said his daughter, Vicki Bahnasy.
        Mr. Stewart was the favorite tailor of film stars, bankers and prosperous businessmen. A typical handcrafted Stewart suit sold for about $4,000 in recent years. He remained active until his death, his daughter said.
        Mr. Stewart's clients included Robert De Niro, Harrison Ford, Lee Marvin and Paul Newman. He also designed the film wardrobes for a number of Hollywood stars
        He learned his tailoring skills as an 11-year-old in his father's shop on Savile Row in London. He came to New York City from London in 1939 and opened his first shop on Fifth Avenue, later moving to 37 West 57th Street.
        He favored the "Savile Row look" -- broad shoulders, slim hips and tapered waists. He designed his suits and cut the cloth himself but left the sewing to his staff of seven. Suits generally took three to four months to finish, but customers accepted the wait. His son, Gordon, has taken over management of the shop and intends to continue it.
        Besides his daughter, Mrs. Bahnasy, who lives in San Mateo, Calif., and his son, Gordon, Mr. Stewart is survived by his wife, the former Irene Luck, and another son, Roger, of Manhattan.
