        Ron Kostelnik, a former Green Bay Packers defensive tackle, died Friday night as he suffered a heart attack and lost control of his car on Interstate 75 in Kentucky, authorities here said. He was 53.
        An autopsy performed Saturday showed that Mr. Kostelnik died of the heart attack, said Scott County Coroner Marvin S. Yocum.
        The crash occurred while Mr. Kostelnik and his wife, Peggy, were returning to their home in Appleton, Wis., from Florida, Yocum said. She suffered minor injuries in the crash.
        Kostelnik played on the Packers' Super Bowl championship teams in 1967 and 1968, at the end of a seven-year career with Green Bay.
        Mr. Kostelnik, who was chief executive officer of Mainline Industrial Distributors Inc. of Appleton, is survived by his wife, three daughters and a son.
