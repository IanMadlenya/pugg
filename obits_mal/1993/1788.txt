        Dr. Kenneth Scott, a scholar of New York and American genealogy, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Maryland. He was 93 and lived in Douglaston, Queens.
        He had pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Scott was professor emeritus of history at Queens College of the City University of New York. He retired from teaching there in 1970 but continued to publish into his 90's.
        He was the author of more than 50 books and nearly 250 articles in a wide range of journals. His final copyright, in 1991, was for "Naturalizations in the Marine Court, New York City, 1834-1840." He also lectured on subjects ranging from ancient Rome to early America. Documented Counterfeiting
        A past president of the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, Dr. Scott examined musty records in the courts, newspaper files and government offices. He abstracted, compiled, edited and had them published as essential tools for genealogical research.
        One of his particular historical interests was counterfeiting in America. He documented it as a major vexation in "Counterfeiting in Colonial America" (1957) and other books.
        He was a native of Waterbury, Conn. He graduated from Williams College in 1921, attended the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, and earned his master's and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Wisconsin while teaching there. He also did graduate work at the American Academy in Rome and Kaiser Friedrich University in Berlin.
        His pursued his long career as a college teacher of the classics, history and modern languages at Yale, Western Reserve University and Wagner College, among others. He joined the Queens College faculty in 1965.
        Dr. Scott is survived by his wife of 67 years, Aurelia Grether Scott; a daughter, Jean H., of Washington; a son, Kenneth J., of Bethesda, Md., five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
