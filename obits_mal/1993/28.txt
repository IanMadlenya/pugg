        Jim Burgess, a tenor and former disk jockey, died last Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 39.
        He died of AIDS, said his companion, Martin Dillon.
        Mr. Burgess studied voice at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He sang with the Opera Company of Philadelphia and the Rittenhouse Opera Society, and appeared as Florestan in Beethoven's "Fidelio" at the Lake George Opera Festival in New York and as Siegfried and Parsifal with the Liederkranz Society of New York, which awarded him first prize in its Wagner Competition.
        Before turning to opera as a career, Mr. Burgess was a disk jockey at Infinity, Studio 54, the Underground, the Saint and other Manhattan nightclubs.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by a sister, Dawn Krop of Gainesville, Fla., and a brother, Jonathan, of Asheville, N.C.
