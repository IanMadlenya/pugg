        George J. Daly, the president of the New York Foundation for Senior Citizens for the last 10 years, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said Linda Hoffman, executive director of the nonprofit agency that provides thousands of the city's elderly with social services, employment and housing.
        Under Mr. Daly's guidance, the foundation sponsored six innovative buildings and about three dozen programs for older people. Its next project for the homeless is expected to be dedicated in September as the George Daly House, a renovated former schoolhouse on East Fourth Street with 88 housing units.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Daly was active in Democratic Party affairs. He handled the public relations of candidates for both local and national office. He was a longtime member of the Lexington Democratic Club on the Upper East Side and served as a district leader in that area.
        Mr. Daly is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Edna Thamsen.
