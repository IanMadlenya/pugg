        David Paley, a retired senior editor of Parade magazine and associate arts editor at The New York Herald Tribune, died on Sunday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale. He was 90 and a resident of Manhattan before moving to Riverdale in the Bronx several months ago.
        His daughter, Maggie, said he died of cardiorespiratory failure.
        Mr. Paley began his newspaper career as a copy editor for The Knickerbocker News in Albany in the early 1940's. A few years later, he joined The Herald Tribune as a copy editor and in 1960 he became co-editor of the newly founded Lively Arts section, a position he held until The Tribune folded in 1966. After an editorial stint with The World Journal Tribune, he became senior editor at Parade in 1967. After retiring in 1978, he did freelance editing.
        He was born near Minsk, Russia, and was under a year old when his family immigrated to New York City. When his father, a painter, fell ill, the young Paley dropped out of high school and worked as an accounts-receivable clerk for the Standard Oil Company before going into journalism.
        Besides his daughter, Maggie, an author and book critic who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Sylvia Leichtling; a son, Tom, a traditional folk musician in London; a brother, Abe, and a sister, Lee Handleman, both of Nutley, N.J.; a grandson and a great-grandson.
