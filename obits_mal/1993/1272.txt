        Joseph Scoma, who, with his brother Al, turned a six-table coffee shop into a landmark restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, died on Friday at his horse ranch in Sebastopol. He was 77.
        The cause was emphysema and heart trouble, his brother said.
        The two men opened Scoma's Restaurant in 1965 and based their menu on some of their mother's favorite recipes. Today, the restaurant seats 320 and has 160 employees.
        Joseph left the San Francisco restaurant to open Joe Scoma's Restaurant in Emeryville in 1973 and then sold it and developed the horse ranch. His brother still operates the original restaurant.
        Besides his brother, Mr. Scoma is survived by his daughters, Lillian, Joette and Carlette; a son, Joseph Scoma Jr. of Santa Rosa; two sisters, Anna, of San Francisco, and Phyllis, of Fairfax; a niece, Cheryl Creedon of San Anselmo, and five grandchildren.
