        Roy E. LaGrone, a retired art director and illustrator who flew with the Tuskegee airmen in World War II, died on Wednesday at his home in Somerset, N.J. He was 72.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. LaGrone discovered his love for flying as a teen-ager when he paid 50 cents to have a barnstorming stunt pilot take him up in a Ford Trimotor airplane in Pine Bluff, Ark., his native town. "As soon as I got up there, I knew absolutely that this was what I wanted to do," he recalled.
        In the war, he was a member of the 332d Fighter Group, one of four all-black fighter and bomber squadrons that fought in Europe. In the segregated armed forces, they were known as the Tuskegee airmen because they trained at Tuskegee Army Air Corps Field in Alabama. 'Back of the Bus'
        "It's a strange thing to think back to those days," he said at a reunion in 1985. "Forty years has a way of fogging your mind. Here I was, a commissioned officer in the United States Army, an officer and a gentleman, as it were, and in the states I was still forced to sit in the back of the bus."
        He said it was only when he was stationed in Italy that he was able to sit down in a restaurant and be treated like a customer.
        Mr. LaGrone became an Air Force artist who recorded flying missions on canvas. One picture, "Operation Provide Hope," shows a huge Air Force cargo plane on an airstrip in St. Petersburg, Russia, where it was being unloaded of food and supplies last winter.
        He retired in 1991 as the art director of the Rutgers University Medical School in Livingston.
        He is survived by his wife, Ester; two daughters, Marilyn LaGrone-Amaral and Tania LaGrone, both of Los Angeles; a brother, Henry, of Pine Bluff, and one grandson.
