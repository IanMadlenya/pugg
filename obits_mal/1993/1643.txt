        Ethelbert Ely Furlong, a landscape architect whose specialty was Oriental garden design, died on Sunday at his home in Glen Ridge, N.J. He was 98.
        Mr. Furlong executed more than 1,800 landscape design projects in the course of a 60-year career, including public works, industrial and residential designs. He served as garden consultant to the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in the mid-1950's, and collaborated in the creation of the museum's Japanese House in 1954. In 1965, in ceremonies at the White House, he was honored by Lady Bird Johnson with the Albert and Mary Lasker Award for a commercial site he designed in Lanham, Md., featuring Japanese gardens.
        He is survived by a son, Robert Gordon Furlong of Montclair, N.J., 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
