        G. Arthur Blanchet of Manhattan, a retired senior partner of the Wall Street law firm of Bigham Englar Jones & Houston, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 91.
        The cause was an abdominal infection, said Carole Brown, a daughter.
        During his 47-year career with Bigham Englar, Mr. Blanchet represented many insurance companies in New York, Bombay, Geneva, Paris and London. In 1958 he was the president of the International Association of Insurers Counsel.
        Mr. Blanchet graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 1924, and received a law degree from Harvard University in 1927. He joined Bigham Englar on graduation, and became a partner in 1937.
        He is survived by his wife of 61 years, Lucille Kennedy Blanchet of Manhattan; five daughters, Lucille Conklin, Beverly Reiss and Carole Brown, all of Rumson, N.J., and Sister Rosamond, R.S.H.M., and Margaret Ann Blanchet, both of New York City, 13 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
