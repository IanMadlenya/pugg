        Dr. Kurt Weitzmann, a professor of art and archeology at Princeton University, died on Monday at the Medical Center at Princeton. He was 89.
        The cause was heart disease, the university said.
        Professor Weitzmann was to have received an honorary doctorate at yesterday's commencement ceremony. Instead, he received it privately last weekend from Harold T. Shapiro, the university's president.
        Professor Weitzmann wrote articles and books based on his visits to Mount Athos in Greece between 1932 and 1954, and to the remote Monastery of St. Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai from 1956 to 1965.
        He described himself as "an art historian who deals with Medieval art at large and with late classical, early Christian and Byzantine art in particular." Manuscripts and Mosaicstktktk
        At Mount Athos, a center of early monastic life, he explored libraries and museums and studied previously unknown late classical, Byzantine and medieval materials. These included illuminated manuscripts, icons, frescoes and mosaics.
        St. Catherine, dating to A.D. 550, is the oldest Greek Orthodox monastery, built by the Emperor Justinian at the reputed site of the burning bush. Professor Weitzmann found it to be a source of rare icons and manuscripts.
        A native of Almerode, Germany, he studied at the Universities of Munster, Wurzburg, Vienna and Berlin, where he earned his doctorate in 1929. He came to the United States in 1935 as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study. He later became a permanent member of the institute.
        In 1945, he also joined Princeton University and was promoted to full professor in 1950. He reached emeritus status in 1972, but continued to write about Medieval art and his field trips until recently.
        He is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Josepha Fiedler.
