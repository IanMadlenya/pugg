        Guy Warren Botts, the former chairman of Barnett Banks Inc. who shaped the acquisitive strategy that made the bank the nation's 17th largest, died Friday at his home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 78 years old.
        His son-in-law, Robin Fawsett, said yesterday that he had died of an aneurysm.
        Mr. Botts was born in Milton, Fla. When he joined Barnett in 1963 as president, the Florida banking industry was fragmented and Barnett had less than $500 million in assets. With many regions of Florida developing more rapidly than Barnett's home market in Jacksonville, Mr. Botts sought a way to capitalize on that growth. After a string of acquisitions, including the purchase this year of First Florida Banks, Barnett has become Florida's largest bank, with $38 billion in assets.
        Mr. Botts was chairman of the bank from 1973 until his retirement in 1984 and in recent years worked as a partner in the law firm of Culverhouse & Botts, with offices in Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla.
        Mr. Botts was a quiet, meticulous man who enjoyed gardening, particularly bonsai, the art of cultivating dwarf trees. On the night before his death, he announced to his family that he had established a scholarship for law students at the University of Florida, from which he graduated with a law degree in 1937.
        Mr. Botts is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a sister, Lora; a daughter, Edith; a son, William, and two grandchildren.
