        Louis B. Heller, who was a supervising justice of the Matrimonial Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in the 1970's and a Democratic Congressman from Brooklyn from 1949 to 1954, died on Saturday in Hospice House, part of the Universal Medical Center complex in Plantation, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale. He was 88 and lived in Lauderhill, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his son, Bobby.
        Justice Heller was a Supreme Court justice for a dozen years beginning in 1966, after being an acting Supreme Court justice from 1960 to 1966. He became the supervising justice of the Brooklyn Matrimonial Division in 1974.
        In 1973, Justice Heller ruled that New York City must provide and pay for legal counsel for indigent defendants in matrimonial cases. In that ruling he maintained that such individuals were otherwise denied equal protection of the law.
        He was a State Senator from Brooklyn in 1943 and 1944, an associate justice of the New York City Court of Special Sessions from 1954 to 1958, a justice of the Court of the City of New York from 1959 to 1961 and a judge of the Civil Court from 1962 to 1965.
        The justice won a seat in Congress in February 1949 in a special election. He went on to become a member of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and to head a subcommittee of that group which investigated the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        He resigned from the House in 1954 to accept his appointment as a Special Sessions justice in New York.
        Louis Benjamin Heller was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and lived much of his life in the Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant areas of Brooklyn. He graduated from Boys High School in Brooklyn and earned a law degree in 1926 from Fordham University.
        He practiced law in Brooklyn and became active in the Democratic Party there.
        His writings included a 1968 book, "Do You Solemnly Swear?," about lawyers' courtroom tactics.
        Justice Heller's wife, the former Ruth Gulkis, died in 1981 after 45 years of marriage.
        In addition to his son, of Brooklyn, he is survived by a daughter, Marcia D. Heller of Manhattan; a granddaughter, and a sister, Frieda Meyerowitz, of Lauderhill.
        A funeral service is to be held at 10 A.M. Wednesday at Sherman's Flatbush Memorial Chapel, 1283 Coney Island Avenue between Avenue J and Avenue I.
