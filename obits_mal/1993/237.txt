        William Plummer Drake, a retired Philadelphia industrialist, died Jan. 22 at his home in Devon, Pa. He was 80.
        Mr. Drake was associated with the Pennwalt Corporation for 49 years. He started out as a summer trainee in 1934 when it was the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company. In 1955 at the age of 42 he became its youngest president.
        During his tenure, the company transformed itself into the Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation and finally Pennwalt. He retired as chairman in 1978 but remained a director until nine years ago. Pennwalt was then acquired by Elf Aquitaine of France and became part of Elf Atochem North America Inc.
        Elf Atochem's chief executive, Seymour S. Preston 3d, said Mr. Drake had turned a "relatively small chemical company into a global chemical, pharmaceutical and equipment company in the Fortune 500."
        Mr. Drake was a native of Bath, Me. He graduated from Deerfield Academy and attended Bowdoin College.
        Mr. Drake is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Maynadier Hardcastle; two sons, James B. 2d and William P. Jr.; three daughters, Margaret D. Peckham, Anne D. Mowat and Sally Plummer; and nine grandchildren.
