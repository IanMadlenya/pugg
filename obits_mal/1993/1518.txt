        David R. Schweisberg, manager at the Beijing bureau of United Press International, died on Nov. 11 in Beijing. He was 39.
        He collapsed in the lobby of the China World Hotel after playing squash in the gymnasium there. He was pronounced dead at Union Hospital. U.P.I. said a heart attack was apparently the cause.

        He graduated from Boston University. He joined U.P.I. in Detroit in 1979.
        His survivors include his mother and father, Sue and Emanuel Schweisberg, of Huntington, and a brother, Matthew, of Merrimac, Mass.
