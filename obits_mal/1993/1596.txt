        Ben Feldman, whom industry experts called the greatest life-insurance salesman of all time, died on Sunday in West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 81 and lived in East Liverpool, Ohio.
        His family said he had died of a stroke.
        Over a career that spanned more than half a century, Mr. Feldman sold more than $1 billion of life insurance as a New York Life Insurance agent working in eastern Ohio. His most lucrative customers were the owners of small factories, mills and businesses.
        Combining a soft-sell approach with a hard drive to succeed, Mr. Feldman became in 1975 the first man to sell $100 million in life insurance in one year. By the end of the 1970's, he was selling more insurance annually as a single agent than 1,500 of the 1,800 insurance agencies in the country. He was still working at his death.
        He was so successful that he was the subject of several books.
        While some agents would appeal to fear or shame in pushing a policy to a reluctant buyer, industry experts said Mr. Feldman would somehow discover a more positive approach that would harness a buyer's best instincts.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Feldman quit school at 16 to work in his father's poultry business. But he soon turned to insurance, joining New York Life as an agent in 1942 and crossing the $1 million-a-year mark in 1946.
        Mr. Feldman's first wife, Freda, died in 1974.
        He is survived by his second wife, Ethel; two sons, Richard and Marvin, and nine grandchildren.
