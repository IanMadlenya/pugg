        Jose Ramos Lopez, the first Puerto Rican Democrat elected to the New York State Assembly from Manhattan, who went on to serve nearly 20 years as a judge, died on Thursday in a hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was 79 and lived in Bellerose, Queens, and Puerto Rico.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Ramos Lopez, who moved to New York City from Puerto Rico when he was 28, was appointed a Deputy Commissioner of Correction in 1953. He was elected to the State Assembly in 1958 to represent East Harlem. In Albany, he sponsored bills to provide collective bargaining rights, unemployment insurance and workers' compensation for hospital workers. He also sought to ease voting restrictions for Puerto Ricans by omitting a literacy test for any who had voted previously.
        In 1967 he was elected a Civil Court judge and in 1978 he was appointed an acting State Supreme Court justice, serving until his retirement in 1985 in the civil division of Supreme Court in Manhattan.
        Mr. Ramos Lopez is survived by his wife, Aida; six daughters, Linda Radford, Dolores Saraceno, Marguarite Toro, Denise Grunti, Lissette and Lisa, all of Queens, and seven grandchildren.
