        E. Douglas Hamilton, a New York City libel lawyer for 66 years, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, L.I. He was 92.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Hamilton began a career in newspaper law as a counsel to The New York Herald Tribune in 1926 until that paper ceased publication in 1966. After that, he represented The World Journal Tribune, which ceased publication in 1967, and New York magazine.
        His belief in the social value of a courageous but reponsible press led him to become a lecturer at the Columbia University School of Journalism on "The American Press." In 1949, he was named adjunct professor of journalism at Columbia, teaching courses in newspaper law and libel. He was named professor emeritus in 1977.
        In 1966, he was the co-author of the book "Libel: Rights, Risks, Responsibilities."
        He served as general counsel and director of the Fresh Air Fund for more than 50 years. He was also director and general counsel to Fairfield Maxwell Ltd. and Campo Tankers S.A. until the early 1980's.
        Mr. Hamilton, who was born and raised in Queens, graduated from Harvard College in 1923 and earned a law degree there three years later. He was a member of the Harvard Club of New York, serving on its board of managers until 1970.
        His wife, the former Cornelia Cook, died in 1989.
        Surviving are a daughter, Cornelia Greenspan of Manhattan; a son, Douglas L. Hamilton of Manhasset, L.I., and three grandchildren.
