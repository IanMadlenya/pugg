        Prof. Alfred B. Pasteur, a professor of counseling psychology at Hunter College of the City University of New York, died on Monday at the home of relatives in Miami. He was 65.
        Professor Pasteur died of heart failure, said his brother, Reginald.
        He joined the Hunter faculty in 1973 and was an authority on the training of school and college counselors. His 1982 book, "Roots of Soul" (Doubleday), which he co-wrote with Dr. Ivory L. Todson, discussed how facets of African-American culture could be used to improve the training of counselors and other educators.
        He was a founding member of the New York Alliance of Black School Educators and the National Alliance of Black School Educators.
        His brother is the only immediate survivor.
