        Gregory d'Alessio, a cartoonist, painter and teacher, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
        He had suffered from emphysema for the past three years and died in his sleep, said Hilda Terry d'Alessio, his wife.
        Mr. d'Alessio first pursued a newspaper career, but turned to cartooning in the 1930's. Eventually his work appeared in syndication, reaching 75 newspapers and magazines, including The New Yorker and Esquire. He returned to the Art Students League in 1960 to teach drawing, which he did until his illness three years ago.
        Mr. d'Alessio, a native of Manhattan, trained at the Art Students League, where he was vice president from 1937 to 1944. His paintings were shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of the City of New York and elsewhere.
        In 1946, he helped found the Society of the Classic Guitar, and in the late 1940's he was also the secretary of the New York Classic Guitar Society.
        For two decades he took part in an informal circle of guitar aficionados, the Silly Center Opera Company, which attracted such celebrities as Tallulah Bankhead, Carl Sandburg and Edward Steichen. Andres Segovia dropped in at times.
        Remembering the period, Mr. d'Alessio wrote and illustrated "Old Troubadour, Carl Sandburg With His Guitar Friends" (Walker & Company, 1987).
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, a fellow artist and instructor at the league.
