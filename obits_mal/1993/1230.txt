        Brother Richard B. Power, a former president of Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y., died on Friday at New Rochelle Hospital. He was 75 and lived in New Rochelle.
        The cause was complications after a surgical procedure, associates said.
        Brother Power was president of Iona from 1959 to 1965, when he helped divide Iona Preparatory School from the college, establishing the college as a self-contained entity. From 1954 to 1959, he was principal of All Hallows High School in the Bronx. He also had been a biology teacher at the former Power Memorial Academy, Manhattan, and at Essex Catholic High School in Newark.
        A native of Manhattan, Brother Power graduated from Power Memorial Academy in 1935 and, the same year, entered the Congregation of Christian Brothers. He later earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in biology from Fordham University.
        Brother Power began teaching at Iona in 1947, seven years after its founding as an independent liberal arts institution by the Christian Brothers of Ireland. He retired from full-time teaching in 1987, but continued as a lecturer and instructor until 1989.
        He is survived by a brother, Thomas Power, of Bayonne, N.J.
