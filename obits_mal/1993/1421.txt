        Edwin L. Crawford, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties since 1977, died on Monday at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y. He was 68 and had lived in Binghamton and in Brewster, Mass. The cause of his death was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Crawford was a leader in efforts to modernize county governments through the United States. A longtime resident of Broome County, he led a drive for an elected county executive there, and held the post himself for eight years, elected initially in 1968.
        A native of Broome County, he served in a glider unit of the 17th Airborne Division in Europe during World War II. After the war, he graduated from Cornell University and Cornell Law School and practiced law in Broome County from 1950 to 1977.
        As director of the Association of Counties since then, he worked closely with the Governor, Legislature and county officials, seeking to secure legislation and funds for the counties.
        Mr. Crawford is survived by his wife of 46 years, Dorothy Hulslander Crawford; two sons, Jameson H., of Ovid, N.Y., and Jonathan M., of Endicott; two daughters, Priscilla C. Slottje and Melissa C. Waters, both of Ithaca; a sister, Martha C. Harris of Vestal, N.Y.; two brothers, Robert F., of Arkansas, and Claude A. Jr., of Fort Myers Beach, Fla., and five grandchildren.
