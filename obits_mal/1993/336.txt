        Walter Wechsler, a former New Jersey State budget director, died Friday at Robert Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 79.
        The Associated Press reported that he died of complications from diabetes and of kidney failure.
        Mr. Wechsler was the director of the New Jersey Division of Budget and Accounting from 1970 until his retirement from the state government in 1974 after 35 years.
        He was deputy director for 15 years before becoming director and came to be known as one of New Jersey's most knowledgeable experts on public fiscal and business management.
        Soon after his retirement, he was named by Gov. Brendan T. Byrne as a special agent to oversee fiscal reforms in the Newark school system. Later he also was a fiscal-affairs consultant and served on a task force studying New Jersey state government expenditures. He was also on the boards of companies and of Rutgers University and other nonprofit organizations.
        A native of the Bronx, Mr. Wechsler went to schools in Passaic, N.J., and graduated from Rutgers in 1937. Two years later he began his state career by joining what became the Office of Management and Budget.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Edna; two daughters, Lizabeth Martin and Amy Wechsler, and two grandchildren.
