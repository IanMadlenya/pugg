        Dr. Robert Paradny, a senior general surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died on Tuesday in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. He was 68 and lived in Englewood Cliffs.
        He died in a collision between his car and a truck in Englewood Cliffs, his family said.
        A native of Canada, Dr. Paradny graduated from the University of Alberta, where he also received his medical degree. He joined Mount Sinai as an assistant resident in surgery in 1951 and had been a member of the attending staff since completing his residency three years later.
        At his death, he was an assistant clinical professor at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine and an associate attending physician at Mount Sinai Hospital. He also kept a private practice in Manhattan.
        He taught residents and medical students, Mount Sinai said, and played a major role in the department of surgery until his death. For many years he was chairman of the department's quality-assurance committee. In 1977, he was the first recipient of the Chief Residents Teaching Award, an annual citation now given to the outstanding teacher of the year.
        Dr. Paradny is survived by his wife, Adelle Paradny, who was injured in the accident; and two daughters, Robin Paradny of Fort Lee, N.J., and Andrea Reiter of Madison, N.J.
