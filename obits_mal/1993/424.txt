        Arnold Franchetti, a composer and a faculty member at the University of Hartford, died on Sunday at Middlesex Hospital in Cromwell, Conn. He was believed to have been at least 84, and he lived in Middletown, Conn.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Franchetti composed more than 160 chamber, orchestral and vocal works, including the operas "The Lion," "The Game of Cards" and "The Maypole." Among his honors were a Guggenheim Fellowship and a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.
        He was born in Lucca, Italy, and was the son of Alberto Franchetti, also a composer. He studied physics at the University of Florence and music at the Salzburg Mozarteum and in Munich with Richard Strauss. After deserting the Italian Army to work with the Resistance in World War II, he moved to the United States in 1948. A year later he joined the faculty at the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford, where he taught until his retirement in 1979.
        He is survived by his third wife, Clara; a daughter, Johanna Mardirosian of McLean, Va.; three grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
