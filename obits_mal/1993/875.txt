        Vincent S. Murino, a retired official of the National Weather Service who helped to develop five-day forecasts and other advances, died on June 5 at a hospital near his home in Falls Church, Va. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Murino formally retired as executive assistant to the agency's administrator but continued as a consultant until this year. He helped in two major reorganizations of the agency, in the 1950's and the 1980's, and worked on the agency's network of offices, communications, computer modeling and marine meteorology.
        Mr. Murino was born in the Bronx to a family of meteorologists. In World War II, he served as a meteorologist in the Marine Corps and took part in the liberation of the Philippines.
        After the war he studied meteorology at St. Louis University, earning bachelor's and master's degrees there and later a master's in public administration at American University.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Eulonda Pohl; a daughter, Jana G. Murino of Arlington, Va.; his brother, Clifford, of Tidewater, Ore., and a grandchild.
