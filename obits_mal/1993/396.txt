        George Arthur Brown, the former Governor of the Bank of Jamaica and until he retired in 1990, an Associate Administrator of the United Nations Development Program, died on Tuesday at his home near Kingston, Jamaica. He was 70.
        He died of cancer, said Hilda Paqui, a spokeswoman for the United Nations aid agency. At the time of his death, Mr. Brown was chairman of the Council of the Mona Campus of the University of the West Indies.
        During his career in the Jamaican civil service, he played a major role in the country's economic development. He drafted Jamaica's first five-year development program and was an economic adviser to the Government as well as a negotiator of aid agreements sought by Jamaica to develop its oil, bauxite and other resources.
        In later years, as a United Nations administrator, he had responsibility for technical aid programs operating in 157 countries. William H. Draper 3d, administrator of the aid program, said Mr. Brown "had few equals in the United Nations system" in his understanding of foreign assistance.
        Born and schooled in Jamaica, he completed his education at the London School of Economics and then joined his country's Ministry of Finance. He was also active in a wide range of development activities, as chairman of the board of Air Jamaica, the Sugar Manufacturing Corporation and the Jamaican National Investment Company. He also was an alternate Governor of the World Bank and its affiliates.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Leila Gill; three daughters, Catherine Brown, Isabel Brown and Alexia Brown, and a son, David Brown.
