        Norman Andersson, a bass-baritone who sang at the Metropolitan Opera and with several symphony orchestras, died on Monday at his home in Chatham Center, N.Y. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, said a statement from Dorothy Cone, his press representative.
        Mr. Andersson made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1980-81 season. His Met appearances included roles in Puccini's "Madama Butterfly" and Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette." He also sang with opera companies in Newark, Dallas, Philadelphia and New Orleans.
        He was a soloist with a number of orchestras, among them the New York Philharmonic, the San Francisco and Pittsburgh Symphonies, the Cleveland Orchestra and the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
        A graduate of Temple University, he earned a master's degree in music at Indiana University, where he studied with Margaret Harshaw.
        He is survived by his mother, Marian, of Palm Harbor, Fla.
