        Harold Messing, a lawyer specializing in the entertainment industry, died on Friday at Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 57 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
        His stepdaughter Shelley Cohn Schmidt said the cause was leukemia.
        Mr. Messing, a longtime sole practitioner, moved his main office to Beverly Hills from Manhattan two years ago. He maintained another office, staffed by an associate, in Manhattan.
        His clients included the choreographer Gerald Arpino, the composer Gian-Carlo Menotti, the comedian Soupy Sales and the actress Ruby Dee.
        Over the years, Mr. Messing did legal work involving Broadway shows including "Over Here," "A History of the American Film," and "Oh, Kay" as well as films including "Babette's Feast." He also did work for the literary estates of S. J. Perelman and Nathanael West.
        He was born and grew up in the Bronx. He earned a bachelor's degree at New York University in 1955, a master's in speech and theater from Stanford University in 1957 and a law degree from New York University in 1966.
        In addition to Mrs. Schmidt, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of nine years, Marcia Yoffe, a former actress; another stepdaughter, Cynthia Cohn of Newport Beach, Calif.; two step-grandsons, and a brother, Dr. Samuel A. Messing of Huntington, L.I.
