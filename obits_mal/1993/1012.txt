        James Patrick Cooney, a retired major general who was one of the Army's top authorities on radiology and the medical effects of atomic explosions, died on Tuesday at Wesley Woods Health Center in Atlanta. He was 90.
        His son, Dr. James P. Cooley Jr., dean of the College of Health Sciences at Georgia State University, said the cause was complications related to Alzheimer's disease.
        At the close of World War II, General Cooney served as medical director of a special mission to Japan to study the effects of the atomic bomb on the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Later, as a radiologist attached to the Atomic Energy Commission, he lectured widely on the biological effects of radiation from atomic explosions.
        General Cooney served for 33 years with the Army Medical Corps. He became Deputy Surgeon General of the Army in 1955 and chief surgeon of the United States forces in Europe in 1959.
        Retiring from the military in 1960, he was named vice president for medical affairs of the American Cancer Society in New York City. He moved to Atlanta in 1969.
        He was born in Parnell, Iowa, and received his medical degree from the University of Iowa in 1927.
        His wife of 57 years, the former Irene Kelly, died in 1986.
        Besides his son, survivors include four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
