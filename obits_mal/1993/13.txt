        Dr. Charles Edward Fletcher, a prominent veterinarian, died on Friday at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 87.
        He died in his sleep of natural causes, said his son, Charles E. Fletcher Jr., of Manhattan.
        Dr. Fletcher, who was known as Ted, opened a small veterinary practice in Marble Hill after graduating from the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University in 1931. The next year he founded the Abbey Veterinary Hospital, which he moved to Riverdale in 1950.
        In 1952, he served as president of the New York City Veterinary Medical Society, and in 1961 he was head of the New York State Veterinary Medical Society. Between 1950 and 1956, he wrote a daily column, "Pet Forum," for The New York Daily Mirror. He retired 30 years ago.
        In addition to his son, Dr. Fletcher is survived by his wife, Doris; a daughter, Gail Fletcher Edwards, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
