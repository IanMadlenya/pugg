        Richard K. Irons, who taught history and coached tennis and debating teams at the Groton School for more than 40 years, died Monday at his home in Groton, Mass. He was 86.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Irons's long tenure saw him serve all six Groton headmasters, including Endicott Peabody, who founded the school in 1884. Mr. Irons had begun an engineering career but changed his mind and earned a second degree in history at Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar.
        He arrived at Groton in 1933, the first teacher there with a Ph.D., and became known to generations of alumni as Doc. He headed the history department for 23 years, beginning in 1949, and retired in 1972. But he still substituted in the classroom now and then, continued to coach tennis until 1979 and remained a keen competitor on the court into his early 80's.
        William Polk, the present headmaster, said Mr. Irons had a particularly vivid teaching style that led many of his students to careers in government service. Among them was McGeorge Bundy, a history professor emeritus at New York University who was national security advisor to Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
        Mr. Irons is survived by his wife, Audrey; three sons, Alden of Arlington, Va., Clifford of West Newbury, Mass., and David of Berkeley, Calif.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
