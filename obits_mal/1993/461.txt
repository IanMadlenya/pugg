        Herbert W. Evans Jr., retired president of Woolsey Marine Industries of Manhattan, makers of paints and finishes for boat builders, died on Sunday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Evans, who was born in Brooklyn, earned a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering at Yale University and served in the Navy in World War II, rising to lieutenant commander. He joined Woolsey Marine after the war and became its president during 34 years with the company, which has since been sold.
        A lifelong sailor, he held a patent on a self-tailing winch that he marketed to the makers of racing and cruising sailboats.
        Mr. Evans is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Ware; a daughter, Holly Richter of Lyons, Colo.; two sons, Dr. Lansing Evans of Boca Raton, Fla., and Sanford Evans of Wayzata, Minn.; a brother, Hugh Evans of Cos Cob., Conn., and five grandchildren.
