        Carl W. Gardiner, the retired head of the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics and fashion company and developer of the elongated nail-polish cap for easier application, died on Friday at a nursing home in Atlantic Highlands, N.J. He was 88 and lived in Rumson, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was kidney illness, his family said.
        Mr. Gardiner served as the executive vice president of Elizabeth Arden from 1948 to 1966, when he succeeded to the presidency on the death of the company's founder, Florence N. Graham, who also used Elizabeth Arden as her name.
        As president, he ended the company's business of selling expensive custom-made fashions by designers like Oscar de la Renta and shifted to marketing ready-made clothes produced in France, Italy and Spain to a wider clientele. The company had 50 salons and plants in 33 countries.
        In 1970 he negotiated the sale of both the cosmetics and fashion operations to Eli Lilly & Company and then retired.
        Mr. Gardiner was born in Millville, N.J. He was educated at George Washington University while working as a page in the Senate.
        In the first part of his career he worked for 21 years at LaCrosse-Schnefel Brothers, where he was executive vice president. He helped transform the company, a manufacturer of surgical instruments that supplied the military in World War II, into a producer of nail-care items. It was there that he developed the long applicator cap that is now the standard applicator for nail polish, his family said.
        Surviving are his wife of 61 years, the former Lorian Salisbury, also known Jolly; a son, Carl Jr. of Locust, N.J.; two daughters, Ann Drake of Palm Beach, Fla., and Pamela Machado of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
