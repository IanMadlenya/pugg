        John Campbell, a blues guitarist and singer, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 41.
        The cause was heart failure, said a statement from Elektra Records.
        Mr. Campbell, who was born in Shreveport, La., took up the guitar at the age of 16 after he was seriously injured in a drag-racing accident. During his convalescence, he spent hours listening to blues artists like John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf and soon began playing in roadhouses in Louisiana and Texas.
        He came to New York City in 1987, making the rounds of the city's small music clubs and bars. In 1989, hired to open for Albert King at the Lone Star Cafe, he was approached by a representative of Elektra Records who offered him a contract. His first album for the label, "One Believer," was released later that year, and was followed last February by a second album, "Howlin' Mercy." He is survived by his wife, Dolly Fox; a daughter, Paris; a sister, Ellen Searcey; a brother, William, and his father, John.
