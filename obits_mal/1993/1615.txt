        Samuel Brown, who with his wife, Edith, operated one of Manhattan's first and best-known health food restaurants and stores, died Monday in New York Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Dr. Karen Brown, his daughter.
        Mr. Brown's restaurant, Brownies, at 21 East 16th Street, was for more than 40 years a dairy restaurant with health food overtones.
        It offered pseudo-chicken chow mein, eggplant steak, soybean cutlet, chili no carne and vegetarian chicken liver. It closed in 1985. A retail store, Brownies Foods, which was associated with the restaurant, remains on Fifth Avenue between 16th and 17th Streets..
        Mr. Brown, who was born in the Bronx, first opened a health food store in the Union Square area when he was 20.
        In addition to his wife, who lives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and his daughter, Dr. Brown of Manhattan, he is survived by another daughter, Gayle Brown of Manhattan, and one son, Dennis Brown of Manhattan.
