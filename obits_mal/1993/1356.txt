        Samuel Lerner, a former professor of engineering and director of construction planning for Brown University, died on Wednesday at his home in Providence, R.I. He was 85.
        The cause was complications from cancer, his family said.
        Professor Lerner was a native of Providence and received his undergraduate degree from Brown in 1930. He received his master's degree from Syracuse University and taught there as a graduate assistant before returning to join the faculty of Brown in 1936.
        He was the author of several research papers while at Brown and received a doctorate from the Polytechnical Institute of Turin in Italy, where he was one of the authors of a study about methods of construction.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ethel S. Bogin, and a son, Stephen L., an architect in Providence.
