        Richard M. Lederer Jr., the retired Village Historian of Scarsdale and an author and investment manager, died on Thursday at White Plains Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Scarsdale.
        His daughter, Barbara Rosin of Chappaqua, said the cause of death was heart failure.
        Mr. Lederer served as the local historian for many years. He was best known for his book, "The Place Names of Westchester County" (Harbor Hill Books, 1978), a gazetteer of the origins and significance of 2,200 of the county's places. Another work was "Colonial American English" (Verbatim, 1985), a glossary of some 3,000 obscure words in use from 1608 to 1783.
        For 50 years, Mr. Lederer was a partner in an investment management firm, Reredel Associates (Lederer spelled backward), retiring in 1980.
        He was a former national treasurer of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and a president of the Jewish Community Council.
        Born in New York City, he graduated from Yale in 1939 and began a banking career as comptroller of the Woodside National Bank in Queens. During World War II, he served in the Army, with the rank of captain.
        Besides his daughter, Barbara, he is survived by another daughter, Ann Lederer of Denver; a sister, Dolly L. Maass of Purchase, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
