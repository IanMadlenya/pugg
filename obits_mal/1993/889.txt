        Robert D. Fowler of Alpharetta, Ga., former owner and publisher of The Gwinnett Daily News, died Sunday in Atlanta. He was 62.
        The cause was complications from heart failure, his family said. Mr. Fowler published the newspaper from 1964 to 1988, when he and his partners sold the News Company, including The Gwinnett Daily News, Winder News and Forsyth County News, to The New York Times Company. The Daily News closed last year after a competitive struggle with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
        A former president of the Georgia Press Association, Mr. Fowler served as editor of The Marietta Daily Journal from 1958 to 1964.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Judith Lidstone, and two daughters, Louise Chernecky and Nancy Bivins, both of Alpharetta.
