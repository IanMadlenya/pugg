        Marvin H. Bernstein, a businessman and philanthropist in New York for many years, died on Sunday at the Miami Heart Institute. He was 66 and lived in Miami.
        The cause was bladder cancer, said Richard D. Siegal of New York, a friend and business partner.
        Mr. Bernstein was the founder and for 34 years the president of the Variety Knit Corporation of Manhattan, which makes women's clothing and T-shirts. He also founded the Marvin Bernstein Oil Company, a petroleum exploration company with headquarters in Miami.
        Mr. Bernstein was a fund-raiser for and a contributor to the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the Simon Weisenthal Center, Israel Bonds, the Weitzman Institute of Science, Tel Aviv University and other medical and religious groups.
        He is survived by his wife, Rhoda Bernstein of Miami; two daughters, Wendy Rothberg of Melville, L.I., and Sherri Grecco of Norwood, N.J.; one son, Jay, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 2, 1993, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Marvin H. Bernstein, a businesman and philanthropist in New York, misspelled the name of the center for Holocaust studies based in Los Angeles for which he was a fund-raiser and contributor. It is the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
