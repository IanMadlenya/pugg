        The Rev. Michel Riquet, a Jesuit priest and former Resistance fighter who became the most popular preacher of postwar Paris as well as a widely read author, died there on Friday. He was 94.
        A native of Paris and a doctor of theology, Father Riquet defied the Vichy regime, which ruled France after the German occupation in World War II. He helped more than 500 Allied pilots to escape from France, leading to his arrest by the Gestapo in January 1944.
        He was held in the Mauthausen and Dachau concentration camps and was freed by Allied soldiers in the waning days of the war in May 1945. Returning to Paris, he wore the faded, striped uniform of the camps for his first sermon at Notre Dame. Post at Notre Dame
        So successful was his Sunday message to growing throngs that he was appointed predicateur, or preacher, at Notre Dame, a position he held for 10 years.
        He took up the cudgels against the anti-clericalism unleashed by the political left at the war's end. The Communist newspaper Humanite sought to undercut him by saying he had turned pro-Nazi at Mauthausen. He reportedly won a largely symbolic libel award of 100,000 francs in 1950 when the paper refused to print his letter of denial.
        In his books, Father Riquet advised Christians on how to spiritually face their everyday concerns in a changing world. He also campaigned against racism and took a special interest in Catholic relations with others groups, particularly Jews, Muslims and Freemasons. He was a vice president of the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism and, from 1972 to 1981, served as national chaplain for Catholic writers.
