        The Rev. Dr. Robert D. Hershey, pastor of the Lutheran Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan for 21 years until his retirement in 1974, died Saturday evening at his home near Reading, Pa. He was 83.
        He had been ill with cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Hershey was most widely known for his parish preaching and nationally broadcast appearances at various times from the late 1940's until the mid-1960's on NBC's "National Radio Pulpit," ABC's "Sunday Vespers" and the Mutual Broadcasting System's "Faith in Our Time."
        While he was at Holy Trinity, which is at 65th Street and Central Part West, the church began its series of Sunday afternoon musical vespers focused on the works of Johann Sebastian Bach.
        He was born in Reading, Pa., graduated from Gettysburg College and the Lutheran Seminary at Gettysburg, and received a doctorate in sacred theology from Temple University. His books include "The Secret of God," "Advent Landmarks: From a Preacher's Notebook" and "Think About These Things," a collection of sermons.
        Dr. Hershey is survived by his wife, the former Mary Billman; a son, Robert D. Jr., a correspondent in the Washington Bureau of The New York Times, and a daughter, Georgina S. Leon, an editor at Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pa.
