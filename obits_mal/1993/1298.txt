        Robert Borthwick Adam, a Buffalo retailer and civic leader, died on Friday in his home in Buffalo. He was 75.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        He had worked for 44 years as the head of Adam, Meldrum & Anderson, the company that was the anchor of Buffalo's downtown retail community. The company eventually opened 10 stores, leading expansion to the suburbs, but Mr. Adam kept the flagship store downtown.
        He was born in Buffalo, the grandson of the founder of the store, also named Robert Borthwick Adam. The store was opened in 1867 on the present site of the Main Place Mall.
        Mr. Adam attended Yale University and returned to Buffalo in 1939. He became president of the store in 1946, a job he held until 1980, when he became chairman and chief executive officer.
        He was the board chairman of the Children's Hospital in the early 1970's. In 1978 he led a $7 million fund drive for the hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Wende; four daughters, Robbie Hall, Wende Alford, Bonnie Hopkins and Trudy Mollenberg, and 10 grandchildren.
