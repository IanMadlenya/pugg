        John Bolton, a British-born pioneer in radio astronomy, died at Buderim in Queensland, Australia, on July 6, The Times of London reported last week. He was 71.
        He was credited with having discovered, in 1947, the first radio "stars," galaxies that broadcast incredibly strong signals in radio wavelengths. By 1956 he was regarded as one of the world's foremost experts on radio astronomy, an extension of optical astronomy in the sense that it allows the observer to "see" objects that emit radiation that is not visible.
        Professor Bolton taught physics and astronomy at the California Institute of Technology from 1956 to 1961, and he established a radio observatory for the institute. He went on to become director of the Australian National Radio Astronomy Observatory from 1961 to 1971.
        He was born in Sheffield, England, and studied mathematics and physics at Cambridge University.
        He is survived by his wife, Letty, and a sister, Jo Wheatley.
