        Nikita Magaloff, one of the last representatives of the Romantic school of pianism, died on Dec. 26 at the Samaritans Hospital in the Swiss village of Vevey. He was 80, and lived in Baugy, Switzerland.
        He died after a long illness, hospital officials said.
        During his long performing career, Mr. Magaloff was best known for his interpretation of Chopin, whose complete works he recently finished recording. He also had an affinity for the music of Prokofiev, an early mentor, and performed the premiere of Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata.
        Mr. Magaloff was born in St. Petersburg, but his family fled Russia in 1919, first moving to Finland and then to France. He studied with Isidor Philipp at the Paris Conservatory and at 17 graduated with the school's first prize. He first gained international recognition as the accompanist for the Hungarian violinist Joseph Szigeti, whose daughter, Irene, he later married. The couple moved to Switzerland in 1939 to escape World War II.
        Mr. Magaloff made his American debut in 1947 as a soloist with the San Francisco Symphony, but was better known throughout Europe, where he appeared with most of the major orchestras under such conductors as Otto Klemperer, Ernest Ansermet and Karl Bohm. His last performances in the United States were in 1987, when he made a recital tour of the major American cities.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Wanda Minder of Switzerland, and two grandchildren.
