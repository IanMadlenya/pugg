        Dr. Howard Mayer Brown, a distinguished scholar of Renaissance music and a professor of music at the University of Chicago, died on Sunday in Venice. He was 62.
        A spokesman for the university said the cause was a heart attack. Dr. Brown had been in Europe to teach at the University of Basel in Switzerland and to conduct archival research in Italy.
        In his academic career, Dr. Brown combined the roles of practicing musician, musicologist and administrator, having an important impact on the study and performance of early music in the United States. His musicological studies included the books "Music in the Renaissance" (1976) and a standard reference work, "Instrumental Music Printed Before 1600: A Bibliography" (1965).
        He also wrote about French and Italian theater music and 16th-century performance practice. He was the author or editor of 14 books and wrote more than 50 scholarly articles and reviews, including major contributions to the New Grove Dictionary of Opera. He prepared facsimile editions of nearly 100 operas written between the mid-17th and the mid-18th centuries. Two Years in London
        Dr. Brown was born in Los Angeles and earned his undergraduate and graduate degrees in music from Harvard University. He began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1960. In 1972, he succeeded Thurston Dart as the King Edward Professor of Music at King's College, University of London. He returned to Chicago in 1974 and, two years later, was named the Ferdinand Schevill Distinguished Service Professor of Music at the the University of Chicago.
        Dr. Brown founded the Collegium Musicum ensemble at the University of Chicago in 1960 for the performance of early music; he directed the ensemble until 1982. He was chairman of the music department from 1989 to 1992. He was also president of the American Musicological Society from 1978 to 1980 and vice president of the International Musicological Society from 1982 to 1987.
        He is survived by a brother, Ralph, of New Zealand.
