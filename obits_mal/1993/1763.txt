        Robert Buchanan Mitchell, emeritus Professor of City and Regional Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, died on Nov. 29 in Philadelphia, where he lived. He was 87.
        The cause was thought to have been a massive heart attack, the university said.
        As a noted urban planner and consultant, Professor Mitchell's career took him to many cities in this country and overseas. He retired in 1975, but continued to teach a graduate course in decision making in Penn's School of Arts and Sciences. He was scheduled to teach the course again next spring.
        Martin Meyerson, a colleague and the university's former president, recalled that at the end of World War II, Philadelphia was the last major American city to establish an overall planning agency. "Robert Mitchell was its first director," Mr. Meyerson said. "In one year he created the most distinguished post of that kind in the United States."
        Born in Indianapolis, Mr. Mitchell received a degree in architecture from the University of Illinois, where he also did graduate work in urban studies. In the late 1940's, he was a research professor in urban land use and housing at Columbia University.
        In 1951 he joined the University of Pennsylvania as Professor of City Planning, organized a department for that discipline and served as its first chairman. For several years, he also served as director of the university's Institute of Urban Studies.
        Professor Mitchell is survived by his wife of 59 years, Bernice Anderson Mitchell; a daughter, Janet Mitchell Krejs of Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.
