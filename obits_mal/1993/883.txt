        Tahar Djaout, an Algerian fiction writer, journalist and poet, died of gunshot wounds on June 2 in Algiers, the British newspaper The Independent reported last week. He was 39 and lived in Bainem, nine miles west of Algiers.
        Mr. Djaout, a co-founder of a weekly newspaper critical of Muslim fundamentalists, was shot in the head on May 26 near his home. The police in Algiers said Muslim terrorists had waylaid him.
        It was as a novelist, writing in French, that Mr. Djaout was most widely known. He won a French literary award, the Prix Mediterranee, for his 1991 novel "Les Vigiles" ("The Watchmen"), which depicted life in Algiers made burdensome by officials.
        He had acquired an international readership with his second novel, "Les Chercheurs d'Os" ("The Bone Hunters," 1984). It portrayed Algeria as being so obsessed by the memory of its war of independence from France it made life impossible for the living.
