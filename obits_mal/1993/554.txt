        Charles W. Lanphere, a former Ramada hotel executive who built a chain of hotels and resorts based in Dallas, drowned Sunday while fishing near his lakeside home in Wood County, Tex. He was 54 years old and lived in Dallas.
        Mr. Lanphere was president of the Registry Hotel Corporation, which he founded in 1974. It operates a chain of hotels and resorts under that name in Naples, Fla.; Scottsdale, Ariz., and Bloomington, Minn., among others.
        He also was the founder, in 1971, and the president of the Hospitality Management Corporation, which manages the Sonesta Villa Resort in Orlando, Fla., and the Holiday Inn Don Fernando de Taos in Taos, N.M., and other properties from California to Maryland.
        He was a native of Ardmore, Okla. He graduated from the Oklahoma State University School of Hotel and Restaurant Administration and a training program offered by the Marriott Corporation in Washington. He joined the Ramada Inn Corporation as a general manager in 1963.
        The following year, he was named a vice president at Ramada's Phoenix headquarters.
        He left Ramada in 1971 to form his own management concern in Dallas.
        Mr. Lanphere is survived by his wife and business partner, the former Sue Ralston; three children by a previous marriage, Charles Jr. of Dallas, Kim of Naples, Fla., and Kari at Oklahoma State University; two stepchildren, Kent Casey of Dallas, and Kelly Casey of Phoenix; and a sister, Linda Scheve of Marietta, Ohio.
