        Kenneth E. Siminski, a stage manager, an actor and a director, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 41 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his brother Julian.
        Using the name of Ken Simmons, Mr. Siminski was stage manager for numerous Off Broadway plays, including Tina Howe's "Approaching Zanzibar," with Jane Alexander, and "Coastal Disturbances," with Annette Bening.
        He appeared in the CBS television movie "A Royal Romance" and directed more than a dozen productions at Off Broadway theaters.
        He was a founder of the Theater of Youth Company in Buffalo and appeared regularly in regional stock theater in Cooperstown, N.Y. He also taught acting and speech at the Columbia School of Theatrical Arts in Maryland and elsewhere.
        Besides his brother Julian, of Studio City, Calif., he is survived by his companion, Timothy Fortuna of Manhattan; his mother, Antoinette Siminski, and a sister, Constance Orlowski, both of Buffalo, and another brother, Eugene Siminski of Clemonton, N.J.
