        Bruce K. Binder, the top fashion adviser for Macy's stores in the East and a company vice president, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said Gloria Kreisman, a Macy's spokeswoman.
        Mr. Binder joined R. H. Macy & Company 21 years ago as the fashion representative for Europe, attending fashion shows and advising the company on what to buy and to feature in advertising. He spent 11 years with the company's Paris buying office.
        In 1981, he was named a vice president and two years later he became the fashion director for men's clothing. Two years ago, he took responsibility for women's ready-to-wear clothing and accessories.
        Mr. Binder graduated from Cornell University and received a law degree from Georgetown University Law School, though he never practiced law.
        He is survived by two aunts, Lillian Nemeth of Bridgeport, Conn., and Jacqueline Meltzer of New York City.
