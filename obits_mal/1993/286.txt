        Otto R. Salassi, who wrote novels for young readers, died on Wednesday at his home in Fayetteville, Ark. He was 53.
        His wife, Margaret, said the cause was liver disease.
        Mr. Salassi's novel "Jimmy D., Sidewinder, and Me" (Greenwillow, 1987), was set in smoke-filled pool halls in the South of the late 1940's.
        "On the Ropes" (Greenwillow, 1981), about a 12-year-old boy who helps his father, a manager of professional wrestlers, to save the family home in East Texas from creditors, was named one of that year's best books for young adults by the American Library Association.
        Mr. Salassi was born in Vicksburg, Miss. He lectured on creative writing and English at the University of Arkansas and taught English at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Adam, of Washington, and Paul, of Fayetteville.
