        Sol Ganz, a retired aerosol-paint manufacturer, died on Wednesday at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he was vice chairman of the board of trustees. He was 74 and lived in Belle Harbor, Queens, and Boca Raton, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, the medical center said.
        Mr. Ganz founded his business, the New York Bronze Powder Company, in a Brooklyn garage in 1959 with an investment of $2,500. It became a developer of paint that could be sprayed on. When he sold the business in 1983, it employed more than 350 people at factories and distribution centers in Elizabeth, N.J., Taylor, Pa., Dallas, Chicago and Los Angeles.
        When the company had its headquarters in Elizabeth, Mr. Ganz financed a program that took children to sports events to reward them for good behavior in school. In retirement, he devoted much time to philanthropy.
        He was recently elected to a third term as vice chairman at Maimonides, where he served on many committees. Other beneficiaries were the Alzheimer Association, United Hospital Fund of New York, the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith, as well as the New York City Ballet and the New York Philharmonic.
        A native of Borough Park, Brooklyn, Mr. Ganz graduated from St. John's University School of Law, but he never went into practice as a lawyer. Instead, he made a career in business and was active in sales of paints before founding his own manufacturing center.
        Mr. Ganz is survived by his wife of 51 years, Shari; a son, Dr. Cary Ganz, of Dix Hills, L.I.; a daughter, Nancy Morrison, of Livingston, N.J., and six grandchildren.
