        Ronald Gow, an English playwright known for his adaptations of novels, died on Tuesday in London, his family announced last week. He was 95.
        The cause was not disclosed.
        Mr. Gow's first hit was his play "Love on the Dole," which he adapted from a novel by Walter Greenwood about a woman's travails in the Depression. Wendy Hiller, later Dame Wendy, starred in it in 1934 in London.
        She and Mr. Gow were married in 1937. She went on to perform in other plays by him, including "Tess of the D'Urbervilles," which he adapted in 1946 from the novel by Thomas Hardy.
        In reporting Mr. Gow's death, The Daily Telegraph of London said on Friday that admirers "appreciated Gow's skill in filleting novels and giving a fluent narrative to otherwise lumpen stories." His plays that were not based on novels did not fare as well with critics and audiences.
        Mr. Gow grew up near Manchester, England, and was educated at the University of Manchester. He worked as a chemist and then as a teacher while taking part in amateur theatricals before turning professional.
        In addition to Dame Wendy, Mr. Gow is survived by their son and daughter.
