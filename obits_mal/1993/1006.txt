He returned to Paris the following year, joined Coudert's law office and was named senior partner in 1952. His clients included the industrialist Armand Hammer, the Sara Lee Corporation, the Walt Disney companies and the Lockheed Corporation.
        He also represented Anaconda, a subsidiary of ARCO, and the Ford Motor Company, when it established its operations in France and in other European countries.
        Mr. Torem was a past president of the American Chamber of Commerce in France.
        Born in Newark, he graduated magna cum laude from Amherst College and received a law degree from Harvard in 1938.
