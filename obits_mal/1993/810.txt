        Bernard Levine, a retired industrialist and supporter of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, his alma mater, died last Wednesday at Tisch Hospital at New York University Medical Center. A former resident of Malverne, L.I., he was 68 and lived in Boca Raton, Fla.
        He died of complications after heart surgery, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Levine earned an electrical engineering degree at Cooper Union in 1944 and started his career at Bendix Aviation. After World War II, he was employed as chief engineer by a military contractor that was later acquired by United Technologies Corporation, which named him divisional general manager.
        In 1959, he joined two other graduates of Cooper Union to form the Vernitron Corporation, a Manhattan-based maker of motors and electronic components. He was its president and chief executive and retired in 1984.
        Mr. Levine kept in touch with Cooper Union through the years as a trustee, fund-raiser and member of many committees of its board of trustees. He also was a director of the Cooper Union Research Foundation and helped by recruiting recent Cooper Union graduates for his company and supplying the school with laboratory equipment.
        He was a founding member of the congregation of the Malverne Jewish Center, which he served as president and treasurer.
        Mr. Levine is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Anna Bluman; a son, Dr. Jerome F. of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.; a daughter, Linda Stone of Nanuet, N.Y.; a sister, Lillian Steinberg of Plainview, L.I.; two brothers, Isidore of Sun City West, Ariz., and Sidney of Palm Beach, Fla., and four grandchildren.
