        Gabor Peter, who headed Hungary's powerful State Security Authority in the late 1940's and early 1950's, has died in Budapest, a Hungarian newspaper reported Thursday. He was 86.
        The newspaper, Reform, said Mr. Peter had died on Jan. 23. The Associated Press reported that a Hungarian historian, Tibor Zinner, who confirmed Mr. Peter's death, said he had interviewed him in recent years and had found him to be unrepentent.
        Under Mr. Peter, the State Security Authority stood at the apex of the system of internal control -- what its many critics called terror. The authority, a force of 50,000 men and women, served as the Communist party's punitive arm and as a funnel for many tips that streamed daily into Hungary's various security agencies.
        Mr. Peter joined the Hungarian Communist party in 1931, when it was illegal. He crossed over to the Soviet side when the Red Army entered Hungary, then returned to Budapest with what became the nucleus of the post-war secret police.
        But in the early 1950's, a period marked by anti-Semitic purges in the Soviet Union, Mr. Peter, who was Jewish, fell from power. In 1954, the Hungarian news agency announced that he had been sentenced to life imprisonment for "crimes against the state and the people." He was released from prison in 1959 and later worked as a tailor and a librarian.
        Mr. Peter is survived by his wife, Jolanda Simon.
