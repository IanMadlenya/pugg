        Irving Atkins, former chief of the litigation department of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, died on Wednesday at Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey. He was 83 and lived in Teaneck, N.J.
        The cause was acute leukemia, said his son, Charles.
        Mr. Atkins started his career as a lawyer and treasurer for A. DeSwaan, an importing and exporting company at 44 Wall Street in 1945, after serving on the staff of the National War Labor Board in World War II.
        He joined the state tax department in 1965 as a senior attorney and rose to the rank of deputy head of the New York City office and later chief of litigation before he retired in 1986. After he retired, Mr. Atkins worked as a part-time consultant in the New York offices of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue consultant.
        As part of his work with the tax department, he conducted a 20-year research project into the tax questions surrounding the donation of J. Pierpont Morgan's art collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art after his death in 1913.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Atkins was educated at the City College of New York and received his law degree from the New York University School of Law.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Bertha; a son, Charles, of Boston; a daughter, Joan Miller of Lake Champagne, Ill.; a brother, Michael, of Queens, and eight grandchildren. Another brother, Dr. Joseph Atkins of Yonkers, died in July.
