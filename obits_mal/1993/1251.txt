        Peter Lipman-Wulf, a German-born sculptor who lived in the United States for nearly 50 years, died on Saturday in Hamburg, Germany. He was 88 and had homes in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, L.I.
        He died of cardiac arrest at the home of his wife's relatives, said Frank Mecklenburg, a family friend. Mr. Lipman-Wulf had gone to Hamburg after attending the opening of an exhibition of his work in France.
        He was born in Berlin and studied at the Berlin Academy. Mr. Lipman-Wulf, who was Jewish, left Germany in 1933 when the Nazis came to power, after being dismissed from his post at the Prussian Academy in Berlin and having several sculpture commissions canceled. He lived first in Paris and then in Basel before immigrating to the United States in 1947.
        He worked in wood, bronze and ceramics in a semi-abstract style that often reflected the influence of German Expressionism. He also did portrait busts, including those of the conductors Bruno Walter and Karl Bohm for the Metropolitan Opera.
        He exhibited his work at galleries in New York City and had a retrospective at the Jewish Museum in 1961. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the British Museum in London and the National Museum in Berlin.
        Mr. Lipman-Wulf's first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and their daughter, Ghilia; another daughter, Michele Staeble of Lausanne, Switzerland, and two grandchildren.
