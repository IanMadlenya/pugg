        Prof. Robert J. Clements of Mahopac, N.Y., a Renaissance scholar who started the program of comparative literature at New York University in 1965 and headed it until 1978, died yesterday at Putnam Hospital Center, Carmel, N.Y. He was 80.
        The cause was a brain hemorrhage, according to his wife, Lorna.
        Dr. Clements was a Michelangelo scholar who wrote many books on Renaissance literature and esthetics. He received a doctorate in Romance languagues from the University of Chicago in 1939 and later concentrated on Italian.
        He joined the N.Y.U. faculty as a professor of French and Italian in 1954, developed the first doctorate program in Italian and then a similar program in comparative literature. He became a professor emeritus in 1978.
        Dr. Clements served on the advisory board of the National Endowment of the Humanities, and at various times headed the French, Italian, Portuguese and Romance sections of the Modern Language Association of America.
        Dr. Clements organized the first international congress of Italian studies in America, which was held in 1973 at N.Y.U. In 1975 Italy made him a Knight of the Italian Republic in recognition of his "past and present contribution to the culture of Italy."
        He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Erin Clements, also of Mahopac; a son, Robert C. Clements of Lexington, Mass., and two grandchildren.
