        Dr. Morris H. Saffron, a dermatologist who became an authority on colonial American medicine and archivist-historian of the New Jersey Medical Society, died on April 28 at his Manhattan home. He was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, said his niece, Lois Ballon of Manhattan.
        Dr. Saffron, who practiced in both New York and New Jersey, was a native of Passaic, N.J., and graduated from Columbia University in 1925 before receiving his M.D. from the University of Maryland. He qualified as a flight surgeon and served in World War II with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        He taught at Seton Hall College of Medicine, Kean College, Rutgers Medical School and the New Jersey College of Medicine. He was the author of several books, including "Surgeon to Washington" (Columbia University Press, 1977). A bibliophile, he returned to Columbia to earn a master's in history and a Ph.D. at the age of 63 in 1968.
        On Nov. 2, 1967, he presented Columbia with the fragile manuscript of a lecture delivered exactly 200 years earlier on the opening day of King's College Medical School by one of the six physicians who in 1767 made up the entire faculty. Dr. Saffron had bought the manuscript at an auction.
        After the Revolution, King's College became Columbia and its medical school grew into Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Besides his niece, he is survived by a sister, Julia Ballon of Hollywood, Fla.
