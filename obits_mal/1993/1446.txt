        Richard A. Bertelsen, a top officer of Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based financial empire, was found dead in his Boston home on Monday. He was 42.
        A corporate statement said he appeared to have died of natural causes.
        Mr. Bertelsen, known as Rab, joined Fidelity Investment in 1978 as manager of shareholder communications. For the last 12 years he was vice president of corporate communications, charged with a range of responsibilities that included public relations, shareholder reports and corporate literature.
        He had put aside his day-to-day duties last year and, at his death, was at work on a history of Fidelity Investments and the origins of the mutual fund industry. The company said it was too early to say how far he had gone with his research and whether someone else could complete the project.
        Privately owned, Fidelity manages some $230 billion in assets for five million individual and institutional investors. It provides its customers with mutual fund and investment services out of offices in 76 cities around the country.
        A native of Boston, Mr. Bertelsen graduated from Harvard College with a B.A. degree in English in 1973. From then until he joined Fidelity Investments, he worked for Little, Brown & Company, the Boston publisher, as an editor responsible for the development and production of college textbooks.
        Mr. Bertelsen is survived by his mother, Galina Bertelsen of Wellesley.
