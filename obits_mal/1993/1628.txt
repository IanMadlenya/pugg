        Arthur D. Brennan, for 25 years a judge, first in Westchester County and then in the New York State courts, died on Friday at the King Street Nursing Home in Rye Brook, N.Y. He was 94 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was old age, said his daughter, Patricia B. Stanley of Pine Plains, N.Y.
        Mr. Brennan was elected a judge of the Westchester County Court in 1951. Two years later, he was elected a justice of the New York State Supreme Court for the Ninth District. In 1960, he was named an associate justice of the Appellate Division for the Second Judicial Department, where he served until he retired in 1976.
        He is survived by his daughter and two granddaughters.
