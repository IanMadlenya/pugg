        Rolf Bjoerling, a tenor and the son of the legendary Swedish tenor Jussi Bjoerling, died late Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. He was 64.
        The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet said the cause of death was heart failure, at his home in Stockholm, the wire service said.
        Because his father had discouraged him, Mr. Bjoerling once told an interviewer, he started singing professionally only at the age of 32, in 1960, a few months after his father's death. Three years later, he made his American debut at Town Hall and attracted lavish praise.
        The critic for The New York Times, Ross Parmenter, wrote that although Mr. Bjoerling "made a favorable impression" he was "not yet in his father's class."
        In subsequent performances, the inevitable comparison with Jussi Bjoerling, who was widely regarded as one of the century's greatest voices, was devastating. If Mr. Bjoerling's compact physique and cheerful round face were reminiscent of his father, his vocal endowment was judged to be distinctly modest.
        As a result, the younger Mr. Bjoerling's career was largely confined to performances at the Royal Opera House in his native Sweden.
