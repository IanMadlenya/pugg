        Dr. George Gero, a psychoanalyst for six decades, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Gero, who practiced until a year ago, was a training and supervising analyst at the New York Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, starting in 1945. He was also a clinical lecturer at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He specialized in the study of depression.
        A native of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in philosophy and psychology at the University of Cologne in 1925 and a medical degree from the University of Heidelberg. He trained as a psychoanalyst at the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute.
        When the Nazis came to power in Germany, he fled to Denmark and practiced there until 1941, when he again fled the Nazi advance. He came to the United States under a foundation grant and lived in Arizona before moving to New York.
        His wife, Jeanne, died in 1985.
        He is survived by a daughter, Nina Gero Tobier, and a son, Peter Jan Gero, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
        Correction:  January 16, 1993, Saturday
        An obituary yesterday about Dr. George Gero, a Manhattan psycho analyst who died on Monday, misstated his professional status. He continued to practice until his death.
