        Dr. Robert W. Holliday, a heart surgeon, died on Tuesday at his home in Mount Kisco. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Florence.
        Dr. Holliday retired in 1984 as director of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at Northern Westchester Hospital. He had also been on the medical staffs of several other hospitals in the county.
        As director of surgery at what is known today as the Westchester County Medical Center, Dr. Holliday was credited with performing the first open heart operation in the county in 1959.
        He graduated from Princeton University in 1944 and received doctorates in both medicine and medical science from Columbia University. He served in the Army Medical Corps.
        He is survived by Florence, his wife of 45 years; a daughter, Dr. Ellen Holliday of Brewster, N.Y.; two sons, Robert Jr. and Joseph , both of Mount Kisco, and two grandsons.
