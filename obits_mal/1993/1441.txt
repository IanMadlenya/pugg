        Ian Burn, an Australian Conceptual artist, writer and unionist who worked and exhibited in the United States and Europe in the 1970's with the Art and Language collective, died on Sept. 29 in Milton, Australia. He was 53 and lived in Rozelle, a suburb of Sydney.
        Mr. Burn drowned in rough seas while swimming with his daughter and her friends, one of whom he was apparently trying to rescue at the time of his death. The incident involved no other deaths.
        Mr. Burn was born on Dec. 29, 1939, in Geelong, Australia, and attended the National Gallery School of Art in Melbourne. In 1964 he moved to London, where he became affiliated with Art and Language, and he continued this affiliation when he moved to New York City in 1967.
        Along with such artists as Mel Ramsden, Roger Cutforth and Joseph Kosuth, Mr. Burn worked as a publisher, editor and writer on a number of small magazines, including Untitled Magazine, Art-Language Magazine and The Fox, publications that favored Marxist theory and were often antagonistic toward the art world. His work was included in "Information," an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1970.
        Mr. Burn returned to Australia in 1977 and taught at Sydney University. In 1979, he was active in the formation of the Artworkers Union, and in 1981 he began working as a journalist with the Union Media Services in Sydney, writing on a range of cultural and social subjects.
        His work is represented in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Australian National Gallery in Canberra and the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
        He is survived by his wife, Avril; a daughter, Rebecca; a son, Daniel, and a brother, Bob.
