        Dr. Terry Langer, director of clinical cardiology at Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia since 1985, died Tuesday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. A resident of Cherry Hill, N.J., he was 52.
        The cause of death was liver failure, his family said.
        A native of the Bronx, Dr. Langer was a summa cum laude graduate of New York University and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School. In the late 1960's, he did research at the Heart Institute of the National Institutes of Health and became recognized as an expert on lipid metabolism and lipid diseases.
        After a stint at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, he moved to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. There he was director of clinical cardiology from 1972 to 1985 as well as an associate professor of medicine at the university.
        Dr. Langer is survived by his wife of 30 years, the former Joan Gordon; three sons, Dr. David Langer of Philadelphia, Robert of Manhattan, and Jonathan of Chicago; his mother, Francine Langer of Atlantic Beach, L.I., and his sister, Marlene Edelstein, also of Atlantic Beach.
