        Gerald J. Carroll, a decorated naval pilot who wrote two novels based on his experiences in Vietnam, died on Thursday at his home in Leonardtown, Md. He was 46.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Carroll, one of the Navy's most decorated aviators of the Vietnam war, served for 21 years and retired in 1990 with the rank of lieutenant commander. He flew 198 combat missions, also serving in Grenada and Beirut. He was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal.
        His writing career did not begin until after he left the Navy and only after several years of encouragement by a former high school classmate, the author Tom Clancy, to start a novel.
        His first novel, "North S.A.R.," was published in 1991 by Pocket Books, a division of Paramount Publishing. Mr. Carroll's latest novel, "Ghostrider One," about Navy and Marine pilots in the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, will be published in October by Pocket Books.
        Mr. Carroll was born in Washington and grew up in Norwich, Conn., and Baltimore. He graduated from Boston College.
        In his Navy career he was an instructor at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md.
        He is survived by his wife, Deborah, and three sons, Sean P., Kevin G. and Brian J., all of Leonardtown, Md.
