        Peretz Miransky, a member of an influential young Yiddish literary group in Poland between World Wars I and II, died on Saturday in a hospital in Toronto, where he lived. He was 85.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Miransky won the National Jewish Book Award in the United States in 1980 and twice won the J. I. Segal award of Canada for Yiddish poetry.
        He wrote fables and poetry as a member of Young Vilna, a group of writers from Vilna who adapted traditional Yiddish to express concerns of their generation.
        His early manuscripts were lost when he escaped the German invasion in World War II. He later recorded his early writings from memory in his first book, "A Light for a Penny."
        After resettling in Canada in 1949, he worked as a shipper for a store, then as a Canadian distribution agent for The Yiddish Daily Journal, which had headquarters in New York City.  Later he became an agent for other Yiddish papers.
        After he retired in the mid-1970's, he wrote poetry full time and published three collections.
        He was married for 28 years to the former Lola Bluds, who died in 1970.
        His survivors include his wife of 17 years, the former Saba Friede; two daughters, Libby Jeremy Miransky of Manhattan and Chana Miransky of Toronto; a son, Rami of Toronto, and four grandchildren.
