        Stanley L. Kaufman, a lawyer who specialized in bringing suits on behalf of corporations' disgruntled stockholders, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer of the liver, his family said.
        Mr. Kaufman was the senior partner in the New York-based law firm of Kaufman Malchman, Kaufmann & Kirby, which has a branch in Los Angeles. He retired last year.
        He was an expert in bringing lawsuits called class actions on behalf of minority shareholders in corporations.
        In the 1950's, Mr. Kaufman successfully represented mutual-fund shareholders in what, as he later recalled, was the first case in which the courts required management fees to be substantially reduced as the mutual funds grew. He said the case, in the Delaware Chancery Court, had set a standard in management-fee charges in the industry for more than 30 years.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from Townsend Harris High School, City College and in 1935, with honors, from Harvard Law School.
        He became a staff attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission before World War II, then served in the Army in Europe and rose to captain. In 1946 he became a founding partner in his law firm.
        Mr. Kaufman's 1943 marriage to the former Ruth Fried ended in divorce after more than 20 years.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Sigrun Rampoldt, whom he married in 1972; two sons, Stanley L. Jr., of Manhattan, and Charles, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Susan, of Manhattan, all from his first marriage, and three granddaughters.
