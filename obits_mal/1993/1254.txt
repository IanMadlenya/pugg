        Donald S. Macdonald, a retired Foreign Service officer and professor emeritus of Korean studies at Georgetown University, died on Sunday at a Washington hospice. A resident of Washington, he was 74.
        He had been ill with cancer for three months, his family said.
        Mr. Macdonald, who spent more than 10 years in Korea as an Army officer, diplomat and teacher, was the author of two recent books about that country, published by Westview Press. They are "The Koreans: Contemporary Politics and Society" (1990) and "U.S.-Korea Relations from Liberation to Self-Reliance" (1992). He also wrote many articles on Korea and Far East Asian affairs.
        Born in Boston, he was a business graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He held a master's from George Washington University and a Ph.D. from Harvard, both in political science.
        Professor Macdonald was a career officer in the State Department from 1947 to 1969, stationed in Washington, Istanbul and Geneva as well as Seoul. From 1971 to 1980 he was a professor at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania and also taught at George Washington University and Trinity College in Washington.
        Through the 1980's he was on the faculty of Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, where he helped organize a Korean studies program. In 1986 and 1990 he was also a visiting professor and Fulbright scholar at Korea University in Seoul.
        He was associated with Senior International Resource Inc., a nonprofit organization he co-founded in 1990 to help government agencies and private firms in dealing with East Asia.
        Professor Macdonald is survived by his wife of 48 years, Jean Carroll Macdonald; a son, Thomson, of Boston; a brother, Gregory, of North Stratford, N.H., and a grandson.
