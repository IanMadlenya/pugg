        Prof. Howard Newton Porter, professor emeritus of Greek and Latin at Columbia University and former chairman of its classics department, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Yarmouth, Me. A former resident of Guilford, Conn., he was 76.
        He died after a long illness, his family reported.
        Professor Porter, an authority on Homeric metrics and the poetry of Pindar, headed Columbia's Department of Greek and Latin from 1968 to 1971. He joined the faculty in 1956 and reached emeritus status in 1978. Before his years at Columbia he had taught at Yale University.
        During World War II, he was a section chief on the team that broke German codes -- service for which he earned a Bronze Star and the British Empire Medal.
        He was born in New Haven, Conn. He was a 1938 Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Yale College and in 1942 received his Ph.D. from Yale.
        He was an avid chess player and gardener, growing desert and alpine plants in Connecticut. For several years, he edited the journal of the American Rock Garden Society.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Harmon of Thornwood, N.Y.; two daughters, Martha Haeseler of Guilford, Conn., and Jane Gagliano of Thornwood; two sons, Michael, of Chebeague Island, Me., and David, of Baltimore; three brothers, Stephen, of Manhattan, Charles T., of Damariscotta, Me., and John 3d, of Lenox, Mass., and nine grandchildren.
