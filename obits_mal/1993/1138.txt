        William T. Corrigan, a television director and producer, died on Wednesday at Noble Horizons nursing home in Salisbury, Conn. He was 79 and lived in Sharon, Conn.
        The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said Robert K. Darden, a friend.
        Mr. Corrigan, a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, worked in television for 30 years. His directorial credits include "Armstrong Circle Theater," "Hallmark Hall of Fame" and "Kraft Mystery Theater."
        In 1963 he directed a revival of Jerome Kern's "Oh Lady! Lady!" as the opening production of the newly renovated Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.
        Mr. Corrigan left television in the mid-1960's and turned to home remodeling and decorating.
        He is survived by two brothers, John, of Watsonville, Calif., and Fredric, of Minneapolis.
