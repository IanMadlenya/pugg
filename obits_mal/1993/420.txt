        Leighton Hammond Coleman, a leading practitioner of corporate and banking law in New York for 45 years, died on Sunday at St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Smithtown, L.I. He was 96 and lived in Stony Brook, L.I.
        The cause of death was a stroke, his family reported.
        For 33 years, he was a partner in the firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell. He was also the last surviving lawyer to have been with its predecessor, Stetson Jennings & Russell, which he joined in 1922. In 1934, he became a partner in Davis Polk Wardwell Gardiner & Reed.
        He developed a close relationship with J. P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley, and he supervised the separation of those banking houses in 1935, as required by the Glass-Steagall Act, which divorced commercial from investment banking. He also took charge of the incorporation of the J. P. Morgan partnership in 1940 and the merger between J. P. Morgan and the Guaranty Trust Company of New York in 1959.
        In World War I, Mr. Coleman, a native of Bethlehem, Pa., enlisted in the Army as an aviation cadet and served as a pursuit pilot. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1922.
        Over the years, he was a director and outside counsel to many large corporations. He was a vestryman of St. James Episcopal Church in St. James, L.I., from 1936 to 1963.
        Mr. Coleman's wife, the former Jane Fraser, died in 1972.
        He is survived by his son, Leighton H. Jr., of Stony Brook; four daughters, Jane Blair of Chevy Chase, Md., Helen Evarts of Manhattan, Sally Woodworth of Portland, Me., and Prudence Sellars of Litchfield, Conn.; 16 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchilden.
