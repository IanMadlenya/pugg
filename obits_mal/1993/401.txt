        Charles R. Standen, a retired advertising executive, died Thursday in a hospital in Hinsdale, Ill., where he lived. He was 75.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Standen headed Tatham-Laird & Kudner, an advertising agency whose clients included the RCA Record Club, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble Company, Dristan, Goodyear, Ty-D-Bol and R. J. Reynolds. He also served as a director of the American Association of Advertising Agencies and of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.
        He started as a merchandising manager at the Tatham-Laird firm in Chicago in 1947, a year after the company was founded. He became director of client services and was elected president in 1964 and chairman in 1969. In the 1960's he led the merger of Tatham-Laird with the Kudner Agency in New York City.
        Mr. Standen was a native of Lorain, Ohio, and a graduate of Ohio University. During World War II, he served with the Army in Europe.
        Surviving are his wife of more than 50 years, the former Maxine Lundgren; a son, Craig, of Cincinnati; two daughters, Cheri Allen of Wilmette, Ill., and Christy Kuney of Denver; a sister, Dorothy Scheel of Sarasota, Fla., and six grandchildren.
