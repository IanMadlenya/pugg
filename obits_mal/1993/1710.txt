        Lauchlin Currie, an economist who helped shape the New Deal during the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, died last Thursday at his home in Bogota, Colombia. He was 91.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Juan Carlos Guerrero, an associate.
        Dr. Currie joined the Roosevelt Administration in 1934 and became deputy chief of research for the Federal Reserve Board. In 1939 he became the special economic assistant to President Roosevelt and over the next six years wrote a series of reports for the White House on national economic policy, international trade and post-war reparations.
        In 1942, Dr. Currie was Roosevelt's personal representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, then Chungking, and headed several delegations to international conferences.
        Dr. Currie left the Government after Roosevelt's death in 1945. In 1948, Elizabeth Bentley, a former Soviet agent who became an informant for the United States, accused Dr. Currie of having supplied information to a Soviet spy ring. Dr. Currie was also identified by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a source, witting or unwitting, of information that had been passed to Russian agents.
        The accusations, which were never substantiated, were denied by Dr. Currie in public statements and under oath before Congressional investigators. "But you never live down guilt by association," he said later in Bogota, where he went to live in 1950.
        Dr. Currie, who received a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, became an economic adviser to the Colombian Government. He also operated a dairy farm and was an adviser to the Colombian Institute of Housing and Loans at his death. A Canadian by birth, he became an American citizen in 1935 and a Colombian citizen in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife, Elvira, of Bogota.
