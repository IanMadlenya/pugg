        John Ashworth, an author of short stories who taught writing at Columbia University for nearly two decades, died on Friday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 83 years old and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
        Complications from cancer were the cause, his son Daniel said.
        One of Mr. Ashworth's stories, "High Diver," which described the lengths to which people will go to escape working-class lives, won an O. Henry Award and was one of three tales on which the 1950's film "Queen for a Day" was based.
        Mr. Ashworth, a graduate of Harvard University, with degrees in English and comparative literature, had an eclectic writing career. He contributed articles to The Atlantic and Harper's Magazine, serving as a foreign correspondent for The Boston Transcript and The Hindustan Times, and worked for the Office of War Information during World War II as an analyst of Nazi propaganda.
        For 17 years, he lectured on his craft at the School of General Studies at Columbia University, his son said.
        Mr. Ashworth is survived, in addition to his son Daniel, of Brooklyn, by his wife, Adrienne; a daughter, Emily Ashworth Marin of San Francisco; two other sons, John Jr., of Rowley, Mass., and David, of Old Lyme, Conn.; a sister, Martha McNay of Cranston, R.I., and a granddaughter.
