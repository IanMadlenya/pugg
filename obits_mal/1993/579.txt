        Prince Kyril Scherbatow, a member of the Russian nobility, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan at the age of 90. The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        He was a native of St. Petersburg. Both his parental families belonged to the House of Rurik, which founded Russia.
        His father, Prince Paul Scherbatow, was a colonel and aide de camp to Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, commander of the Russian Army on the Western and Turkish fronts in World War I. His mother, Princess Anna Bariatinsky, was lady-in-waiting to Empress Alexandra of Russia.
        After the Bolshevik revolution, he fled to Constantinople as a teen-ager. He served as an interpreter for the British Royal Navy, then studied in Bulgaria and Belgium.
        Next he worked in banking in Brussels and Paris in the 1920's, then in 1932 he immigrated to the United States as a representative for Veuve Cliquot champagne.
        In 1939 he married Adelaide Sedgwick Munroe, and they operated guest homes in Jamaica and Bermuda for society and celebrity visitors. She died in 1968.
        He is survived by his second wife of 22 years, the former Lucile Forman Palmer; a brother, Prince Alexis, of Manhattan; three sisters, Princesses Nadejda Scherbatow of Paris, Anne Nabokoff and Olga Djordjadze, both of Brussels; and three stepchildren, Harry Munroe of Fairfield, Conn., and Lucile Hamlin and Jerome Hamlin, both of Manhattan.
