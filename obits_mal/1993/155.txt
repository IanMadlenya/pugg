        John Stender, the first director of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, died Saturday at the Hallmark Nursing Home in Federal Way, a suburb of Seattle. He was 76 and lived in Federal Way.
        Mr. Stender died of bone cancer, said his wife, Mary Ruth.
        Mr. Stender was a three-term Republican member of the Washington State Senate when President Richard M. Nixon appointed him in 1973 to head the newly created agency, whose mandate was to oversee safety in the workplace. Mr. Stender was a lifelong member of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Shipbuilders, Forgers and Helpers.
        In 1975, President Gerald R. Ford appointed Mr. Stender as an assistant secretary of the Selective Service Administration and the following year to an assistant secretary position with the Environmental Protection Agency.
        A native of Ismay, Mont., Mr. Stender had joined the union after graduating from Rocky Mountain College in Billings, Mont., at 18. He began work at a shipyard in Seattle but soon became a business agent for the union.
        Mr. Stender was elected to the Washington State Senate in 1962 and served there until his OSHA appointment.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, JoAnne, of Seattle; two sons, John Jr., of Sandy, Utah, and James, of Kent, Wash.; a step-daughter, Joan Springer, of Lexington, Ky.; a brother, Carl, of Corpus Christi, Tex.; a sister, Evelyn Sanders, of Springfield, Ark.; six grandchildren, and six step-grandchildren.
