        Donald Kvares, the author of more than 100 plays, many of which were performed Off and Off Off Broadway, died on Tuesday at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in the Bronx. He was 57.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, said Viktor Allen, a friend.
        Mr. Kvares told an interviewer that he became "fascinated by the macabre" while a high school student on Long Island. As a teen-ager, he said, he submitted a series of characteristically bizarre stories to a publisher only to have them returned with a rejection slip on which was written "UGH".
        "I couldn't figure out whether that was critical commentary or the secretary's initials," he said, but he was undeterred and soon developed an interest in playwriting. In at the Beginning
        He found a welcome reception in New York during the early days of the Off Off Broadway movement, seeing his works produced at the Cafe Cino and La Mama Experimental Theater. By 1985, when two of his one-act plays were performed at the Sargent Theater on West 54th Street, Mr. Kvares declared that it was his 100th production in New York.
        The satirical tone of his work was often captured in titles like "Wuziz," "Couchmates," "Springtime for Mahler" and "Freudian Memoirs of Viola Pickins."
        An ominous tone also frequently pervaded his work. He once told an interviewer that the fog in his plays "could as well be nuclear fallout or a deadly disease."
        Critics labeled his plays "neo-absurdist" and "black comedy" and frequently compared them to works by Sam Shepard and the film maker Steven Spielberg.
        Mr. Kvares's play "Smoking Pistols" won the Samuel French/Double Image award, and "Doctor's Office Disco" was given a New York Drama League award.
        He is survived by a sister, Bonnie Viola-Kvares.
