        Marvin Fisher, who composed "When Sunny Gets Blue," "Destination Moon" and other songs, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, L.I. He was 76 and lived in Southampton.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Lee Davis, a friend.
        Mr. Fisher was born in New York, a son of Fred Fisher, a Tin Pan Alley composer whose songs included "Chicago," "Dardanella" and "Peg o' My Heart." As a teen-ager, he attended the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School, for a year, studying piano and theory. He then worked as an arranger for the orchestras of Glenn Miller, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Les Brown and Johnny Green in the 1930's and 40's. He also played piano with the Justin Stone Orchestra.
        In the late 40's he began composing and working as the West Coast representative for Fred Fisher Music Company, founded by his father in 1907.
        In 1942, after his father's death, Mr. Fisher and his brother, Dan, also a composer, took over the company. Marvin Fisher later founded a subsidiary, Marvin Music, which published his songs and those of Nat (King) Cole, Rosemary Clooney and Peggy Lee.
        His songs, which included "Cloud Morning" and "For Once in Your Life," were recorded by Cole, Joe Williams, Mel Torme, Mabel Mercer and George Shearing.
        Mr. Fisher is survived by his wife, Pamela; his brother, of Manhattan; a sister, Doris, of Los Angeles; a son, Frederick, of Manhattan; a daughter, Penny Trombina of Oradell, N.J., and two grandsons.
