        Gino Bechi, an opera baritone who became a popular leading man in Italian musical films in the late 1940's, died on Tuesday at his home in Florence, Italy. He was 79.
        His daughter, Rosella, said his death occurred in his sleep.
        Mr. Bechi sang at La Scala in the late 1940's and made his American debut in 1951 at Carnegie Hall, singing Figaro in "The Barber of Seville." His opera roles included the title roles in "Rigoletto" and "Nabucco" and Iago in an "Otello" staged by Roberto Rossellini.
        His films included "When Love Calls," "The Lovers," "The Voice of Love" and "A Voice in Your Heart," all romantic musicals released in the United States with subtitles.
        He was the offscreen voice of Amonasro in a 1954 film of "Aida" (Sophia Loren played the onscreen title role to Renata Tebaldi's voice), and the elder Germont in a 1968 film of "La Traviata" (Anna Moffo was Violetta).
        In addition to his daughter Rosella, of Florence, he is survived by his wife, Juliana, also of Florence, and another daughter, Daniela Giusti of Frankfurt.
