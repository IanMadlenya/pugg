        Lebert J. Lombardo, a brother of Guy Lombardo who played the trumpet in his band, the Royal Canadians, died on Wednesday at Lee County Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 88 and lived on Sanibel Island, Fla.
        The cause was emphysema, said his brother-in-law Kenneth A. Gardner, known as Kenny, who sang with the band for many years.
        Lebert (pronounced LEE-bert) Lombardo and his brothers Guy and Carmen formed the band in 1923. Lebert was its chief trumpeter until about 1979.
        Mr. Gardner said yesterday that after Guy's death in 1977, Lebert became the sole owner of the band and its name, and that since 1980 its name had been franchised to a succession of band leaders. Carmen Lombardo died in 1971.
        With Lebert's death, Mr. Gardner said, ownership of the band's name has passed to his two daughters and his son Carmen.
        Lebert Lombardo, who was born in London, Ontario, is survived by four sons, Peter and Bill, both of San Francisco, John Michael, of the San Diego area, and Carmen, of Sanibel Island; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Sanibel Island, and Gina Cudahy of Fort Myers; two brothers, Victor, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Joseph, of Delray Beach, Fla.; two sisters, Elaine Gardner of Plandome, L.I., and Rosemarie Rogers of Whitehouse, Ohio, and five grandchildren.
