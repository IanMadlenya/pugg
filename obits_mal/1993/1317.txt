        Peter Mark Schifter, a theater, opera and television director who was nominated for a Tony Award for his work on the 1989 musical "Welcome to the Club," died last Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said Doug Jones, a friend.
        In addition to "Welcome to the Club," Mr. Schifter directed the original production of Albert Innaurato's long-running play "Gemini" and numerous productions Off Broadway and at resident theaters. Among these productions were the premiere of Christopher Durang's "History of the American Film," at the O'Neill Playwrights Conference and the Mark Taper Forum; "Titanic," Mr. Durang's Off Broadway debut, and "Das Lusitania Songspiel," with Mr. Durang and Sigourney Weaver.
        He also worked on many after-school-special television programs for Highgate Pictures. In recent years, he had been a director for the ABC daytime dramas "One Life to Live" and "Loving." A Start With 'Rumpelstiltskin'
        Mr. Schifter, a graduate of Ohio University and the Yale School of Drama, made his debut as an opera director with Joseph Beber's "Rumpelstiltskin" for the Pennsylvania Opera. He went on to direct the world premiere of Leonard Bernstein's "A Quiet Place" for the Houston Grand Opera and the first major revival of Ernst Krenek's "Jonny Spielt Auf," for the Long Beach Opera in California.
        Mr. Schifter also directed productions for the Washington Opera, the Central City Opera in Colorado, the Seattle Opera and the Edmonton Opera in Alberta. At Wolf Trap in Virginia, he staged Vittorio Giannini's "The Taming of the Shrew" with Anna Moffo.
        He is survived by his father, Sidney Schifter of Cranbury, N.J., and a sister, Esta Jo Schifter of Philadelphia.
