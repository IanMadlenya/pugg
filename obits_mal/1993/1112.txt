        Dr. Alan Paul Smith, a plant ecologist for the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, died on Thursday at Doctor's Hospital in Miami. A resident of Balboa, Panama, he was 48.
        The cause was complications from cancer, the institute said.
        Dr. Smith was best known for advancing the study of the tropical forest canopy and the plants and animals that live in the treetops high above the forest floor. He designed cranes that allow scientists to enter the canopy safely.
        At his death, he was preparing to deploy more cranes at Smithsonian field stations in Panama. He intended to couple this work with comparative research in a temperate forest at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Md.
        Dr. Smith had lived mostly in Panama since he joined the Tropical Research Institute as a staff scientist in 1974. In the early 1980's he was the institute's scientist in charge at Barro Colorado Island in Gatun Lake, northwest of Panama City, where a wildlife sanctuary was established in 1924. Since 1988, he also served as assistant director of terrestrial research for the institute.
        A native of Madison, N.J., he graduated from Earlham College and earned his master's and Ph.D. degrees at Duke University. Over the years, he held teaching and research assignments at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Nairobi and the University of Miami.
        His own research began with the study of high-altitude plants. Last year, he helped the Smithsonian and its partners in Kenya and at Princeton University establish the 48,000-acre Mpala Ranch on Kenya's Laikipia Plateau to study its mammals, grassland eco-systems and climate changes.
        Dr. Smith, who was single, is survived by an adopted son, Michael C. Smith, of Miami, and his parents, Glenn and Ruth Smith of Jamesburg, N.J.
