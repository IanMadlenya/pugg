        Edwin Margolis, a New York State judge and former legislative counsel to three Democratic Speakers of the State Assembly, died on Wednesday at his home in North Chatham, N.Y. He was 63.
        He died of a heart attack, said his aide, Virginia Albert.
        Mr. Margolis had been a Court of Claims judge in Albany since 1987. He started his government career in New York City's Law Department in 1957, and became the city's legislative liaison in Albany in 1961.
        Speaker Anthony Travia hired him as a counsel in 1966, and he continued serving under Speakers Stanley Steingut and Stanley Fink.
        Mr. Margolis was an expert on the intricacies of amending state pension laws, a fiscally and politically sensitive issue to elected officials. He also served as the counsel to the president of the State Constitutional Convention in 1967.
        Mr. Margolis had worked in the Manhattan law firm of Shea Gould. He was also a professor at Hunter College from 1968 to 1987, teaching classes on land-use-planning law, environmental protection, housing, community development and public finance. He also taught at Queens College and Albany Law School.
        He wrote on property tax and education finance issues. With Stanley Moses, he wrote "The Elusive Quest: The Struggle for Equality of Educational Opportunity" (1992) for which Gov. Mario M. Cuomo wrote the foreword.
        Mr. Margolis was the chairman of the Court of Claims Legislative Committee and a trustee of the North Chatham Free Association Library.
        He was born in New York City. He graduated from New York University and New York Law School. He served as a meteorologist in the United States Army in the early 1950's.
        His survivors include his wife of 23 years, Mary Anne Krupsak, a former lieutenant governor, and a brother, Eugene of McLean, Va.
