        Dr. John Wildeman, a criminologist and professor of sociology at Hofstra University, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 56 and lived in Hempstead, L.I.
        The cause was chronic liver disease, the university said.
        Dr. Wildeman was an expert on criminology and deviant behavior. He spent three years doing research for the Probation Management Institutes of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency and held training sessions for administrators of probation departments across the country.
        He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in Philadelphia in 1963 but left the priesthood three years later. He started his teaching career in the Bronx in 1967 at Lehman College of the City University of New York. He joined the Hofstra faculty in 1969 as an associate professor and advanced to full professor in 1988.
        He was a summa cum laude graduate of St. Charles Seminary in Philadelphia, received an M.A. cum laude from Gregorian University in Rome and earned his Ph.D. at New York University. He was the author of "Social Problem America: Alienation and Discontinuity" (1985).
        He is survived by his wife, Isabel, and a son, Peter.
