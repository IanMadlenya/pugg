        Franco Brusati, the director of "Bread and Chocolate," "To Forget Venice" and other award-winning films, died on Sunday in Rome, where he lived. He was 66.
        The cause of death was leukemia, said Teri Kane, a Manhattan press agent.
        "Bread and Chocolate," a picaresque comedy about the upwardly mobile strivings of an immigrant from southern Italy working in Switzerland, was released in 1978 in the United States and won the Golden Bear Award of the Berlin Film Festival as well as a New York Film Critics Award.
        "To Forget Venice," released here in 1980, concerned the relationships between two homosexual couples, one male, one female. The film received an Academy Award nomination as well as the Italian equivalent of the Academy Award for best film.
        Other Brusati films include "Tenderly," "I Am the Boss," "The Disorder," "The Tulips of Haarlem," "The Good Soldier" and "The Unworthy Uncle."  Also Wrote for the Stage
        Mr. Brusati was also a successful playwright whose work was performed throughout Europe. His plays include "Well Being," "The Troublesome Woman," "Roses of the Lake," "The Woman on the Bed" and "Gallant Conversation."
        Mr. Brusati, who was born in Milan, studied in Italy, Switzerland and England. After a brief career as a freelance journalist he moved to Rome, where he became a film assistant, eventually working with the directors Alberto Lattuada, Rene Clair and Roberto Rossellini.
        He collaborated on the script for Franco Zeffirelli's film version of "Romeo and Juliet," and was the author or co-author of many other movies, including "Under the Roman Sun," "A Sunday in August," "The Unfaithful" and "Seated at His Right."
        Mr. Brusati served on juries at the Cannes and Berlin film festivals and was president of the international jury of Europa Cinema.
        There are no immediate survivors, Ms. Kane said.
