        Sanzo Nosaka, a founder and former chairman of the Japan Communist Party who was expelled last year after party leaders called him a traitor to the party, died yesterday at his home in a Tokyo suburb. He was 101.
        Mr. Nosaka was by far the most respected Communist in Japan, where he had helped to found the party in 1922 after he returned from study in Britain, where he had helped to found the British Communist Party in 1920.
        He built the Japanese party into a prominent factor in politics if not a particularly significant one. But in the process, he was jailed for his politics, then fled to Soviet Union in 1931. He moved on to the United States, and served with the Communists in China before returning to Japan in 1946, when he was elected to Parliament.
        But in September 1992, party officials abruptly stripped him of the title of honorary chairman, which he had acquired in 1982 after stepping down as chairman of the party's central committee, a post he had held since 1958. And in December 1992 he was drummed out of the party entirely.
        Mr. Nosaka's disgrace, the party declared, stemmed from the discovery in the Soviet Communist Party archives of a letter that he had sent in the late 1930's from the United States, where he was living in exile, to the Communist International in Moscow.
        Japanese Communist Party officials said the half-century-old document proved that Mr. Nosaka had falsely accused another legendary Japanese Communist, Kenzo Yamamoto, of spying in Moscow for the Japanese police.
        In 1939 Mr. Yamamoto, who had gone to the Soviet Union in 1928, was executed by a Soviet firing squad.
        The Japanese party newspaper reported at the time that Mr. Nosaka had told a session of the central committee he had nothing to say about the matter. But Mr. Nosaka said in his autobiography that in fact he had tried to save Yamamoto's life.
