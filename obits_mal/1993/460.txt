        Henry M. Curran, a former Republican State Senator and chairman of the New York State Harness Racing Commission, died Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.
        Mr. Curran, who was born in Lock Haven, Pa., graduated from what was then Pace College. In World War II, he served with an armored unit in Europe, rising from private to captain, and was recalled to active service during the Korean War. He began his public-service career as a deputy sheriff and was elected Town Clerk of Oyster Bay in 1953.
        In 1960, the voters sent him to the State Senate, where he became chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Banking Lawn. He left the Senate undefeated in 1970 when Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller asked him to head the harness-racing panel. He was replaced as a commissioner in 1975, several months after the Democratic administration of Hugh L. Carey took office in Albany.
        Outside his public career, Mr. Curran was a partner in Curran, Cooney, Penny Agency Inc., a general insurance firm in Garden City, L.I.
        Mr. Curran is survived by his wife, the former Rita Rothmann; three sons, Henry R., of Huntington Bay, L.I., Paul M., of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Peter D., of Nashua, N.H.; a daughter, Lecia R. DeHaven of Westfield, N.J.; a sister, Margaret McCafferty of Fort Lauderdale, and four grandchildren.
