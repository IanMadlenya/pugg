        Brad Phillips, a retired radio news anchor at WINS in New York City and a leader in the national radio and television union, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had a short illness, his family said.
        Mr. Phillips was a newscaster on WINS for 44 years until his retirement last year. He started there as a disk jockey on music programs, after working as an announcer on several other stations.
        During the 1948 Truman-Dewey election, Mr. Phillips stayed on the air 23 consecutive hours. When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Mr. Phillips was the anchor for 12 straight hours.
        For more than 20 years he was a national and local officer of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, including serving a long tenure as national vice president.
        Brad Phillips was his professional name; he was born John A. Babis. A native of Manhattan, he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in education, both at New York University.
        As a teen-ager he toured the country, singing with a band. During World War II he served as a correspondent for the Armed Forces Radio Network.
        He is survived by four sons, Douglas Babis of Brentwood, L.I., Lawrence Babis of Missoula, Mont., Russell Babis of Westhampton Beach, L.I., and William Babis of Scotch Plains, N.J.; a daughter, Judy Smith of Springfield, Mass., and five grandchildren.
