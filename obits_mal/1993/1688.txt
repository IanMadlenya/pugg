        Capt. Lawrence A. Renehan, chairman of the Gulf and Eastern Steamship and Chartering Corporation of Houston, died Tuesday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Ann.
        A graduate of the Kings Point Merchant Marine Academy on Long Island, he joined the Farrell Lines in 1944 as a deck cadet. He went on to become an executive at Farrell, the International Paper Company and the Prudential-Grace Lines. In 1976, he was a founder of Gulf and Eastern Steamship and Chartering, a worldwide steamship agency.
        In addition to his wife of 35 years, he is survived by a son, Peter L. of Manhattan, and a daughter, Christina of Southport, Conn.
