        William B. Lodge, who helped build the CBS radio and television networks as a top executive in the formative years of the broadcasting industry, died Tuesday in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., where he lived. He was 85.
        He had been in declining health since he had a stroke in 1981, CBS said.
        Mr. Lodge joined CBS as an engineering assistant in 1931 when he was in his early 20's and fresh out of college. He rose to director of radio engineering in 1937 and vice president of engineering in 1949.
        With the advent of television, he was promoted to vice president of engineering for the CBS television network in 1952, and became vice president of affiliate relations and engineering in 1957.
        Among the issues and developments Mr. Lodge supervised were the introduction of high-quality taping technology, which enabled delayed broadcasts to the West Coast, the transformation from black-and-white to color, and the the introduction of microwave relays.
        He was also involved in the debate over the allocation of UHF and VHF frequencies, the financing of presidential convention and election coverage, and the North American treaty to prevent conflicting radio signals among neighboring nations.
        Mr. Lodge was born in Whitemarsh, Pa. He graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1930 and earned a master's degree there in 1931.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Margaret Wilkinson, and a brother, Harold of Cape Cod, Mass.
