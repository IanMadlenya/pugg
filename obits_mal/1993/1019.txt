        Haskell Cohn, a past president of the Boston Bar Association and a founder of the Boston law firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, died on Sunday at his home in Westwood, Mass. He was 91.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Francis X. Meaney, a spokesman for the firm.
        In 1933, Mr. Cohn and three other lawyers founded the firm, which today has 225 lawyers. He was a managing partner for about 30 years, retiring in 1988, though he continued to serve as counsel.
        He was born in Concord, N.H. He graduated from Dartmouth College, earning a law degree at Harvard in 1925. He began his legal career with Hale & Dorr in Boston.
        Surviving are his wife of 65 years, the former Harriet Segal; two daughters, Marjorie C. Wolf of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and Susanna C. Bensinger of San Francisco; a sister, Ruth C. Segel of Brookline, Mass.; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
