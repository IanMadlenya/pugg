        Philip Carlson, a New York advertising executive, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 34.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Carlson and Karen Hochman founded Ad Hoc Marketing Resources in 1983, and the firm became a leading independent direct response advertising agency. In 1991, Ad Hoc was acquired by Jordan, McGrath & Taylor. Mr. Carlson then joined the advertising firm of Biederman, Kelly & Shaffer as senior vice president and chief financial officer, positions he held until last April.
        Before Ad Hoc was founded, he had marketing jobs at General Foods and Citicorp.
        He was raised in Nissequogue, N.Y. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1981.
        He is survived by his companion, Thomas Cott of New York City; his mother, June Carlson Johnston of Nissequogue, and his sister, Barbara Carlson of New York City.
