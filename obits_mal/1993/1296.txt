        Mark Jollie, the financial administrator of the New York City Opera since 1987, died on Thursday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Susan Woelzl, the spokeswoman for the New York City Opera, said that the cause was AIDS.
        Mr. Jollie was born in Montclair, N.J., and was a graduate of Trenton State College. For the four years before he joined City Opera, he was an administrative assistant to John Crosby, the general director of the Santa Fe Opera. In the mid-1970's, Mr. Jollie taught music at Parsippany High School in New Jersey. From 1976 until 1982, he was a singer, dancer and coordinator in national touring productions of "Oklahoma" and "110 in the Shade."
        For the last several years, he had been on the board of directors of the Community Health Project.
        He is survived by his parents, Marjorie Jolie of Old Bridge, N.J., and George Jollie of Hawthorne, N.J., and two sisters, GeorgeAnn Limbach of Madison, N.J., and Kathleen Jollie of Bristol, Conn.
