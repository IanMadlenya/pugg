        Royce Marcellus Phillips, a former assistant principal in the New York City schools and former chairman of the education department at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, died on Oct. 3 at his home in Yonkers. He was 69 years old.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Daisye Glasse.
        Dr. Phillips received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in education from the University of Massachusetts. He taught at Public School 139 in Harlem, the high school he had attended, and later became an assistant principal at P.S. 146. He was also a professor of education at the University of Massachusetts and, later, at Medgar Evers.
        His marriage to Alice Little ended in divorce in 1951.
        Besides Mrs. Glasse, who lives in the Bronx, he is survived by two other sisters, Vivienne Mussenden of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and Constance Hall of the Bronx, and three brothers, Samuel Jr., of Elmsford, N.Y., Charles and Robert, both of the Bronx.
