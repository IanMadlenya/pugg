        Brother James X. Collins, director of development and former professor of anthropology at Manhattan College, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 45 and lived in a Christian Brothers' residence in Riverdale.
        The cause was complications from lymphoma, the college said.
        Brother James worked at the college in several capacities for almost 20 years, first as a part-time lecturer in sociology in 1974 and then as an assistant professor of sociology a year later. In 1987, he was appointed director of development, a job in which he directed the administration of grant money and fund-raising projects, including an annual fund-raising dinner held at the Waldorf-Astoria in January.
        He graduated from the Catholic University of America in Washington. In 1965 he entered the novitiate and professed his vows a year later as a brother in the Roman Catholic Church. Brothers devote themselves to teaching. His first assignment was in Africa at Nyahururu High School in Thompson's Falls in Kenya, where he taught religion and English and directed the school library.
        He returned to America in 1973 to teach at La Salle School in Albany for nine months before leaving to complete a master's degree in anthropology at New York University. He returned to Africa on leaves of absence from Manhattan College in 1979 and 1983, staying two years each time. During his last stay, he served as director for the Christian Brothers' research program, which spanned six countries in Africa.
        During his tenure at Manhattan College, Brother James was the author of more than 30 scholarly articles on sociological and anthropological topics.
        He is survived by his mother, Nora of Rockaway, N.J., and his sister, Noreen Madden of Warwick, N.Y.
