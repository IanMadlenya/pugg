        Walter D. Fackler, an economist known for the accuracy of his annual forecasts of national trends, died yesterday at a hospital in Chicago. He was 71 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Fackler was a professor and former associate dean and acting dean of the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. He had also served as director of its master's degree program for business executives.
        For 31 years he made annual forecasts of the nation's economy that were widely quoted and considered among the most reliable. His expertise included industry, public finance, monetary policy and the economic effects of government actions.
        He served as a senior economist for President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Cabinet Committee on Price Stability for Economic Growth in 1959-60. Before that, from 1956-59, he was the assistant director of economic research for the United States Chamber of Commerce.
        As an economist, he wrote many articles, gave speeches, testified before Congressional committees and was a consultant to business, government agencies and foundations.
        Mr. Fackler was born in Aitkin, Minn. A veteran of World War II, he served as a captain in the Army in Europe and won a Bronze Star.
        He graduated from George Washington University and studied for his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University, where he also taught briefly. He worked for six years at George Washington as a teacher, assistant to the Dean of Faculties and director of the Foreign Service Review Program.
        His survivors include his wife of 42 years, the former Hazel Shepardson; three sons, Paul, of Durham, N.C., and Mark and Neil, both of the Chicago area; a brother, James, of Minneapolis; three sisters, Charlotte Collins of King City, Ore., Joyce Pershall, of Olympia, Wash., and Rachel Rennick of British Columbia, Canada, and two granddaughters.
