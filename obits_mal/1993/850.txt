        Lester J. Grant, a Boston real estate developer and businessman, died Wednesday at his winter home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. A former resident of Weston, Mass., he was 67 and lived in Bedford, N.H.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover and Boston University after serving with the Navy in the Pacific in World War II. An enthusiastic explorer and hunter, he sought out remote places from Alaska to Zululand on rugged camping trips and safaris for more than 40 years.
        Mr. Grant was president of Pilgrim Management Corporation, real estate developers in Boston, and chairman of the Mayflower Group of Companies, a Boston-based enterprise dealing in venture capital and corporate financing.
        He was a past president of the Safari Club International and the New England Safari Club. He served as trustee of the Middlesex Community College and director of the Middlesex Community College Foundation.
        Mr. Grant is survived by his wife, the former Faith O'Neil; two sons, Geoffrey P., of Bedford, and Alexander T., of Fort Lauderdale, and a daughter, Leslie J. Grant, also of Bedford.
