        Howard R. Suslak, a Manhattan investment banker who was the president of MacDonald & Company, one of the country's oldest corporate merger specialists, died on Friday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. He was 73.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his wife, Lillian.
        Mr. Suslak purchased McDonald & Company in 1958 and continued to run it until recently.
        He was a graduate of the Juilliard School, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania. He was a director of the Opera Orchestra of New York.
        He is survived by his wife.
