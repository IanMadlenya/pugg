        Dr. Robert G. Hicks, a leader in the field of anesthesiology, died on Thursday at a hospital in Stamford, Conn. He was 70 and lived in Greenwich.
        The cause was pneumonia and complications of cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Hicks, who retired last year as the chairman of the anesthesiology department at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan, was a past president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
        As part of a team at St. Vincent's, he helped develop the Code 99 emergency response to cardiac and respiratory failures, which was eventually adopted worldwide. Its premise is that swift treatment can save lives.
        Dr. Hicks was active in city and state anesthesiology organizations and was the anesthesiology representative to the Interspecialty Council of the American Medical Association and to the Council of Medical Specialty Societies.
        He was a co-founder of the Medical Liability Mutual Insurance Company, the largest malpractice insurer in New York State and one of the nation's biggest physician-owned companies in the nation.
        He also served as the chairman of St. Vincent's Residency Training Program and taught as a clinical professor at New York Medical College.
        Dr. Hicks was born in Manhattan. After graduating from New York University, he earned his medical degree at Cornell University in 1946, then served in the United States Army medical corps.
        He became St. Vincent's first resident anesthesiologist in 1949 and served as the department chairman for 35 years.
        Dr. Hicks is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Mary Jane Rooney; a daughter, Mary Pat Kelleher of Brookfield, Conn.; four sons, Stephen, of New Fairfield, Conn., Thomas, of Sea Girt, N.J., Frank, of Glastonbury, Conn., and Laurence, of Danbury, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.
