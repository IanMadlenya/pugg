        Anthony F. DiMauro, a catamaran sailor who won the Little America's Cup four times and helped promote the design innovation that the San Diego Yacht Club used to retain the America's Cup in 1988, died on Tuesday at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. He was 75, and lived in Norwalk.
        His family said the cause of death was prostate cancer.
        A wealthy food distributor, Mr. DiMauro devoted much of his life to ocean racing, primarily in the Little America's Cup series for Class C catamarans, the two-man, 25-foot craft that have been a magnet for high-tech designers since the Sea Cliff Yacht Club on Long Island began the interational competition in 1961.
        Mr. DiMauro won the cup from Australia in 1977 and successfully defended it against Italy in 1978, 1980 and 1982 before losing it to Australia in 1985.
        He developed the unique rigid sail resembling an upright airplane wing that became the basis for the sail used by Stars & Stripes in its successful defense of the America's Cup in 1988.
        He is survived by two sons, Kevin and Dennis, and two grandchildren.
