        Otis Edward Fellows, a professor emeritus in the humanities at Columbia University and a scholar of 18th-century French literature, died on Saturday at his home at the Regency Park retirement community in Portland, Ore. He was 84.
        His daughter, Lisa Fellows Andrus, said the cause was congestive heart failure.
        Professor Fellows moved to Portland after living for many years in Morningside Heights in New York City. He began teaching at Columbia's department of French and Romance philology in 1939, becoming a full professor in 1958. He was chairman of the Italian department from 1963 to 1966 and was appointed Avalon Foundation Professor in 1970, a position he held until his retirement in 1977. A Focus on Diderot
        An authority on Denis Diderot, an encyclopedist of the Enlightenment, Professor Fellows founded Diderot Studies, a periodical published in Geneva, in 1949 and edited it for many years. He was a co-editor of "The Age of Enlightenment" (1942, revised 1971) with Norman Torrey, which has remained the leading anthology of 18th-century French literature.
        His best-known work is "Diderot" (1977), a biography and appreciation. His other books include "From Voltaire to 'La Nouvelle Critique': Problems and Personalities" (1970) and a 1953 collection of Georges Simenon's detective stories.
        Professor Fellows was born in Hanover, Conn. He was a graduate of American University and the University of Dijon and lectured in English at a teachers' training college in Brittany. He pursued graduate studies in Romance languages at Brown University, receiving a master's degree and in 1936 a Ph.D.
        During World War II he was an intelligence officer in the Office of War Information in northern France and lectured at the Sorbonne. In 1959, he was honored by the French Government for his academic and wartime achievements.
        In addition to his daughter, of Portland, he is survived by his wife, Frances Elaine.
