        Dr. Milton Jonathan Slocum, a general practitioner in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan during four decades and the author of a volume of memoirs, died on Friday at his house in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 87 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Susan Hinerfeld.
        Dr. Slocum practiced in Hell's Kitchen, now known as Clinton, from 1931 to 1968, with time out for World War II service, and then moved to Santa Monica, where he continued practicing for 14 years and retired.
        Reviewing Dr. Slocum's memoirs, "Manhattan Country Doctor" (Scribner's, 1986), in The New York Times Book Review, the author Irvin Faust wrote that in the Hell's Kitchen of the doctor's day: "The police looked out for the good people while madams, the mobsters, pimps and bootleggers did their nefarious things. But all of them wanted a medical man who was there when they needed him, which was practically always. They found one. Dr. Slocum and his small town were a marriage that would have enchanted Hippocrates."
        Dr. Slocum was born in Clifton Forge, Va., moved to Brooklyn as a teen-ager and graduated from Erasmus Hall High School before earning a bachelor's degree at New York University and his medical degree at New York Medical College.
        For 24 years he taught part time at New York Medical College-Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital.
        His wife of 52 years, the former Belle Gibralter, died in 1982.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two grandsons.
