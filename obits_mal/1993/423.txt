        Paul Back, an artist and designer who gave Newsday its present look, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 64 and lived in Northport, L.I.
        Complications from asthma and pneumonia caused his death, the paper reported.
        Mr. Back, who was born in Brooklyn, got his first job at Newsday on Long Island in 1948 as a part-time messenger, working his way through Pratt Institute. Newsday hired him full-time in 1952 to do art work for the advertising section. He established a separate editorial art department in 1961.
        As editorial art director, he revamped the paper's typeface, layout and format in 1968. His redesign of Newsday essentially remains today and is also reflected in New York Newsday, which is aimed at New York City readers.
        Mr. Back retired from the paper last year and turned to painting and photography.
        He is survived by his wife, Ursula, and two daughters, Stacy Lee of Centerport, L.I., and Alicia Ursula of Manhattan.
