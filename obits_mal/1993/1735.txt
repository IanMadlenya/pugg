        Harry T. Whitin, a textile maker and philatelist, died on Nov. 24 at the Evergreen Woods Health Center in North Branford, Conn. He was 76 and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Whitin maintained a tradition of manufacturing and marketing textiles that began in a family blacksmith shop in Northbridge, Mass., in 1809. He was president of the former Paul Whitin Manufacturing Company in Northbridge and Gilbertsville, Mass. Most recently he headed Harry T. Whitin Inc., which he operated with his son James in Norwalk, Conn.
        Mr. Whitin was born in New Bedford, Mass. He was a chemical-engineering graduate of Yale University, class of 1939, and worked for the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester before serving in the Army Air Corps in World War II. He joined the family business in 1946 and remained active in it until his death.
        Mr. Whitin was a connoisseur of rare stamps. He collected them, wrote extensively on the subject in stamp journals and advised major auction houses. His specialties included King George V keyplate issues of Bermuda and Malta, postage-due stamps of St. Lucia and small-format King George VII keyplates of the Leeward Islands.
        He was a founding member of the Bermuda Collectors Society and a member of the Royal Philatelic Society of London and the American Philatelic Society, among others.
        He was a direct descendant of Robert (King) Carter of Corotoman, one of the earliest and largest landowners in Virginia.
        Mr. Whitin is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Taylor Whitin; three sons, Harry T. of Westboro, Mass., James T. of Norwalk, and John C. of Santa Clara, Calif.; a daughter, Anne Whitin Gruss of Edina, Minn.; two sisters, Sophie Draper of Boston and Cora Truslow of Saco, Me.; a brother, Welby C. of Lakeland, Fla., and three grandchildren.
