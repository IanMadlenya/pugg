        Irving P. Kartell, who as a Justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn ruled in favor of women bus drivers in a 1981 discrimination case, died on Saturday at Mary Immaculate Nursing Home in Lawrence, Mass. He was 86 and moved to Lawrence from Brooklyn three years ago.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said Harvey Goldman of the Goldman Fisher Funeral Chapel in Malden, Mass.
        Justice Kartell, a Democrat, was elected to the Supreme Court in 1971 and retired in 1983. He sat on the Civil Court from 1967 to 1971 and the Municipal Court from 1957 to 1967.
        The judge's 1981 ruling came after Robert Abrams, the State Attorney General, brought a suit on behalf of the 30 women who drove buses for the Transit Authority at the time.
        The women drivers contended that the authority's promotion of 30 men from bus driver to dispatcher, on the basis of a seniority list, was unfair to the women, who were relatively new on the driver force.
        In 1981, there were about 9,000 bus drivers in the city. Most of the 30 women among them had been hired after a minimum height requirement of 5 feet 4 inches was dropped in 1976.
        The judge ruled that the authority must make promotions based on merit, not seniority. He ordered the authority to hold Civil Service tests for the dispatcher jobs.
        Irving Philip Kartell was born in Brooklyn and earned his law degree from St. John's University. He practiced law in Brooklyn and was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York from 1947 to 1953.
        His wife of 55 years, the former Leonore Sweedler, died in 1990.
        The judge is survived by a son, Dr. James P., of Andover, Mass.; a daughter, Karren Jacobson Cowl of Baltimore, and a grandchild.
