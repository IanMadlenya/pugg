        Robert Westall, the author of more than 30 books for children, died on Thursday in Warrington Hospital in Cheshire, England. He was 63 and lived in Lymm, Cheshire.
        The cause was respiratory failure brought on by pneumonia, said Wes Adams, his editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
        Mr. Westall published his first novel, "The Machine-Gunners," in 1975. The book, based on his childhood experiences, is the story of five British teen-agers who find and hide a machine gun during World War II. Although some critics attacked the book as unsuitable for children because of its harsh depiction of life during the blitz and its characters' penchant for swearing, it won the Carnegie Medal, Britain's most prestigious children's-book award.
        A string of books for young readers followed, marked by a realistic approach to violence, sexuality and family conflict. They included "The Wind Eye" (1976), "The Watch House" (1977), "The Devil on the Road" (1978) and "Fathom Five" (1979), a sequel to "The Machine-Gunners." "Scarecrows" (1980), about a young boy's turmoil over his mother's remarriage, also won the Carnegie Medal. Taught Art for 25 Years
        Mr. Westall was born in Tynemouth, Northumberland, and received a bachelor's degree in fine art from Durham University in 1953. From 1953 to 1955 he served in the Royal Signals, a branch of the British Army. After earning a doctorate in fine arts from the Slade School at the University of London in 1957, he spent the next 25 years as an art teacher, art-department head and careers counselor at Sir John Deane's College, a secondary school in Northwich. He also wrote for Cheshire Life and The Cheshire Chronicle, and in 1970 and 1980 he was an art critic for The Guardian.
        In 1985, Mr. Westall left teaching to become an antiques dealer, an occupation he gave up after a few years to write full time. Throughout his career, he returned often to his experiences in wartime Britain, most recently in "Blitzcat" (1989) and "The Kingdom by the Sea" (1990). But he also devoted many works to the supernatural, including the novels "Stormsearch" (1990) and "Yaxley's Cat" (1991). He wrote one book for adults, "Antique Dust" (1989), a collection of ghost stories, and edited a book of photographs, "Children of the Blitz: Memories of Wartime Childhood" (1985).  "Demons and Shadows," the first volume of a two-volume collection of the best of Mr. Westall's ghost stories, will be published in October by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
