        John P. Giuggio, former president of the company that owned The Boston Globe, died on Wednesday at his home in Cohasset, Mass. He was 63.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, said Helen W. Donovan, The Globe's executive editor.
        His newspaper career began when he was 4 years old and helped his father, also named John Giuggio, deliver papers from a horse-drawn cart in the West Roxbury section of Boston.
        When he was 15, Mr. Giuggio began work for The Globe as a messenger. He later took a full-time job in the classified advertising department while attending Boston College, from which he graduated in 1951.
        Mr. Giuggio's positions at The Globe included advertising salesman and business manager. He guided the newspaper through its first sale of stock in the 1970's.  President in 1982
        In 1982 he became president of The Globe Newspaper Company, which owned the paper, as well as Affiliated Publications Inc., which in turn owned that company. In 1992 he relinquished the positions of president of Affiliated and vice chairman of the Globe Newspaper Company.
        The final act of his career was his role in negotiating the sale of The Globe to The New York Times. The sale was concluded this year. He was named to the board of The New York Times Company last month following its acquisition of The Globe for $1.04 billion.
        Mr. Giuggio is survived by his wife, Barbara, whom he married 40 years ago when she was an ad taker at The Globe; two sons, John Jr. of Cambridge, Mass., and Stephen of Cohasset; two daughters, Barbara Mance of St. Clair, Mich., and Patricia Cappello of Norwell, Mass., and seven grandchildren.
