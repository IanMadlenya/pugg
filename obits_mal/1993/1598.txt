        Dr. Mark Straus, a medical consultant in the New York fur trade who had fought with the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War, died on Oct. 27 at his home in the Bronx. He was 84.
        The cause was advanced prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Straus graduated from the University of Alabama and received his medical degree from the University of Paris. He then served as a physician and front-line combatant in the Washington Battalion and the Lincoln Brigade in the civil war that ravaged Spain in the late 1930's. After the victory of Gen. Francisco Franco'sNationalist forces, Dr. Straus continued to support the Loyalist cause as chairman of a Committee to Aid Spanish Refugees.
        Dr. Straus was in private practice in Brooklyn as an internist for nearly 50 years. For more than three decades, until his recent retirement, he was medical consultant to the Fur Dressers and Dyers Joint Board, for which he researched the occupational hazards of dyes used by the industry.
        Dr. Straus is survived by his wife, Dorothy; his daughters, Alice Straus of Tiburon, Calif., and Elaine Ron of Washington, and two grandchildren.
