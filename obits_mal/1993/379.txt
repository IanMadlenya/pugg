        Gordon M. Metcalf, who was chairman and chief executive of Sears, Roebuck and Company from 1967 until his retirement in 1973, died yesterday at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 85 and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.
        A spokesman for Sears, Jerry Buldak, said the cause of death was not immediately clear.
        As chairman and chief executive, Mr. Metcalf oversaw a sweeping expansion of Sears stores. In late 1972, shortly before he retired, Sears was the country's largest retailer, employed 365,000 and had annual estimated sales of $11 billion.
        Mr. Buldak said Mr. Metcalf was also responsible for the construction of the Sears Tower, in Chicago, whose height of 1,454 feet makes it the world's tallest building. It was built from 1970 to 1974.
        Mr. Metcalf was born in Sioux City, Iowa, graduated from Morningside College there in 1929 and did graduate work at Northwestern University's School of Commerce.
        He joined Sears at its Bay City, Mich., store in 1933. From 1948 to 1957 he was the general manager of Sears retail stores in the Chicago area, and then was vice president of the Midwest region until he became chairman and chief executive.
        Over the years he was a director of Sears, Allstate Insurance Companies, First National Bank of Chicago and other concerns. He was chairman of the United States Industrial Payroll Savings Committee in 1970 and of the National Alliance of Businessmen in 1972.
        Mr. Metcalf was married in 1933 to Marrien Marguerite Sturdevant, who died in 1989.
        He is survived by three children, Judith Lynn Scott of Canton, Tex., Jill Dorothy McIntyre of Tyler, Tex., and Jack Donald Metcalf of Clearwater, Fla.; 11 grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
