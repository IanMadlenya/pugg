        Larry Berthelson, the creator of the Pickwick Puppet Theater and a former president of the Puppetry Guild of Greater New York, died at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif., on April 8. He was 60.
        Mr. Berthelson, who was born in New Haven, formed his puppet company when he was 21. He performed on television and in hundreds of schools around the country. In 1963, Mr. Berthelson and his puppets took part in a WCBS-TV adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's "Just So Stories."
        One of his goals was to use his puppets to help introduce young audiences to good music and he often staged performances in conjunction with concerts by symphony orchestras, including the Detroit Symphony and the Brooklyn Philharmonic.
        His puppets appeared regularly during the early years of the Ernie Kovacs show and made appearances on the Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen and Garry Moore television shows. His company also took part in a series on opera with Joan Sutherland filmed in London in 1971 and 1972 and broadcast in the United States on Public Television.
        A master puppeteer, he produced and directed all the performances and created all the puppets appearing in his productions. He was a founder in 1962 of the Puppetry Guild, which is the leading organization of puppeteers in New York.
        He is survived by two brothers, Charles and Richard, both of New Haven.
