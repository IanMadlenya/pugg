        Hans Jacobson, a Wall Street specialist who traded the bonds of bankrupt railroads, died on Thursday in Cambridge, England. He lived in Basking Ridge, N.J., and was 88.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, for which he was being treated at a Cambridge hospital, his family said.
        A native of Berlin, Mr. Jacobson immigrated to New York in 1929 and started working at an old-line investment firm, A. G. Becker. But soon after, he enrolled at the New York Institute of Finance in a course that was to shape his career.
        The subject was investing in debt-ridden railroads, at a time when most railroads were in liquidation and undergoing reorganization under the bankruptcy laws. Although in default, the carriers had vast real-estate holdings going back to generous land grants in the 1800's. Carriers Recovered
        In addition, World War II held out the prospect of a comeback for the industry, convincing Mr. Jacobson that he had found his niche on Wall Street. He was right: The carriers started turning a profit and, by developing their landed properties, were able to reorganize and pay off their defaulted bonds at hefty premiums.
        More recently, Mr. Jacobson became involved in the deals arising from the default of the Erie-Lackawanna and Penn Central railroads. But he also handled the bonds of corporations being reorganized in other industries. He retired two years ago from Herzog Heine Geduld, a leading firm in the over-the-counter market, but remained an active trader on Wall Street.
        In 1990, he established the Jacobson Foundation for Asian Studies at Georgetown University in Washington.
        Mr. Jacobson is survived by his wife, the former Maryanne Hicks Peters; two daughters, Lisa Jacobson Treacy and Patricia Overton; a stepdaughter, Patricia Peters Page, and five grandchildren.
