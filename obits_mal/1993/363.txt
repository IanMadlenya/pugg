        Dr. Bertram Selverstone, professor emeritus of neurosurgery at Brown University, died Saturday at his home in Boston. He was 76 and also had a home in Providence, R.I.
        Professor Selverstone was best known for his work with radiotherapy to localize brain tumors and surgery to control cerebral aneurysms, the bulging of the wall of a blood vessel often caused by hardening of the arteries or high blood pressure. He invented a device known as the Selverstone Carotid Clamp that is used to control the flow of blood through the carotid artery.
        A native of Augusta, Ga., he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Medical School. During World War II he served as a captain in the United States Army Medical Corps.
        He was on the faculty of Harvard Medical School before joining the staff at Tufts University in 1951. He served as a professor of neurosurgery there until 1971, concurrently working as neurosurgeon-in-chief at New England Medical Center Hospitals.
        Dr. Selverstone moved to Providence in 1970 to establish a private practice and was appointed clinical professor of neurosurgery at Brown the following year. He reached emeritus status in 1985.
        He was a past president of the New England Neurosurgical Society and of the Neurosurgical Society of America. In 1974, he received the Award of Honor of the Society of Nuclear Medicine for improving the use of radionuclides, or radioactive atoms, and contributions to nuclear medicine.
        Professor Selverstone is survived by three daughters, Dr. Joan Selverstone Clark of Encino, Calif., Judith Selverstone Shaw of Canton, Conn., and Laura Gordon of South Woodstock, Vt.; a son, Peter, of Arlington, Mass.; two brothers, Dr. Louis A., of Boston, and Dr. Norman J., of Cambridge, Mass., and five grandchildren.
