        Mr. Kloman was born in Haymarket, Va., and grew up in Portland, Me., and Fargo, S.D. He graduated from Washington College in Chestertown, Md., in 1928.
        In World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services, helping supervise the training of secret agents. He also served as an operative in London and Scandinavia.
        Mr. Kloman is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Muriel Winthrop; a sister, Anne Hunter Jenkins of Ashville N.C., and two stepchildren, Harold Sands of London and Emmy Heppenheimer of East Hampton, L.I.
