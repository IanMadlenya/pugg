        Rabbi Stanley Witty, an educator and religious leader who was a principal of Hebrew and public schools in the New York City region for more than 37 years, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 62 and lived in Kew Garden Hills, Queens.
        His family said the cause was cancer.

He had been the principal of four New York City public schools, including Intermediate School 70 on the West Side of Manhattan, and five Hebrew schools, including the Bergen County High School of Jewish Studies, Paramus, N.J.
        Rabbi Witty was executive director of the Ohr Torah Institute in Queens from 1987 to 1989 and an adjunct professor at the Long Island University Graduate School of Education.
        A graduate of Yeshiva University in 1952, Rabbi Witty received an M.A. in foreign-language education from Hunter College in 1960. He was ordained in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, Shifra; a son, Noach, of Lakewood, N.J.; three daughters, Hadassah Ganz of Scranton, Pa., Chani Metger of Brooklyn and Esther Zelmanowitz of Queens, and two brothers who are rabbis, Yitzhak, of Downsview, Ontario, and Abraham, of Fairlawn, N.J.
