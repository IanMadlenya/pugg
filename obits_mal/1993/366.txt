        Henry Clay Crofoot Jr., a Northern California lumberman and Nevada miner, died Tuesday in a local hospital. He was 75.
        He had had cancer for 10 years.
        Mr. Crofoot was born in Syracuse and grew up in the old timber town of Magalia in Butte County, Calif. He lived and worked in Mendocino County and northern Nevada for nearly 50 years.
        In the 1940's, Mr. Crofoot and his family came to the North Coast of California and set up sawmill operations in the Ukiah and Anderson valleys during the heyday of Mendocino County's timber industry. The Crofoot mills were among the most successful of the county's many sawmills.
        In the late 1960's the Crofoots reduced their timber operations and focused on what is now a big gold mining venture in Lovelock, Nev. The Crofoots maintained homes in Nevada and at their ranch near Hopland in Mendocino County, 13 miles south of Ukiah.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Jane; two sons: Dan Crofoot of Lovelock and Jim Crofoot of Reno; two sisters, Gladys McPhun of Ukiah and Beatrice Allinger of Brookings, Ore.; a brother, John Crofoot of Ukiah, and six grandchildren.
