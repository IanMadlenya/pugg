        Anton Crihan, a leader in the movement that reunited his native region of Bessarabia with Romania between the world wars, , died on Jan. 9 in a hospital in St. Louis, Mo. He was 99 and lived in St. Louis.
        He died of cancer, his family said. Further details on the cause of death were not available.
        His body will be flown to Romania and then on to Moldova, a former Soviet republic that encompasses most of Bessarabia, for Government memorial ceremonies and burial, said a spokesman for Moldova's delegate to the United Nations, Tudor Pantiru .
        Dr. Crihan was born in 1893 in a village in Bessarabia, a region in southeastern Europe that had changed hands repeatedly through the centuries and was occupied by Russia beginning in 1887.
        After World War I and the Communist revolution in Russia, Dr. Crihan, was among the handful of campaigners who succeeded in annexing most of Bessarabia to Romania. He became politically active in Romania, which was then governed by a constitutional monarchy. Trained as an economist, he served on the Central Committee of the National Peasant Party, , was elected to several terms in Parliament and was appointed Agriculture Minister.
        Bessarabia was recaptured by the Soviet Union in 1940 but was retaken by Romania a year later with the aid of Nazi Germany. It was ceded to the Soviet Union with the defeat of the Axis powers.
        After the Soviet takeover, Dr. Crihan went into hiding and then fled on foot. He made his way across Europe and finally arrived in the United States in 1949, where he delivered lectures and wrote articles and books championing the reunification of Moldavia and Romania. Moldavia, now known as Moldova, gained independence when the Soviet Union disintegrated in late 1991.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Clivia Lula.
