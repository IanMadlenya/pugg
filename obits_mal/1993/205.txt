        Samuel Zuckerberg, a manufacturer in Manhattan's garment district who led fund-raising campaigns for Jewish charities, died on Tuesday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park. He was 82.
        He had a heart attack at his home in Flushing, Queens, said his son, Harvey.
        Mr. Zuckerberg was born in the East Village and attended Stuyvesant High School. He founded two companies, the Federal Bias Corporation and the Hip Hugger Corporation, which made zippers, elastic waistbands and other accessories.

        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Gwen; a daughter, Ronnie Mass, of San Francisco, and three grandchildren.
