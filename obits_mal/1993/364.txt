        Edwin Jay Gould, a retired investor, wildlife conservationist and outdoorsman, died Wednesday at a hospice in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 61.
        Mr. Gould, who lived in Palm Beach, had been a private investment banker in New York City.
        For many years he was the majority owner and board chairman of Douglas Elliman & Company, one of New York's largest real estate management companies and the operator of numerous apartment buildings in Manhattan. He sold the company in 1989.
        An avid fisherman who took part in many tournaments, Mr. Gould advocated the practice of catch-and-release to preserve fish stocks. One fish he kept was a 549-pound Atlantic blue marlin, caught on 30-pound-test line in Chub Cay in the Bahamas in 1972. The fish broke the record of 480 pounds for that species in the 30-pound line category.
        He served as a deputy commissioner of the International Whaling Commission in the Nixon Administration and was a member of the New York Aquarium Committee.
        Mr. Gould, a native of New York City, was a great-grandson of Jay Gould, the 19th Century railroad baron and financier.
        After graduating from the Staunton Military Academy and the University of Virginia, he served five years as an enlisted soldier in the United States Army. He was stationed in Korea.
        He was previously married and divorced twice.
        His survivors include his wife, Rina; four sons, James T. of Hamilton, Bermuda, Alexander W. of Montchanin, Del., and Gordon R. and Howard B., both of Manhattan; two stepchildren, Katiana M. Chapman of Sarasota, Fla., and Aldine R. Chapman 3d of Palm Beach, and three grandchildren.
