        Alvin Schonfeld, a retired Wall Street executive, died yesterday at the Humana Hospital in Phoenix. He was 74 and lived in Phoenix.
        His son, Robert, said the cause was heart failure.
        Mr. Schonfeld became the managing partner of H. Hentz & Company, a diversified securities business in Manhattan, in 1963 and became its president and chief executive officer in the late 1960's.
        He went on to become a senior executive vice president of another Wall Street concern, Hayden Stone, for some years and was later active in investment banking in New York, serving as a consultant and adviser to various businesses and individuals.
        He was born in Manhattan, grew up in Manhattan and Queens, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in 1939 and attended Harvard Law School.
        In addition to his son, of Manhattan, Mr. Schonfeld is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Miriam Dickson; a daughter, Barbara Eisler of Monmouth County, N.J.; and a brother, Dr. Murray Schonfeld of Dallas.
