        Howard N. Math, a retired New York City manufacturer, died on Wednesday at Jupiter Hospital in Florida. He was 72 and was a resident of Jupiter and of Manhasset, L.I. .
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Math, who was born in the Bronx, went into business with his father and founded Tri-State Industries in the Bronx in the 1940's. It grew into a large supplier of furniture and other equipment to funeral directors. Mr. Math sold the business about four years ago and retired.
        He was a founder of Temple Judea of Manhasset and served as one of its first presidents. He also was a past president of the Manhasset Civic Association.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Claire Hyman; a son, Rabbi Dennis Math of Manhattan; a daughter, Joan Kaye of Avon, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Patti Hoffman of Jupiter, and five grandchildren.
