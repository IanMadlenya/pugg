        Victor Jacobs, a lawyer who represented several leading French chefs and restaurants in New York City, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, his doctor said.
        Mr. Jacobs practiced law in Manhattan for 60 years. Among his clients were Le Cirque and Lutece. When the restaurateur Henri Soule died in 1966, Mr. Jacobs, as the executor of the estate, ran Le Pavillon and La Cote Basque until they were sold.
        He also represented the Culinary Institute of America, the Christian Brothers Winery, several wine importers and distributors, many food writers, restaurant critics and some hotels.
        His specialization in what he called hospitality law evolved from his work as an immigration lawyer for chefs like Mr. Soule, performers and others.
        Mr. Jacobs was the lawyer for the conductor Bruno Walter. He became chairman of the Bruno Walter Foundation and a board member of the Franz W. Sichel Foundation, which was named for the wine industry executive.
        Mr. Jacobs also served on the boards of the American Council for Nationalities Service, the Mildred Englander Foundation and the Charles and Irene Jacobs Foundation, created by a manufacturer unrelated to the lawyer.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Jacobs graduated from Syracuse University in 1926 and earned his law degree at Harvard in 1933. In 1938, he formed a law partnership with Gabriel Galef in Manhattan and in 1989 their firm merged with another to form Wormser, Kiely, Galef & Jacobs.
        He was married and divorced.
        His survivors include his companion, Margaret Sichel, and a daughter, Silvia Jacobs of Yreka, Calif.
