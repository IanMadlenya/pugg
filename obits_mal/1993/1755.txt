        Robert A. Siegel, a Manhattan stamp dealer who auctioned off some of the world's rarest and costliest stamps, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 80 and had homes in Manhattan and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        He had a stroke while walking to his Park Avenue business the previous Tuesday, the Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries said.
        Mr. Siegel started collecting stamps as a hobby at age 7 and went into business for himself when he was 16. In 1934 he opened a dealership and auction house in New York.
        By his own estimate, the company bearing Mr. Siegel's name sold more than $200 million worth of stamps during his 63 years in the business. One, the unique British Guiana "One-Cent Magenta," was auctioned by him twice. The second time around, in 1981, it fetched $935,000, which set a record at the time.
        He was a past president of the American Stamp Dealers Association.
        He is survived by a daughter, Roberta Edelstein of La Jolla, Calif.; a sister, Betty Portwood of Albuquerque, N.M., and two grandsons.
