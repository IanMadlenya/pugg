        He died of AIDS, said his brother, Michael, of Blacksburg, Va.

He lived in San Francisco until 1980, when he moved to New York City. His first solo show was at Artists Space in TriBeCa in 1980. In 1981, he had the first of four solo shows at the Fun Gallery on East 10th Street, one of the best-known showplaces of the East Village art scene.
        In addition to his brother Michael, Mr. Connelly is survived by his parents, Arch and Roslyn, of Zion, Ill.; two sisters, Kimberly Gabbert of Crystal Lake, Ill., and Lisa Strong of Bloomington, Ill.; and five other brothers, Daniel, of Amboy, Ill.; Steve, of Katlin, Ill.; Kevin, of Indianapolis, and Philip and John, of Waukegan, Ill.
