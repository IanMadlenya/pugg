        Robert E. O'Bradovich, a makeup artist and actor, who won the first Emmy Award in makeup for his work in the 1961 television play "Victoria Regina," died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
        The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said his daughter, Tamara.
        Mr. O'Bradovich won the special citation and critical acclaim for his artistry in transforming Julie Harris from a slender young princess to the corpulent, aged Queen Victoria in the NBC "Hallmark Hall of Fame" production.
        He won two other Emmy Awards for makeup: in 1965, for "The Magnificent Yankee," and in in 1979, for "The Halloween That Almost Wasn't." He also did makeup for movies, including "The Boys in the Band," and Broadway shows, among them "Dracula."
        In his career as a makeup artist from 1950 until his retirement in 1983, he turned actors into Dr. Samuel Johnson, Thomas Jefferson, Genghis Khan and Ulysses S. Grant. He did dozens of Abraham Lincolns. A major success was the conversion of Richard Burton into the monster Caliban in "The Tempest."
        He was born in Crosby, Minn., and studied drama in New York City. He acted in a score of television shows and supplemented his income by playing the trumpet.
        Explaining his surname in a 1965 interview, Mr. O'Bradovich said his ancestors were O'Bradys from Ireland, but they emmigrated to the Balkans during the famine in the early 19th century and picked up the Slavic suffix, which stuck.
        His first marriage, to Bridget Gilmartin, ended in divorce in 1958.
        In addition to his daughter, Tamara, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., and a son, Robert, of Portland, Me., both from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Marilyn, another daughter, Donica, of Manhattan, and another son, Gregory, of Austin, Tex.
