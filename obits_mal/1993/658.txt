        Roger Warren Jones, a Deputy Secretary of State in the Kennedy Administration and a chairman of the Civil Service Commission in the Eisenhower Administration, died Friday at the Valerie Manor Nursing Center in Torrington, Conn. He was 85 and had lived in New Hartford, Conn., since 1975.
        He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, said his daughter, Cynthia Hodges, of Wilmington, Del.
        After becoming a career Federal employee in 1933, with time out for Army service in World War II, Mr. Jones, a Republican, rose to be Deputy Director of the Budget Bureau in 1958, under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1959 Eisenhower named him to head the Civil Service Commission, the predecessor of the Office of Personnel Management.
        In January 1961, President-elect John F. Kennedy chose him to be the State Department's Deputy Secretary for Administration.
        Mr. Jones left the State Department in 1962 and moved back to the Budget Bureau. He retired in 1968, but was called back to duty at the bureau in 1969 under President Richard M. Nixon, and was put in charge of developing personnel policies. He retired again in 1975 and moved back to New Hartford, where he had been born.
        He earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1928 and a master's degree from Columbia University and went on to win various high awards for Federal service.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Dorothy Heyl; two sons, Roger H. Jones of Marina del Rey, Calif., and Edward C. Jones of Williamstown, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
