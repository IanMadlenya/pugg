        Gregory L. Broyles, a leader in the fight against AIDS among black, Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 43 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Michael Tate, a friend.
        Mr. Broyles was the director of the Men of Color AIDS Prevention Project in the Office of Gay and Lesbian Health Concerns, which is part of the New York City Health Department.
        He joined the health agency last year, after serving two years as the project director of special programs at the Black Leadership Commission on AIDS, a nonprofit organization.
        Before that, he was the public policy associate at the Gay Men's Health Crisis and the assistant director of the Minority Task Force on AIDS. He was also on the board of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center.
        Mr. Broyles graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit in 1971.
        He is survived by his mother, Mildred Demings; his father, Ernest P. Broyles, and a sister, Rosalyn Demings, all of Detroit.
