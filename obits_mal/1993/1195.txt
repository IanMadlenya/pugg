        Dr. Leon Resnekov, a cardiologist and Frederick H. Rawson Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago, died on Tuesday at the university-run Bernard Mitchell Hospital. He was 65 and lived in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago.
        He had long been ill but had kept teaching and seeing patients until a few weeks ago, the university said.
        Dr. Resnekov was known for his part in early studies of electrical shock as a means to restore normal heart beat after rhythm disturbances. He also helped develop the use of nuclear medicine in imaging the heart. In a 1978 paper he catalogued all prosthetic heart valves by their radiological contours and by the sounds they produce.  His research was condensed in more then 300 articles published in medical journals.
        Colleagues and students described Dr. Resnekov as a memorable teacher and thoughtful physician.
        One colleague, Dr. Rory Childers, a professor of medicine, said: "He was trained in the British tradition of clinical cardiology, making the maximum use of noninvasive tests and stressing the importance of taking a careful medical history, and listening to the patient's heart rather than turning too soon to a battery of technological interventions."
        Born in Cape Town, South Africa, Dr. Resnekov earned his medical degree at the university there before receiving further training in England. In 1967, the University of Chicago recruited him as a tenured associate professor of medicine.
        He became a full professor in 1971 and for 10 years was co-director of the medical school's cardiology section.
        As one of his many honors, University of Chicago Hospitals created a Leon Resnekov Fellowship in Clinical Cardiology to support young doctors preparing for careers in that field.
        Dr. Resnekov is survived by his wife of 38 years, Carmella Ocheroff Resnekov; a daughter, Orna Resnekov of Cambridge, Mass.,and a son, Dean, of Chicago.
