        Dick Metz, a peripatetic cattle rancher who was a leading touring golf pro in the 1930's and 40's, died Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in Arkansas City, Kan., according to his wife, Jean.
        The police in Arkansas City said yesterday that Mr. Metz, who was 84 and in ill health, drove his pickup truck to the parking lot of a local funeral home, parked it and climbed into the rear before shooting himself in the head. Mrs. Metz said her husband had been despondent after declining health forced him to abandon active ranching and lease out the ranch he had operated near Arkansas City, his boyhood home.
        Until then, he had operated ranches in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia, Alabama and Kansas, even while pursuing his career in golf.
        In 1930, he joined the Professional Golfers' Association tour, placing second in his first tournament, the Los Angeles Open. Over the next two decades he won 14 tournaments. At the 1947 United States Open at the St. Louis Country Club, he was a co-leader after two rounds with a score of 139, which tied the 36-hole record for Open play. He finished 13th.
        Although he devoted himself increasingly to ranching in the 1950's, he won the United States senior title in January 1960. That July he won the senior world championship.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Craig and James; a daughter, Joan Stork, and one grandchild.
