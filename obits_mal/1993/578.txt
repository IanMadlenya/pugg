        Prof. Fritz Steinhardt, who taught mathematics at City College for 39 years, died on Wednesday at his home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. He was 71.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Professor Steinhardt joined the college's mathematics department in 1954, advanced to full professor in 1969, and served as department chairman in the early 1970's. In 1988, he received the City College Distinguished Teacher Award.
        A native of Vienna, he fled Austria for Switzerland to escape Nazi rule, studied in Zurich at the Federal Institute of Technology, and received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1951. He served in the United States Navy doing mathematical calculations for flight simulators.
        He played the violin and published music study scores titled Lea Pocket Scores.
        Professor Steinhardt is survived by his wife, Prof. Vicki Chuckrow of City College; two daughters, Laura and Anna, and a sister, Claire Cunningham of Lincoln, Mass.
