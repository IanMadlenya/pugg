        Raiford Graham Trask Sr., a real estate developer who was a benefactor of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, died on Sunday night at his home in Wilmington. He was 77.
        He had had cancer for two years, his family said.
        Mr. Trask built his career by turning his family's farm land into subdivisions. He also helped develop resorts and shopping centers in Wilmington.
        The Trask name is on several landmarks, including the Raiford G. Trask Sr. Coliseum at the university. The campus is built on Trask land, some of which Mr. Trask sold at bargain prices and some of which he donated.
        Besides his contributions to the university, Mr. Trask gave land to schools in New Hanover County and to the county parks department.
        He is survived by his wife, Mabel; a daughter, Ethel Coupland of Wilmington; two sons, Raiford G. Jr. and D. Webster, both also of Wilmington; two brothers, Neil W., of Anderson, S.C., and Allen N., of Wilmington; two sisters, Madeline Trask and Emma T. Miars, both of Wilmington; eight grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
