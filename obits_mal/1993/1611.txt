        Charles Coe Townsend, a New York financial consultant, died yesterday at Kershaw County Hospital in Camden, S.C. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan and Germantown, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said. He was on vacation at the time, they said.
        He was treasurer of the IBM World Trade Corporation, the computer maker's international affiliate, from 1958 to 1974. He held executive positions in a number of other companies before and after his years with International Business Machines.
        Mr. Townsend, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Harvard University and held a master's degree in economics from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, Bonnie von Wiesenthal Townsend; three sons, Charles C. 3d, of Barrington, R.I; Frederic, of Lake Bluff, Ill., and James, of Oyster Bay, L.I.; a daughter, Claire Bacher of Berkeley Heights, N.J.; two brothers, Rodman, of Knoxville, Tenn., and Hewitt, of Wilmington, Del.; a sister, Elizabeth Townsend of Knoxville, and nine grandchildren.
