        Yevgeny I. Gabrilovich, a renowned scenarist of Soviet cinema, died in a Moscow hospital on Monday. He was 94.
        Mr. Gabrilovich was best known in Russia for his scripts for "The Last Night" (1937), "Mashenka" (1942), "The Dream" (1943), co-written with Mikhail Romm and especially "Communist" (1958).
        Mr. Gabrilovich was born in the southern Russian town of Voronezh in 1899. He began writing short stories in 1921, shortly after a year at the law school of Moscow University.
        He made his dramatic debut in Moscow in the 1920's, playing piano in Vsevolod Meyerhold's theater for four years. He also worked briefly as a clerk and then as a journalist.
        As a war correspondent for Izvestia and other Soviet newspapers, he witnessed the discovery of Hitler's corpse in Berlin and the surrender of the Japanese at the end of World War II. Many of his short stories and scripts dealt with broad historical themes, especially war and the Bolshevik Revolution.
        His other films included: "Two Fighters" (1943), "The Gadfly" (1955) and "Resurrection" (1962).
        The fourth volume of Mr. Gabrilovich's film scripts, short stories and essays was published in Russia in 1987.
