        Aaron Wildavsky, a political scientist who was an expert on the analysis of public policy and government budgeting, died Saturday at his home in Oakland, Calif. He was 63.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his son Adam.
        Dr. Wildavsky (pronounced will-DOV-skee), a former president of the American Political Science Association, taught at the University of California at Berkeley from 1963 until his death. He was a former chairman of the university's department of political science and had been the first dean of its Graduate School of Public Policy.
        In May he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University.
        In his 1990 book, "The Deficit and the Public Interest" (University of California Press), which he wrote with Joseph White, he said that the nation's "deficit is high because reducing it will have serious adverse consequences for virtually everybody, and therefore for the country as whole." They added, "Until this fact is faced; until politicians, the media, and the public admit that the difficulty is not a lack of courage or insidious 'special' interests dominating the 'public' interest, debate will remain distorted and unproductive."
        Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Norman J. Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute praised "the careful, honest, straightforward marshaling of argument and data and the power of the thesis."
        Aaron Bernard Wildavsky was born in Brooklyn and reared in its Brownsville section. He graduated from Brooklyn College and earned his doctorate from Yale in 1959.
        His 1956 marriage to Carol Shirk ended in divorce in 1970.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Mary Cadman; three sons, Adam of Queens, Ben of San Francisco and Dan of Oakland; a daughter, Sara Wild of Manhattan, and one grandchild.
