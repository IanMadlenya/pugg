        Imam Yusuf Shah, a Black Muslim who helped to lead the Nation of Islam's Harlem mosque for 23 years and directed its Fruit of Islam security force in 20 Eastern states, died in his sleep on Wednesday at his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 65.
        He had heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. Shah was a top aide with Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan until they left the organization.
        Originally named Joseph Gravitt, Mr. Shah was born in Detroit. His father, also named Yusuf, was active in the Islamic movement of the Moorish Science Temple of Noble Drew Ali, and Mr. Shah joined the Nation of Islam in Detroit.
        In 1952 the organization's leader, Elijah Muhammad, sent him and Malcolm X to New York to organize a fledgling mosque, the Malcolm Shabazz Masjid. Mr. Shah was designated a captain and was widely known as Captain Joseph.
        He remained a leader of the mosque during the crises of Malcolm X's dissent and assassination in 1965, a police shootout at the mosque in 1972 and Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975.
        Muhammad's son, Warith Deen Muhammad, named Mr. Shah an imam in 1975 and relied on him as a senior adviser. Later he became minister of the Southwest region for the American Muslim Mission. Among his survivors are his wife of 38 years, the former Sylvia Johnson; three daughters, Maryum Shah of Manhattan, Marlene Shah of Atlanta and Ruqaiyah Shah Garland of the Bronx; three sons, Yusuf Ibn of New Haven, and Ameer and Jamil, both of Mount Vernon.
