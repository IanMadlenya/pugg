        Arthur J. Klein, a New York lawyer for 35 years who often represented actors and other people in entertainment, died on Tuesday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 61.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Martin Garbus, a law partner.
        Mr. Klein was a founder of the New York law firm of Frankfurt, Garbus, Klein & Selz, which has represented actors, directors, authors, book publishers and art galleries. He also was a frequent lecturer on such legal issues in the entertainment industry as intellectual property and contracts.
        He was born in Danville, Va., graduated from Duke University and received his law degree from the University of Virginia.
        He is survived by his wife, Elinor Klein, and a son, Willy, both of New York.
