        George B. Troussoff, a Bell Laboratories engineer who became a museum president in retirement, died Tuesday. He was 73 and lived in Bernardsville, N.J.
        He died suddenly while on personal business in Gladstone-Peapack, N.J., said Richard C. Simon, a fellow trustee at the Macculloch Hall Historical Museum in Morristown. The exact cause remained undetermined.
        Mr. Troussoff was born in New York City after his Russian parents were stranded in the United States while on an arms-buying mission for the czar during the Russian Revolution.
        He graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in 1941 and went to work for Bell Laboratories at Whippany, N.J.
        During World War II, Mr. Troussoff was involved in radar design. He also took part in developing large military fire-control systems, including the Nike missile project. He was a consultant for the Apollo moon program and NATO weapons designs. He retired in 1979 after 38 years with Bell and became active in volunteer organizations.
        He joined Macculloch Hall, an affiliate of the W. Parsons Todd Foundation, as a trustee in 1982 and assumed the board presidency two years ago. The museum was an 1810 gentleman's country estate and offers furnishings and decorative art of the period, as well as a collection of political cartoons by Thomas Nast, who lived across the street.
        Mr. Troussoff's first wife, Ruth Van Winkle, died in 1980. In 1986 he married Marian Jones Kingsford, who survives, as does his daughter, Gail Troussoff Marks of Kensington, Md.; a sister, Natalie Trousof of Woods Hole, Mass., and two stepdaughters, Cynthia Kingsford Gilmore of Sudbury, Mass., and Alessandra Kingsford of Wayland, Mass.
