        William J. Block, a retired Manhattan lawyer who specialized in product liability, died on Nov. 17 at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. He was 89.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his son, Noah Block of Manhattan.
        In his youth Mr. Block was a competitive fencer. In 1924 he was gravely wounded when, as a member of the Columbia College fencing team, he was accidentally stabbed in the chest by an opponent's blade. He was a graduate of both the college and Columbia Law School.
        He retired to West Tisbury, Mass., in 1974.
        Mr. Block is survived by his wife of 59 years, Sophia Block; his brother, Harris of Manhattan; two sons, Adam of Bronxville and Noah, and two grandchildren.
