        Jonathan Eddy, a former New York newspaperman who helped to found the American Newspaper Guild in 1933, died on Wednesday in Houston, where he was visiting family. He was 91 and had homes in Barcelona, Spain, and Dickinson Center, N.Y.
        He had been in failing health for two years, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Eddy graduated from Cornell University in 1924 and joined the reporting staff of The New York Times. His assignments took him from the New York City area to as far as Central America.
        The guild grew out of informal meetings in New York. Mr. Eddy, elected secretary, brought together newsroom staff members in other states to form a national union.
        In 1937, after leaving The Times, he was elected executive vice president.  Factional discord drove him away the following year.
        In 1941, Mr. Eddy took over the Standard News Association, a local news service his father owned. It closed in the early 1950's.
        Mr. Eddy later settled in Spain, where he met his third wife, Maria del Rosario Ruiz de Rivas, who survives. His other survivors are: their daughter, Susana, of Washington, and son, Julian, of Houston; a son from his second marriage, John P., of San Francisco, and a daughter, Dr. Lefa Bordas of Barcelona; two sons from his first marriage, Nicholas, of New Hartford, Conn., and Stephen, of Barkhamsted, Conn., and a sister, Polly Kline of Woodstock, N.Y.
