        MacDonald Harris, a novelist and a teacher of comparative literature, died on Saturday at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son Paul Heiney.
        In his 16 novels, Mr. Harris brought to such popular forms as the adventure novel, the crime novel and the war novel a fascination with the fine line between illusion and reality, and a scholarly thoroughness in developing the historical backgrounds for his stories.
        Mr. Harris, whose real name was Donald W. Heiney, was born in South Pasadena, Calif. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands in 1948 and a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Southern California in 1952.
        He divided his time among university teaching, scholarship and fiction writing. He published the first of his 50 short stories in Esquire in 1947, using the pseudonym MacDonald Harris. After receiving his doctorate, he taught comparative literature at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City from 1953 to 1965. In this period he published two general studies, "Contemporary Literature" (1954) and "Recent American Literature" (1958).
        In 1965, he accepted a professorship at the University of California at Irvine. There he directed the comparative literature program until 1970 and co-directed the university's fiction-writing program from 1973 until he retired in 1991. Late-Blooming Novelist
        In 1961, Mr. Harris published his first novel, "Private Demon," the strange tale of a pleasure cruise aboard a yacht once owned by the Emperor Franz Josef of Austria-Hungary. His best-known works came fairly late in his career. They include "The Balloonist" (1976), "Pandora's Galley" (1979), "Herma" (1981) and "Hemingway's Suitcase" (1991). His most recent novel, "A Portrait of My Desire," was published this year by Simon & Schuster.
        His Harris's scholarly works include "America in Modern Italian Literature" (1964) and "Three Italian Novelists" (1968), a critical study of Alberto Moravia, Cesare Pavese, and Elio Vittorini. He also translated works by Rilke and Italo Calvino into English. He frequently wrote on travel for The New York Times.
        His novel "The Balloonist " was nominated for a National Book Award in fiction in 1976. In 1982 the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Sciences gave him its award in literature, and in 1985 he received a special achievement award from PEN for his novel "Tenth."
        In addition to his son Paul, of Philadelphia, he is survived by his wife, Ann; another son, Conrad, of Los Angeles, and one grandson.
