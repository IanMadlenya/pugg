        State Supreme Court Justice James H. Boomer drowned on Sunday while vacationing in the Arkansas wilderness. He was 71.
        According to The Associated Press, authorities in Arkansas said he was backpacking on the Ozark Highlands Trail when he tried to find a way across a rain-swollen creek. They said he fell in and was pulled under by the current.
        Justice Boomer was known for his speedy handling of cases.
        He was named in 1982 to the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court. The court, which sits in Rochester, reviews cases from 22 counties in central and western New York.
