        Arthur Roe, a chemist, educator and former official with the National Science Foundation, died on Tuesday at his home in Tucson, Ariz. He was 80.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        He was the first director of the foundation's international program, from 1961 to 1972, and worked on joint projects with Japan, Brazil, the Soviet Union, India and other countries.
        Earlier he was at the University of North Carolina for 20 years as a teacher, director of the university's radioisotope laboratory and chairman of the natural sciences division and the chemistry department. He helped plan the Research Triangle Park, which has attracted many high-tech businesses to North Carolina.
        Dr. Roe promoted high school science in North Carolina. After the Soviet Union launched its first spacecraft, the Sputnik satellite, setting off a wave of national anxiety about science education in American schools, he went to the national foundation in 1959 to help revitalize the nation's textbooks.
        Dr. Roe was also a part-time researcher and consultant for the Atomic Energy Commission and the Navy.
        He headed North Carolina's chapter of the American Chemical Society and was on its national council. He was also a past president of the Micromineralogists of the National Capital Area.
        In retirement he was a volunteer worker at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum and the University of Arizona's Mineral Museum. He added thousands of micromineral specimens, which require magnification for study.
        Dr. Roe was born in Victor, Colo. A graduate of Oberlin College, he earned a master's in chemistry at Colorado College and a doctorate at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Barbara Garfitt; three sons, Bill, of Tucson, Nick, of Houston and Neill, of Washington, and three grandchildren.
