        Richard N. Lander, the retired Commissioner of Jurors for Westchester County and also a local historian and church official, died on Friday at his home in Armonk, N.Y. He was 64.
        He had a long illness, his family said.
        As commissioner he broadened the pool of jurors, previously limited to property owners, to a representative cross section from voter rolls, motor vehicle records and the telephone directory. In 1980 he said, "We want participation by everybody."
        Mr. Lander was a past president of the State Association of Commissioners of Jurors. He served as Westchester's Commissioner from 1967-86 and was the deputy for four years. Earlier he was deputy county clerk and worked in the county land records office and for Home Title Guaranty Company. Accompanied His Father
        Mr. Lander served 12 years as a Republican town councilman of North Castle. He was a descendant of Timothy Carpenter, the first child born to settlers in North Castle.
        Since the age of 18 he also served as the town's first historian, building on tales he heard while accompanying his father, Ernest, on his rounds as a physician.
        He was a co-founder of the North Castle Historical Society. Under his presidency, the society acquired Smith's Tavern, the town's original gathering place, which began a complex of historical buildings. He was a past vice president of the Westchester County Historical Society and served on the county's Committee on Historic Preservation.
        Mr. Lander was a longtime board president of Armonk United Methodist Church and a trustee of Middle Patent United Methodist Church and Bethel Methodist Home and served as a regional, state and national Methodist officer.
        His survivors include his wife of 36 years, the former Jean E. Holmes, and two sons, Jonathan H. of Clinton, N.J., and David R. of Armonk.
