        David L. Domijan, executive vice president and chief financial officer of the New York Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 38 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, the exchange reported yesterday.
        Mr. Domijan, a graduate of Amherst College, worked as a staff accountant for Price Waterhouse & Company before joining the New York exchange in 1979. He rose to vice president of strategic planning in 1984 and was named to his present position -- chief financial officer and executive vice president for finance, new listings and corporate liaison -- three years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy; their 9-year-old son, David Jr.; a daughter Tara, 6; his parents, Leo and Helen Domijan of Tampa, Fla., and two sisters, Dorothea Tribuiani of Avon, Conn., and Barbara Lemanski, also of Tampa.
