        Dr. Kendall Emerson Jr., clinical professor of medicine emeritus at Harvard University, died on Tuesday at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 86.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Worcester, Mass., Professor Emerson graduated from Yale University in 1929 and received his M.D. from Harvard in 1933. As a young doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Medical School, he conducted research on sulfonamide drugs under Prof. E. K. Marshall and on Addison's disease and adrenal-gland therapy under Dr. George Thorn.
        Before World War II, he became associated with the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then, commissioned into the Naval Reserve, spent the war years with the Rockefeller unit in the Pacific. In 1946, he joined the Harvard faculty and the medical department of Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.
        In the ensuing years, his research focused on the pituitary and adrenal glands and the lactogenic hormone. He reached emeritus status at Harvard in 1973. Until his retirement from the medical school and Brigham Hospital, he also served as consultant in endocrinology, visiting physician and, finally, chief-of-medicine at the Boston Lying-in Hospital.
        Professor Emerson is survived by his wife, Betty; two sons, Jonathan D., of Portland, Ore, and Benjamin, of Jamaica Plain, Mass.; three daughters, Jean Davison of San Rafael, Calif., Bonnie D. Gerrard of Gloucester, Mass., and Anne Emerson of Jamaica Plain; 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
