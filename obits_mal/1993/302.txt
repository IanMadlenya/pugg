        Lane W. Adams, the former executive vice president of the American Cancer Society, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 77 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage that he suffered earlier this month at the hospital, said Michael F. Heron, the society's senior vice president for communications.
        As executive vice president, Mr. Adams was the chief member of the society's staff and its chief executive officer from 1959 until his retirement in 1985. During that time, the society's annual income from contributions and bequests grew to $300 million from $45 million.
        Mr. Heron said Mr. Adams "encouraged the society to pursue research concerning the connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer." The findings from that research helped convince the Surgeon General of the United States, Luther L. Terry, to issue a landmark 1964 report that led to subsequent cigarette warning labels, Mr Heron said.
        Mr. Adams was born in Logan, Utah, and studied banking at Rutgers University. He worked as a banker in Utah and was a member of the society's board of directors before becoming its executive vice president at its headquarters, which were then in Manhattan.
        Mr. Adams is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Evans, whom he married in 1937; a daughter, Victoria Quan of Manhattan, and a son, Anthony L. of Greenwich, Conn., and two grandchildren.
