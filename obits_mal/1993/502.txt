        Lawrence Calcagno, an artist who came to prominence during the heyday of Abstract Expressionism in the 1950's for his series "The Black Paintings," died on Thursday in State College, Pa., while visiting relatives. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan and Taos, N.M.
        The cause was brain cancer, said Reine Hauser, associate director of the Anderson Gallery in Buffalo, which had often displayed his work.
        Mr. Calcagno was born in San Francisco, and grew up on a ranch near Big Sur, Calif. He worked as a merchant seaman in Asia, and after serving in World War II, he studied art in San Francisco, Paris and Florence.
        After the 1950's, Mr. Calcagno continued his abstract explorations of landscape themes. He exhibited in many museums and galleries in the United States, and was the recipient of a Ford Foundation grant and fellowships to Yaddo and to the MacDowell Colony.
        He is survived by two sisters, Virginia Gibson, of San Carlos, Calif., and Lillian Still, of Harrison, Ark.
