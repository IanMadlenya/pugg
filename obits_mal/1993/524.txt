        Herbert Fisher, the founder and chairman of Jamesway Corporation, which operates 108 discount department stores, mainly in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, died on Saturday at his home in Oradell, N.J. He was 71.
        His daughter Meredith Fisher said the cause was cancer of the colon.
        Mr. Fisher, who was also a philanthropist, was the company's longtime president as well as chairman, but stepped down as president in 1977. He retained the title of chairman until his death and continued to oversee the company's operations until about six months ago.
        In 1960, he opened the first of the Jamesway stores, in Jamestown, N.Y. The chain, which has about 5,000 employees, has its headquarters in Secaucus, N.J.
        Mr. Fisher grew up in Borough Park, Brooklyn, graduated from Townsend Harris High School and attended City College for two years before serving in the Army in World War II.
        He began in business as a merchandise packer, and went on to be elected to the Discounting Hall of Fame.
        At his death he was on the board of governors of the Hackensack, N.J., Hospital and a national vice president of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
        In addition to his daughter Meredith, he is survived by his wife, the former Florence Temkin; two other daughters, Judith Furer of Tenafly, N.J., who is a buyer of handbags and costume jewelry for the company, and Lesley Greenblatt of Fort Lee, N.J.; a brother, Bernard, and a sister, Eleanor Lappitt, both of Tucson, Ariz., and four grandsons.
