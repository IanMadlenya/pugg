        David Pingree Wheatland, founder and former curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments at Harvard University, died Tuesday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. He was 94 and lived in Bedford, Mass.
        A native of Salem, Mass., Mr. Wheatland graduated from Harvard in 1922 and returned to the college as a researcher at the Cruft Library in 1928. A visit to England in 1937 honed his interest in collecting early scientific books, especially those relating to electricity and magnetism.
        The collection, which he started privately in the 1930's, includes thousands of pieces, including dozens of ivory diptych sundials, prisms and lenses, measuring devices, organ pipes used for acoustical research, commercial glass and 250 microscopes. He became honorary curator in 1964 and remained active with the collection until his death.
        He was also the author of "Principal Works, The Apparatus of Science at Harvard 1765-1800" (Harvard University Press, 1968.)
        Mr. Wheatland's wife of nearly 60 years, the former Elizabeth Hinckley, died in 1985. He is survived by four daughters, Nancy W. Biglow of Bellevue, Wash., Barbara Wheatland of Topsfield, Mass., Susan W. Stauffer of Lafayette, Calif., and Martha W. Lunt of Mount Desert, Me.; a son, David A. of Cumberland Foreside, Me.; two sisters, Anna W. Ordway of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and Martha W. Ingraham of Manchester, Mass.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
