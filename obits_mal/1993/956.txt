        Richard M. FitzSimmons, a former general counsel and senior vice president of the Allis-Chalmers Corporation, died Friday. He was 69 and had homes in Milwaukee and in Hobe Sound, Fla.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his daughter Jamie Thorson of Mequon, Wis.
        Mr. FitzSimmons, a former trustee of Hamilton College, was with Allis-Chalmers, the manufacturing and machinery company, where he served also as secretary, from 1970 until 1986, when he joined the Milwaukee law firm Cook & Franke.
        He was also on the American Bar Association's committee on corporate law departments.
        He was born in New Haven and graduated from Hamilton College and Yale Law School. He practiced law in Manhattan and had legal posts with the General Electric Company in Kentucky and Connecticut before joining Allis-Chalmers.
        In addition to Mrs. Thorson, he is survived by his wife, Estelle; another daughter, Anne FitzSimmons of Milwaukee, and three grandchildren.
