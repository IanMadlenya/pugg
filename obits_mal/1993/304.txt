        Lester Wilson, a choreographer, director and dancer, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 51.
        His family said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Wilson is best known for his choreography for "Saturday Night Fever," the 1977 film starring John Travolta. He also won praise for his arrangement of the special dance sequences in "Me and Bessie," the 1975 Broadway musical with Linda Hopkins.
        Most recently, he did choreography for the films "Sister Act," starring Whoopi Goldberg, and "Mr. Saturday Night," starring Billy Crystal.
        In the 1980's, he put together the elaborate dance numbers that became the trademark of Ann-Margret's lavish Las Vegas shows. He also did the choreography for a number of Broadway musicals, including Harold Prince's "Grind" and Mark Bramble's version of "The Three Musketeers." Discovered by Fosse
        Mr. Wilson was dancing in the African Room in Harlem when he was discovered by Bob Fosse, who cast him in the 1963 revival of "Pal Joey" at City Center. From there Mr. Wilson went to London to perform in "Golden Boy" with Sammy Davis Jr.
        At that time, he became friends with Josephine Baker, who encouraged him to go to Paris. Taking her advice, Mr. Wilson started a show in Paris in 1967 called "The Young Americans," with Liza Minnelli and Johnny Halliday. He also performed at the 1968 Olympic Arts Festival in Munich. He was the first American to the German equivalent of an Emmy Award.
        Mr. Wilson was born in Jamaica, Queens, where he grew up. He graduated from the Juilliard School of Music, which he attended on scholarship with support from Martha Graham.
        He is survived by his mother, Anna Wilhelmena Bosley, and a sister, Julie Anderson, both of Mount Pleasant, S.C.
