        Dr. Michael Edward Stanley, a Columbia University neuroscientist known nationally for his research on the biochemistry of suicide, died on Monday at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 49.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife and fellow researcher, Dr. Barbara Stanley.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Stanley held twin positions at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was the director of the Department of Neuroscience at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, a part of the center. And he was clinical professor of psychopharmacology in the Departments of Psychiatry and Pharmacology at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        He held both positions since 1989.
        Dr. Stanley published more than 100 scientific papers. His subjects, besides suicide, included self-injurious behavior and ethics in psychiatry.
        He was a member and chairman of the psychopharmacology advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration. He also was a consultant for the National Institute of Mental Health, which provided grants for much of his work, and the American Suicide Foundation.
        Dr. Stanley, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., was an Army helicopter pilot in Vietnam and Germany from 1965 to 1968, with the rank of chief warrant officer.
        He graduated magna cum laude with a psychology major from Montclair State College in 1972. He then studied pharmacology and received a master's degree and a Ph.D. with honors in 1979, both from Mount Sinai School of Medicine-City University of New York.
        Coming from Wayne State University School of Medicine, he joined the Columbia faculty in 1985 as an associate professor.
        Besides Dr. Stanley's wife of 23 years, the former Barbara Hrevnack, he is survived by two children, Melissa, 13, and Thomas, 10; his mother, Marie Stanley of South Plainfield, N.J., and two brothers, William of Newark, Del., and Jon of Cape Elizabeth, Me.
