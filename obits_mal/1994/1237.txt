        Dr. Marcus Singer, a longtime professor of anatomy and zoology who was Henry Willson Payne Professor of Anatomy at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, died on Saturday at his home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He was 80.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son Dr. Robert Singer.
        Dr. Marcus Singer retired in 1985 after 24 years at Case.
        In 1953, when he was on the Cornell University faculty, Dr. Singer was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and questioned about his political affiliations. He admitted having been a Communist until 1948, although he said he had never held a party card. He refused to name Communists he had known while teaching at Harvard, from 1942 to 1951, on grounds of "honor and conscience" and invoked the protection of the Fifth Amendment.
        In 1956, he was convicted of contempt of Congress, fined $100 and given a three-month suspended sentence in Federal District Court in Washington, which ruled that he had waived the Fifth Amendment's protection. In 1957 the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set aside the conviction, saying its ruling was required by a Supreme Court decision in a similar case. The court sent the case back to Federal District Court with instructions to enter a judgment of not guilty.
        Dr. Singer was born in Pittsburgh and attended the University of Pittsburgh before studying and teaching at Harvard.
        His marriage to Leah Horelick ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son Robert, of Shrewsbury, Mass., he is survived by another son, Jon of Cleveland Heights; four sisters, Edythe Neiberg, Irene Kramer and Anne Miller, all of Pittsburgh, and Rhoda Hirsch of Buffalo; two brothers, Melvin, of Pittsburgh and Harry, of Boston, and three grandchildren.
