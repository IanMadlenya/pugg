        Allan Albert, who wrote, produced and directed television documentaries, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Gary Feinstein, a longtime friend.
        Mr. Albert worked on several programs for public television, including "The Songs of Six Families," a salute to American regional music that he produced and directed in April, and "You're the Top: The Cole Porter Story," which he wrote and directed for the Porter 100th anniversary in 1990. He also directed the Cole Porter gala at Carnegie Hall that year.
        Mr. Albert was born in New York City and reared in Miami Beach. He earned a bachelor's degree at Amherst College and did graduate work at the Yale School of Drama, where he founded the Proposition, a musical improvisation group that played for a decade in Cambridge, Mass., and on tour. He was artistic director of the Charles Playhouse in Boston and from 1977-79 directed the Berkshire Theater Festival in Stockbridge, Mass.
        As the director of comedy development at Home Box Office from 1979-81, he was in charge of the "Young Comedians Shows," which featured such performers as Pee-wee Herman and Arsenio Hall. In 1980 he formed Allan Albert Productions to produce shows for theme parks. He founded the Oasis foundation in 1989 to promote the work of young photographers.
        He is survived by his mother, Ferda, of North Miami Beach, and a sister, Linette, of Manhattan.
