        Max Kaminsky, a trumpeter associated with the Chicago school of jazz musicians of the 1920's and 30's, died on Tuesday at Castle Point Veterans Administration Medical Center in Castle Point, N.Y. He was 85.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Virginia, of Hopewell Junction, N.Y..
        Mr. Kaminsky was a student of the great New Orleans trumpeters, and as a result he played with a big tone, using slurs and growls and blues ideas. Though he rarely recorded as a leader, he made regular appearances with swing and Dixieland musicians.
        Originally from Massachussetts, Mr. Kaminsky moved to Chicago in 1928, where he started working with some of the better jazz musicians of the time, including the saxophonist Frank Teschemaker and the drummer George Wettling. He quickly fell in with a group of musicians surrounding the guitarist Eddie Condon, with whom he played and recorded for the rest of his career. They included Jack Teagarden, Bobby Hackett, Brad Gowans, George Brunis, Bud Freeman, Joe Sullivan, Dave Tough and Gene Krupa. With Dorsey and Shaw
        In 1933, Mr. Kaminsky recorded with Benny Carter's Chocolate Dandies and played with the clarinetist and saxophonist Mezz Mezzrow, and from then on he worked with Tommy Dorsey, Artie Shaw and Bud Freeman.
        In the 1940's he was part of a series of important concerts at Town Hall and Carnegie Hall, held under Eddie Condon's name and for the rest of the decade he worked with survivors from the first decades of jazz's history, including Willie (the Lion) Smith and Sidney Bechet, along with Joe Marsala, Jack Teagarden and Art Hodes.
        In the 1950's he worked in television and played at Ryan's, a swing and Dixieland club in New York, where he worked until the 1980's. He later performed with Earl Hines and recorded several albums under his own name.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Sam, of Denver, and Matthew, of Boston.
