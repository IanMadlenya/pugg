        John Henry Martin, a former superintendent of schools in Mount Vernon, N.Y., who studied how children learn to read and write, died at his summer home in Sugar Hill, N.H., on July 1. Dr. Martin, who was 78, also lived in Stuart, Fla.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said Thomas I. Pillsbury Jr., director of the Pillsbury Funeral Home in Littleton, N.H.
        Dr. Martin founded the JHM Corporation, which developed "Writing to Read," a computer-based literacy instruction system, in conjunction with a unit of the International Business Machines Corporation. I.B.M. began selling the program in 1984, and by the end of 1990, it said, more than 7,000 elementary schools around the country had installed the systems.
        He also developed, in conjunction with I.B.M., a computer-based system to help teach illiterate adults and adolescents to how to read and write.
        Dr. Martin, who was superintendent of the Mount Vernon schools from 1964 to 1966, previously served as a superintendent of schools in Wayne, N.J., and Freeport, L.I. He also was an adjunct professor at New York University and, in 1976, chairman of a Federal project called the National Panel on the Study of Adolescence.
        He was born in Paterson, N.J., and received a B.S. from the University of Alabama and an M.A. and a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia University.
        His first wife, Evelyn, died. He is survived by his second wife, Imelda Tilley Martin; a son, Michael, of Willingboro, N.J.; two daughters, Susan, of Palm City, Fla., and Jane, of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and two grandchildren.
