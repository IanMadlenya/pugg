        Kim Sang Man, the former publisher of South Korea's most influential newspaper, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Seoul. He was 84.
        Mr. Kim was associated with the paper, Dong-A Ilbo, for 45 years, starting in 1949, serving as executive director, president, publisher, chairman and, since 1981, chairman emeritus.
        He helped build the paper into one of South Korea's largest national dailies, with a circulation of more than one million. The paper did not challenge the authoritarian post-war governments but has shown more independence in recent years as South Korea has widened democratic rights.
        At his death Mr. Kim was chairman of the trustees of Korea University, formerly Posung College, in Seoul.
        He was born in Puan, Korea, studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science and graduated from Waseda University in Japan in 1940. He presided over the Korean-British Society for many years and was named a Commander of the British Empire.
        Mr. Kim also served as chairman of the Press Foundation of Asia.
        Mr. Kim is survived by his wife, Koh Hyun Nam Kim; two sons, Kim Byung Kwan, who is chairman of Dong-A Ilbo, and Kim Byung Kun, the paper's executive director; and three daughters, Kim Myung Eui, Kim Myung Jin and Kim Myung Cho.
        Correction:  February 15, 1994, Tuesday
        An obituary on Jan. 28 about Kim Sang Man, former publisher of South Korea's most influential national daily newspaper, Dong-A Ilbo, misstated the paper's position on authoritarian Governments that ruled the country until recent years. The paper indeed challenged those dictatorial Governments and has been a consistent voice for democratic reform and press freedom. The obituary also misstated the paper's circulation. It is 2,160,000.
