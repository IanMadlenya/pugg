        Noel Pointer, the jazz violinist, singer, pianist and composer, died on Monday at New York-Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He was 39 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Chinita.
        Mr. Pointer made his solo debut at age 13 as a classical violinist, performing music by Vivaldi with the Symphony of the New World Orchestra in New York City. He also appeared with the Chicago Chamber Orchestra and the Detroit Symphony.
        While still a teen-ager, he performed with several theater orchestras, including those at the Apollo Theater, the Westbury Music Fair and Radio City Music Hall.
        He also wrote scores for several dance troupes, among them the Joyce Trisler Danscompany and the Inner City Ensemble Theater and Dance Company. He played regularly in clubs in the metropolitan area. In his New York Times review of Mr. Pointer's performance with a quintet at Fat Tuesday's in 1985, John S. Wilson praised the music as "spirited, colorful and filled with melodic charm and rhythmic power."
        Mr. Pointer served as a musical adviser to the National Endowment for the Arts and the United States Information Agency. In February 1992, he founded the National Movement for the Preservation of the Sacred African Burial Grounds of New York City, a coalition of performing artists, anthropologists and historians.
        Mr. Pointer recorded seven solo albums, including "Phantazia." Two of his albums, "All My Reasons" and "Direct Hit," were nominated for Grammy Awards.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Danai and Danielle; a son, Noel Jr.; a brother, the Rev. William Pointer Jr., and his parents, Louvinia and William Pointer, all of Brooklyn, and a sister, Olive Harney of Arleta, Calif.
