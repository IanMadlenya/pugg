        Walter McQuade, a writer and architecture critic, died on Monday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in New Hyde Park. He was 72 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        After graduating from Cornell University in 1947 with a degree in architecture, Mr. McQuade joined the staff of The Architectural Forum and later began writing articles for Fortune magazine as well. He joined the staff of Fortune in 1964 and continued there for 20 years, until his retirement.
        Mr. McQuade was appointed to the New York City Planning Commission by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1967, and served during the period when the city was being divided into neighborhood planning districts. He led the move to rezone the Plaza Hotel as residential, thus preserving the hotel from demolition to make room for an office building.
        He was the architecture and design critic for The Nation from 1959 to 1965 and for Life magazine from 1970 to 1974. He was the author of several books: "Schoolhouse" (1958), "A City Fit to Live In" (1971), "Architecture in the Real World" (1985) and, with his wife, Ann Aikman, "Stress" (1974), which was reissued in an updated edition last year by New American Library.
        Mr. McQuade was awarded the gold medal for architecture criticism by the American Institute of Architects in 1974.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Molly, of Brooklyn, and Kate, of Great Neck; a son, Benjamin, of Vienna, and a sister, Eileen Vastola of Plattsburgh, N.Y.
