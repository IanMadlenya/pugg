        A. Kenneth Pye, who resigned as president of Southern Methodist University in Dallas on June 22 because of his health, died yesterday at his vacation home in Lake City, Colo. He was 62.
        The cause was cancer, said William H. Lively, a spokesman for S.M.U.
        Dr. Pye left a lasting impression on two universities: S.M.U., which he had served as president since 1987, and Duke University, where his 21-year association included two terms as chancellor and two terms as law school dean.
        Although he is credited with achieving financial stability and establishing an emphasis on scientific literacy at S.M.U., his greatest challenge there was restoring integrity to the university's athletics program.
        Dr. Pye took over S.M.U. in the wake of a scandal provoked by payments to football players that had been made with the knowledge of the university's board. The football program was banned for the 1987 season and sat out the entire 1988 season. He was credited with leading the rebuilding of the university's athletic program.
        Before coming to S.M.U., he served at Duke as a professor of law, university counsel, director of international studies, dean of the law school, chancellor of the university and as its acting president. As chancellor, he was credited with helping transform Duke from a regional institution to one of national prominence.
        Born in New York City in 1931, Dr. Pye received a B.A. degree from the University of Buffalo and J.D. and LL.M. degrees from Georgetown University.
        Dr. Pye is survived by his wife, Judith Pye, and their son, Henry Williams Pye of Dallas.
