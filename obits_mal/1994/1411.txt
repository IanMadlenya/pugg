        Peter Wilenski, a former ambassador to the United Nations from Australia who proposed reforms for the administration of the United Nations, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Sydney. He was 55 years old.
        The cause was lymphatic cancer, which had been under treatment for several years, according to a statement from the Australian Mission to the United Nations.
        Mr. Wilenski was born in Poland in 1939 and moved with his family to Australia when he was 4. He began his rise in Australian government in the early 1970's as a private secretary to Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.
        He served as ambassador from 1989 to 1992, during which time he was a strong advocate of improving the record of the United Nations for hiring women. He also formed a group of ambassadors who met to write a package of reform proposals for the top United Nations administration.
        He returned to Australia to serve for a year as secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
        He is survived by his wife, Jill; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Katy, all of Sydney.
