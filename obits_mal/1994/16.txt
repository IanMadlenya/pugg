        Robert F. Corroon, a Manhattan insurance executive for 44 years, died on Monday in Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. He was 71 and lived in Greenwich.
        The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said his wife, Helen.
        In 1945, Mr. Corroon joined Corroon & Reynolds, a Manhattan firm that managed insurance companies. The firm was founded in 1905 by his family. He became chief executive officer of its successor company, Corroon & Black in 1972.
        Over the years the company became a major insurance broker and Mr. Corroon rose to chairman of the board in 1975, continuing in that position until 1989, when he retired from active management of the company.
        Mr. Corroon was a trustee of the College of Insurance, a director of the International Insurance Society and a director of the New York Insurance Brokers Association.
        He is survived by his wife of Greenwich; four sons, Robert F. Jr., of Fairfield, Conn., Richard F. 2d, of Greenwich, Peter, of San Francisco, and Christopher, of Park City, Utah; two daughters, Holly Corroon of Manhattan and Andrea Corroon of Los Angeles; two brothers, Lawrence, of Rye, and Hugh, of Greenville, Del., and a sister, Mari Stearns of Montclair, N.J.
