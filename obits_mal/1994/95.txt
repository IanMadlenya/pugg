        Charles P. Noyes, a retired lawyer and diplomat, died yesterday in Huntington (L.I.) Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Syosset, L.I.
        He had had Alzheimer's disease for some time, his family said.
        A native of St. Paul, Minn., Mr. Noyes graduated from Yale University and its law school. He practiced with the New York firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts until 1941 when he joined the legal staff of the Lend-Lease Administration.
        Later, he was sent to London as an assistant to W. Averell Harriman, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's special representative to Britain. In the late 1940's he was a member of the United States Mission to the United Nations. He briefly worked for the Department of Defense and, in the 1950's, was a consultant to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
        He served as Minister-Counselor to the United States Mission at the United Nations under Adlai E. Stevenson from 1961 to 1965, when he became an alternate delegate to the 1964 Session of the General Assembly.
        Mr. Noyes's first wife, the former Elizabeth McCutcheon, died in 1964. He is survived by Carol Rothschild Bradford, whom he married in 1965; two sons, Charles P. 3d of Spencertown, N.Y., and James McC. of Hood River, Ore., and two grandchildren.
