        Samuel Ervin Hill, a conservationist and retired labor arbitrator, died on Sunday at his home in Redding, Conn. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, his son William said.
        Dr. Hill, who had a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University, was an economic planner in Federal agencies from 1941 to 1953 and a research associate in industrial relations at Princeton University in the later 1950's and early 1960's. Afterward, he was a self-employed labor arbitrator and owned an old, working farm in Redding.
        In 1964, he became the first chairman of the Redding Conservation Commission, and conservation took up much of his time in his later years. He served on that panel most of the time until his death.
        He did much to persuade Connecticut legislators to adopt regulations on the use of inland wetlands and was one of the regulations' drafters. He was also instrumental in bringing about the purchase by the Town of Redding of more than 1,000 acres, mostly woodlands and other scenic open space, which has kept those lands undeveloped.
        Dr. Hill was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in 1935 from Ohio Wesleyan University, then his doctorate in 1940. He was a co-author of "Toward Fair Employment" (1964).
        His marriage to Edith Foster ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Betty Anne Bell; a daughter, Susanna Hill of Redding; two sons, William and Robert, both of Redding, four grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
