        Dr. Harry Most, an authority on tropical diseases who helped protect American soldiers against malaria in World War II, died on Sunday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged on West 106th Street. He was 86 and had lived in Manhasset, L.I., until December.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his daughter, Susan Most.
        Dr. Most retired last year as the Herman M. Biggs Professor of Preventive Medicine at New York University's medical school, where he was chairman of the department of preventive medicine from 1953 to 1973. He had taught there since 1941, with time out for service as a major in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.
        When the United States entered that war, said Dr. Jerome Vanderberg, a professor at the medical school, "relatively few American physicians had any expertise in tropical medicine and parasitic diseases." So "when American troops found themselves confronting the enemy in the South Pacific, Dr. Most's knowledge and experience became vital to our country's cause," Dr. Vanderberg said.
        Dr. Most was a leader in the development of chloroquine for use in treating American troops suffering from malaria, Dr. Vanderberg recalled. At the beginning of the American involvement in the war there were more American casualties from malaria than from enemy fire, but "by the end of the campaign in the Pacific, malaria was largely under control," Dr. Vanderberg said.
        Dr. Most was the author or co-author of more than 150 articles, chapters and books in the field of tropical medicine. He received numerous awards and honors.
        He was born and reared in Manhattan and earned a bachelor's degree, a medical degree and a doctorate in science, all from New York University.
        In addition to his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dr. Rita Most of Manhattan, formerly of Manhasset; a son, Paul, of Los Angeles, and a grandchild.
