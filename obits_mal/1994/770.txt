        Dr. Ralph Lloyd Shriner, a prominent organic chemist and author of a widely used textbook on the subject, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Riverwoods, Ill. He was 94 and most recently lived in Lincolnshire, Ill.
        Dr. Shriner was one of the scientists who laid the foundations of modern organic chemistry in the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Among other things, he came up with a system to identify organic compounds well before the advent of advanced technology for qualitative analyses. He specialized in determining the structures of organic compounds, including drugs, and how to synthesize them.
        In 1935, Dr. Shriner published his classic textbook, "The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds," which went through six editions and was translated into three foreign languages. It helped train several generations of undergraduate chemists in the laboratory aspects of their discipline. He was the author of another book and the co-author of two more, and he published 120 papers.
        A native of St. Louis, he earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Washington University there. He received his master's and Ph.D. degrees in organic chemistry at the University of Illinois in Urbana, where he taught from 1927 to 1941, when he became a professor and chairman of the Chemistry Department at Indiana University in Bloomington.
        In 1947, he joined the chemistry faculty of the State University of Iowa, now called the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, where he taught until 1963, serving for a time as department chairman. After his retirement he was a visiting professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas until 1978.
        The American Chemical Society honored him in 1962 with the James Flack Norris Award for outstanding achievement in the teaching of chemistry.
        Dr. Shriner is survived by his daughter, Joan Palinscar of Lincolnshire, and three grandchildren.
