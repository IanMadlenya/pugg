        Benjamin Schechter, the managing and artistic director of Folksbiene, a Yiddish theater in Manhattan, died on Monday at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 74 and lived in the Bronx.
        He died of congestive heart failure said Leonard Schechter, his son.
        Born in Kovel, in eastern Poland, now Russia, Mr. Schechter came to the United States in 1936. During World War II, he served as a corporal in the United States Army.
        After the war, he worked as a bookkeeper and taught Yiddish and Hebrew in Manhattan and the Bronx. In 1956, he joined the Folksbiene, then on East Broadway in lower Manhattan, where he was an actor and assisted in its business affairs. After he became the managing director in the 1970's, the theater moved to the Central Synagogue in midtown.
        In addition to his son, a Manhattan dealer in architectural artifacts who lives in Kutztown, Pa., he is survived by his wife of 42 years, May Rothman, and a daughter, Naomi, a clinical psychologist in Manhattan.
