        George G. Vest, a tax lawyer and philanthropist, died on Tuesday in Norwalk Hospital. He was 64 and lived in New Canann, Conn.
        The cause was a pulmonary embolism, the family said.
        As vice president and director of the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Foundation, he helped to direct its charitable activities. Set up by the founder of the Cities Service Company, the foundation's endowments go primarily to further marine biology, oceanography and marine law projects. In 1969, it gave $7 million to Columbia University's geological observatory, which was renamed the Lamont Doherty Geoglogical Observatory.
        Mr. Vest was born in Washington. He graduated from Brown University in 1952 and received a law degree from the University of Virginia in 1958. He was a partner in the firm of Cummings & Lockwood in Stamford, Conn.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lee Haskell; a daughter, Sallie Benson Vest of Salem, Mass.; a son, G. Graham Jr. of Burlingham, N.Y.; a sister, Joan Vest Withington of Centreville, Md.; a brother, Col. Wendell N. Vest of Norfolk, Va., and two grandchildren.
