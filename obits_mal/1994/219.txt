        John Wickham, an innovative agricultural scientist who was a pioneer in the planting of grapes and other fruits in Suffolk County and whose family farmed in Cutchogue for 300 years, died on Thursday at Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport. He was 85.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Parnel Wickham-Searl.
        Mr. Wickham began planting grapes on his 275-acre family farm on Long Island's North Fork 30 years ago, reviving previous largely unsuccessful attempts to establish vineyards in the county.
        His success in producing table grapes, chiefly through his hybrid Suffolk Red variety, spread to the production of wine grapes on the eastern end of Long Island where viticulture is now flourishing.
        He was also credited with developing and introducing to Long Island farms new varieties of apricots, nectarines, sweet cherries, apples, peaches, pears and cranberries in conjunction with the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, N.Y.
        Mr. Wickham was one of the first of eastern Long Island's farmers to diversify from vegetables alone, primarily potatoes, into fruit trees and berry bushes.
        For many years he and members of his family operated the Wickham Fruit Farm, a fruit and vegetable stand on Route 25 in Cutchogue.
        Mr. Wickham graduated from Cornell University with a degree in civil engineering in 1930. In addition to farming, he served at various times on the Suffolk County Planning Board, the Long Island Regional Planning Commission and the Southold Town Planning Board, as well as other governmental and advisory groups.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Anne, of Cutchogue; two sons, Thomas, of Cutchogue, and John L., of Baltimore; his daughter, Mrs. Wickham-Searl of New Suffolk, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
