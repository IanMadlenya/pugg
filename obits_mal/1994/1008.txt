        The Rev. Herschel Halbert, a founder of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, died on Aug. 2 at his home in Norwood, N.J. He was 78.
        He died of natural causes, his family said.
        Mr. Halbert was long active in promoting interreligious cooperation for peace, a cause for which he traveled across the country and around the world. The campaign reached a new stage in 1970, when more than 300 religious and lay leaders met in Kyoto, Japan, to start the conference. He played a role in strengthening the organization with the formation of 30 national chapters and affiliated religious bodies in 60 different countries.
        Mr. Halbert grew up in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University. He attended General Theological Seminary in New York and was ordained an Episcopal priest in 1943. Served on Bishop's Staff
        He was a Navy chaplain in World War II and served parishes in Maryland and eastern Pennsylvania before becoming director of Christian education in the Diocese of Central New York. In the 1960's, he was assigned to the staff of the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church U.S.A. in New York.
        Most recently, he was an active volunteer of the Anglican United Nations Office and helped organize the United Nations Non-Governmental Committee for Freedom of Religion or Belief earlier this year.
        Mr. Halbert is survived by a daughter, Sally Halbert of Manhattan; three sons, David of Walnut Creek, Calif., Stephen of North Hollywood, Calif., and Peter of Studio City, Calif.; and a sister, Jane Halbert of Baltimore.
