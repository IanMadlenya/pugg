        William K. Frankena, a philosophy professor at the University of Michigan who compiled a widely read book on the theory and history of ethics, died on Saturday at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Ypsilanti, Mich. He was 86 and lived in Ann Arbor.
        He died of a heart attack, said his son Karl, also of Ann Arbor.
        Professor Frankena, who taught for more than 30 years until his retirement in 1978, composed "Ethics," published by Prentice-Hall in 1963. The book, which consists of a series of essays, is now in its 24th printing and has been translated into eight languages. It is considered a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to the study of ethics, covering questions of value, obligation and the nature of ethical convictions.
        Among his other books were "Thinking About Morality" (1980) and "Three Historical Philosophies of Education" (University of Michigan Press, 1965).
        He was born in Manhattan, Mont., graduated from Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1930, and received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1937.
        Professor Frankena's wife, the former Sadie Roelfs, died in 1978. Besides his son Karl, he is survived by another son, Mark, of Alexandria, Va., a brother, August, of Jamestown, N.C., and four grandchildren.
