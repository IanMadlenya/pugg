        Carl Barnett, a general foreman for the delivery department of The New York Times for more than 30 years, died on Saturday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. He was 76 and a resident of Port Washington, L.I.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his wife, Mary, said.
        Mr. Barnett was born in Manhattan and reared in Pelham Bay, the Bronx. He joined The Times in 1945 as a truck driver after serving with the Navy Seabees in the Pacific during World War II.
        In 1949, he was promoted to general foreman, the top position in the delivery department at that time. He left the position in 1979 to work in the circulation department. He retired in 1980.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Carl Bryan of Ojai, Calif.
