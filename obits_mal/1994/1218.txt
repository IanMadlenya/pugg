        Andrea Velis, a tenor who sang more than 60 roles at the Metropolitan Opera and was one of the company's best character actors, died on Tuesday at Memorial Hospital in North Conway, N.H. He was 67 and had homes in Manhattan and Tamworth, N.H.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Faber Donoughe, his companion.
        Mr. Velis, who was born in New Kensington, Pa., in 1927, studied in Pittsburgh and on a Fulbright Scholarship at the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. He made his professional debut as Goro in a Pittsburgh Opera production of "Madama Butterfly" in 1954, and sang at the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Cincinnati Summer Opera before making his Met debut in 1961, as Joe in Puccini's "Fanciulla del West."
        Mr. Velis specialized in comprimario roles, the incidental characters that provide some of the texture in an opera. His most frequent role at the Met was Spoletta in "Tosca," which he sang 130 times. His Met repertory also included Don Basilio and Don Curzio in "Le Nozze di Figaro," Alcindoro in "La Boheme," Monostatos in "Die Zauberflote," Altoum in "Turandot," Squeak in "Billy Budd," the Witch in "Hansel and Gretel" and the bailiff in "The Ghosts of Versailles."
        His last performance was in February, and he was to have sung Altoum this season. In all, he sang 1,867 performances at the Met, the fifth-highest number of appearances in the company's history.
        In addition to Mr. Donoughe, he is survived by a sister, Beulah Wilson of Walpole, N.H.
