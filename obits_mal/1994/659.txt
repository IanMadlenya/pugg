        James Seeman, a watercolorist, muralist and designer of wall coverings, died on Tuesday at his winter home in Miami. He was 79 and lived in Water Mill, L.I., the rest of the year.
        The cause was complications from heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. Seeman, a native of Vienna, was educated in Austria. He had additional art training at the Pratt Institute after coming to the United States in 1938.
        In the 1940's, he started his career as a mural painter and designer of scenic and decorative wall coverings. He founded James Seeman Studios and sold it 30 years later, in 1973, when it was based in Garden City Park, L.I. The company sold and distributed his work worldwide.
        He is survived by his wife, Mina Korn Seeman; two sons, Roy, of Miami, and Gary, of San Francisco; a stepdaughter, Lisa Castrigno of Montclair, N.J.; a brother, Fred, of Mystic, Conn., and Naples, Fla.; a sister, Relly Natt of Pompano, Fla., and Smithtown, L.I.; two grandchildren and one step-granddaughter.
