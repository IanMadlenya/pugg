        Cameron Mitchell, a theater, film and television actor who played one of Willy Loman's sons in the original Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman" and the hard-drinking, two-fisted Buck Cannon in the television series "The High Chaparral," died on Wednesday at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 75.
        The Associated Press reported that the cause was lung cancer.
        In his opening-night review of "Death of a Salesman" in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called the performances by Mr. Mitchell as Happy and Arthur Kennedy as his brother, Biff, "all youth, brag and bewilderment." In a re-review of the play a year into its run, he wrote, "Mr. Mitchell's easy, boyish but cheap affability could not be improved upon." Mr. Mitchell also played the role in the 1951 film version.
        Mr. Mitchell was born in Dallastown, Pa., and reared in York, Pa., where his father was a minister. He pitched for his high school baseball team well enough to attract offers from several major-league teams. Determined to become an actor, however, he traveled to New York, where for a time he worked alongside Gregory Peck as a page at Radio City. He made his Broadway debut in 1939 in "Jeremiah," by Stefan Zweig, and the following year he appeared as the second huntsman in the Lunt-Fontanne production of 'The Taming of the Shrew."
        After serving as a bombardier during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles and signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which cast him in a wide variety of roles. His more than 90 films include "They Were Expendable" (1945), "Cass Timberlane" (1947), "Command Decision" (1949), "The Sellout" (1952), "How to Marry a Millionaire" (1953), "Man on a Tightrope" (1953), "Hell and High Water" (1954), "House of Bamboo" (1955), "Carousel" (1956) and "Hombre" (1967).
        He also appeared on Broadway in "The Trojan Women" (1941), "Southern Exposure" (1950) and "Les Blancs" (1970).
        In the 1960's he worked mostly in Europe, appearing in foreign-language historical dramas. His more recent films included "Buck and the Preacher" (1972), "The Klansman" (1974), "The Swarm" (1978), "Without Warning" (1980) and "My Favorite Year" (1982).
        Mr. Mitchell made no secret of his distaste for the new Hollywood. "Thank God I worked with the great ones: Gable, Cooper, Power," he said in a newspaper interview in the 60's. "The respect, mystique and imagination are gone from the movies. Today they're junk."
        Mr. Mitchell worked steadily in television, most memorably in "The High Chaparral" from 1967 to 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, Johanna; six children, Charles, Fred, Camille, Jake, Jono and Kate, and five grandchildren.
