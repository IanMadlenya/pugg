        Leonard Feldman, an authority on high fidelity and consumer electronics, died on Monday at his home in Great Neck, L.I., after a two-year battle with cancer. He was 66.
        Mr. Feldman wrote seven books on audio and electronics and hundreds of articles about audio technologies.
        He was a Chicago native who grew up in New York City. As a teen-ager, he became entranced with what blossomed into a lifelong passion when Maj. Edwin Howard Armstrong demonstrated his new invention, FM radio, at Brooklyn Technical High School.
        Mr. Feldman graduated in 1950 from City College with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. In the 1950's, he designed components for Fisher Radio, then one of the field's leading companies. He was the co-founder in 1956 of Madison Fielding, which made one of the first transistorized preamplifiers for use with microphones.
        Mr. Feldman was inducted in 1980 into the Audio Hall of Fame. He was a technical consultant to national and international groups that set technical standards for the audio field. He was also a fellow of the Audio Engineering Society and a member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
        He is survived by his wife of 45 years, the former Rayma Mandelbaum; a daughter, Dianne Cohen of Chestnut Ridge, N.Y., and a son, Daniel Feldman of Easton, Pa., and three grandchildren.
