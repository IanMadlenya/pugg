        Henry Hill, a founder and former president of Berry-Hill Galleries in New York City, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Angela Plowden-Wardlaw.
        Mr. Hill was born and educated in London, and served in the British Army in World War I. He then joined the family business, Frederick Berry & Sons, which dealt in rare antiquities.
        Mr. Hill moved to New York during World War II and established Berry-Hill Galleries with his brother, Sidney. He was an authority on antique gold snuff boxes, China Coast paintings of the 19th century and American Impressionist paintings.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Minna; a son, Frederick, who is vice president and co-owner of Berry-Hill Galleries; his brother, and three grandchildren, all of New York City.
