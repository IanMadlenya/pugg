        William L. Parkerton, the senior vice president and a founding board member of Consumer Credit Counseling Services of Connecticut in Hartford, died on Friday at his home in West Hartford, Conn. He was 49.
        His family said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Parkerton's association with the Connecticut credit service began with the organization's establishment in 1974 as a nonprofit organization helping individuals and businesses avoid bankruptcy and resolve financial difficulty. From modest beginnings, the service grew to a statewide network of 12 offices.
        On graduation from Dartmouth College in 1966, Mr. Parkerton joined the Peace Corps. He spent two years in India, where he met his wife, the former Patricia Hostetter of Sacramento, Calif. He earned a graduate degree in economic behavior in 1970 from the University of Kentucky.
        A trained singer, he was a member of the Hartford and New Haven Chorales and the Unitarian Society of New Haven Chorus. He also was a member of a number of municipal commissions.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Melissa, and a son, Jesse, both of West Hartford.
