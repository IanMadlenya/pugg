        Bobby Pratt, a jazz pianist and trombonist, died on Friday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was heart and kidney failure, said Chuck Folds, a friend.
        Mr. Pratt first made his reputation playing the trombone. He left his home in Schenectady, N.Y. in 1942 at the age of 16 and moved to New York, where he began a long apprenticeship with some of the major bands of the day, including those of Charlie Barnet, Johnny Richards, Georgie Auld, Stan Kenton and Raymond Scott.
        In 1950 dental problems forced him to take up piano, and for the rest of his career he played both instruments, becoming the consummate versatile New York musician and appearing in clubs all over the city. At one time he had nine regular jobs.
        Mr. Pratt was part of the swing movement of the 1940's, playing with Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, Sid Catlett and others, and took part in early be-bop jam sessions with Charlie Parker. As a result his style was an amalgam of various schools.
        In 1967, Mr. Pratt started a long association with Jimmy Ryan's, a nightclub on West 54th Street. Mr. Pratt was the club's house pianist. When Roy Eldridge arrived there in 1969, Mr. Pratt took up trombone and stayed until the club closed in December 1983.
        From the 1980's into this decade Mr. Pratt worked at various clubs, including Cajun and Arturo's in Greenwich Village.
        He is survived by a brother, Norman, and a sister, Marlene Pachucki, both of Schenectady; and a stepdaughter, Sharon Sprague of Goshen, N.Y.
