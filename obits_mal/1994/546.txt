        Sanford Schwarz, who had been publisher of Sterling's Magazines and was an active advocate for the use of living wills, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. Mr. Schwarz, who lived in Manhattan, was 74.
        The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Charlotte.
        From 1974 to 1984, Mr. Schwarz was the owner and publisher of Sterling's Magazines, which published Daytime TV, Soap Opera Stars and other periodicals. He remained as a consultant when the company was sold. He served in the Army Air Force from 1942 to 1945.
        He was a board member of Choice in Dying, a nonprofit New York group that distributes and publicizes living wills, which enable people to direct their choices for medical treatment if they become incapacitated.
        He is survived by his wife; two sisters, Constance Siegel of Manhattan and Shirley Frank of Toronto, and a brother, Bert of Blairsville, Ga.
