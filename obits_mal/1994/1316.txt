        Oscar Mpetha, a longtime African National Congress figure and union leader who was a political prisoner in South Africa even past his 80th birthday, died on Tuesday in Cape Town. He was 85.
        Mr. Mpetha had advanced diabetes, and the British newspaper The Guardian reported that both his legs had been amputated, that he was partly blind and had lung and kidney problems.
        After beginning his union work with factory workers in the 1940's, he went on to become prominent in the mainly black Food and Canning Workers Union.
        He joined the African National Congress in 1951, rising to become vice president of the Cape Province unit for some years until the Congress was banned by the Government in 1960.
        In 1983 Mr. Mpetha was convicted of terrorism and of inciting a riot at a squatter camp in August 1980 during which two whites were killed. He was sentenced to five years in prison.
        In 1983, while he was making an unsuccessful appeal of his sentence, he was selected to be one of three co-presidents of the United Democratic Front, a new umbrella group of anti-government forces.
        After he began serving the sentence in 1985, one of Mr. Mpetha's legs was amputated and he was hospitalized for most of the sentence.
        Mr. Mpetha was one of seven imprisoned Congress figures who were released in October 1989 in what was widely seen as a Government rehearsal for the subsequent freeing of Nelson Mandela, the main Congress leader, who was also a political prisoner at the time. Despite his poor health, Mr. Mpetha continued to speak at rallies around his country.
        His wife, Rose Constance Nombunga Mpetha, who was also active politically, died in 1986, while he was a prisoner at Grote Schuur hospital in Cape Town. He is survived by a daughter and a son.
