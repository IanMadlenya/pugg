        Irving Albert Tittler, who taught biology at Brooklyn College for more than 40 years, died Oct. 6 at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 86 and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.
        The cause was complications from cancer, said his wife, Sylvia Isseks Tittler.
        Dr. Tittler, who specialized in protozoology, the study of microscopic animals living chiefly in water, joined Brooklyn College in 1935, becoming an assistant professor in 1946, an associate professor in 1952 and a professor in 1958. He retired in 1978.
        In the 1940's and 1950's, he was a research fellow at the Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific Grove, Calif., and the Cold Spring Harbor (L.I.) Laboratory.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Bethany College in 1929 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1935.
        Besides his wife of 59 years, he is survived by a son, Robert, of Montreal; a daughter, Nancy, of Binghamton, N.Y.; four grandchildren, and a brother, Herbert, of Orlando, Fla.
