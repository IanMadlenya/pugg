        Dr. Arthur Thomas Jersild, a developmental psychologist who wrote about how schools can foster self-awareness and self-understanding in children and teachers, died on Monday at a nursing home in Beaufort, S.C. A former resident of Middletown, N.J., he was 91.
        At his death, he was professor emeritus of psychology and education at Teachers College of Columbia University.
        He published many books on child psychology and education between 1928 and 1965 that were widely translated.
        His "In Search of Self" (1952) was based on some 3,000 interviews with students from the fourth grade to college. He found that even small children have more self-awareness than was commonly thought and that emotional hurt can leave emotional scars worse than the scars from a physical attack.
        "The little child knows what it is to have his feelings hurt," he wrote, "to be sad, to be disappointed with as much the same basic meaning as are experienced by the post-graduate student."
        "Child Psychology" (Prentiss-Hall), first published in 1933, went through its sixth edition in 1968. It was considered a premier text in its field.
        He urged that teacher-training programs help future teachers face their own conflicts and anxieties. His analysis of a teacher's self-understanding was published in 1955 as "When Teachers Face Themselves" (Teachers College Press) and remains in print as a paperback.
        Dr. Jersild was born in Elk Horn, Iowa. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Nebraska and earned his Ph.D. in psychology at Columbia in 1927, when he became an instructor at Barnard College. He then taught at the University of Wisconsin before joining the Teachers College faculty in 1930. He reached emeritus status in 1967.
        Dr. Jersild is survived by a son, John T. of Beaufort; a daughter, Alice J. of Staatsburg, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
