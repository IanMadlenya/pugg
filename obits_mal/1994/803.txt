        Dr. William Elgin Swinton, a paleontologist whose writings included a seminal textbook on dinosaurs in 1934, died on Sunday in Toronto. He was 93.
        Dr. Swinton, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, was emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Toronto, where he taught in the 1960's. At the time, he also served as director of life sciences at the Royal Ontario Museum. He also helped to set up the Ontario Science Center.
        Beyond paleontology and zoology, his long career touched on the history and philosophy of science, anatomy, biology and architecture. His final academic post was that of a visiting professor at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1977 and 1978.
        His other accomplishments included tutoring the Princess Royal, the future Queen Elizabeth, when she was a youngster and he was the paleontologist and dinosaur expert of the Natural History Museum in London and serving in intelligence for the Royal Navy in World War II as a lieutenant commander.
        He was a native of Kirkcaldy, Fifeshire, Scotland. Dr. Swinton graduated from the University of Glasgow, where he received his Ph.D. in 1931.
        He joined the staff of the Natural History Museum in 1924 and remained there until 1961. In that period, his laboratory studies of newly unearthed fossils of creatures living 100 million or more years ago were the basis of scholarly articles, museum guides and books.
        Aside from his textbook "The Dinosaurs" of 1934, his titles included "A Guide to the Fossil Birds" (1934), "The Science of Living Things" (1935), "The Corridor of Life" (1948), "Fossil Amphibians and Reptiles" (1954; sixth edition, 1974).
        Another side of his writing was reflected in handsomely illustrated books for the youngest naturalists, written in simple language to give them an opportunity to meet famous extinct creatures. "The Wonderful World of Prehistoric Animals" (1952) aimed at the age group of 10 to 14, and "Digging for Dinosaurs" (1964) was for those 9 and younger.
