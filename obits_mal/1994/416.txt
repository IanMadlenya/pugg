        Benjamin Patterson DeLoache, a baritone who was a professor emeritus of voice at the Yale University School of Music, died on Tuesday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 88 and lived in New Haven.
        Mr. DeLoache made his singing debut in 1928 with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. He later made more than 30 solo appearances with Stokowski, including a leading role in the American premiere of Alban Berg's opera "Wozzeck."
        Mr. DeLoache was born in Camden, S.C., and won a scholarship to study voice at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. After winning a Naumburg Foundation award in 1935, he made his New York recital debut at Town Hall. He then performed regularly around the world, both as a recitalist and as a soloist with orchestras under conductors including Paul Hindemith, Sir Thomas Beecham and Robert Shaw.
        Mr. DeLoache began teaching in the 1940's at the Henry Street Settlement in Manhattan. From 1953 until retired in 1974, he taught at the Yale School of Music and maintained private studios in New York and New Haven.
        He is survived by a sister, Esther Mahaffey of Newberry, S.C., and a brother, James, of Easley, S.C.
