        J. Hobart Warner, a dean and faculty member of the Wooster School in Danbury, Conn., for 44 years, died Monday at the Genesee Hospital in Rochester. Mr. Warner, who had moved to Rochester last year, was 85.
        Mr. Warner had a heart attack while driving, said a daughter, Judith Edwards.
        Mr. Warner joined the faculty of the preparatory school in 1933 as a history and mathematics teacher. During his long career there he also served as dean for 10 years, as well as business manager, baseball coach and football coach. He was a graduate of Wesleyan and Columbia Universities.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Marian Warner of Rochester; two daughters, Mrs. Edwards of Penfield, N.Y., and Joanna Kennedy of Brookline, Mass., and five grandchildren.
