        Richard Paul Seelig, a founder and former vice chairman of the old Chromalloy American Corporation, died on Saturday at his home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. He was 80.
        Mr. Seelig, a native of Berlin, trained at the Berlin Institute of Technology and came to the United States in 1936. Before World War II, he helped start a small company in the field of powder metallurgy and components for the Norden bombsight.
        In 1952 he was a co-founder of Chromalloy American, which grew into a billion-dollar international conglomerate with interests in metal fabrication, transporation and petroleum services, among others. He retired in 1972 as vice chairman. The company has since been absorbed by the Sun Chemical Corporation, now known as the Sequa Corporation, based in Manhattan.
        Mr. Seelig belonged to many professional organizations, including the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers, the American Society of Metals, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. During the Johnson Administration he was a member of the National Committee on Critical Materials.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Roth Seelig, and a sister, Dr. Hildegard Seelig-Fysal of Asheville, N.C.
