        Arnold P. Johnson, a businessman widely known for his efforts to support black-owned businesses in Harlem and to expand job opportunities there, died on June 3 at Harlem Hospital. He was 83.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his wife, Etienne Johnson.
        As president of the Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Harlem, Mr. Johnson spoke out against what he termed "economic colonialism" on 125th Street, or ownership of shops in Harlem by people who did not live in that part of Manhattan. He also publicly advocated more support for black-owned businesses in the area.
        Mr. and Mrs. Johnson owned Etienne's Fashions, a women's apparel store at 482 Lenox Avenue, at 134th Street. He was a board member of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation and the United Council of Harlem Organizations. In 1971 he became the first black to become a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, Etienne, of Manhattan, and three sisters, Anita Johnson of the Bronx, and Louise Johnson and Fita Johnson, both of Miami.
