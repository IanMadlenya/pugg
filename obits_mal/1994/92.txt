        Billy Sullivan Jr., who played for seven major league teams over 12 seasons before retiring in 1947, died of heart failure on Tuesday at the Springwood Nursing Home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 83.
        Sullivan, who played for the pennant-winning Detroit Tigers in 1940 and for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1942, had a career batting average of .289 in 962 games. His father, Billy Sullivan, who died in 1965, was a catcher in the majors from 1899 to 1916, mostly with the Chicago White Sox, whom he also managed in 1909.
        After leaving baseball, the younger Sullivan designed and built homes in Sarasota.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Barthman of Sarasota; and two daughters, Joan Sullivan of Berkeley, Calif., and Jill Spelman of New York City.
