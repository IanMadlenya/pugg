        Hans M. Kolstee, a retired professor of engineering at Queensborough Community College, died on Nov. 12 at North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. A resident of Glen Cove, he was 74.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.

        He retired from Queensborough Community College in 1991 after 28 years of teaching manufacturing processes, machine design and related subjects. Professor Kolstee was previously an employee of Grumman Aerospace, where he did work for the space program, contributing particularly to the propulsion system of the lunar module.
        Professor Kolstee is survived by his wife of 33 years, Joyce Bailey Kolstee; three daughters, Anja Cook of North Harwich, Mass., Linda Kolstee of Cambridge, Mass., and Ellen K. Majewski of Cupertino, Calif., and two grandsons.
