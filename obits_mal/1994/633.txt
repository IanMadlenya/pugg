        Fred Sadoff, an actor and director whose 50-year career included productions on Broadway and the West End in London as well as films and television, died yesterday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 68.
        The cause was AIDS, said Adam Rodman, a friend.
        Mr. Sadoff, whose first show business work was in summer stock companies when he was a teen-ager, made his acting debut on Broadway in the original production of "South Pacific" in 1948, playing the "Professor." He appeared in "Wish You Were Here" in 1952, directed "Terrible Swift Sword" in 1955 and helped in the direction of "The Sleeping Prince" the following year.
        A founding member of the Actor's Studio, Mr. Sadoff was also the first American to work as an assistant director at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater in Stratford on Avon (in 1958) and helped produce its version of "Hamlet," which toured the Soviet Union. He also helped stage several productions in London.
        He returned to New York, and acting, late in 1958, appearing in the Broadway production of "The Quiet American." Over the next several years he helped stage several plays in New York and England. After 1970, Mr. Sadoff spent much of his time in Los Angeles, where he appeared in films and television.
        He is survived by his brother, Robert, of Los Angeles.
