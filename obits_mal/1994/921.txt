        Roger Hewes Wells, a political scientist and authority on Germany who taught for four decades at Bryn Mawr College, died on June 16 at the Barton Stone Christian Home in Jacksonville, Ill. He was 100.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter Elsa Wells Kormann.
        Professor Wells taught at Bryn Mawr College from 1923 to 1963, with time out for service as a United States official in Germany after World War II.
        He served for a time as chairman of the college's political science department, and his writings on Germany include the book "The States in West German Federalism" (1961), which is still in print from New College & University Press.
        In early post-World War II Germany, he was deputy director of civil administration in the United States Military Government and chief of the historical division in the Office of the United States High Commissioner. He was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom for work he did in those years.
        A native of Quincy, Ill., he was a graduate of Northwestern University and of Harvard University, where he earned his doctorate. He married Stella Florence Dueringer in 1922. She died in 1984.
        In addition to Mrs. Kormann, of Chevy Chase, Md., he is survived by another daughter, Lois Wells of Jacksonville, Ill., with whom he formerly made his home, three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
