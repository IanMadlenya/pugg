        Kurt Josten, a German-born scholar and a former curator of the Museum of the History of Science at Oxford, England, died on July 10 near Dusseldorf, Germany, in the town of Neuss, where he lived. He was 82.
        Dr. Josten was naturalized British citizen who was born Conrad Hermann Josten and was also known as C. H. Josten. He held the curator's post from 1950 until he retired in 1964.
        He was an expert on the early history of chemistry and astronomy and on early astronomical instruments. He expanded the museum's holdings through purchases and the gift of a private collection of old astronomical and mathematical instruments. It had been amassed by a shipowner, J. A. Billmeir, with assistance from Dr. Josten.
        Dr. Josten was an authority on Elias Ashmole, the 17th-century British antiquary, scholar and collector who founded the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and wrote his diary and other papers in a code. In 1949 Dr. Josten found the key to the code, and the writings were published in 1966.
        Dr. Josten was born in Neuss and earned a doctorate in law at the University of Erlangen, Germany, in 1935, after Hitler came to power. But he gave up the law as a profession because, he said later, "law no longer existed" in Germany at that time.
        An opponent of Nazism, he spent part of the Hitler era in hiding in France and in Germany. After the war, he moved to England. In retirement, he returned to Neuss.
        His wife, Constanze, died in 1964.
