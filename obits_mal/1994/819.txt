        Thomas M. Palmer, a baritone who sang with the Metropolitan Opera, died on June 11 at Central Park Lodge, a nursing center in Clearwater, Fla. He was 59 and lived in Largo, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, said his companion and accompanist, Mary Jane Linzalone.
        Mr. Palmer made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1974, singing Silvio in Franco Zefferelli's production of "Pagliacci." He also sang with the San Francisco, Houston and Santa Fe opera companies.
        Mr. Palmer was born in Harrisburg, Pa. He was a graduate of the Juilliard School, and made his European debut with the Geneva Opera as Marcello in "La Boheme," a role he sang some 300 times around the world, including once in a 1978 production with the Greater Miami Opera opposite Luciano Pavarotti.  He was a member of the New York Chamber Soloists, and made recordings for Vanguard and Columbia Records.
        Mr. Palmer taught voice at Indiana University, the University of Bridgeport, Florida State University and the University of South Florida, and was the general manager of the St. Petersburg Opera Company in Florida and Florida Opera West.
        In addition to Ms. Linzalone, he is survived by a twin brother, Theodore, and three other brothers, Edwin, Robert and John, and a sister, Mimi, all of Florida.
