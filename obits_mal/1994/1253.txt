        Charles A. Frye, a professor who taught African and African-American studies courses in philosophy, religion and literature, died last Saturday at the Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans. He was 48 and lived in New Orleans.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        At his death, Dr. Frye was a professor of African philosophy and humanities at Southern University in New Orleans and director of the university's Center for African and African-American Studies.
        He was born in Washington and attended Howard University in Washington, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1968 and a master's degree in African studies in 1970.
        In 1976 he received a doctorate in higher education from the University of Pittsburgh. His dissertation, "Toward a Philosophy of Black Studies," published in 1979, helped shape black studies programs at universities throughout the world.
        Over his 25-year-career, Dr. Frye taught at Howard, Northeastern University, the City College of New York, Hampshire College and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
        He wrote four nonfiction books and a novel, "The Peter Pan Chronicles," published in 1989.
        Dr. Frye is survived by his wife, Claudia Menza; his mother, Alberta Frye of Washington; three sons, Odeyo, of Houston, Sekou, of Richmond, and Anthony, of North Adams, Mass., and a daughter, Lia, of New Orleans, all from a previous marriage; two sisters, Dr. Daisy Reed of Richmond and the Rev. Geraldine King of Fort Washington, Md.; a brother, Robert, of Springfield, Va., and a grandchild.
