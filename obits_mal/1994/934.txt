        William A. Penner, a Chicago financial executive who was active in AIDS-related causes, died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 60.
        The cause was AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Penner worked in the brokerage industry for many years. At his death, he was president of the Washington Capital Group, which manages business mergers and acquisitions.
        He was on the boards of the National Symphony Orchestra and the Joffrey Ballet, and raised money for the recent introduction of Plus Voice, a magazine about the human immunodeficiency virus and the people who carry it.
        He is survived by two sons, Bill, of Boston, and George, of Los Angeles; a brother, Robert, of Palm Springs, Calif., and a sister, Ann Henderson of Beatrice.
