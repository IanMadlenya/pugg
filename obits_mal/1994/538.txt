        Dr. Robert L. Leopold, a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, died on Saturday at Bryn Mawr Hospital near Philadelphia. Dr. Leopold, who lived in Haverford, Pa., was 71.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Edith, said.
        Dr. Leopold was also a professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at the university's medical school. He had been partially paralyzed since the late 1960's as a result of injuries suffered in auto accidents.
        He was a 1944 graduate of Harvard University and received a medical degree from Penn.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, David, of South Weymouth, Mass., Donald, of Lexington, Mass., and William Goldberg-Leopold of Merion, Pa., and 10 grandchildren.
