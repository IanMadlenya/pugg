        Daniel M. Rosen, a lawyer who was an expert on patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, died on Friday at his home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 53.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Rosen began his career as a United States Patent Examiner in Washington. He later joined the North American Philips Corporation as counsel for patents and licensing. In 1974, he founded a firm with S. C. Yuter in New York City, which eventually became Rosen, Dainow & Jacobs. The firm specializes in intellectual-property matters for international and United States companies.
        He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Lyn; a son, Robert, of Hoboken, N.J.; a daughter, Amy Rosen Moran of Jackson Heights, Queens, and a sister, Gloria, of New York City.
