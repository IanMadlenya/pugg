        Milton J. Bluestein, founder of Plymouth Shops, a women's clothing retailer, died on Friday at his retirement home in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Blue stein, who lived most of his life in Manhattan, was 90.
        The cause was heart failure, said a grandson, Peter Galison.
        Mr. Bluestein began the retailing company in 1924 and guided it for almost 50 years as it grew into a chain of about 50 specialty apparel stores in the New York and Washington areas. He sold the company in 1970 and retired in 1975.
        He also was active in the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, the Hospital Council of Greater New York and the Anti-Defamation League.
        Mr. Bluestein is survived by his wife, Gabrielle, and a sister, Mini Cohan, both of Palm Beach; two daughters, Barbara Bluestein and Marion Galison, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
