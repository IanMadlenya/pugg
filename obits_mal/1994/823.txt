        Christopher Clarkson, a retired president of American operations for the British Aircraft Corporation, died on Sunday at his home in Old Lyme, Conn. He was 92.
        A native of England, Mr. Clarkson was educated at Lancing College in Sussex and had a long career in aviation. He joined the Royal Air Force in 1924 as an instructor at its Central Flying School, returned to civilian life as a test pilot and won trophies for aerobatics and cross-Channel air races.
        In World War II, he rejoined the Central Flying School but the R.A.F. sent him to the United States to test the warplanes being sent to Britain on Lend-Lease. He became chief of the test branch of the British Air Commission in this country in 1943, rose to the rank of group captain and received the Air Force Cross.
        After the war he served as civil-aviation attache in the British Embassy in Washington until 1952. That year he became United States representative of Vickers-Armstrong Ltd., then one of Britain's leading aircaft and arms manufacturers. That led to his position in 1961 as head of British Aircraft Corporation U.S.A., now British Aerospace. He retired four years later.
        Mr. Clarkson is survived by his wife, Evelyn Clark Clarkson; three daughters, Lady Carola Dobbs of Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland; Jane Croucher of London, and Catherine Maclean of North Wales; two brothers, Anthony and Stephen, both of Surrey; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
