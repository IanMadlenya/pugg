        Albert Green, a potter and painter who developed an international reputation for his ceramics, stoneware, porcelain and canvases, died on Monday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 79 and lived in Westfield, N.J.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Hortense.
        Mr. Green's abstractions in either basic or earth colors decorated the hundreds of bottles, plates, bowls and other containers either now or once on exhibit in museums and galleries around the world.
        Critics praised his works for their sweep and harmony. He also was a student of Chinese and Japanese glazes and adapted some of their intricacies to the surfaces of his pieces, infusing them with a shimmering light and a subtle sense of color.
        Mr. Green said he had become almost obsessed with the work of Chinese potters of the Sung Dynasty (A.D. 960-1279) and with their ability to create celadon glazes known as Kuan. He spent several years conducting experiments at his studio in Westfield before he was able to approximate the technique.
        A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Green studied painting at the Art Students League in New York City. During that time he sold men's clothing; he later ran children's clothing shops in Plainfield and Elizabeth, N.J. He retired in 1976 to devote all his efforts to painting and pottery.
        In addition to his wife of 53 years, he is survived by a son, Paul, of Edmonds, Wash.; a daughter, Beth Olesky of New York City, and three grandchildren.
