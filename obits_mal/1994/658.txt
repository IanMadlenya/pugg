        Harley Flaum, who wrote and produced music for radio and television as well as humorous radio advertisements, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 48.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Margie.
        In 1972 Mr. Flaum founded and became president of Radio Band of America, a company that has won more than 30 Clio Awards for radio advertising.
        He graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in communications from Temple University.
        Mr. Flaum is survived by his wife; his mother, Betty Ross of Palm Beach, Fla., and his stepfather, George Ross, also of Palm Beach.
