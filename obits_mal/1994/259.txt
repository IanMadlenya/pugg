        Gary Clare, director of creative development for the performance-programs department at Thirteen/WNET, the public television station in New York, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 32.
        The cause was AIDS-related, his family said.
        Mr. Clare supervised program development and financing for "Great Performances," the performing-arts series produced by WNET for PBS. Among the programs he worked on were "Sondheim: A Celebration at Carnegie Hall," "Gregory Hines's Tap Dance in America" and "In the Wings: Angels in America."
        He also helped develop "In the Spotlight," a series of pop music specials, and "Theater in America," a documentary series on the history of the American theater.
        A native of Providence, R.I., he received B.A. and M.F.A. degrees from Brandeis University, where he staged plays and musicals. Before joining WNET in 1987, he worked as a director and stage manager in regional theater and Off Broadway.
        Mr. Clare is survived by his mother, Dorothy; his father, Robert, and a brother, Douglas, all of Warwick, R.I.
