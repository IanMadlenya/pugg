        R. A. Radley, a national figure in the fight against AIDS, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 43 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was related to AIDS, which he had for eight and a half years, the hospice said.
        Mr. Radley, known as Russ, was the founding executive director of the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS in 1986. That made him the first full-time grant-maker to AIDS services and prevention efforts.
        He also was a founding board member of Gay Men's Health Crisis; Funders Concerned About AIDS, which represents foundation and business executives supporting AIDS and H.I.V. projects; New York City AIDS Fund; Photographers and Friends United Against AIDS, and the New York City Gay Men's Chorus.
        A native of Whitestown, N.Y., Mr. Radley graduated from the State University of New York in Plattsburgh. In the early 1970's he was an assistant to the college's president and designed a marketing and public affairs program for S.U.N.Y. branches. Before working at the design industries foundation he operated a management consulting firm.
        Mr. Radley is survived by his parents, Stanley and Geraldine Radley of Sarasota, Fla., and a brother, Roger of Philipsburg, Mont.
