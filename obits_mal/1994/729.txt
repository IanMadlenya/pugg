        Dr. Charles Moertel, a cancer researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., died on Monday at his home. He was 66 and lived in Rochester.
        Kay Boeding Thiemann, a spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic, said only that he had a lengthy illness.
        Dr. Moertel, who directed numerous studies of cancer treatments, was known for his insistence on scientific rigor. He was particularly irked when small preliminary studies were hailed as proof that new treatments were effective. He said such premature claims gave false hope to dying patients, and he noted that in fact most new drugs failed to fulfill their initial promise.
        He founded the North Central Cancer Treatment Group, made up of health care organizations that enrolled patients from small communities in cancer studies.
        Two studies conducted by Dr. Moertel showed that laetrile and vitamin C were ineffective against cancer. Another showed that chemotherapy and radiation were effective in patients with high-risk rectal cancer.  Questioning Costs
        More recently, he focused on the high cost of cancer treatments and questioned the use of standard, but sometimes ineffective, practices. Last year, he showed that a blood test often used to detect the recurrence of colon cancer after surgery was ineffective in improving cure rates.
        And he argued last year that the Federal Government should control the costs of drugs it had helped develop, rather than letting companies charge patients high prices.
        Born in Milwaukee, Dr. Moertel received a medical degree from the University of Illinois in Chicago in 1953. He joined the Mayo Clinic in 1954.
        Dr. Moertel is survived by his wife, Virginia; his mother, Alma Panfil of Oceanside, Calif., three sons, Charles S. of Ann Arbor, Mich., Christopher L. of St. Paul, and David M. of Rochester; a daughter, Heather M. Vick of Minneapolis, and eight grandchildren.
