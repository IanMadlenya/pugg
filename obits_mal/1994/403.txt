        Charles G. Stachelberg, a retired commodities importer who was active in community affairs and as an advocate of children's rights, died on Monday in Beth Israel North Hospital. A lifetime resident of Manhattan, he was 67.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Stachelberg attended Columbia University, served in the Navy in World War II and then graduated from Wesleyan University. He entered the commodities business and was a co-founder of the Schwabach Coffee Corporation, importers of coffee.
        After his retirement from business a dozen years ago, he devoted his efforts to the causes of children's welfare and quality-of-life issues, for which he served on many boards. At his death he was a director of the Jewish Association of Neighborhood Centers. He also was a director of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York and was active in the East Side's Community Board 8, dealing with neighborhood preservation and zoning.
        Mr. Stachelberg is survived by his wife, Susan; two daughters, Erica B., of Manhattan, and Winnie, of Washington, and a son, Cas, also of Manhattan.
