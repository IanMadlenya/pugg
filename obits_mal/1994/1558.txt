        Roland D. Ciaranello, a Stanford University psychiatrist who conducted research on infantile autism in an effort to find a gene that may cause the disorder, died on Thursday in San Juan, P.R., where he was attending a conference. He was 51.
        Dr. Ciaranello was jogging when he appeared to suffer from cardiac arrest, university officials said.
        He was the Nancy Friend Pritzker Professor of Psychiatry and chief of the Division of Child Psychiatry and Child Development at Stanford University Medical Center. Dr. Ciaranello studied the biochemical controls of behavior as they apply to neurological and psychiatric disorders in children.
        In recent years, his research focused on the molecular biology of serotonin, a major key brain chemical, as it relates to psychiatric disorders and the genetics of infantile autism.
        He was born in Schenectady, N.Y., graduated from Union College in 1965 and earned his medical degree from Stanford in 1970. Dr. Ciaranello joined the Stanford faculty as an assistant professor in 1978. Within three years he received an accelerated promotion to associate professor with tenure.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy Rogers Ciaranello, and a daughter, Andrea Lynne, both of Palo Alto, Calif., and his parents, Roland Sr. and Carmella Ciaranello of Schenectady.
