        Loremil Machado, a performer and teacher of Afro-Brazilian dance, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Barbara Browning, a longtime friend.
        Mr. Machado was known for the intensity of his dancing even in styles like the Brazilian martial arts form Capoeira, which calls as much for reckless daring as for skill and training.
        He was born in Salvador, Bahia Brazil, and came to New York City in 1975. He taught at Clark Center and at Lezly Dance Studios, both in Manhattan. He performed with his own troupe, the Loremil Machado Afro-Brazilian Dance Company, for which he also choreographed, and as a featured dancer in Jelom Vieira's DanceBrazil troupe. He and Mr. Vieira have been credited with popularizing Capoeira in New York City.
        He is survived by his mother, Joselina Candida de Sousa Machado, and three brothers and two sisters, all of Salvador, Bahia Brazil.
        A memorial program is to be held tomorrow at 5 P.M. at S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street.
