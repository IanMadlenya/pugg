        Matthew A. Meyer, a New York book publisher and literary agent, died on Friday at Charlene Manor, a nursing home in Greenfield, Mass. He was 84.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        During a 40-year career in publishing, Mr. Meyer held positions at Farrar Straus & Young, now Farrar Straus & Giroux, and the Viking Press, now Viking Penguin, where he headed the subsidiary rights department. While at Vanguard Press, he was responsible for the publication of "The Bridge Over the River Kwai," the 1954 book by Pierre Boulle, and for the subsequent sale of its film rights.
        In 1975, he retired from publishing and became a literary agent.
        He was born in Chicago and graduated from Yale University in 1932.
        Mr. Meyer was married to the former Ernestine Cohen, who died in 1976. He is survived by two sons, Carl, of Conway, Mass., and John, of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
