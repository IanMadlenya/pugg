        Clinton Wilding Smith, a dancer and choreographer, died last Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, said Marc Janover, his companion.
        Mr. Smith was born in Hingham, Mass. He attended Skidmore College, and came to New York in 1974. He appeared with Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the all-male parody ballet group, dancing under the name of Redrova Komova. In 1982, he formed a stilt-dancing partnership with Coralie Romanyshyn; with her, he performed dances choreographed for stilts, including a version of "The Nutcracker Suite," around the country. He also worked with various modern-dance choreographers, among them Alice Farley, Tamar Rogoff and Lori Bellilove.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his mother, Elizabeth Wilding Smith of Hingham, and a sister, Leslie Richell of Cambridge, Mass.
