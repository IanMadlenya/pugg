        Adolf J. Snow, who was an executive at Sears, Roebuck & Company when Gen. Robert E. Wood built it into the world's biggest merchandising enterprise, died on Wednesday. He was 100 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was kidney failure, his family said.
        A native of Austria, Dr. Snow graduated from Ohio State University and held a Ph.D. from Columbia University, where he studied philosophy under John Dewey. In the 1920's he wrote a book on Newton's physical philosophy and several others on the psychology of business relations and sales.
        At Sears, Roebuck in Chicago, he filled executive retail, personnel and marketing positions under General Wood. One of his innovations was having artists design appliances for the company. Among them was Raymond Loewy, who in 1934 designed the Coldspot refrigerator, which took first prize at the Paris International Exposition of 1937 and gave Sears a commercial success.
        An accomplished mountaineer and skier, Dr. Snow continued to ski into his 90's.
        He is survived by his second wife, Aida; a daughter, Julia Jane Watrous, of California, and several grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.
