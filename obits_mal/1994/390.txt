        Donald Hopson, a New York fashion designer best known for his work on the Adele Simpson collections of women's clothes, died on Friday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 57.
        The cause was cancer, said Rodger Robinson, the executor of his estate.
        Mr. Hopson, a 1957 graduate of the Parsons School of Design, worked in the fashion industry for 35 years. For more than a decade he worked on Adele Simpson's lines of stylish but wearable outfits for American working women. He was previously employed as a design assistant by other fashion houses.
        Early last year, he went into business for himself by opening his Donald Edward Hopson antiques shop, at the Madison Avenue Antiques Center near East 66th Street in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hopson is survived by his father, Henry Hopson of Edmeston, N.Y., and a sister, Phyllis Arnold, also of Edmeston.
