        Col.-Gen. Stefan Guse of the Romanian Army, who figured in the crisis that ended the Ceausescu dictatorship in 1989, died on March 28 in the military hospital in Bucharest. He was 54.
        The cause was lung cancer, the Reuters news agency reported, citing the Romanian state news agency Rompres.
        General Guse was Chief of Staff of the Romanian armed forces when the crisis began in December 1989 with mass anti-Government demonstrations in Romania's fourth-largest city, Timisoara.
        President Nicolae Ceausescu commanded that the demonstrators be subdued with deadly force and warned that anyone who disobeyed his orders would be shot. Government forces opened fire on the protesters in Timisoara, killing and wounding numbers of them. The bloodshed led to other rebellions around the country, culminating in Mr. Ceausescu's capture and his execution on Dec. 25.
        American correspondents, reported that the available evidence suggested that troops of the Romanian Army had joined, with members of the Romanian security forces, in the shootings at Timisoara on Dec. 17, under the overall direction of General Guse.
        For his part, the general contended that he had disobeyed the dictator's orders. After Mr. Ceausescu's death, he remained briefly as Chief of Staff.
        But the Government that succeeded Mr. Ceausescu's contained other veteran military commanders and figures who had once been high-ranking Communists, and opponents contended that it was protecting people who had killed civilians during the rebellion.
        The opposition to the new Government also contended that General Guse had at first obeyed Mr. Ceaucescu's orders to shoot demonstrators.
        In 1990, with the rancorous political climate continuing, General Guse was transferred to the lesser post of commander of an army region, with his headquarters in the city of Buzau, 60 miles northeast of Bucharest.
