        Herman B. Glaser, a former president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, died on Tuesday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his family.
        Mr. Glaser retired in 1986 as a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Glaser, Shandell & Blitz. But he continued to work full time at the firm until his death.
        For the most part, he represented plaintiffs in personal-injury cases involving medical malpractice and products liability. Such cases are the firm's specialty.
        Long prominent in his field, he was a former officer of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. He was also the founder of the Academy of the New York State Trial Lawyers Institute and was one of the academy's deans at his death. He lectured widely and wrote numerous articles for legal journals.
        In addition, Mr. Glaser was a founder of the New York State Council for Civic Affairs, a consumer group.
        A native of Manhattan, he received a B.A. degree from Fordham and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School.
        From 1939 to the mid-1960's, he practiced law in Manhattan as a general litigator and then as a specialist. He went on to be a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Julian & Glaser before becoming a founding partner, in 1975, of Glaser, Shandell & Blitz.
        He is survived by his wife of 45 years, the former Lorraine Derene, and two daughters, Jan, of Los Angeles and Lynne, of Manhattan.
