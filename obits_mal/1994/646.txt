        Dr. Lester A. Gelb, a former director of clinical services in the Department of Psychiatry and, since 1987, consultant emeritus at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 74 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Since his retirement from Maimonides, Dr. Gelb continued to see patients in his private practice in the Bronx.
        He was born in New Haven, graduated from New York University, received his medical degree at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and trained in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College.
        In the early 1960's, he directed out-patient services for the new Department of Psychiatry at Maimonides and designed a program that allowed patients to be treated without a waiting period. He served as clinical director of the hospital's Community Mental Health Care Center from 1967 to 1977.
        He also served as an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, a consulting psychiatrist at Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home in the Bronx and attending physician at the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center in Brooklyn.
        Dr. Gelb is survived by his wife of 49 years, Lia Ruber Gelb; a son, Daniel L., of Manhattan; a daughter, Judith Gelb Fisher, also of Manhattan; a sister, Vitta G. Zuckerman, of Deerfield, Fla.; and three grandchildren.
