        Robert Sherrod, an author of books on World War II who had been the editor of The Saturday Evening Post and a correspondent in World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 85.
        The cause was emphysema, said Dr. John H. Sherrod, a son.
        Robert Sherrod's 1944 book, "Tarawa: The Story of a Battle," is still in print (through the Admiral Nimitz Foundation). When the book came out, Mr. Sherrod was an associate editor of Time magazine and had covered various phases of the war in the Pacific.
        Tarawa, an atoll of the Gilbert Islands in the western Pacific, was wrested from its Japanese occupiers by United States marines in bitter fighting in 1943. Mr. Sherrod went ashore with the invading marines and stayed until the last Japanese defender was killed or captured.
        His other books include "On to Westward: the Battles of Saipan and Iwo Jima" (1945, Nautical & Aviation), which has been praised as one of the outstanding books of reporting on World War II; and "History of Marine Corps Aviation in World War II" (1952, Nautical & Aviation).
        Mr. Sherrod was also a co-author of the text of "Life's Picture History of World War II" (1950) and of "Apollo Expeditions to the Moon" (1975).
        After covering the Pacific and Far East for Time and Life magazines and later for The Saturday Evening Post, Mr. Sherrod became The Post's managing editor from 1955 to 1962 and its editor in 1962. He went on to be a vice president of the Curtis Publishing Company in 1965 and 1966.
        Robert Lee Sherrod was born and reared in Thomas County, Ga., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Georgia in 1929. After working for newspapers, he joined Time Inc. in 1935, helped set up Time's Washington bureau and went on to cover the Pacific war area for Life as well as Time.
        He married Elizabeth Hudson in 1936 and she died in 1958. His 1961 marriage to Margaret Carson Ruff ended in divorce in 1972. He married Mary Gay Labrot Leonhardt later that year. She died in 1978.
        In addition to his son John, of Pittsburgh, Mr. Sherrod is survived by his companion, Bernice Jacobsen; another son, Robert L. Jr. of Maysville, Ga.; four grandchildren; two great-grandchildren, and a sister, Louise Bassett of Tallahassee, Fla.
