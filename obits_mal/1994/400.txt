        M. Keith Irvine, a writer, editor and publisher known for his expertise on Africa, died on Thursday at his home in Algonac, Mich. He was 69.

        Mr. Irvine (pronounced UR-vin), was born in Ipswich, England, and educated at the University of London, the University of Manchester, the University of Edinburgh and the Sorbonne in Paris. He was a journalist in England before moving to New York in 1952 and becoming the editor of Africa Today and Africa Weekly.

He founded his own publishing company in Algonac in 1975, Reference Publications Inc., which specializes in reference books on Americana, American Indians and Africa as well as medicinal plants and folk games. At his death he was president and editor of the company, which also uses the imprint Encyclopaedia Africana.
        He was the author of "The Rise of the Colored Races" (1970) and the editor of "Encyclopaedia of Indians of the Americas" (1974) and "World Encyclopedia of Black Peoples" (1975).
