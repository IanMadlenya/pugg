        Sol D. Kapelsohn, a leading New Jersey civil-liberties and labor lawyer until he retired seven years ago, died on Wednesday at Chandler Hall Nursing Home in Newtown, Pa., where he had lived for four years. He was 88.
        The cause was old age, said his son, Emanuel Kapelsohn of Bowers, Pa.
        Mr. Kapelsohn was a founder of the New Jersey Civil Liberties Union and was counsel for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the American Newspaper Guild, the Bakery Drivers Union and the Airline Mechanics Union, among other groups.
        He was the senior partner in the former law firm of Kapelsohn, Lerner, Leuchter & Reitman of Newark. He helped to write almost 1,000 pieces of legislation governing union rights, wages and industrial safety.
        One of 12 children of Russian immigrant parents, he worked as a construction laborer during the day and attended New York University Law School at night. He was graduated in 1926. He was a resident of Maplewood, N.J., for 35 years.
        Besides his son, he is survived by two daughters, Marjorie DeStefano of Lawrenceville, N.J., and Lois Etz of Princeton, N.J., and four grandchildren.
