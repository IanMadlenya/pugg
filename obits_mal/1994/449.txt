        Peter Hackes, whose daily radio program for retired Americans, "Mature Focus," has been broadcast by several hundred radio stations for the last seven years, died on Sunday at Georgetown University Hospital. He was 69 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Jessie Hackes.
        Mr. Hackes became the radio voice of the American Association of Retired Persons in 1987 after retiring from a 40-year career as a radio and television correspondent. He initially worked for CBS, then spent 30 years with NBC in Washington.
        Mr. Hackes graduated from Grinnell College and received a master's degree in journalism from the University of Iowa.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Peter, of Seal Beach, Calif.
