        Irving S. Ribicoff, a founder and retired senior partner of the Hartford law firm of Schatz & Schatz, Ribicoff & Kotkin, died on Monday at a Hartford convalescent home. A Hartford resident, he was 79.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Born in New Britain, Conn., Mr. Ribicoff graduated summa cum laude from Williams College and received his law degree from Yale University Law School. In 1941, he and his brother, Abraham A. Ribicoff, the future Connecticut Governor and United States Senator, formed the law firm of Ribicoff & Ribicoff.
        The brothers added David Kotkin to the partnership in 1945. Abraham Ribicoff later withdrew from active practice to pursue a career in politics and government, and the firm merged with Schatz & Schatz in 1978 to become one of the largest firms in the state. Irving Ribicoff retired from the firm in 1986.
        He played an active part in civic and cultural organizations. He also held positions on panels of the bar at the local and state level. From 1964 to 1975 he was president of the Connecticut branch of the Federal Bar Association.
        Besides his brother, a resident of Cornwall, Conn., Mr. Ribicoff's survivors include his wife of 39 years, Belle Krasne Ribicoff, and a daughter, Dara Ribicoff of Hartford.
