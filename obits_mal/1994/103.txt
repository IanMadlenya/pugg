        Abraham S. Braude, a Jewish philanthropic leader in Cincinnati, died there yesterday in the Jewish Hospital. He was 74.
        The cause was complications of cancer, said his son Jonathan P. Braude.
        From 1945 to 1973 he was an executive of several manufacturers including the Gruen Watch Company in Cincinnati and the Hartmann Luggage Company in Racine, Wis. He then became a marketing and management consultant.
        He was a governor of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Cincinnati and served on the boards of many Jewish and Israeli cultural and religious groups.
        Mr. Braude is survived by his wife, Marilynn, a daughter, Marjorie Welling, and a son, Jonathan P., all of Cincinnati, and another son, Dr. Stephen E. Braude of Columbia, Md.
