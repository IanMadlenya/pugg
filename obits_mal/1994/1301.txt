        Jerome Wenig, a labor lawyer who served as a mediator in Connecticut in recent years, died on Sunday while being taken to Norwalk Hospital. He was 71 and lived in Westport, Conn.
        Mr. Wenig, who had been suffering from kidney disease for several years, died of cardiac arrest, said his wife, Mary Moers Wenig.
        Mr. Wenig was an arbitrator and then a mediator in labor disputes involving public school teachers in Connecticut from the mid-1980's until his death. He also taught labor law and collective bargaining at the University of Bridgeport School of Law in the 1980's and early 1990's, and was on its board of advisers.
        He was born in Astoria, Queens, and grew up in Great Neck, L.I., and in Little Neck, Queens. A graduate of Queens College in 1943 and Harvard Law School in 1948, he was a partner in the Manhattan labor-law firm of Mayer, Weiner & Mayer from 1953 to 1968.
        From 1968 to 1985 he was variously general counsel, vice president and a director of the APL Corporation in Great Neck, which produced paper, plastics and vitamins.
        Besides his wife of more than 40 years, his survivors include a daughter, Rabbi Margaret Moers Wenig of Brooklyn; a son, Michael M., of Anchorage; a brother, Dr. Martin Wenig of Port Washington, L.I.; his mother, Anna of Commack, L.I., and three grandchildren.
