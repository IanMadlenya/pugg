        Joseph A. Kaplan, a Russian immigrant who prospered by devising and promoting colored shower curtains, died on Tuesday in Beth Israel Hospital. Mr. Kaplan, who lived in Manhattan, was 98.
        The cause was a stroke, said his son, Harold.
        Mr. Kaplan arrived in New York when he was 5. In the 1920's, while a salesman of bathroom accessories, he hit on the idea of replacing the white duck shower curtains that were customary then with colored fabrics in a variety of designs. To produce them, he founded Joseph A. Kaplan Inc. in 1924.
        At first a novelty item, colored curtains became extremely successful in the late 1920's and 1930's. Mr. Kaplan expanded the line into plastic shower curtains, then vinyl curtains. He eventually expanded his operations into umbrellas, raincoats and furniture. He retired 20 years ago.
        Mr. Kaplan is survived by his companion, Jane Triolo of Manhattan; two sons, Harold M. of Greenwich, Conn., and Arthur M. of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a brother, Harry A. of White Plains, and two sisters, Anna B. Bender of Philadelphia and Virginia Krulik of Riverdale, the Bronx.
