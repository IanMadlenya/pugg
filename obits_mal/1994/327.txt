        Alexei Haieff, a composer whose long life in music reached from Siberia to the United States and finally to Italy, died on Tuesday in San Camillo Hospital in Rome. He was 80.
        The cause was lung congestion and heart failure, hospital officials said.
        Mr. Haieff was an American citizen for 55 years and a prominent composer in New York life in the postwar era. He came to public attention again last year when "Divertimento," a George Balanchine ballet for which he created the music, was revived by the New York City Ballet in its Balanchine Celebration, observing the 10th anniversary of the choreographer's death. Mr. Haieff's work with Balanchine was complemented by a strong friendship with Stravinsky. Many critics found strong traces of Stravinsky's neo-classical style in Mr. Haieff's music. 'His Own Language'
        His Piano Concerto No. 1 enjoyed considerable success in the early 1950's, and he was also known for his three symphonies, "Divertimento" and numerous chamber pieces. Writing in The New York Times in 1961, Harold C. Schonberg discovered "elements of Stravinsky and the dodecaphonists" in his Third Symphony, adding however that "Mr. Haieff has his own language."
        Mr. Haieff was born in Biagoveschensk, Siberia, in 1914. He moved to China with his family when he was 6 and came to the United States in 1932. He studied at the Juilliard School, and then with Nadia Boulanger in Cambridge, Mass., and in Paris. In addition to composing, Mr. Haieff taught extensively, mainly at the State University at Buffalo, at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie-Mellon University) in Pittsburgh, at Brandeis University and at the University of Utah. He settled in Rome 20 years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Sheila.
