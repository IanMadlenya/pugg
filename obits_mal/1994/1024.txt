        DeWitt Asiel Stern, a New York insurance broker, died on Aug. 4 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Stern was chairman of the DeWitt Stern Group, a brokerage in Manhattan that had its roots in a firm founded in 1899 by his father, DeWitt Hayes Stern. He joined the firm in 1932 after graduating from Princeton University.
        During the Depression, he devised policies for small businesses. He also helped to shape the New York State Disability Law. He later made his interest in rare books and numismatics into specialities for his firm.
        He had knowledge of French, German, Italian, Greek and Latin, and volunteered as a teacher of English as a second language for new immigrants, an activity he continued until recently. He also raised funds for Princeton.
        Mr. Stern is survived by his wife of 61 years, Dr. Virginia Fox Stern, an Elizabethan scholar; a son, Jolyon Fox Stern of Manhattan, president of the DeWitt Stern Group; a daughter-in-law, Nelle Nugent, the Broadway producer; and a granddaughter.
