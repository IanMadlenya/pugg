        Norman Howard Beamer, a former chief of the Pennsylvania District of the United States Geological Survey, died on Monday at his home in Harrisburg, Pa. He was 80.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Beamer, a native of Manor, Pa., received a bachelor's degree from Maryville College in Tennessee. He was an elementary school principal in Virginia and a chemist for the Industrial Rayon Corporation before World War II. During the war he served with the Navy in the Pacific theater, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander.
        After the war he joined the Department of the Interior's Geological Survey in Pennsylvania. He became district chemist in the agency's Water Resources Division and developed a network of water monitoring stations in the Delaware Estuary. He was district chief from 1966 until his retirement in 1978.
        Mr. Beamer was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as the Interior Department's representative to the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission, a position he held for six years.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Evelyn Hazlett Beamer; a son, Norman H., of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Andrea B. Barnett of Ithaca, N.Y., and three grandsons.
