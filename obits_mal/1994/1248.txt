        Ira I. Miller, a Long Island builder who was active in Jewish life in the United States and Israel, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        Mr. Miller, who was born in New Haven, received a business degree from Columbia College in 1939. He was a partner in Miller Realty Associates of Glen Cove, L.I., a family concern that developed shopping centers and other commercial properties.
        At his death, he was chairman of the Yeshiva of Central Queens in Flushing and a past chairman of State of Israel Bonds in the New York region. He and his siblings played a role in the growth of Yeshiva University and established the Andrew and Rose Miller Chair in the History of Zionism and Modern Israel.
        Most recently he was helping to create the Open University in Tel Aviv. Other beneficiaries of his philanthropy included American Friends of Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, Pride of Judea Family Mental Health Center of Douglaston, Queens, and Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife of 53 years, Roselyn Wolkoff Miller; two sons, Stephen, of Cape May, N.J., and Dr. Robert J., of Syosset, L.I.; a brother, Leon, of Great Neck; three sisters, Diane Sherman of Manhasset, L.I., Evelyn Slewett of Bay Harbor Island, Fla., and Minnie Lieberman of Forest Hills, Queens, and three grandchildren.
