        John Blair Linn Goodwin, a writer and poet, died last Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. He was 81 and had homes in Manhattan, West Palm Beach, Fla., and the Netherlands Antilles.
        He had suffered a long illness, said Anthony Russo, a friend.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Goodwin was a world traveler who often wrote about the places he visited. "The Idols and the Prey" (1952) was a novel about Haiti; "A View From Fuji" (1963) was a novella about Japan, and "The Pleasant Pirate" (1940) was a children's book.
        He published poetry and one of his many short stories, "The Cocoon," was included in a 1947 anthology of best American short stories. He also was an amateur painter.
        Mr. Goodwin is survived by his brother, Henry Sage Goodwin of Avon, Conn., an architect and painter.
