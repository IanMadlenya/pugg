        Michael J. Kochel, a guard on Fordham University's famous football teams of the 1930's who later became an Air Force colonel, died Thursday at his home in Bellevue, Neb. He was 78.
        The cause apparently was a heart attack, said his son, Michael P. Kochel.
        Kochel was a reserve on the 1936 team whose steadfast line was called the Seven Blocks of Granite, and he was a starter on the 1937 and 1938 teams. He later played for the Chicago Cardinals in the National Football League.
        During World War II, he was a heavy-bomber pilot and flew B-17's in Europe. He pursued a military career after the end of the war and retired from the United States Air Force as a colonel in 1969.
        He is survived by a daughter, Susan Thornton of Omaha, and his son, who lives in Olney, Md.
