        Paul C. Echols, a musicologist, conductor and director of the Mannes Camerata, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 50.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said Charles Kaufman, the dean of the Mannes College of Music.
        Mr. Echols was an expert in medieval music. He directed the Mannes Camerata, the college's resident early-music ensemble, and developed the school's early-music program. He was also the head of the Mannes opera program, and in the last 12 years he directed or conducted 12 Baroque operas and six Renaissance theater pieces, many for their American premieres. He had an interest in contemporary American music, as well, and mounted several modern operas at Mannes.
        Mr. Echols was born in California, and spent his childhood in Latin America, where as a member of the choir of an Anglican cathedral school in Havana, he was exposed to such early composers as Tallis and Byrd. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Duke University and did graduate work at New York University, where he became the director of the Collegium Musicum in 1976.
        He became the executive editor of the Charles Ives Society, the house editor for contemporary music at Peer-Southern music publishers and the director of publications and a vice president of G. Schirmer, the music-publishing company.
        He is survived by his wife, Cassandra; his mother, Nancy Echols; his father, Chandler Echols; a stepmother, Monique Echols; three sisters, Tika, Jill and Georgia, and a brother, Chandler.
