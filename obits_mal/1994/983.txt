        Leo Guzik, a retired lawyer who was active in Jewish causes, died on Saturday at the Belmont Manor Nursing Home in Belmont, Mass. He was 90.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Guzik, formerly of New York City, graduated from Fordham University in 1935. He was a founding partner of the Wall Street law firm of Guzik & Boukstein. His corporate clientele focused on the textile industry, and he also served as counsel to Israeli businesses and organizations. Those included the Jewish Agency, Hadassah and Zim Lines.
        He was a supporter of the American Friends of the Hebrew University and a past member of the university's board of governors. To encourage American students to study and work in Israel, he endowed a Guzik Travel Scholarship at Antioch College four years ago.
        Mr. Guzik is survived by his wife of 63 years, Pearl Robbins Guzik, now of Newton, Mass.; a son, Michael, of Griggstown, N.J.; a daughter, Tamara G. Bliss of Newton, and three grandchildren.
