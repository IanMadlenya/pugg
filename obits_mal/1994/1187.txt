        Haywood Henry, an important saxophonist and clarinetist who was one of the last of the living members of the 'Bama State Collegians, died on Sept. 15 at his home in the Bronx. He was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Diane Washington.
        In the early 1930's, Mr. Henry attended the Alabama State Teachers College in Montgomery, where he joined up with Dud Bascomb and Erskine Hawkins in the 'Bama State Collegians. They became the nucleus for the Erskine Hawkins band, which made its name at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem.
        Mr. Henry performed with the band into the 1950's, and his big sound on baritone saxophone -- his nickname was "the Gentle Monster" -- and improvisational abilities helped make the band a success.
        Mr. Henry was one of the few big-band musicians to survive the rock-and-roll onslaught, and in the 1950's, when big bands had mostly fallen out of favor, he entered the rock-and-roll recording studios, often appearing with the tenor saxophonist Sam (the Man) Taylor, another big-band veteran.
        Mr. Henry played on thousands of recordings for Atlantic, Groove and other labels.
        In the late 1950's and early 60's, he performed with Reuben Phillips at the Apollo Theater in Harlem and with the band leaders Lucky Millinder, Wilbur de Paris, Snub Mosley and others. In the late 1960's he began an association with Earl Hines, and in the early 70's he worked on Broadway, playing in "Ain't Misbehavin'."
        In 1983, he recorded an album, "The Gentle Monster" (Uptown), and in the last 10 years he worked regularly with the Duke's Men and the Harlem Jazz and Blues band.
        He recently performed in Denmark.
        In addition to his daughter, of Denver, he is survived by his wife, Arvenell, and a son, Fabian, of New Jersey.
