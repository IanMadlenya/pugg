        Elmer E. Klaus, an authority on the viscosity of fluids, died on Tuesday at Centre Community Hospital in State College, Pa. Dr. Klaus, who lived in State College, was 73.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        For 35 years Dr. Klaus taught at Pennsylvania State University, from which he received a doctorate in chemistry, retiring in 1982 as a professor of chemical engineering.
        Dr. Klaus's research centered on tribology, the study of the effects of friction on moving machine parts and of ways to avoid those effects. He helped develop Penn State's petroleum refining laboratory, and was an adviser to several Federal scientific agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; a daughter, Diane Horton of Memphis; a son, Dennis R., of McMinnville, Ore., and two sisters, Leotta Haas of Lancaster, Pa., and Norma Patterson of Ligonier, Pa.
