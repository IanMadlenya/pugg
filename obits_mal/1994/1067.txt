        T. Charles Lee, the retired organist and choirmaster of the Brick Presbyterian Church in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at the Palm Beach Hospice Center, Palm Beach, Fla. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Shpresa Lee.
        Mr. Lee was organist and choirmaster of the Brick Church for 25 years before retiring in 1985. He was also music director and conductor of the Oratorio Society of New York and director of choral activities at Lehman College of the City University of New York.
        Mr. Lee graduated from Oberlin College and received master's and doctoral degrees from the Union Theological Seminary School of Sacred Music.
        He is survived by his wife, of Palm Beach.
