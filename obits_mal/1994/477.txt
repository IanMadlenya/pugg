        Carlo Rossi, who became a television and radio personality promoting the Gallo jug wines that were named for him, died on Wednesday in Modesto, Calif. He was 90.
        His family said he had been ill for a long time.
        Mr. Rossi's down-home awkwardness on camera made him a popular personality in the 20 years he promoted Gallo's Carlo Rossi, the leading jug wine in the United States. He was involved in the wine business for more than 60 years, working in marketing and winery management throughout California.
        A distant relative of the Gallos, Mr. Rossi joined the E & J Gallo Winery in Modesto in 1953, just as the winery was beginning to distribute its products nationally. His major job was helping Ernest Gallo, chairman of the winery, open new markets.
        Carlo Rossi wines were introduced in 1955 in California and Nevada. In the early 1970's, Mr. Gallo decided to make Carlo Rossi a national brand and began looking for someone with a distinctive voice for radio commercials.
        He chose Mr. Rossi, who talked about the wine named for him in his own words.
        Mr. Rossi is survived by his wife, Mary Rossi; two daughters, Francine Filice of San Francisco and Marlene Zullo of Oakland; four stepchildren, Lee Dovichi of Stockton, Calif., and Larry Dovichi, Jim Dovichi and Claire Simi, all of Modesto; a sister, Rose Tyter of Redwood City, Calif.; 16 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
