        Lord Tranmire, a prominent British Conservative who opposed Britain's membership in the Common Market, died Jan. 17. He was 90.
        Lord Tranmire, who was born Robin Turton, was an extraordinarily durable Member of Parliament, for the Thirsk area in North Yorkshire, from 1929 until he retired from his seat in 1974. He liked to say that a member should be true to "principles first, country second, then party and constituents."
        He was a joint parliamentary Under Secretary to the Foreign Office in 1954 and 1955 and Minister of Health from 1955 to 1957. He was made a life peer, a baron, in 1974.
        By 1962 he had become a leading Conservative Party opponent of British entry in the Common Market, campaigning instead for increased trade inside the Commonwealth. After Britain joined the Common Market in 1973, he became the leader of a group that campaigned for his country to pull out.
        A scion of an old Yorkshire family, he presided over the 800-year-old family seat, Upsall Castle, at Thirsk. He was educated at Eton and at Balliol College at Oxford and became a barrister as well as a landowner.
        He is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Ruby Scott, two sons and a daughter.
