        Brig. Gen. Robert M. Williams, a retired Army lawyer, died on Tuesday at his home on Hilton Head Island, S.C. He was 79.
        The cause was heart disease, said his daughter Karen Williams.
        General Williams retired from the Army as Assistant Judge Advocate General for Civil Law, based in Washington, in 1969. He went on to practice law in Savannah, Ga.
        A native of Valdosta, Ga., he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1939 and served in Europe in World War II. He was severely wounded in Italy. After the war, he earned a law degree from the University of Virginia and began his legal career with the Army.
        In addition to his daughter Karen, of Simsbury, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Jeanne; another daughter, Barbara Jean Wakefield of Atlanta; a sister, Caroline W. Gaffney of Bayonet Point, Fla.; a brother, George W., of Savannah, and three granddaughters.
