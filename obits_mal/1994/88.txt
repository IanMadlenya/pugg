        Duncan C. Gray, a former executive of Kidder, Peabody & Company, died on Tuesday at his home in Pelham, N.Y.. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jean.
        Mr. Gray retired from Kidder, Peabody in 1984 after 20 years' service with the New York investment banking and brokerage firm. He had been a member of its board and head of its public finance department.
        He graduated from Duke University in 1940 and flew 35 missions over Europe as a navigator with the Eighth Air Force during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife; four sons, Duncan Jr., of Pelham, Robert L. and Russell F., both of Los Angeles, and Kenneth H., of Pelham, Ala., and two brothers, John T., of Wellington, Fla., and Dr. James G., of Elmira, N.Y.
