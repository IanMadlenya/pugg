        Bernard Benstock, a professor of English at the University of Miami and an authority on James Joyce, died on July 14 at his summer home in South Egremont, Mass. He was 64 and also lived in Coral Gables, Fla.
        His death, in his sleep, was apparently caused by a heart attack, said Kevin Finnerty of Finnerty & Stevens Funeral Homes in Great Barrington, Mass.
        Professor Benstock was editor of the "James Joyce Literary Supplement" and a co-founder of the International James Joyce Foundation, of which he was president for eight years.
        He is survived by his wife, Shari, a University of Miami professor who is an authority on Edith Wharton; two daughters, Kevin, of Cincinnati, and Erika, of Phoenix, and a stepson, Eric, of Chicago
