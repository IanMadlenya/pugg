        Jose Teodoro Moscoso, a Manhattan lawyer most recently associated with law firm of Baker & McKenzie, died last Wednesday at his family's home in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was complications from AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Moscoso, a native of Ponce, Puerto Rico, graduated from Harvard University and received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1965. He specialized in international commercial transactions, a subject about which he wrote frequently.
        He also was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. He worked in the Baker firm's New York office from 1984 to 1991.
        He was on the board of directors of El Museo del Barrio and of Boricua College, both in New York City.
        Mr. Moscoso is survived by his mother, Gloria Moscoso, and a sister, Margarita Moscoso, both of San Juan. His father, Teodoro Moscoso, a former United States Ambassador to Venezuela and a leader of the Alliance for Progress in the 1960's, died in 1992 at the age of 81.
