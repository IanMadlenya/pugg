        Philip Bosakowski, a playwright, died on Sunday at Middlesex Memorial Hospital in Middletown, Conn. He was 47 and lived in Portland, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Wesleyan University in Middletown, where Mr. Bosakowski was a visiting playwright at one time.
        Mr. Bosakowski's plays include "Crossin' the Line" and "Chopin in Space." In a review of a 1985 production of "Chopin in Space," at the Ark Theater Company in Manhattan, D. J. R. Bruckner of The New York Times called Mr. Bosakowski "a cunning humorist."
        "There are enough verbal, visual and musical jokes to keep you thinking for a long time about passion, inspiration, politics, religion, history and -- since this is an affectionate tribute to the playwright's Polish origins -- nationality," Mr. Bruckner wrote.
        A recent work, "Nixon Apologizes to the Nation," is to receive its premiere in New York at Primary Stages next spring.
        Mr. Bosakowski taught play writing at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., and had been a visiting playwright at Princeton University and Dartmouth College, as well as at Wesleyan. He was a member of New Dramatists, an organization that encourages and develops playwrights, and the O'Neill National Playwrights Conference.
        He also wrote for film and television.
        Surviving are his wife, Gay Smith, of Portland; his father, Frank, and stepmother, Anne, of Willingboro, N.J.; a sister, Mary, of New York, and two brothers, James, of Cambridge, Md., and Paul, of Atlanta.
