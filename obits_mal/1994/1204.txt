        S. Burns Weston, a retired lawyer and civic leader who worked in the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, died on Friday at his home in Keene, N.Y., in the Adirondack Mountains. He was 90.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Weston began to practice law in 1929 in Cleveland. In 1935, he joined the Roosevelt Administration, serving as an official of the National Youth Administration in Ohio and, later, in Washington. From 1942 to 1944, he served on the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission in the State Department. In 1944, he returned to Ohio to become the executive director of the postwar planning panel of the Greater Cleveland Development Council. He resumed his career as a lawyer in 1946.
        For the next 30 years, he was a senior partner and chief litigator in the Cleveland firm of Weston, Hurd, Fallon, Paisley & Howley. Retiring in 1976, he moved to Keene but continued to practice, describing himself as a "country lawyer." In the late 1970's, he was a member of the New York State Governor's Committee on Sentencing.
        A native of Yellow Springs, Ohio, Mr. Weston graduated from Antioch College. He then studied for a year at the Sorbonne in Paris before earning a law degree at Yale University in 1929.
        He was a former trustee and chairman of Antioch College and a director of the Yale Law School Fund. He had also been president of the Cleveland Bar Association, through which he worked to improve legal services for the poor. A Democrat, he headed the Ohio Volunteers for Adlai E. Stevenson in the former Illinois Governor's two campaigns for President in the 1950's.
        Mr. Weston is survived by his wife of 65 years, Simonne Humphrey Weston, whom he married when he was a graduate student in Paris; a son, Burns H., of Iowa City; a daughter, Monique Weston Clague of Silver Spring, Md., and four grandchildlren.
