        William Duff-Griffin, an actor who frequently appeared in productions by the New York Shakespeare Festival, died on Nov. 13 at the Manhattan home of his companion, the actor Robert Joy. He was 54.
        The cause was prostate cancer, Mr. Joy said.
        Mr. Duff-Griffin was a versatile actor who was equally at home in Shakespeare and avant-garde works. He first became involved in the theater in the mid 1960's at La Mama, as a production manager and then as a performer in several productions by Tom Eyen and Andrei Serban. Among the plays in which he appeared were "The Greek Trilogy," "The Good Woman of Szechuan" and "The Cherry Orchard" at Lincoln Center and many New York Shakespeare Festival productions, including "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night" and "The Taming of the Shrew." He also appeared in several movies, including "The Hudsucker Proxy" and "Basic Instinct," and was seen on television in "Murphy Brown, "The Kennedys of Massachusetts" and other programs.
        Mr. Duff-Griffin, whose original name was William Joseph Duffy, was born in New York City. He worked briefly as an economic analyst before changing careers.
        He is survived by Mr. Joy.
