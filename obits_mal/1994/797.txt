        Stasys Lozoraitis, Lithuania's Ambassador to the United States from 1991 to 1993, died on Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, a former aide, Victor Nakas, said yesterday. He was 69. He lived in Rome and was on a private visit from Vilnius to the United States.
        The cause was liver failure, said Mr. Nakas, who was on Mr. Lozoraitis's staff in Washington.
        At his death, Mr. Lozoraitis (his name is pronounced stahs-EES law-zaw-RYE-tis) had been Ambassador to Italy for eight months. He was the son and namesake of another Lithuanian diplomat, who was a Foreign Minister of Lithuania while it was independent between the two World Wars and who died in 1983.
        The younger Mr. Lozoraitis was an unsuccessful candidate in Presidential elections in Lithuania in February 1993. The country became free in 1991 from the Soviet Union, which had taken it over in 1940. Running as an independent, he came in well behind the winner, Algirdas Brazauskas, a former head of the Lithuanian Communist Party.
        Mr. Lozoraitis was born in Berlin, where his father was stationed, and was educated in Lithuania, Germany and Italy. After the Soviet Union took over Lithuania, he remained outside its borders and went on to head the anti-Communist Lithuanian legation in Washington.
        Mr. Lozoraitis is survived by his wife, the former Daniela D'Ercole; and a brother, Kazys Lozoraitis, who is Lithuania's Ambassador to the Vatican..
