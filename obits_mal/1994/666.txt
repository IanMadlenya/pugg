        James F. Hoch, a partner in the Manhattan law firm of Shearman & Sterling, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, said Michael E. Zega, his companion.
        Mr. Hoch joined the law firm in 1982 and two years ago became a partner specializing in taxation. He graduated from Fordham University and received a law degree from New York University in 1978.
        He is survived by his mother, Ann Hoch, and a brother, Thomas, both of Brooklyn, and a sister, Catherine Hoch of Manhattan.
