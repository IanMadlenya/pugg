        Denison Ray of Malden Bridge, N.Y., a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society who practiced civil rights law for almost 30 years, died on Jan. 6 in Ellis Hospital in Schenectady. He was 62.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Michael Hampden, a friend.
        For the last decade, Mr. Ray was the executive director and chief counsel of the Legal Aid Society of Northeastern New York in Albany. Previously He had served with legal-assistance groups in St. Louis, Portland, Me., Durham, N.C., and Raleigh, N.C.
        In the 1960's Mr. Ray worked with the Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Law in Mississippi representing black plaintiffs in local courts.
        Mr. Ray received bachelor's and master's degrees from Auburn University and in 1961 graduated from New York University Law School. He was a lawyer with several Manhattan law firms before practicing civil rights law full time.
        Among Mr. Ray's survivors is a son, Daniel Ray of Providence, R.I., and a daughter, Belinda Ray of Thetford, Vt..
