        George Sturgis Coffin, a prolific publisher and writer of books on bridge and other games, died on March 12 at Waltham-Weston Hospital near his home in Belmont, Mass. He was 90.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his executor, Frederic Crafts 3d.
        Mr. Coffin, who graduated from Harvard College in 1928, broke ground in 1932 with "Endplays at Bridge Explained." He published about 200 books, written by himself and others, on bridge, poker, cribbage and other games. He also wrote about fungi, on which he was an authority.
        He is survived by a daughter, Harriette Johnson of Shelburne Falls, Mass., and two grandchildren.
