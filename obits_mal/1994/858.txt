        William Edward Schevill, an authority on whales and the sounds they make, died on Monday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. He was 88 and lived in Concord.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Barbara.
        At his death, Mr. Schevill had the title of scientist emeritus at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where he had begun working in 1943, technically retiring in 1985.
        A recent article in the institution's publication "Woods Hole Currents" called him "one of the world's most innovative whale biologists and an undisputed pioneer in the field of whale sounds." Recording Whales
        A senior staff member at the institution, Dr. William A. Watkins, said yesterday: "His work in the biology and bio-acoustics of whales, porpoises and seals has provided the basis for much of the scientific work that is now being done on the acoustic behavior of these animals. He did the first recordings of underwater sounds and had the insight to extrapolate from these recordings to their uses."
        In 1949, Mr. Schevill and his wife, a mammalogist, made what the institution calls an unprecedented recording, with a dictating machine, of sounds made by beluga whales in the Saguenay River in Quebec.
        "This whale had a reputation among the old sailors, who called it names like the 'sea canary,' " he once recalled. "It was only the biologists who said this is impossible, all whales are mute. We went up and found these whales were chatterboxes."
        Mr. Schevill was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Manhattan and St. Louis. He graduated from Harvard College in 1927 and earned a master's degree in paleontology from Harvard. His early work was in paleontology, and he had longstanding ties with the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard.
        Besides his wife of 56 years, the former Barbara Lawrence, Mr. Schevill is survived by a daughter, Lee, of Acton, Mass., and a son, Edward, of Tucson, Ariz.
