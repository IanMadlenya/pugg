        Jack Spector, a disk jockey and radio personality in the New York metropolitan area for 33 years, died on Tuesday after apparently suffering a heart attack while broadcasting popular music on WHLI in Garden City, L.I. He was 65 and lived in Brooklyn.
        Jane E. Bartsch, vice president of the station, said Mr. Spector collapsed in the studio while he was on the air and was taken by ambulance to Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, where he was declared dead.
        "Jack was playing 'I'm in the Mood for Love' with vocals by Louis Prima and Keely Smith when it happened," Ms. Bartsch said. She said that when the station went silent, employees rushed into the studio and found him on the floor. One of the Good Guys
        Mr. Spector began working as a disk jockey in New York in 1961 at radio station WMCA, where he was a member of a group of broadcasting personalities called the Good Guys. He labeled himself Your Main Man Jake and usually closed his shows saying, "Look out street, here I come!"
        He switched to WHN in 1972, then for nine years was the host of the "Saturday Night Sock Hop" on WCBS-FM. He also worked for a brief period as the host of a sports talk show for WNBC.
        Mr. Spector broke into broadcasting in Martinsburg, W.Va., in 1955, then worked for stations in Albany, Providence, R.I., and Chicago before returning to New York. Born and raised in Brooklyn, he attended Brooklyn College and had a brief tryout as a minor-league baseball player with the Brooklyn Dodgers organization. He served in the United States Army in Korea.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn, of Brooklyn; three daughters, Cheri Mellone and Nancy Bunnicelli of Staten Island and Laurie Spector of Manhattan, and a sister, Tesse Gesser of Manalapan, N.J.
