        Walter L. Lingle Jr., an executive vice president of the Procter & Gamble Company from 1954 to 1969, died on Wednesday at the Deupree-St. Luke Retirement Community in Cincinnati. He was 86.
        The cause was a stroke, his daughter Susan Moeller said.
        Mr. Lingle joined P.&G. in 1931 and became sales-promotion manager in 1939 and manager of foreign business in 1945. He retired in 1969.
        In 1962, Mr. Lingle took a leave to be deputy administrator of the Agency for International Development. He resigned after three months in a dispute over managing foreign aid. Later he was deputy associate administrator for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for two years before returning to P.&G.
        He graduated from Davidson College in Davidson, N.C., in 1928.
        In addition to Mrs. Moeller, of Yarmouthport, Mass., Mr. Lingle is survived by a son, John, of Neshanic Station, N.J., and another daughter, Judith Ryan of South Nyack, N.Y.
