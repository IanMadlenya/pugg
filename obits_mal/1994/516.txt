        Andrew Paul Zoob, a drummer and the founder of a booking service for musicians, died on March 30 while on vacation in Paris. He was 46.
        The cause was septic shock, said his wife, Carol Maryan, an architect.
        Mr. Zoob, who preferred the name Andy, was the leader of the Andy Zoob Orchestra, which he founded in 1990 after 22 years as a drummer on Broadway. Among the shows for which he played were "Evita," "A Chorus Line" and "42d Street." His company, Zoob Productions, books performers and provides other music services for corporate and private events. Both the band and company are to continue operating, his wife said.
        He was a member of the Peter Nero Trio for three years and toured with Marvin Hamlisch and Eartha Kitt, among others.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Nathan; his mother, Ina, of Seacliff, L.I.; and a sister, Liz, of Boston.
