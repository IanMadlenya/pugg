        Soulima Stravinsky, a composer, pianist and the youngest son of Igor Stravinsky, died yesterday at the Emerald Oaks Nursing Home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 84.
        The cause was respiratory failure after a long illness, said his son, John.
        Sviatoslav Soulima Stravinsky was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Sept. 23, 1910, and was reared in Paris, where he studied the piano with Isidor Philipp and music theory and composition with Nadia Boulanger.
        He made his Paris debut in 1934, and was at first a specialist in his father's piano music. Between 1934 and 1938, he toured with several Stravinsky works, including the Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments, the Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra and the Concerto for Two Solo Pianos, which he recorded with his father as the other soloist in 1938.
        When Igor Stravinsky moved to the United States in 1939, Soulima joined the French army and remained in Europe for nine more years. When he moved to the United States in 1948, he settled briefly in Hollywood and New York, and gave several performances of the Capriccio with his father conducting. But he also performed Scarlatti, Mozart and other composers, and edited editions of the Mozart Piano Concertos, for which he composed cadenzas.
        He joined the faculty of the University of Illinois School of Music in 1950, and taught piano there until 1978. Two of his faculty recital recordings were recently issued by Centaur Records, which has also released recordings of several of his compositions, including his three string quartets and a cello sonata.
        In addition to his son, of Bellport, L.I.., he is survived by his wife, Francoise, and a sister, Milene Marion, of Woodland Hills, Calif.
