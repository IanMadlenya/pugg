        Edward P. McGrath, a corporate communications specialist and former newspaper reporter, died on Tuesday at his home in Weston, Conn. He was 64.
        The cause was melanoma, said his wife, Phyllis Scher McGrath.
        Mr. McGrath, a native of Manhattan, graduated from New York University and worked for The New York Herald Tribune in the 1950's. He was director of corporate communications for the Kennecott Copper Corporation until the company was acquired by the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) in 1982.
        For the last 12 years, he was president of McGrath Associates of Weston, a full-range communications company dealing primarily with annual reports and other periodic publications for corporate clients and trade associations.
        Mr. McGrath was a highly decorated veteran of the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Service Cross, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star. He continued in the Army Reserve and retired a few years ago with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
