        Harry Winthrop Fowler, a retired president and chairman of Fiduciary Trust Company International, an investment management concern based in Manhattan, died on Thursday at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London, Conn. A former resident of Katonah, N.Y., he was 73 and lived in Stonington, Conn.
        He had been ill for a long time, his family said.
        Mr. Fowler was born in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard College. After World War II broke out in Europe, he volunteered for the British Army and, as an officer in the King's Royal Rifles, took part in heavy combat.
        In 1947 he joined what was then the Fiduciary Trust Company of New York as an investment officer. He was elected president in 1960 and took the additional post of board chairman three years later. He retired from those positions in 1982 but continued as chairman of the executive committee until 1985 and as a director until two years ago.
        Under his stewardship the company grew to manage $26 billion for individuals and institutions. It also outgrew New York, adding offices in Washington, Los Angeles, Miami, London, Geneva and Hong Kong. In the 1980's the company dropped New York from its name and substituted International to reflect its international clients and branches.
        Mr. Fowler is survived by his wife, Emily O'Connor Tucker Fowler, whom he married in 1980. Also surviving are two daughters and two sons by his previous marriage, to Grace Montgomery Fowler, which ended in divorce. They are Cecily W. Fowler of South Salem, N.Y., Angela W. Fowler of New York City, Harry S. W. Jr., of Anchorage, Alaska, and Lucius L., of Minneapolis. Mr. Fowler is also survived by a sister, Pamela F. Furze of Sussex, England; five stepchildren, and 21 grandchildren.
