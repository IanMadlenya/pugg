        Joseph Goto, an Abstract Expressionist sculptor known for welded steel works, died on Jan. 18 at his home in Pawtucket, R.I. He was 79.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Goto, who was born in Hilo, Hawaii, in 1916, learned the craft of welding while working for the Army during World War II. He attended the Art Institute of Chicago in the late 1940's and had his first show at the Frumkin Gallery in Chicago in 1956. His first exhibition in New York was at the Stephen Radich Gallery in the early 1960's; his last was at the Zabriskie Gallery in 1973.
        His works, which ranged from table-top pieces to monumental outdoor sculptures, continued a tradition of improvisational welded composition started by David Smith.
        Over the years he held teaching positions at the University of Michigan, Brandeis University, Carnegie-Mellon University and the Rhode Island School of Design, which mounted a retrospective of his work in 1971.
        His work is represented in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art and the Rhode Island School of Design.
        He is survived by his wife, June; a daughter, Joji; a son, Kai, and four grandchildren, all of Pawtucket; and a brother, Byron, of New York City.
