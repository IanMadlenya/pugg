        In 1933, he began a lifelong research project on the career of Adah Isaacs Menken, the 19th-century American actress. His biography of her in 1947 was an account of her achievements as an actress, dancer and belle of the Nevada territory and the American frontier.
        Last year, he put together a series of eight sketches and satires by Mark Twain, consisting of columns written in 1864, when Twain was a reporter for The Territorial Enterprise of Virginia City, Nev. It was then that Samuel Clemens began to use the Twain nom de plume.
        Mr. Lesser is survived by his wife, Frances, of Washington; two sons, Lawrence M., of Rockville, Md., and Howard M., of Bethesda, Md; a brother, Dr. Arthur J. Lesser of Washington, and four grandchildren.
