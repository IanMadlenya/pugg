        Ivan Lyons, who wrote the novel "Someone Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe" with his wife, Nan, died on Aug. 18 at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 59 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a widespread infection, said his wife.
        Mr. Lyons was born in New York City, where he graduated from the High School of Performing Arts and earned a degree in film writing from City College. After doing graduate work in film writing at Boston University, he returned to New York and worked as a reporter for Show Business, a reader for the Scott Meredith Literary Agency and an advertising and sales manager for Plenum Publishing. In 1965, he started his own publishing company, Science Associates.
        To entertain themselves on a summer vacation, he and his wife decided to write a comic murder mystery. Mr. Lyons, who was dieting at the time, decided to make the murderer a deranged dieter who stalks a series of celebrity chefs. "Someone Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe" was published in 1976. The 1978 film adaptation, "Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?," starred George Segal, Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Morley.
        Mr. Lyons also collaborated with his wife on the novels "Champagne Blues" (1979), "Sold" (1982), "The President Is Coming to Lunch" (1988) and "Someone Is Killing the Great Chefs of America" (1993).
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Samantha, of Los Angeles.
