        Horace Collins, senior vice president and assistant general counsel of Home Box Office, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said Robert Del Deo, his companion.
        Mr. Collins was responsible for overseeing all legal aspects of HBO's feature-film financing, licensing, programming and distribution, as well as HBO's West Coast programming operations, including the financing and production of HBO pictures and other original programming.
        He joined HBO in 1979 as an associate counsel after being an associate in the Manhattan-based law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel.
        Mr. Collins was formerly a member of the board of the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, and was active in Los Angeles in Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.
        Born in Atlanta, he received a law degree from Harvard and an M.A. in communications from Stanford University.
        In addition to his companion, Mr. Del Deo, he is survived by his mother, Helen Collins of Atlanta.
