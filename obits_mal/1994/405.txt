        Jack Sears, who served on President Clinton's transition team dealing with AIDS issues, died on March 1 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. A resident of Santa Fe since 1988, he was 40.
        The cause was complications of AIDS, said his companion, Rich Cress.
        A native of Port Arthur, Tex., Mr. Sears graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Tex., where he also earned a master's degree in education. He taught in public schools in Texas and worked for a fund-raising concern in Manhattan for 10 years before moving to New Mexico.
        In Santa Fe, he was the director of resources and development for the Visiting Nurse Service for northern New Mexico. He was also Gov. Bruce King's representative on the state's AIDS task force.
        Besides Mr. Cress, Mr. Sears is survived by his parents, L. A. and Viola Grace Sears of Dallas; two brothers, Lonnie and Mark, both of Dallas, and a sister, Suzy Stevens of Plano, Tex.
