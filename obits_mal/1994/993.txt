        Mervin M. Jules, a graphic artist, painter and teacher, died last Friday at his son's summer home in Provincetown, Mass. He was 82 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        He died after a long illness, said his daughter Gabriel Jules Zepecki.
        Mr. Jules was born in Baltimore and studied art there and at the Art Students League in New York. He had his first solo show at the Hudson D. Walker Gallery in New York in 1937 and thereafter exhibited frequently, both in the United States and abroad. A realist whose work often dealt with social themes, he was especially prolific as a printmaker. From 1945 to 1970, he taught at Smith College, where he became head of the art department. From 1970 until he retired in 1980, he headed the art department at City College.
        Mr. Jules's work is in many public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
        Mr. Jules's wife, Rita, died in 1974.
        In addition to his daughter, of Fairfax, Va., he is survived by a brother, Charles, of Pikesville, Md.; a son, Rick, of Milwaukee and Provicetown; another daughter, Hideko Morita of Forest Hills, Queens, and three grandchildren.
