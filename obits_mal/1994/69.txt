        Stanley Adams, a lyricist who was president of Ascap for 24 years, died yesterday at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He lived in Great Neck, L.I., and was 86.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Berenice Adams.
        Mr. Adams, a native of Manhattan who earned a law degree at New York University in 1929, became a songwriter after working on varsity theatrical productions at N.Y.U. as an undergraduate. While he was still in law school, his first song, "Rollin' Down the River," written in collaboration with Fats Waller, became a hit after being introduced by Guy Lombardo.
        Through the years, Mr. Adams wrote lyrics to melodies by Hoagy Carmichael, Ray Henderson, Victor Herbert, Oscar Levant, Sigmund Romberg and Max Steiner. His best-known lyric, "What a Diff'rence a Day Made," was a hit in four different renditions: by the Dorsey Brothers (1934), Andy Russell (1944), Dinah Washington (1959) and Esther Phillips (1975). On occasion, the tense of the word "made" in the original lyrics has been changed to "makes."
        Mr. Adams joined Ascap -- the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers -- in 1934 and was its president from 1953 to 1956. He was again elected to the presidency in 1959; subsequently, he was re-elected to the one-year post annually through 1980.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Adams is survived by two stepsons, John Levin of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Andrew Levin of Great Neck, and a grandson, Adam Hammil of Boston.
