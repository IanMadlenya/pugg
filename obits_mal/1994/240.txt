        Bertram L. Clarke, a prominent designer of art books and typography, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        He died from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said Steven J. Abramson, a friend.
        Mr. Clarke was born in Richmond and graduated from Johns Hopkins University. He worked as a printer in Baltimore and served in the Coast Guard during World War II.
        In 1946, he came to New York City and became a designer at Limited Editions Club. Later, he worked as a freelance designer with David Jacques Way on the typography and design of the Frick Collection's 12-volume catalogue. In 1953, the two men went into business together as Clarke & Way, Inc. The company was dissolved in 1970. Mr. Way died last Friday.
        Mr. Clarke then joined the A. Colish printing company, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., remaining until he retired in 1987, when he became a consultant. A retrospective of his work was held that year at the New York Public Library.
        Mr. Clarke's talents were much in demand in the art world. He designed catalogues for David Rockefeller, Paul Mellon, Jayne Wrightsman and Laughlin Phillips. And he designed and printed the folio edition "Georgia O'Keeffe" published by Viking. He also designed the catalogue of "Georgia O'Keeffe, Arts and Letters," for the National Gallery of Art.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Barudin; three daughters, Wendy Clarke of Topanga, Calif.; Janet Clarke DeWitt of Kerhonkson, N.Y., and Mary Clarke of Manhattan, and one grandchild.
