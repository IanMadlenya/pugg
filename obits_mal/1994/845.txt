        Peter Campbell Brown, a New York lawyer who was a former New York City corporation counsel and a former Justice Department official, died yesterday at United Hospital Medical Center in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.
        The cause was cardiorespiratory failure, said his son Peter C. Jr., and he had been suffering from osteomyelitis.
        Mr. Brown practiced civil, criminal and corporate law in Manhattan over the years, and his clients included Sugar Ray Robinson, Vince Lombardi and other sports figures. He practiced on his own from 1978 into the 1990's, after being of counsel to Winer, Neuburger & Sive from 1972 to 1978; a partner in Brown, Carlino & Emmanuel from 1965 to 1972, and a partner in Manning, Hollinger & Shea from 1958 to 1965.
        He was corporation counsel, the city's chief lawyer, from 1955 to 1958 and the city's commissioner of investigation in 1954 and 1955. He held both posts under Mayor Robert F. Wagner, a fellow Democrat and close friend.
        Once, when Mr. Brown was criticized as corporation counsel in connection with a purchase of land by the city, Mayor Wagner declared that no one had challenged Mr. Brown's "integrity as a lawyer and as a man."
        From 1947 to 1950, he was successively first assistant in the criminal division of the United States Justice Department, executive assistant to the United States Attorney General and special assistant to the Attorney General.
        He was named by President Harry S. Truman to the Subversive Activities Control Board in 1950 and was its chairman in 1952 and 1953. He presided at hearings that were preliminary to an order requiring the Communist Party to register as an organization seeking to overthrow the United States.
        Mr. Brown was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Bay Ridge and received an A.B. in 1935 and an LL.B. in 1938, both from Fordham University. He received a doctorate in law from St. Bonaventure University in 1951.
        He practiced law in Brooklyn from 1938 to 1941. During World War II, he was an Army officer, took part in the Battle of the Bulge and became a friend of the future Mayor Wagner, who was also in uniform. After the war, in 1946, Mr. Brown was an assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in Brooklyn.
        Over the years, he was on the boards of directors of Federation Bank and Trust Company, Thomas Publishing Company, St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind., and other companies and organizations.
        His military service earned him six battle stars and a Belgian decoration. He was a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre and a Knight of Malta.
        Mr. Brown is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Joan Gallagher; four sons, Peter C. Jr. of Armonk, Thomas G. of Rye Brook, Michael F. of Redwood City, Calif. and Robert J. of Manhattan; a daughter, Patricia J. of Manhattan, and nine grandchildren.
