        William Poll, who with his wife, Christine, opened one of the first specialty groceries on the Upper East Side more than 50 years ago, died on Friday at his Queens home. He was 89.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said Salvatore Susca of Stamatiades Funeral Home, which is handling the arrangements.
        Mr. Poll, whose store at 1051 Lexington Avenue, near 75th Street, bears his name, was an archon of the Greek Orthodox Church and a trustee of The Garden School.
        He is survived by his wife and seven children: William Poll Jr. of Astoria, Queens, Stanley Poll of Manhattan, Joyce Steele of Setauket, L.I., Anita Poll-Nussbaum of Manhattan, Sultana O'Sullivan of Indianapolis, James Poll of Durham, N.C., and Maria Hadsiyane of Baltimore.
