        Bert Knapp, a news broadcaster for the radio station WMCA in New York City, died last Wednesday at Branford Hospital in Connecticut. He was 76 and lived in Wallingford, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Knapp began his career at WMCA in 1945, as a disk jockey. He went on to become host of a sports talk show, a news broadcaster and eventually news director of the station. He also was an adjunct professor of broadcasting at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University. He retired from WMCA in 1986.
        During World War II, Mr. Knapp served in the Eighth Air Force and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart.
        He is survived by his wife, Annette;, a son, Paul, of Hamden, Conn.; a daughter, Wendy Daigneault of New York City, three grandchildren and two sisters, Hilda Goldberg and Miriam Schulman.
