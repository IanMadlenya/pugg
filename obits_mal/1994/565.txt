        Edward B. McMenamin, a retired administrator for the Federal Government and in the private sector, died on Monday at a Manhattan apartment where he and his wife were staying. A former resident of Manhattan, he was 82 and lived in Bridgehampton, L.I.
        He had been in declining health for three years, said Joan Stitt McMenamin, his wife of 41 years. She retired in 1992 as headmistress of the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan.
        A native of Portland, Me., Mr. McMenamin was an economics graduate of Bowdoin College. He served in the Marine Corps in the Pacific in World War II and spent 22 years in the United States Civil Service. Much of his work for the Federal Government in Washington and abroad dealt with international economic cooperation programs like the Marshall Plan, the Mutual Security Agency in Paris and the International Cooperation Administration.
        Retiring from the Civil Service, he was associate provost of Columbia University from 1957 to 1961, and as the university's secretary from then until 1972. After that, he was a consultant for administrative projects to the Federal Government, to the city of Boston, the Aspen Institute and several environmental agencies. For several years he was also business manager of St. Bernard's School in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife.
