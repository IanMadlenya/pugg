        Howard Otway, an actor, author and singer who was the owner and director of Theater 80 St. Marks, the longest continuously running movie house devoted exclusively to revival films in New York City, died on Monday at New York University Medical Center. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was emphysema, said his wife, Florence.
        His theater, at 80 St. Mark's Place in the East Village, began its film revival program in 1971 with an opening-night celebration at which Gloria Swanson was the host. Designed and built by Mr. Otway in 1966, the theater was previously the home of the Manhattan Festival Ballet and of theatrical productions that included the 1967 musical "You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown."
        Mr. Otway began his professional career at the age of 14 as a band and radio vocalist in the Middle West. He moved to New York at the age of 19, acted in stage productions and toured with Ms. Swanson in "Let Us Be Gay" in the early 1940's. He acted on Broadway with Katharine Cornell in "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" (1945). He was also the author of two novels, "The Evangelist" (1954) and "The Paradise Bird" (1956).
        Mr. Otway was born in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, while his parents were en route from England to take up a Salvation Army post.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Lawrence, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
