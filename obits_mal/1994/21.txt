        Samuel Kaplan, a Jewish historian who conducted a Yiddish-language radio program on WEVD for 42 years, died on Jan. 14 at his home in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was 87.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        His program, "Yeshiva Bochur," (yeshiva boy) was carried from 1936 until he retired in 1978. It was devoted to tales of Jewish history with dramatizations of the lives of wise men.
        Mr. Kaplan, who was also an accountant, graduated from City College.
        He is survived by three sons, Joel, of Far Rockaway, Bernard, of Staten Island, and Yeshaya, of Brooklyn; 10 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
