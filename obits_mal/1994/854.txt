        Gerald Eades Bentley, a longtime Princeton professor who suggested that Izaak Walton's 1653 book on fishing, "The Compleat Angler," was partly copied from a 1577 work by another author, died on Monday at his home in Hightstown, N.J. He was 92.
        Professor Bentley began teaching at Princeton in 1945 and was its Murray Professor of English Literature from 1952 to 1970.
        In 1956 he wrote the preface to a modern edition of "The Arte of Angling," a 1577 work by an unidentified writer that had been unknown to modern scholars until a copy turned up in London in 1954. In the preface, Professor Bentley called whole sections of the Walton treatise "surprisingly similar" to the older volume and emphasized that the structures of the two books were also similar.
        D. E. Rhodes, a British authority on fishing literature, sprang to Walton's defense. "It seems to me unjust to accuse Izaak Walton of plagiarism, because plagiarism did not exist in the 17th century," he wrote in a British journal. "All authors of that and earlier ages read what they liked and used what they liked of it without acknowledgment."
        Professor Bentley was born in Indiana and educated there, and at the University of Illinois and the University of London.
        He was widowed twice. He is survived by two sisters, Josephine Cannell of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Marian Malone of Fort Myers, Fla.; a son, G. E. Bentley Jr. of Toronto; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
