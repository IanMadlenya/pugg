        Stefan Munsing, a former cultural officer in the State Department who helped take American art to postwar Europe, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Peter.
        Mr. Munsing was born in Desloge, Mo., of Russian immigrant parents and was reared in Detroit. He worked in New York City as a designer for RCA and for the designers Hans Knoll and Norman Bel Geddes.  He was in the Army in World War II, then worked with an Army unit locating stolen artworks before joining the State Department.
        During the late 1940's and 50's, he established the State Department's Amerika Haus programs in Munich and Berlin and organized exhibitions and cultural programs in Germany and Austria. In 1955, he was named cultural officer at the American Embassy in London, where he staged exhibitions of such New York artists as Philip Pavia, Paul Jenkins and Ben Shahn and became an important force in the London art world.
        In the 1960's and 70's he helped establish the contemporary art collection of the National Museum of Fine Arts in Washington (now the National Museum of American Art) and headed the State Department's Art in Embassies program. After his retirement from the State Department in 1976, Mr. Munsing was a consultant to the American Association of Museums.
        In addition to his son, of Wyomissing, Pa., he is survived by his wife, Juliana; a daughter, Stefanie Winkelbauer of Vienna, and three grandchildren.
