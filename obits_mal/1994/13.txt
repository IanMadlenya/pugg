        Pierre-Paul Schweitzer, a French official who survived internment in a Nazi concentration camp and served as managing director of the International Monetary Fund from 1963 to 1973, died on Sunday, his family said. He was 81.
        The cause and place of death were not disclosed.
        Mr. Schweitzer, who was born in Strasbourg, came from a distinguished family that included one uncle, Albert Schweitzer, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952, and another uncle, Charles Munch, who was the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
        Pierre-Paul Schweitzer was a graduate of the Sorbonne and was trained as a lawyer. His career was closely linked to finance and he held numerous top Government posts.
        He began as an Inspector of Finance in 1936. After the outbreak of World War II, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the French Army. When France fell in 1940, he joined the Resistance and was later captured and held at the Buchenwald concentration camp, on the outskirts of Weimar, Germany, until it was liberated in 1945.
        After the war, Mr. Schweitzer rose quickly to become director of France's Treasury in 1953 and a vice governor of the Bank of France in 1960. After heading the I.M.F. for 10 years, he returned to France and served as chairman of the state energy company, Petrofigaz, from 1974 to 1979. He also sat on the boards of Unilever N.V. and Robeco N.V. and headed investment groups based in Luxembourg and Monaco.
        Mr. Schweitzer was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, France's highest decoration. He spent his retirement at his homes in Paris and Vandoeuvres, Switzerland.
        Mr. Schweitzer is survived by his wife, the former Catherine Hatt, whom he married in 1941, and two children, Louis and Juliette. Louis Schweitzer is president of Renault, the state-owned automaker.
