        Allston Jenkins, a founder and past president of the Philadelphia Conservationists, died on Monday at his home in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. He was 91.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Jenkins, a certified public accountant, started a campaign in 1952 to set aside a portion of the Tinicum Marshes in southwest Philadelphia as a wildlife refuge. That led to the formation of the Philadelphia Conservationists, which since then has preserved more than 45,000 acres of marsh, beach, forest and other land, turning the properties over to public agencies.
        Born in Stamford, Conn., Mr. Jenkins graduated from Yale University, where he led the ice hockey team to the Ivy League championship in 1925. He helped found the accounting firm of Jenkins Fetterolf & Company in 1936 and remained a partner until the company's merger with Main La France in 1969.
        Mr. Jenkins is survived by a daughter, Polly Man; two sons, James and Thomas; a brother, John; three sisters, Gladys Fox, Hope Stengel and Aurelia Brown, and three grandchildren.
