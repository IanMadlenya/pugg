        John William Seigle, a retired major general and vice president of Sikorsky Aircraft of Stratford, Conn., died on April 3 at St. Raphael's Hospital in New Haven. He was 64 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Seigle, who was born in Cincinnati, joined the Ohio National Guard and spent 33 years in the Army. He entered West Point in 1949, was commissioned in 1953 and earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in philosophy from Harvard University in the 1960's.
        Twice wounded, he received a Silver Star and other citations for bravery in the Vietnam War as commander of an armored cavalry squadron. Later, he headed a cavalry regiment that guarded a sector of the border between East Germany and West Germany.
        In the 1970's, he took part in planning for the training and conditioning of the all-volunteer Army. He retired from the service in 1982.
        The next year, he joined United Technologies Corporation of Hartford as a vice president for planning and business development of its building systems sector. At his death, and for the last seven years, he was vice president for planning at Sikorsky Aircraft, a subsidiary of United Technologies.
        General Seigle is survived by his wife, Marilyn Johnson Seigle; two sons, John W. 2d, of East Hartford and Gregory P., of Washington; a daughter, Sally C. Seigle of Woodbridge; two brothers, Col. Robert N., of Burke, Va., and Thomas R., of Knoxville, Tenn.; three sisters, Carole J. Holland of Knoxville, Sylvia D.
