        Wolfgang Behl, a sculptor and teacher, died on Oct. 17 at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, the city where he lived. He was 76.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Elizabeth Behl-Amter.
        Mr. Behl was born in Berlin in 1918. He studied art there and, after immigrating to the United States in 1939, at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence. From 1954 until his retirement in 1983, he taught at the Hartford Art School.
        Mr. Behl worked in a style of abstract yet recognizable forms, and executed a number of public commissions throughout Connecticut. He was represented by the Bertha Shaefer Gallery in New York City from 1950 to 1973. An overview of his work was exhibited at the Sculpture Center in New York in 1980.
        In addition to his daughter, of Washington, he is survived by his wife, Lula, of Hartford, and two grandaughters.
