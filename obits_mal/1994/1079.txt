        Dr. Alfred Hurwitz, a decorated combat surgeon in World War II who served as chief of surgery at hospitals in Connecticut, New York City and Florida, died on Sunday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was 85 and lived in Kennebunk and Liberty, Me.
        The cause was cancer of the pancreas, his family said.
        From the end of World War II until he moved to Maine in 1973, Dr. Hurwitz was successively the ranking surgeon at Veterans Administration hospitals in Newington and West Haven, Conn., at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn and the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami.
        While in Florida, he was also a professor of surgery at the University of Miami School of Medicine.
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Boston Latin School, Harvard College and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. He completed his residency at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and practiced surgery in Boston until the fall of 1942.
        He then became chief of an Army surgical team. On D-Day he went into combat with the troops, landing at Omaha Beach. He accompanied them in the Battle of the Bulge and across the Remagen bridge for the final push into Germany. He received six campaign stars, a Presidential citation and a Bronze Star.
        While on a sabbatical from Maimonides, he served as chief of surgery on the hospital ship S.S. Hope in Trujillo, Peru. The ship sails to developing countries and provides free medical care to the populations. Dr. Hurwitz helped the Hope project branch out in Ecuador, Sri Lanka and Jamaica.
        Dr. Hurwitz is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dorothy Solomon Hurwitz; a son, Dr. Richard L., of Norfolk, Va.; two daughters, Susan Hurwitz, of Denver, and Tobey Isenstein, of Boca Raton, Fla.; a sister, Beatrice Scheff of Brookline, Mass., and six grandchildren.
