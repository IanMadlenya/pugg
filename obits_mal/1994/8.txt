        Henry Warren Balgooyen, an economist and Presidential counselor who devoted many years to the fostering of inter-American cooperation and free trade, died on Saturday at his home in Katonah, N.Y. He was 81.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Balgooyen's mastery of international commerce took him to many conferences in the Americas as a delegate or adviser, starting in the 1940's. An expert on Latin American affairs, he counseled Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.
        Over the years, Mr. Balgooyen headed or held high office in the Pan American Society, the Americas Foundation, the Ecuadorian-American Association, the Argentine-American Association and the Bolivarian Society.
        Other organizations in which he held office included the Institute of International Education, the American Enterprise Institute and the Council for Latin America.
        A native of Hadley, Mich., Mr. Balgooyen graduated from the University of Michigan and received an M.B.A. degree there in 1929. He started his business career in the foreign department of Chase National Bank and eventually became president and chief executive of American and Foreign Power Company in New York.
        In the late 1960's, the company merged with Ebasco Industries, from which he retired in 1968 as senior vice president.
        Mr. Balgooyen is survived by his wife of 63 years, Violet Linden Balgooyen; two sons, Warren P., of Norridgewock, Me., and Bruce W., of Chico, Calif.; a daughter, Marjorie B. Drysdale of Randolph, Vt.; 10 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
        Another daughter, Carol B. Wilkinson, died in 1988 after a long illness, and Mr. and Mrs. Balgooyen also raised her four children, Stephanie, Eric, Mark and Joseph.
