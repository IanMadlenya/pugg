        Robert E. Murray, a managing director of J. P. Morgan & Company Inc. and former head of its American Depositary Department, died on Monday at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 57 and lived in Point Lookout, L.I.
        The cause was cancer, a company spokesman said.
        A 1962 graduate of Fordham University School of Business, Mr. Murray spent 39 years at J. P. Morgan and a predecessor firm, Guaranty Trust Company. He started his career at Guaranty Trust in 1954, took part in Morgan's management-training program and became a general banking officer in 1968.
        Morgan organized the depositary department in 1927 as an effective way for investors to hold shares of foreign companies. According to Morgan, it is the world's largest such department. Mr. Murray, who became a vice president in 1979, was in charge of it from 1987 until 1991, when he was promoted to managing director.
        He is survived by his wife, Ellen McDonough Murray.
