        John F. Reilly, a New York lawyer and former Family Court judge, died on Monday in Cabrini Hospital. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Reilly was born in Manhattan. He worked as a boxing manager in the 1930's before he served with the United States Army in Europe during World War II. He then graduated from Fordham University, where he also earned his law degree in 1956.
        He started his legal career as a law clerk in the State Attorney General's Office and from 1959 to 1960 was an assistant industrial commissioner for the State Labor Department.
        Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed and swore in Mr. Reilly, a Republican, as a judge of the Family Court in August 1970. He served on the bench until the end of 1977.
        Mr. Reilly is survived by his wife of 47 years, Helen Pequi Reilly; two sons, John, of Brooklyn and Paul, of the Bronx, and three grandchildren.
