        Chung Il Kwon, the chief of staff of the South Korean Army who became a national hero at the age of 32 while commanding forces at the start of the Korean War in 1950, died on Monday at a hospital in Hawaii. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He left the army in 1957 as a four-star general and served for 20 years in high positions in the South Korean Government. He was the Prime Minister in 1964, during a period of sustained economic growth. Led South Koreans at Inchon
        During periods of the fiercest fighting with North Korean and Chinese forces, General Chung served as a tactical commander of his country's forces, winning the respect of American military leaders. As a major general, he led South Korean units during the landing of United Nations forces at Inchon. Shortly after that, the North Koreans were forced out of most of South Korea.
        He received his early military training in Japan and served as a captain in the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. After the war he served in the Chinese Nationalist Army, and then joined the nucleus of what became the South Korean Army.
        In 1960 he became Ambassador to the United States and later served as Foreign Minister and Speaker of the South Korean Parliament. During the 1960's Mr. Chung studied international relations at Harvard University and political science at Oxford University.
        Mr. Chung was a political ally and confidant of Gen. Park Chung Hee when General Park seized power in South Korea in a coup in 1961. Mr. Chung later became Prime Minister in the Park Government, and he served in the Government in one capacity or another until he was dismissed by President Chun Doo Hwan in 1980.
        Mr. Chung is survived by his wife, Park Hye Soo, and four children.
