        Norman Hepple, a British portrait painter who portrayed Queen Elizabeth II and numerous members of the British upper, and upper-middle, classes, died on Jan. 3. . He was 85 and lived in Richmond, near London.
        Mr. Hepple was considered courtly and skilled at chatting with his subjects while they posed. Mr. Hepple rose to be president of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters from 1979 to 1983 and a fellow of the Royal Academy.
        A leitmotif of elegance ran through his work -- through his depictions of industrialists, members of the nobility, pillars of the legal world and the like, as well as of the Queen and her family.
        He once said, alluding to his privileged clientele: "They're not paying you to make them look as if they've just been pulled out of the river."
        Mr. Hepple painted one portrait of the Queen, looking trim and level-eyed, for the Royal Navy's Submarine Service. The other, showing her regally robed, was done for the Island of Jersey. In addition, he did four portraits of the Queen Mother. He also portrayed the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Alexandra.
        He was born in London and studied art at Goldsmith's College and at the Royal Academy Schools.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jillian Pratt, a son and a daughter.
