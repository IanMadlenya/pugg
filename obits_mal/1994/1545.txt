        Lowry Nelson, emeritus professor of comparative literature at Yale University, died on Nov. 12 in Tallinn, Estonia. He was 68 and lived in Bethany, Conn.
        The cause was thromboembolism, the State Department said. Professor Nelson was in Estonia doing research on Vyacheslav Ivanov, the Russian Symbolist poet.
        Dr. Nelson specialized in literatures from the 13th to the early 20th century. His books include "Baroque Lyric Poetry (Yale University Press, 1961, and Octagon Books, 1978), "The Poetry of Guido Cavalcanti" (Garland Publishing Inc., 1986) and "Configurations of Poetry: Essays in Literary History and Criticism" (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991).
        Born in Provo, Utah, he received an undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 1947 and a Ph.D. from Yale in 1951. He taught at Harvard and the University of California, Los Angeles before joining the Yale faculty. He retired in June.
        He is survived by two sisters, Ann Nelson of Charlotte, N.C., and Janet Nelson Friedell of Lexington, Ky.
