        Frederick H. Block, a New York lawyer and former assistant United States Attorney, died last Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 85.
        The cause was cancer, said Jean Libman Gollay, his former wife.

        He helped to found the Community Synagogue in Rye, N.Y., and was its president from 1952 to 1955. At his death, he was of counsel to the Manhattan law firm of Ohrenstein & Ohrenstein.
