        Yen Chia-kan, President of Taiwan from 1975 to 1978, died on Dec. 24in Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taipei, the Chinese Information and Culture Center in New York announced yesterday. His age was given as 90.
        The cause was heart failure, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said. The French news agency Agence France-Press had reported that Mr. Yen suffered a brain hemorrhage that left him bedridden more than seven years ago and that his condition had worsened after a second hemorrhage in 1992.
        As Taiwan's Vice President, Mr. Yen became President under a provision of his country's Constitution, upon the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the longtime Chinese Nationalist leader, in 1975. Mr. Yen, who was often called C. K. Yen in the English-language press, held office as President during the three-year balance of Chiang's term. He was then succeeded by the Generalissimo's son Chiang Ching-kuo, who was elected President.
        Mr. Yen, who was born in Jiangsu Province, in southeastern China, received a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in Shanghai. He went on to hold Government posts in Taiwan in the late 1940's and, after the Nationalists fled there in 1949, served as Prime Minister as well as in various Cabinet posts.
        His survivors include his wife, Liu Chi-chun, and nine children.
