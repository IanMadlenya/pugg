        Arthur Altman, a songwriter whose credits include the music for "All or Nothing at All," died on Tuesday in Lake Worth, Fla. He was 83.
        The cause was a heart ailment, a statement from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said.
        Mr. Altman was born in Brooklyn in 1910. He studied violin as a young man and began his professional career as a violinist with the CBS Radio Orchestra. His first nationally known song was "Play Fiddle Play," which he wrote in the early 1930's for the orchestra leader Emory Deutsch.
        He wrote the music or lyrics for more than 400 songs. "All or Nothing at All," with music by Mr. Altman and lyrics by Jack Lawrence, was recorded by Frank Sinatra and the Tommy Dorsey band in the early 1940's and quickly became a pop classic. He also wrote the lyrics to "All Alone Am I" and "I Will Follow Him," both of which became pop hits.
        He is survived by a son, Dick, of New York City.
