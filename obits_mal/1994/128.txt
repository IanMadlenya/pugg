        Edward Duke, a British actor who appeared on Broadway, died on Saturday in London. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, said Pete Sanders, a publicity agent.
        Mr. Duke attended a Jesuit school in Lancashire, England, and continued his education at an American high school in Tokyo, where his father was British cultural attache. He studied drama in London.
        Mr. Duke appeared in the 1990 London revival of Noel Coward's "Private Lives," which starred Joan Collins. The production then toured the United States before opening on Broadway in March 1991.
        He also played Off Broadway and toured the United States in his one-man show "Jeeves Takes Charge," which he adapted from the writings of P. G. Wodehouse. His film credits include "The French Lieutenant's Woman" (1981) and "Invitation to the Wedding" (1985).
