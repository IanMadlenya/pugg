        Gary Wood, the stocky, scrappy quarterback who set Cornell and Ivy League records before joining the Giants in 1964, died Tuesday night at his home in Dix Hills, L.I. He was 52.
        His family said he died of a heart attack.
        At 5 feet 11 inches and 180 pounds, he did not have the stature of a National Football League quarterback, but in five seasons with the Giants, Wood was a popular backup who frequently thrilled crowds with his fearless rollout style and his penchant for turning planned handoffs into impromptu bootleg plays for big gains.
        It was a style he had developed at Cornell, where Wood, who had grown up in Cortland, N.Y., was a skilled passer who could run. While many of his records have been broken, Wood, who was named the Ivy League player of the week five times, still holds the Cornell records for rushing by a quarterback.
        The Giants' eighth draft choice in 1964, Wood, who turned down offers to play in the American Football League and in Canada to accept the N.F.L. challenge, showed great promise as a rookie.
        Frequently replacing an injured Y. A. Tittle, he completed 66 of 143 passes for 952 yards and 6 touchdowns with 3 interceptions and was ranked 13th among N.F.L. quarterbacks, three places ahead of Tittle. He also ran the ball 39 times for 158 yards and 3 touchdowns.
        Although Tittle's retirement left open the No. 1 quarterback spot for Wood, he was displaced before the 1965 season with the arrival of Earl Morrall. Two seasons later, with Morrall frequently hurt or faltering, Wood had his most productive season, completing 81 of 170 passes for 1,142 yards and 16 touchdowns with 13 interceptions while rushing 28 times for another 196 yards and 3 touchdowns. Played for New Orleans
        After a season as a rarely used third-string quarterback in New Orleans, Wood returned to New York in 1968 as a backup for Fran Tarkenton. He extended his career another season largely as a holder on place-kicks for his former Cornell teammate Pete Gogolak. In his six N.F.L. seasons, he completed 186 of 400 passes for 2,575 yards and 14 touchdowns with 18 interceptions.
        After playing briefly in Canada, he became an insurance broker in Valley Stream, L.I.
        He is survived by his wife, Jill; three sons, Jonathan, David and Eric; a sister, Neva Ryan, and a brother, Robert.
