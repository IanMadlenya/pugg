        Frederic Paige Kimball, a retired aviation consultant who served for 30 years as a Justice of the Peace, died on April 20 at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jeanne Bachrach Kimball.
        A native of Dedham, Mass., Mr. Kimball graduated from Princeton University and started his career as an analyst for American Airlines in New York City. Later, as a consultant, he often appeared as an expert witness before the Civil Aeronautics Board in Washington.
        In Westport, he served on the local Board of Finance, the Town Charter Revision Committee and as chairman of both the Democratic Town Committee and the Unitarian Church in Westport. As a Justice of the Peace he performed some 600 marriage ceremonies.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Kimball is survived by three daughters, Joy Overstreet of Vancouver, Wash., Faith Russell of Norwood, Mass., and Holly Tashian of Nashville, and five grandchildren.
