        Dr. Harold R. Kay, who helped develop surgical procedures to treat electrical disturbances in the heart, died on Nov. 12 at his home in Wynnewood, Pa. He was 47.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Cindy Zeidman Kay.
        The techniques, developed at the Philadelphia Heart Institute, furthered the treatment of arrhythmia without open heart surgery. In the technique, a device is implanted in the abdomen and electrical leads are threaded through veins to the heart. A defibrillator can then be used to diagnose the nature of the irregularity, and the heart can be shocked into a normal rhythm.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Kay was a clinical associate professor of surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. He received an undergraduate degree from the university in 1968 and a medical degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1972.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two children, Jana and David; two brothers, Richard, of North Caldwell, N.J., and Jonathan, of Brooklyn, and his parents, Helen and Abner Kay of Lake Worth, Fla.
