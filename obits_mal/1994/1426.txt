        Jerome Stenbuck, chairman of the Stenbuck Company, a Manhattan concern specializing in financial public relations and financial transactions, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mr. Stenbuck, who lived in Manhattan, was 70.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his sister, Nancy Rosenfield of Manhattan.
        During a long career in financial public relations, Mr. Stenbuck was a senior vice president of Tex McCrary Inc. during the 1950's and chief operating officer of Monroe Scharff Inc. during the 1960's.
        Over the years, Mr. Stenbuck, a native of Milwaukee, was an adviser and consultant to more than 200 public and private companies nationwide.
        His college education was interrupted by World War II. He served in the Army in Italy before re-entering and graduating from the University of Michigan.
        He worked in advertising with The Detroit Times, then joined his father in public relations in Boston. In 1954, he came to New York to join Tex McCrary.
        In addition to his sister, Mr. Stenbuck is survived by a brother-in-law, James Rosenfield of Manhattan; a niece, Laurie Rosenfield of Manhattan, and a nephew, James Rosenfield Jr. of Chicago.
