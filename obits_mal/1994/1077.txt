        John J. P. Kilgallen, a physician who spent more than half a century transforming the New York Racing Association's medical department from a one-room nursing station into an innovative health service, died on Friday at the Courtland Gardens nursing home in Stamford, Conn. He was 95.
        His family said he died of natural causes after suffering from internal bleeding.
        Dr. Kilgallen, who joined the racing association in 1941 and continued his work until he was 85, also maintained a private practice in which he made house calls into his 80's. By the time he retired from the racing association 10 years ago, he was supervising a staff of two doctors and six nurses at a full-scale treatment center at each of New York's tracks.
        Dr. Kilgallen was credited with beginning the practice of having an ambulance trail the riders around the track during a race to assure quick treatment for a fallen jockey.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, Kevin and John, and a daughter, Elaine.
