        Jerry M. Tinker, the staff director of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs and an authority in those fields, died on Friday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 55.
        The cause was a gastrointestinal hemorrhage, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Tinker was also an aide to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat whose staff he joined in 1970.
        A statement from Senator Kennedy's office in Boston said Mr. Tinker was instrumental in shaping every piece of immigration legislation for two decades, including the sweeping Immigration Reform Act of 1990.
        Mr. Tinker worked for the immigration subcommittee for many years and became its staff director in the late 1980's.
        He was born in Fountain Valley, Calif., and he received a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands in Redlands, Calif., in 1961. He studied in India in 1962 and 1963 and earned a master's degree from American University in 1965.
        His 1972 marriage to Anne Timothy Gaud ended in divorce in 1992.
        He is survived by his mother, Lucille Hurt of Irvine, Calif.; two daughters, Katherine and Caroline, both of Bethesda; a half-brother, Paul Hurt of El Toro, Calif., and a half-sister, Nancy Hurt of Irvine.
