        Dr. Walle J. H. Nauta, an authority on the anatomy and functions of the human brain, and a founder of the field of neuroscience, died on Thursday in Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 77 and lived in Newton, Mass.
        The cause was a blood infection, said his daughter Tjalda Belastock.
        Until his retirement in 1986 as a professor of neuroanatomy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Nauta had devoted 40 years to studying the brain and furthering scientific understanding of its structure.
        Dr. Nauta, whose career started in Europe, developed techniques that enabled scientists to trace the fiber connections within the brain. He continued this work in the United States in 1951 and joined M.I.T.'s department of psychology in 1964. As the field advanced, the university established an independent department for the study of the brain and cognitive sciences.
        He was to have received a special award in neurosciences next month from the National Academy of Sciences in Washington. The award was in recognition of his "extraordinary contributions to progress in the field of neuroscience and for development of a powerful method for determining connectivity among specific brain sites."
        Dr. Nauta was born in Medan, Indonesia. He received a medical degree from the University of Leyden in the Netherlands in 1942 and a doctorate in anatomy from the University of Utrecht in 1945. After World War II, he taught at the University of Zurich and from 1951 to 1964 was a neurophysiologist at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute in Washington.
        He was a professor of anatomy at the University of Maryland from 1955 until his appointment at M.I.T. He was the author of more than 100 scientific papers published in professional journals.
        Dr. Nauta is survived by his wife, Ellie; two daughters, Mrs. Belastock, of Newton, and Janneke Bogyo, of Lewiston, N.Y., and a son, Haring J. of Galveston, Tex.
