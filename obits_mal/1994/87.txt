        Dr. Hansskarl Bandel, a New York structural engineer who worked on such projects as Madison Square Garden and the United States Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair, died on Dec. 29 in Carbondale, Colo. He was 68 and lived in Canadensis, Pa.
        He died, apparently of a heart attack, while skiing the slopes with his wife at Vail Pass, said Nils Olsson, a colleague in Tampa, Fla.
        A native of Germany, Dr. Bandel held a doctorate from Technical University in Berlin and taught engineering before going to work in the German steel industry. He moved to the United States in the 1950's and worked for several New York engineering firms as a partner.
        Among other structures he helped to build were the Ford Foundation Building in Manhattan, the Yale Hockey Rink, the Marina Towers in Chicago, the Jefferson Arch in St. Louis and the Honolulu Stadium. He also contributed articles to architectural journals in the United States and Europe.
        Dr. Bandel is survived by his wife, Irmtraut, and a sister, Rosmari Scheidt.
