        Richard Cohen, a public relations adviser to several of the nation's largest national Jewish organizations, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Dr. Aphrodite Clamar-Cohen.
        Mr. Cohen's firm, Richard Cohen Associates, represents several umbrella groups, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, which was made up of 50 smaller bodies, and the 22-member American Zionist Movement. Among its other clients are the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture.
        Mr. Cohen was born in Brooklyn and graduated in 1943 from City College, where he was editor of the undergraduate paper, the Campus. He served as an Air Force navigator in the Pacific Theater during World War II.
        After the war, Mr. Cohen worked in New York and Paris for the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, which was involved in the effort to help resettle Jewish refugees from Europe. In 1955, he returned to the United States to work in various roles, including associate executive director, for the American Jewish Congress. He left in 1979 to form his own public relations firm.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Cohen is survived by three daughters, Joelle Cohen Keene and Nina Cohen, both of Los Angeles, and Leslie Cohen, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Ruth Schechter of Manhattan, and four grandchildren
