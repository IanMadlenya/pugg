        Dick Cary, a jazz arranger, instrumentalist and composer, died yesterday at Glendale Adventist Hospital in Glendale, Calif. He was 77 and lived in Sunland, Calif.
        The cause was cancer, said Floyd Levin, a jazz writer and friend.
        Mr. Cary's arrangements were used by many well-known artists, including Jean Goldkette, Benny Goodman and Pee Wee Russell, for whom he did the Dixieland album "By Arrangement Only." His compositions have been performed by jazz ensembles, big bands and symphony orchestras.
        Mr. Cary was born in Hartford. By the age of 11, he was playing violin with the Hartford Symphony Orchestra. But his first love was jazz, and by the time he was in his 20's, he was playing solo piano at Nick's, a club in New York City. In 1947, he played piano with the Louis Armstrong All-Stars; later, he performed with Jimmy Dorsey and Eddie Condon.
        In 1959, Mr. Cary moved to California. His Tuesday Night Band, a group of studio musicians who for 20 years met weekly in his home, was featured in the 1992 Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival.
        He is survived by two daughters, Judy, of Naples, Fla., and Janet Mevs of New Jersey; a brother, William, and four grandchildren.
