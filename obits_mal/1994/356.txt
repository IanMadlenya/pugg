        Thomas L. Blakemore, an American lawyer who was an expert on Japanese law and whose Tokyo law firm represented many United States companies in Asia, died on Feb. 19 at his home in Seattle. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, said Griffith Way, a friend.
        Mr. Blakemore practiced law in Tokyo for 38 years as the founder and senior partner of the firm of Blakemore & Mitsuki. Mr. Blakemore completed his studies of Japanese law at Tokyo University and was admitted to the bar there in 1950. He was one of the few foreign lawyers allowed to practice in courts there at the time.
        From 1946 to 1949 he served in the government section of the headquarters of Gen. Douglas MacArthur in Tokyo. Mr. Blakemore helped revise the Japanese civil and criminal codes from authoritarian to democratic. He also translated the Japanese criminal code into English.
        In postwar Tokyo, Mr. Blakemore helped promote the entry of American businesses into the Japanese market, and he became a director of several major Japanese companies.
        Mr. Blakemore earned a law degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1938 and did postgraduate legal studies at Cambridge University and Tokyo Imperial University until the outbreak of World War II. During the war he was an Army captain with the Office of Strategic Services in China.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances, of Seattle.
