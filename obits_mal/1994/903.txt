        Leon Rafalowicz, a New York jewelry wholesaler and benefactor of Jewish causes, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 74 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Poland and survivor of the Holocaust, Mr. Rafalowicz came to New York in 1952 and became the owner of a successful wholesale business in Manhattan's diamond district. He was a trustee of Fifth Avenue Synagogue and contributed to charities and institutions in this country as well as in Israel.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean Turkel Rafalowicz; a son, Joseph of New Rochelle; a daughter, Linda R. Moskowitz of Washington; two stepsons, Edward Turkel of Kew Garden Hills, Queens, and Lawrence Turkel of Riverdale, the Bronx; three grandchildren, and five step-grandchildren.
