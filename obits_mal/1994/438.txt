        William L. Bergsma, a composer of symphonies, chamber music, songs and other works, died on Friday at Swedish Hospital in Seattle. He was 72 and lived in Seattle.
        The cause was a heart attack suffered in the hospital, where he was being treated for a broken hip, said his daughter, Anne, of Seattle.
        Mr. Bergsma was born in Oakland, Calif., and studied at Stanford University. He was a teaching fellow at the Eastman School of Music and earned an a bachelor's degree from the University of Rochester in 1942 and a master's degree in music there in 1943.
        From 1946 to 1963, he was on the faculty of the Juilliard School of Music, where he was associate dean from 1961 to 1963. He was a professor at the University of Washington, in Seattle, from 1963 to 1986 and the director of its School of Music from 1963 to 1971.
        In 1972 and 1973, he was a visiting professor at Brooklyn College. He received numerous awards, grants and commissions, including Guggenheim fellowships in 1946 and 1951.
        In 1981, after the world premiere of his work "The Voice of the Coelacanth," a set of 10 variations for horn, violin and piano, at Alice Tully Hall, one critic noted that the coelacanth was a fish that had long been thought extinct until a specimen was found in the 1930's.
        It was said at the time that Mr. Bergsma had adopted that unlikely survivor as a symbol for himself -- a composer, then 60, who had never deserted tonality and, at that time, saw dozens of his former avant-garde colleagues returning to the fold.
        In addition to his daughter, a classical soprano specializing in the 20th-century repertory, Mr. Bergsma is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Nancy Nickerson; a son, Laurence, of Seattle; two half-brothers, Edwin Bennett of Portland, Ore., and David Bennett of Oakland, and two half-sisters, Shirley Bennett of Maui, Hawaii and Gloria Olson of Hillsborough, Calif.
