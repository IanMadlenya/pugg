        Sam Roffe, the founder and chairman of Roffe Inc., one of the nation's largest makers of ski apparel, died on Sunday at his home in Seattle. He was 85.
        The cause of death was cancer of the liver, said Ann Stables, a company spokeswoman.
        Mr. Roffe, a lifelong resident of Seattle who never skied himself, turned a business whose first account was with a college bookstore into one with a clothing line with products in ski stores across the country. He is credited with manufacturing the first stretch ski pants in the United States, of which his company is still the leading seller.
        Mr. Roffe began his career in the garment manufacturing business in 1933 as a cutter for Seattle Woolens, a uniform manufacturer. After 25 years with Seattle Woolens, Mr. Roffe left to start his own business as a uniform manufacturer.
        In 1960, his company outfitted the United States Alpine ski team for competition for the Olympics in Squaw Valley, Calif. In 1963, he added ski parkas to his apparel line and decided to stop manufacturing uniforms and concentrate on ski apparel.
        In 1992, Mr. Roffe started Roffe Riding, a line of horse riding and training apparel. Until his death, he was chairman of Roffe Ski-Wear, and at the same time continued to work as a tailor among his company's 200 workers.
        Mr. Roffe is survived by a brother, Harry; a sister, Bertha Roffe Appleman; a son, Robert, and two grandchildren, all of Seattle.
