        David R. Butler, an industrial designer and stylist of corporate identity symbols, died on Friday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 53.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Jennifer Butler.
        Mr. Butler was a co-founder and the former chairman of Lister Butler Inc., a corporate and brand identity consulting concern in Manhattan. He founded the company in 1977 with John Lister, now the chief executive.
        Mr. Butler graduated from the University of Illinois and was a lieutenant in the Navy.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and his daughters, Susan and Jennifer, all of Westport.
