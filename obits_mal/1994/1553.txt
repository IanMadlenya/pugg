        J. Kingston Herbert Jr., a fund-raiser for Harvard Medical School, died last Tuesday in his office at the school in Boston. He was 62 and lived in Milton, Mass.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At his death he was the medical school's director of development in charge of major gifts. He had held that post since 1986, and had raised millions of dollars for the school.
        Mr. Herbert was born in New Bedford, Mass., and graduated from Princeton University in 1954. He spent 14 years as a marketing executive at Lever Brothers, Procter & Gamble and American Home Products.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Garrison Herbert; three sons, Timothy, of Houston, James, of Milton, and John Kingston 3d of Boston, and a sister, Sheila Herbert of Manhattan.
