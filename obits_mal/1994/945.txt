        John P. Mangan, a vice president and associate general counsel of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of America, died on Tuesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. Mr. Mangan, who lived in Bronxville, was 62.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, James.
        A graduate of Fordham College from which he also received a law degree in 1958, Mr. Mangan joined the Equitable in 1960, became head of its litigation division in 1987, and retired four years ago.
        He was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission from 1977 to 1981, and was a founder of the South Bronx Community Action Theater.
        Besides his son, James, of Bronxville, Mr. Mangan is survived by his wife, Ann Marie; three daughters, Margaret Murtagh, Maryann Palermo and Eileen Van Hoek; his mother, Mary Mangan, and four grandsons, all of Bronxville.
