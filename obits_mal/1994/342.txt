        Ira Murchison, a sprinter who set world records on two continents and won a gold medal in the 1956 Olympic Games, died on Monday at Ingalls Hospital in Harvey, Ill., outside his native Chicago. He was 61.
        The cause of death was bone cancer, his wife, Verinda, said.
        The 5-foot-4-inch Murchison, who grew up in Chicago's Morgan Park neighborhood, was the Illinois champion in the 100- and 220-yard dashes in 1951. Later, at Western Michigan, he was the collegiate champion in the 100.
        While Murchison was in the Army in 1956, his career reached its peak, first at a meet in West Berlin, where he matched Jesse Owens's 20-year-old 100-meter record of 10.2 seconds, then in Cologne, West Germany, where he broke it with a time of 10.1. Later that year, he ran on the American 400-meter relay team that set a world record of 39.5 seconds in winning a gold medal at the Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.
        Murchison's career came to an end when he was stricken with colon cancer at the age of 26. He later worked as a high school and college coach in Chicago.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Ira Jr.; a stepson, Kenneth, and three brothers, Gerald, Robert and Norman.
