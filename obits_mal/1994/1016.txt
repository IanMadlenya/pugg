        Mark Kauffman, an award-winning photographer for Life magazine, died on Friday at his home in Pismo Beach, Calif. He was 71.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his daughter Linda.
        At 17, Mr. Kauffman became the youngest photographer ever to shoot a cover for the magazine, when he did a photo portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt. He was a staff photographer for 30 years, covering events in the United States, Europe and the Far East.
        He received the White House News Photographers' Grand Award in 1953. He later served as director of photography for Playboy magazine for five years and was a professor of photography at California Polytechnic State University.
        In addition to his daughter Linda, he is survived by two other daughters, Sylvia Kauffman and Yvonne Tavalero, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
