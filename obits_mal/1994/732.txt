        Milton E. Mermelstein, a Manhattan lawyer for 50 years and a former chairman of Alexander's Department Stores Inc., died on June 21 at his home in Deal, N.J. He was 86.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Born in Newark, Mr. Mermelstein graduated from George Washington University, where he also received a law degree. In World War II, he served in the Navy as a commander. He was an intelligence officer on a warship that accompanied the first wave of the D-Day invasion force at Utah Beach.
        He was admitted to the New York bar in 1934 and remained in practice until his retirement 10 years ago. He was a senior partner in Mermelstein, Burns & Lesser in 1969 when he was elected chairman of Alexander's. He held that post until 1976, after which he remained on the board for several more years.
        Mr. Mermelstein is survived by his wife of 56 years, Doris Saxe Mermelstein; two sons, John S. of Manhattan and Stephen E. of Boston, and one grandson.
