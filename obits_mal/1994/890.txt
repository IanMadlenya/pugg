        Robert Buchholz, a singer, pianist and composer, died on June 27 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Tim Cahill, a friend.
        Mr. Buchholz, who was known as Buck, appeared in several Manhattan cabarets, restaurants and hotels, including the Duplex, the Four Seasons and the Rose Room of the Algonquin Hotel, where he had a seven-year run. He composed and arranged the scores for two of Charles Schultz's "Peanuts" touring shows and for the documentary film "Greetings From Washington, D.C."
        Mr. Buchholz was born in Shelby, Neb. He graduated from the University of Nebraska and did graduate work at Ball State University. He also studied with the composers Richard Rodney Bennett and Maury Yeston.
        He is survived by his mother, Opal, of Shelby; a brother, Craig, and a sister, Cheryl, both of Lincoln, Neb.
