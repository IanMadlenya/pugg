        Joseph K. Davie, dean of the Long Island College Hospital School of Nursing, died Tuesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 39.
        The exact cause of death has yet to be determined, said his stepmother, Mary Davie.
        Mr. Davie took up the post of dean and professor of nursing at Long Island College Hospital in 1991 after teaching for 11 years at Grossmont College in San Diego. He received an R.N. from Loretto Heights College in Denver and a master's in nursing from the University of San Diego. Mr. Davie was the co-author of several books on critical care nursing.
        He is survived by his father, John F. Davie and his stepmother, of Bronxville; two brothers, Michael, of Jacksonville, Fla., and Robert, of Boca Raton, Fla., and a sister, Nancy Mahany of Denver.
