        Judge Howard Schwartzberg, who presided over the Texaco bankruptcy case at Federal District Court in White Plains, died on Friday at the Dana Farber Cancer Center in Boston. Judge Schwartzberg, who lived in Larchmont, was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said his son Robert Schwartzberg.
        In 1987 and 1988 Judge Schwartzberg presided over the tangle of legal proceedings stemming from the bankruptcy of Texaco Inc. after the Pennzoil Company won a $10 billion damage suit against Texaco. The bankruptcy filing by Texaco was the largest by an industrial corporation. Texaco eventually emerged from bankruptcy after paying more than $3 billion to settle the dispute.
        Judge Schwartzberg took a seat on the Federal bankruptcy court in 1971, previously serving as house counsel for M. Lowenstein & Sons, a textile company in Manhattan. He received a law degree from New York University, where he also earned an undergraduate degree.
        He is survived by his wife, Lita Schwartzberg of Larchmont; two sons, Robert, of Palo Alto, Calif., and Paul, of Alexandria, Va.; one daughter, Dr. Diane Weiss of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
