        Burke McHugh, a former actor, model and restaurateur, died on May 15 at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital. A resident of Falmouth for nearly three decades, he was 77.
        The cause was heart failure and pneumonia, said Frank Gehrecke, a friend in New York.
        A native of Rutland, Vt., Mr. McHugh started performing in plays and musicals in high school and thencollege. He graduated from the University of Vermont.
        Moving to Greenwich Village, he began appearing on stage and in movies and became one of the country's top male models. His image was that of the all-American husband and father, and as such he made about 100 commercials for national television. He also founded his own company, the Burke McHugh Modeling Agency, which later became the Rice-Burke Agency.
        In 1960 he conceived and co-directed a fast-paced revue called "Greenwich Village, U.S.A.," a comic commentary on the mores and manners of the Village. It was well-received, ran for almost three months and was reprised the following year.
        Settling in Falmouth in the 1960's, he became the manager and host of the Popponesset Inn, where he staged variety shows. Most recently he was a partner in the Boathouse, a restaurant and bar in Falmouth Harbor.
        Mr. McHugh is survived by his sister, Marianne Beary of Rye, N.Y.
