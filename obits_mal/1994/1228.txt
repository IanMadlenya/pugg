        G. Joseph Tauro, whose career as Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court and the Massachusetts Superior Court spanned nearly 15 years in the 1960's and 1970's, died on Thursday at Salem Hospital in Salem, Mass. He was 88 and lived in Swampscott, Mass.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, a spokesman for the family said.
        During Judge Tauro's term as Chief Justice of Superior Court, from 1962 to 1970, the court issued decisions in several high-profile cases, including a dispute involving charges of illegal possession of marijuana brought against two Massachusetts residents. In that case, the court upheld the state's anti-marijuana statutes, which were being challenged, ruling ultimately that marijuana was "a harmful and dangerous drug."
        In 1970, he was chosen by Gov. Francis W. Sargent to head the state's highest court. During his term, Judge Tauro helped create the state's Appeals Court, an intermediate appellate level division.
        Born in 1906 in Lynn, Mass., he practiced law there from 1927 until his appointment to the Superior Court as an associate justice in 1961.
        He graduated from Boston University and the Boston University Law School in 1927.
        Survivors include his wife of 64 years, Helen; a son, Joseph L., of Marblehead, the Chief Judge of Federal District Court in Massachusetts; two brothers, Raymond, of Woburn, Mass., and Arthur L., of New Hampshire; a sister, Celia Tricca of Malden, Mass., and three grandchildren.
