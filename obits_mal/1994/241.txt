        David Jacques Way, a fine-arts printer who became a musicologist and the owner of D. Jacques Way & Zuckermann Harpsichords, died on Friday in Stonington, Conn. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Katherine.
        Mr. Way purchased Zuckermann Harpsichords, a well-known harpsichord and fortepiano maker, and moved the company from New York to Stonington in 1967. His early keyboard instruments, some of which he designed himself, are built in Stonington and Paris, and are used by musicians around the world. The company also produces harpsichords and other keyboard instruments in kit form.
        Born in Elk Creek, Neb., he attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina. In 1949 he and Bertram L. Clarke, a graphic artist, helped design a 12-volume catalogue for the Frick Collection. Four years later they founded a printing company, Clarke & Way. Their fine-art books for museums and university presses won many awards from the American Institute of Graphic Arts. Mr. Clarke died on Sunday.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Way is survived by a son, Anthony, of Petaluma, Calif.; two daughters, Jessica, of Stonington, and Deborah Burt of Denver; a brother, George, of Altadena, Calif., and five grandchildren.
