        Jess Richards, a versatile actor who appeared in 11 Broadway shows and numerous Off Broadway, touring and regional productions, died on Sunday at his home in Indianapolis. He was 51.
        The cause was AIDS, his agent, Beverly Anderson said.
        Mr. Richards was generally to be found in musicals, playing roles that ranged from the sailor Chip, one of the leads in the 1971 Broadway revival of "On the Town," to the impresario in a 1992 production of "Phantom of the Opera" in Fort Worth.
        On Broadway, his credits included "Barnum" (for which he studied juggling and wire walking with the Big Apple Circus), "Two by Two," "South Pacific," "Nash at Nine" and "Mack and Mabel."
        Off Broadway and in cabaret, he appeared in such productions as "Dames at Sea," the Lyrics and Lyricists series, "Lullaby of Broadway" and "Josh Logan's Musical Scrapbook" at the Rainbow Grill.
        Among his regional credits were "The Tempest" at the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn., "Loot" at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J., and "The Seagull" at the Seattle Repertory. He toured nationally in "Hello, Dolly!," "Irene" and "Mack and Mabel."
        Mr. Richards's performance in "On the Town" in 1971 won him a Theater World award for best actor in a musical.
        Mr. Richards, whose original name was Richard Sederholm, was born in Seattle and was a graduate of the University of Washington, where he studied acting.
        He is survived by his mother, Permelia Sederholm of Seattle, and a brother, Jack Sederholm of Indianapolis.
