        Stephen Walter Brener, a leading Manhattan-based expert, consultant and broker in hotel and motel real estate, died on Wednesday while on vacation in Chaumont-sur-Tharonne, France. A resident of Manhattan, he was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Brener was president of InterBank / Brener Brokerage Services, specializing in management consulting for the hotel industry. Previously he headed Stephen W. Brener Associates, which provided the whole range of consulting services from the purchase to the sale of properties.
        Before setting out on his own more than 10 years ago, he was a senior vice president of Helmsley-Spear, the real-estate business. There, he organized and headed the hospitality division. His Helmsley connection dated to 1952, when he was named a vice president of Dwight-Helmsley at the age of 26.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Brener attended Georgia School of Technology until World War II cut short his education. He served with the 78th Infantry Division in Europe and was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge.
        He was involved in many activities and organizations of the hotel industry. He also lectured on his field at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration, as well as at New York University, Michigan State University and Pace University.
        In two weeks he was to preside for the 16th year at the Hospitality Industry Investment Conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, sponsored by New York University. He was a principal organizer of that conference.
        Mr. Brener is survived by his wife, Ann Santa Lucia Brener; a daughter, Angela Brener of Ben Lomond, Calif., and one grandson.
