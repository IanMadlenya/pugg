        Dr. Sibley Worth Hoobler, a retired cardiologist who founded one of the country's first hypertension clinics, died on Tuesday in Tucson, Ariz. He was 82 and lived in Cleveland.
        His family said he had been wintering in Arizona as usual and died of a heart attack while playing tennis.
        Dr. Hoobler directed the hypertension unit at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor from 1947 to 1974. Under his guidance, the unit became an internationally renowned research center on high blood pressure.
        He taught at the university's medical school from 1959 until 1976, when he retired. Then, for about 10 more years, he was associated with Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland as a clinical professor of medicine.
        A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hoobler was a 1933 graduate of Princeton University. He earned a doctorate in science and his M.D. degree at Johns Hopkins University.
        He wrote many papers and a textbook on hypertension and published a memoir, "Adventures in Medicine," in 1991. He also sponsored medical scholarships through Johns Hopkins and the University of Michigan.
        An avid outdoorsman and trout fisherman, he was active in the Nature Conservancy, to which he gave 640 acres of forest in northern Michigan.
        Dr. Hoobler is survived by his wife, Catherine; a son, Raymond, of Manhattan; a daughter, Patricia Schock of East Lansing, Mich., and four grandchildren. Also surviving are four stepchildren and eight step-grandchildren.
