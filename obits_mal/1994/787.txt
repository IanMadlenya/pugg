        Edward F. O'Rourke, an investment consultant, died on Sunday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. A Greenwich resident since 1969, he was 58.

He previously served as president of the New York-based firm of Sterling Grace & Company, president of Nesbitt Thompson Securities in New York, and managing director of Fahnestock & Company, also in New York.
