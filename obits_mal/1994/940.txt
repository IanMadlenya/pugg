        Robert F. Mullen, a senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, died yesterday at his home in Scarsdale. He was 51.
        The cause was cancer, said Evan R. Chesler, a partner in the firm.
        Mr. Mullen graduated from Tufts University and received a law degree from Columbia University in 1968. He was a law clerk to Judge Frank J. Murray of Federal District Court in Boston before joining the firm in 1969. Mr. Mullen became a partner in 1975.
        He was on the team defending I.B.M. in the antitrust suit brought by the Federal Government, and was counsel to Chemical Bank in some of its litigation. Mr. Mullen also represented the families of students killed or wounded in the 1970 demonstrations at Jackson State University in Mississippi.
        From 1989-91 he served as co-chairman of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and represented plaintiffs in civil rights cases throughout the country.
        He is survived by his wife, Geraldine; two sons, Gregg and James, and a daughter, Laurie, all of Scarsdale; two sisters, Karen M. Weinhold of Hampton, N.H., and Priscilla A. Kipp of Townsend, Mass., and a brother, Frederick S. Mullen Jr. of Arlington, Mass.
