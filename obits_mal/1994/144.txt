        Mark Ross Locher, national communications director for the Screen Actors Guild, died on Friday at Hollywood Community Hospital in Hollywood. He was 37 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was AIDS, the performers' union said.
        Mr. Locher, a native of Hollywood, graduated from Occidental College and earned a Master of Fine Arts degree from Northwestern University in 1980. He then joined the guild and in 1985 was named national communications director.
        He also established the Screen Actors Guild Archives, a repository of photographs, papers and videotapes documenting the union's history.
        He is survived by his parents, Don and Patricia Locher of Sierra Madre, Calif; two brothers, John of Seattle, and Paul of San Diego; and a sister, Deborah Gregg of Las Vegas, Nev.
