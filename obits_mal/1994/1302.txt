        Carroll J. Mealey, a lawyer in Albany for nearly 40 years who served on several statewide judicial and professional panels, died on Monday at Albany Memorial Hospital in Albany. He was 64 and lived in Loudonville, N.Y.
        The cause was heart failure, said a family spokesman.
        Among other appointments, Mr. Mealey was named by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the Appellate Division Task Force, which drew up recommendations for procedures in the state's appellate courts in 1989, and to the Joint Commission on Judicial Administration, formed to increase speed and efficiency of the courts, in 1985. He also served on a state panel overseeing professional standards and was a referee for the State Commission on Judical Conduct.
        He was a senior partner in the law firm DeGraff, Foy, Holt-Harris & Mealey.
        An Albany native, he graduated from College of the Holy Cross in 1951, and received his law degree from Harvard University in 1954.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Eileen Mealey; two sons, John C., of Enfield, Conn., and Michael J., of Manhattan; three daughters, Colleen M. Geary of Loudonville, Kathleen M. Noyes of Manhattan, and Gail M. Quinn of Fairfield, Conn.; two stepsons, John F. Doyle 3d and Kevin H. Doyle, both of Loudonville; a brother, the Rev. John H. Mealey of Albany, and four grandchildren.
