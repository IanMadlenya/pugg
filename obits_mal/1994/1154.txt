        Dr. Wladimir Theodore Liberson, a physician and medical researcher, died on Sept. 3 at the Miami Heart Institute in Miami. He was 90 and lived in North Miami Beach.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his wife, Dr. Cathryn Liberson.
        Dr. Wladimir Liberson was a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation and was associated with Dr. Howard Adelglass, with offices in Manhattan, for about three years, until late 1993.
        Concurrently, Dr. Adelglass said, Dr. Liberson was a specialist in electromyography, a measure of muscular impulses. He was also an expert in interpreting electroencephalograms and was prominent in the field of evoked potentials, a method in which a computer analyzes brain waves.
        At his death, Dr. Liberson, who wrote many articles in medical journals, was an editor of the journal Electromyography and Clinical Neurophysiology.
        Born in Russia, he received his medical degree from the University of Paris in 1936, came to the United States in 1940 and earned a Ph.D. in physiology at the University of Montreal in 1951.
        In the United States, his family said, he did research and other work at hospitals in Hartford, Chicago, Miami and at the Brooklyn-Cumberland Medical Center in Brooklyn.
        A marriage in 1929 to Dr. Miriam Liberson ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Cathryn Liberson, he is survived by two daughters, Annette Liberson and Helen Keers, both of Manhattan; a stepson, Franklin Walters of North Miami Beach, a grandchild and five step-grandchildren.
