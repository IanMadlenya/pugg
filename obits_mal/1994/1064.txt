        Ronald Rawson, a broadcaster and producer who established several summer theaters on Long Island, died on July 18 at his home in Cohasset, Mass. He was 76 and also had a home in New York City.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Rawson began his first theater, the Westhampton Playhouse, in 1951; he later established the John Drew Theater in East Hampton, and mounted several Broadway-bound productions there. He presented a number of actors and actresses who were to become well-known, including Eva Marie Saint, Tammy Grimes and Keir Dullea, in their first professional stage roles. From 1968 to 1988, he operated the South Shore Music Circus in Cohasset.
        Mr. Rawson was born in Clear Lake, Iowa, and attended Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. In the 1940's and 50's, he was a program announcer and commercial spokesman for radio and television shows, among them "Can You Top This?," "Adventures of the Thin Man" and "The Colgate Comedy Hour."
        He was a president of the New York Screen Actors Guild and a national officer of the guild. At the time of his death, he was the chairman of the Motion Picture Players Welfare Fund in New York and the president of the South Shore Art Center in Massachusetts.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two daughters, Jan McCormick of Chicago and Jean Rawson-Terhaar of Rockville, Md.; a sister, Marlys Rawson of Garner, Iowa; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
