        Douglas A. Pagliotti, the production stage manager for the Old Globe Theater  in San Diego, died on Tuesday at his home. He was 36 and lived in San Diego.
        The cause was AIDS, said Will Roberson, his companion.
        Mr. Pagliotti, a native of Santa Barbara, Calif., was a graduate of the Pacific Conservatory of Performing Arts in Santa Monica, Calif., and of Webster  College in St. Louis. Before the Globe, he worked at the Denver Center Theater Company, the St. Louis Repertory Theater, the Huntington Theater Company in Boston and the Hartford Stage.
        At the Old Globe, which he joined in 1980, he managed more than 150 productions, including the world premieres of Neil Simon's "Rumors," Stephen Sondheim's "Into the Woods" and A. R. Gurney's "Cocktail Hour." He was production stage manager of the Globe's revival of "Damn Yankees," which moved on to Broadway.
        In addition to Mr. Roberson, he is survived by his parents, Angelo and Barbara Pagliotti; three sisters, Gigi and Angela Pagliotti and Janelle Ryan, and a brother, Ted Roche, all of Santa Barbara.
