        Gerald Lee Bledsoe, whose career as a broadcaster took him to stations from Buffalo to New York City to Washington and finally Detroit, died on Sept. 27 at his home in Detroit. He was 51.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Bledsoe had a music-and-talk program, "Nite Mix," on WMXD-FM in Detroit. His distinctive voice was also heard nationally on television commercials.
        He joined the Detroit station in 1992 after working for stations in Washington. "Nite Mix" on MIX 92.3, a program of love songs and ballads, was aimed primarily at a black audience.
        Mr. Bledsoe, a native of Lineville, Ala., got his start in radio at the age of 16 at station WUFO in Buffalo. He came to New York City in 1967 and joined WWRL as a disk jockey, later becoming the host of programs on WBLS. While in New York in the 1970's he was also the co-producer of a television program called "Soul" for Channel 13 and the host for another show on WPIX, "Soul Alive".
        Mr. Bledsoe's marriage, to Tracy Nicholas, ended in divorce.
        He is survived by a son, Carlos, of Kettering, Md.; two daughters, Lisa, also of Kettering, and Lauren, of Teaneck, N.J; his parents, Jewell Dobbs Bledsoe of Kettering, and Greene Bledsoe of Milwaukee; two sisters, Rebecca, of Los Angeles, and Janice Rachell of Palmdale, Calif., and a brother, Robert, of Los Angeles.
