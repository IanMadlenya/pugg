        Joseph Harold Reid, who was executive director of the Child Welfare League of America for 25 years until his retirement in 1978, died last Friday at his home in Melbourne Beach, Fla. A former resident of Bellerose, L.I., he was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Born in Lima, Ohio, Mr. Reid earned a B.A. and a master's in social work at the University of Washington. Before he joined the staff of the league in 1950 as assistant executive director, he served four years as an officer in the Navy and six years at the Ryther Child Center in Seattle.
        He became executive director of the Child Welfare League, an alliance of private agencies, in 1953. During his tenure, the organization was based in Manhattan; it has since moved to Washington.
        Mr. Reid was a leading spokesman for child welfare. He addressed the subject at meetings throughout the United States and Canada and in many other parts of the world. He directed research for the league on such topics as hard-to-place and runaway children, adoption, centers for emotionally disturbed children and setting national standards in the field of child welfare.
        He served on the board of the National Assembly of National Voluntary and Social Welfare Organizations. He was a vice president of the Christian Children's Fund and of the American Parents Committee, as well as deputy president of the International Union on Child Welfare and member of many governmental committees and commissions.
        Mr. Reid is survived by his wife of 34 years, Bierte Matthiessen Reid; a daughter, Susan Reid of Columbus, Ohio; a son, Nicholas M., of Port Townsend, Wash.; a stepson, Martin Teixeira of Cocoa, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Maggie Techara of Topeka, Kan.; three brothers, Bruce, of Port Townsend, William, of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, and Keith, of Sedona, Ariz.; a sister, Nancy Raab of Santa Barbara, Calif., and five grandchildren.
