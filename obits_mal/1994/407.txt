        Peter G. S. Mero, a retired entrepreneur in the telecommunications industry, died on Sunday at Evanston Hospital in Evanston, Ill. He was 84 and lived in Wilmette, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Mero was born in Budapest and educated in Vienna and at the Technical University of Leipzig, Germany. He started his career with the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in Zurich and London, marketing I.T.T. products and services in Central and Eastern Europe.
        He immigrated to the United States shortly before World War II, was commissioned into the Army Signal Corps and served as communications officer for the Office of Strategic Services in Algiers from 1943 to 1945.
        After the war he became a Government and Red Cross communications consultant. He subsequently was an executive vice president of the Comptometer Corporation before starting his own company, the Extel Corporation of Northbrook, Ill., in 1968.
        Mr. Mero held more than 20 patents for electronic and telecommunications equipment he developed over more than 40 years. He retired as president and chairman of Extel in 1982, and sold the company several years later.
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah Sabow Mero; three daughters, Christine Mero and Jennifer Ickes, both of Northampton, Mass., and Sally Martin of Washington; a sister, Dr. Agi Plenk of Salt Lake City, and four grandchildren.
