        Carlos Jacott, owner of the popular Mexican restaurant El Parador Cafe in mid-Manhattan for 32 years, died last Saturday in New York University Medical Center. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        A native of the Mexican town of Dolores in Chihuahua, his parents took him to the United States at an early age. He attended the University of Iowa, where he had his first taste of restaurant life, as a waiter to stretch his income.
        He opened El Parador on Second Avenue and 31st Street in 1959, and it quickly became a success. It moved to its present location, at 325 East 34th Street, 10 years later. It was sold to the current owners, Manuel and Jose Alejandro, in 1990.
        Mr. Jacott is survived by his wife of 42 years, Julie Garcia Jacott; a son, Carlos of Chicago; two sisters, Leisha Hollis of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., and Tenchie Gillespie of Phoenix; three brothers, Raul, also of Phoenix, and Hector and Manuel, both of Globe, Ariz.
