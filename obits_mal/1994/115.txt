        Georges Paques, a former press officer for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization who admitted giving allied military data to the Russians and who was convicted of treason to his native France in 1964, died in Paris on Dec. 19. He was 79.
        Mr. Paques was convicted in Paris by a five-member Court for the Security of the State and was sentenced to life in prison. But President Charles de Gaulle reduced the sentence to 20 years, and Mr. Paques was released in 1970, after having served six years.
        The public prosecutor at his brief trial, Andre Caron, declared that the ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs of France and the Secretary General of NATO had stated that the information that Mr. Paques admitted having passed to the Soviet Union was harmful to France and to its allies.
        He spent years as a high official in various French Government ministries before going to work for NATO, in the Paris area, in 1962. He was eventually arrested by French counterintelligence agents.
        In a statement before the court retired to deliberate, Mr. Paques declared:
        "I beg you to believe me. I have never been a Soviet agent. Everything I did was to assure France's survival."
        The heart of Mr. Caron's summation at the trial was a recital of the most important documents that Mr. Paques had given to his Soviet contacts in a liaison that began in Algiers during World War II and continued until he was arrested in 1963.
