        Felix Kelly, a New Zealand-born artist known for his paintings of stately country houses, died on July 3 in Devonshire in southwestern England. He was 80 and had lived in Britain since 1938.
        He had had Alzheimer's disease for two years, The Times of London reported.
        One of Mr. Kelly's last paintings was of Highgrove, Prince Charles' mansion in Gloucestershire, in western England. Earlier, Mr. Kelly helped the prince with its remodeling.
        Summing up Mr. Kelly's career, the British newspaper The Independent said last week that when he painted portraits of well-to-do clients' homes, "the mystical, evocative ambiance which he bestowed upon these houses was enormously appealing."
        His artwork also included book illustrations and stage designs for productions at the Old Vic and elsewhere. And he had a hand in embellishing or altering other grand country houses.
        Mr. Kelly was born and educated in New Zealand. He continued painting while serving as a Royal Air Force officer in World War II and had his first one-man show in 1943 in London.
