        George H. Lesch, a former chairman and chief executive of the Colgate-Palmolive Company, died last Thursday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 84.
        Mr. Lesch was president and chief executive of the Manhattan-based company, whose headquarters are at 300 Park Avenue, from 1960 to 1971. He was chairman from 1961 to 1974.
        In 1968, after the company posted record sales and earnings, he said that achievement reflected "continuing success in introducing new products with high consumer acceptance." Among the products that Colgate-Palmolive introduced while he headed the company were Ajax Detergent and Ajax Liquid.
        Mr. Lesch was born in Washburn, Ill., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois in 1931 and joined the company as an accountant in 1932.
        He became controller of its Mexican subsidiary in 1939 and later became president of that unit and then vice president of Colgate-Palmolive International, in charge of sales and advertising for Europe. He was president of the international unit from 1957 to 1960.
        Mr. Lesch is survived by his wife, Esther; two daughters, Georgette Copeland of Anchorage and Elizabeth Ramee of New Milford, Conn., four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
