        Edward Schwartzman, a political campaign specialist whose clients included former Mayor Abraham D. Beame of New York City and a New York gubernatorial candidate, Assemblyman Perry B. Duryea, died on Saturday in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 66 and had lived in Manhattan until 1983, when he moved to Bethesda.
        He died of complications from a heart attack, said his former wife, Robin Berman Schwartzman of Chevy Chase, Md.
        Mr. Schwartzman was among the first to use scientific telephone polling and canvassing techniques in political campaigns.
        He is survived by a son, Danny Berman Schwartzman of Chevy Chase, and a brother, David, of Brooklyn.
