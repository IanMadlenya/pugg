        Harry Abrams, who twice ran between Los Angeles and New York City in the late 1920's, died yesterday in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. He was 87.
        Mr. Abrams discovered he had a brain tumor two months ago, said Dale Adams, a daughter.
        In an age when non-Olympic races were considered entertainment, Mr. Abrams was a star, outrunning horses and participating in dance marathons in Madison Square Garden.
        But it was his accomplishment at age 21 that earned him a citation in Ripley's "Believe It or Not" and secured his small part in American sports history. In 1928, Mr. Adams ran over 84 days and 3,422 miles from Los Angeles through Chicago to New York in the Trans-Continental Race, which later became known as the Bunion Derby.
        Mr. Abrams, a 5-foot-10-inch, 135-pound runner, finished only 11th and did not win a share of the prize money. But in 1929, running in the opposite direction against 299 other men, he finished ninth and collected $1,500.
        During both races, the runners were expected to cover a specific distance each day, with the length varying according to the terrain. At night, they slept in tents as part of a caravan that included sideshow acts organized by the promoter of the races, C. C. (Cash and Carry) Pyle. Those who finished the race averaged 41 miles a day.
        Mr. Abrams traced his running exploits to his childhood on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Working as an errand boy for a lithographer, he would walk for blocks instead of taking a streetcar.
        "I could walk faster than the streetcar anyway," he recalled in an interview with The New York Times in 1991. "I pocketed that carfare."
        He is survived by two daughters, Ms. Adams of Briarcliff Manor and Carol Andiloro of Pearl River, N.Y.; a brother, Max Abrams, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. His wife of 56 years, Emma, died two years ago.
