        Bruce Peyton, a playwright and lyricist, died on Dec. 25 at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said James Seymour, a friend.
        Mr. Peyton's work was produced Off Broadway and at regional theaters. His credits include "Mother and Son Inc.," "Hazard County Wonder" and "Feathertop," a musical he wrote with Skip Kinnon. The show, based on a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne, was staged at the WPA Theater in 1984. His play "Live Wire" has toured schools around the country to educate teen-agers about AIDS.
        He was born in Paducah, Ky., and was a graduate of the University of Kentucky. He was on the faculty of the B.M.I. Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop.
        He is survived by his father, Billy Bruce Peyton, and a step-sister, Jeanie Gooud, both of Paducah.
