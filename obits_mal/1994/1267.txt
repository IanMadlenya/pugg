        Dakari Hru, a poet and an author of children's books, died on Aug. 31 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 42 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a brief illness, said Mary Jack Wald Associates, his literary representative.
        Mr. Hru's first picture book, "Joshua's Masai Mask," published in 1993, was described as "splendidly universal" in a review in The New York Times. A second picture book, "The Magic Moonberry Jump Ropes," is to be published by Dial Books for Young Readers in the spring of 1996. His poetry is to be included in an anthology to be published by Lee & Low Books in 1995.
        He was born in Pittsburgh and received a bachelor's degree in French from the University of Dayton in Ohio and a master's degree in organizational psychology from Columbia University. He was employed at the United Nations and, since 1985, was a contributing poet to "Reflections, Journal of the United Nations Society."
        He is survived by several cousins.
