        Dr. Murray Fuhrman, a radiologist whose 50-year career was spent in medicine, research and teaching, died June 30 at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, family members said.
        Dr. Fuhrman received his medical training at St. Andrew's University in Scotland and during the Spanish Civil War, organized and headed a British medical surgery unit in support of Republican forces.
        After returning to the United States, he completed a residency in thoracic surgery in 1940, but chose to enter the newly developing field of radiology. He began private practice in 1941 and was a co-founder of Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, Queens.
        Dr. Fuhrman was among the physicians invited in 1949 to the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies in Tennessee, where he worked on one of the early programs in nuclear medicine.
        He also taught medical students at the State University at Stony Brook, L.I., Queens Hospital Center and Long Island Jewish Hospital.
        Dr. Fuhrman is survived by his wife, Sylvia Howard Fuhrman, a special representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, and a daughter, Leni Fuhrman of New York City.
