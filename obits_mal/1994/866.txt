        Dr. Paul Ander, a professor of chemistry at Seton Hall University and co-author of the college textbook "Principles of Chemistry," died on Sunday at his home in Union, N.J. He was 63.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Ander's specialty was the physical chemistry of giant molecules, like a  protein or polymer molecule composed of hundreds of thousands of atoms. He wrote scores of articles on polymer chemistry. The textbook, one of several he co-wrote, was published in 1965.
        A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Ander was a graduate of City College. He received  a master's degree in chemistry from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and a doctorate from Rutgers University. He briefly taught at Rutgers as an instructor before joining the Seton Hall faculty in 1960 as an assistant professor.
        He had been a full professor since 1970. He oversaw Ph.D. students and the research of undergraduates. In 1973, he became the university's chief adviser on careers in the health professions, a position in which he counseled students wishing to train for medicine, dentistry, related health fields or research.
        He had research grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. Seton Hall awarded him its Bishop McQuaid Medal for outstanding service in 1985.
        Dr. Ander's wife, Ellen, died in 1988. He is survived by two sons, Harold of Marlboro, N.J., and Michael of Ocean Grove, N.J.; two brothers, Sy, of Boynton Beach, Fla., and Morris, of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and a grandson.
