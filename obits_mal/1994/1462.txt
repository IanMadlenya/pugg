        Charles Shirley, an arranger for big bands and a respected counselor on alcoholism, died on Friday at his home in Osprey, Fla. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Kay.
        Mr. Shirley wrote many arrangements and original scores for the big bands of Ray Anthony, Les Elgart, Stan Kenton and others, and for television series including "The Arthur Godfrey Show" and "The Ted Mack Family Hour." He also arranged and conducted several all-star jazz sessions for RCA Victor Records.
        He was one of the first people in popular music to become deeply involved with the treatment of alcoholics and was the director of industrial programs for the Alcoholism Council of Greater New York.
        His wife is his only survivor.
