        Robert S. Johnson, an advisory director of Lehman Brothers, the New York investment banking firm, died in New York Hospital on Sept. 14. He was 79.
        He died of a stroke, said A. Edward Gottesman, an associate.
        At his death, Mr. Johnson, who had a varied career in investment banking and industry, was a director of three British companies: Spode, Raleigh Industries and Royal Worcester.
        Mr. Johnson, who was born in Boston, received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan and obtained a law degree from Boston College. He later became a vice president of C.I.T. Financial Corporation.
        In 1968, he became a vice president of Loeb, Rhoades & Company, New York investment bankers. Soon afterward, he played an important part in bringing about a $1.2 billion merger between the C.I.T. Financial Corporation and the Xerox Corporation. It was then the biggest industrial merger in history.
        He became a Loeb Rhoades general partner, then a managing director, and beginning in 1984, an advisory director of successor firms, most recently Lehman Brothers.
        He was also chairman of Consulting Partners/TASA, a Zurich executive recruiting firm, in the 1960's and 1970's.
        Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Margaret Compton, and a daughter, Elizabeth, of Manhattan.
