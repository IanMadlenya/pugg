        Henry Osborne Havemeyer Frelinghuysen, a philanthropist, civic leader and breeder of thoroughbred horses, died on Wednesday at his home in Far Hills, N.J. Mr. Frelinghuysen, who also had a home in Northeast Harbor, Me., was 78.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Frelinghuysen came from one of New Jersey's oldest and most prominent families and was a twin brother of Peter Frelinghuysen, the former United States Representative.
        "I manage the family's affairs and indulge in a little horse-raising," Henry once said of himself.
        His interests also included the arts and a range of charitable undertakings. He was a former board chairman of the Association to Benefit Children in New York City, a former president of New Jersey's Historical Society, a former trustee of the New York City Ballet and a former board president of the Far Hills Country Day School, as well as a former board president of the New Jersey Thoroughbred Breeders Association.
        He was a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law School and served with the Army Air Force in Korea.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marian Kingsland; a son, George L. K. Frelinghuysen, and a stepson, Henry W. Seherr-Thoss, both of New York City; two brothers, George G., of Palm Beach, Fla., and Peter H. B., of Morristown, N.J.; a sister, Frederica F. Emert of Philadelphia, two grandchildren and five step-grandchildren.
