        Clement Biddle Wood Jr., a novelist who for many years was an editor of The Paris Review, died on Sunday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 69 and had lived in nearby Water Mill since 1983.
        The cause was complications from colon cancer, said Clement Biddle Wood 3d, his son.
        Mr. Wood attended Harvard University and, as president of the Harvard Lampoon in 1948, he was one of the writers who helped shape the brand of irreverent humor that was to define the magazine for many years.
        Mr. Wood's first novel, "Welcome to the Club," published in 1966 by McGraw-Hill, was shaped by his experiences as a lieutenant in World War II.
        The book, a darkly comic examination of racial prejudice and bureaucratic intransigence, tells of the visit of a black U.S.O. troupe to an Army base in Hiroshima, Japan, during the early days of the Allied occupation. It was described by a reviewer in The New York Times as "one of the funniest -- and most serious -- books of the year."
        Mr. Wood's second book, "Ocean Vu, Jog to Beach," was published in 1988 by St. Martin's Press.
        George Plimpton, the editor of The Paris Review, said Mr. Wood had served as a sort of international editor of the literary magazine.
        Mr. Wood was at work on a biography of Irwin Shaw, one of his literary influences, when he died.
        While living abroad, he also wrote screenplays for American and European movies.
        He is survived by his wife, Jessie Leigh-Hunt Bruce and by four children from his first marriage: a daughter, Marion Covey of Chicago, and three sons, Clement and Alexander, of Manhattan, and Willard, of Seattle.
        He is also survived by four stepchildren, Cabell Bruce of Manhattan, Leigh Bruce of London, Thomas Bruce of Washington and James Bruce of San Diego; his first wife, Jane Wood Harvey of Grasse, France; a brother, William, of West Grove, Pa., a sister, Emily Wood of Philadelphia, and 11 grandchildren.
