        Msgr. John P. Brehney, the founding principal of Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx, died on Monday at St. John's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 74.
        The cause was a stroke, said Msgr.  John M. Harrington, a friend.
        Cardinal Spellman High School opened in 1960 and Monsignor Brehney was its principal until 1976. He then became the pastor of Our Lady of Fatima Parish in Scarsdale, N.Y., a position he held at the time of his death.
        He was ordained in 1945 and received a doctorate in education from Harvard University in 1954.
        He taught history at Cardinal Hayes High School and served for 10 years as associate superintendent of schools and co-director of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine for the Archdiocese of New York.
