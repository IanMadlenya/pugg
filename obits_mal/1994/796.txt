        Philip Vera Cruz, who helped found the United Farm Workers union, died on Saturday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif., his hometown. He was 89.
        The cause was emphysema, said his wife, Deborah Vollmer.
        Born in Ilocos Sur, the Philippines, Mr. Vera Cruz came to the United States in 1926 and for the next 30 years worked at menial jobs on farms and in canneries and restaurants in Minnesota and Washington State. For a year, he attended Gonzaga University in Spokane, Wash.
        In the 1950's, he moved to California and helped bring together small groups of Filipino farm workers. That led to the formation in the 1960's of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, composed mainly of Filipinos, which engaged in a series of strikes in the California towns of Coachella and Delano. Merger Under Chavez
        With the success of these strikes, the Filipino faction in 1965 joined with agricultural workers of other ethnic groups, largely Mexican, to form the United Farm Workers, under the direction of Cesar Chavez. The union soon began a decade of strikes and other labor actions in its efforts to gain recognition and better salaries and working conditions.
        Mr. Vera Cruz resigned his post as second vice president of the union in 1977 because of differences with Mr. Chavez. Chief among them was Mr. Vera Cruz's belief that Mr. Chavez had become an apologist for Ferdinand Marcos, then President of the Philippines.
        In 1988, long after his retirement, Mr. Vera Cruz visited Manila, where President Corazon Aquino gave him an award for long service to Filipinos in the United States.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Vera Cruz is survived by a brother, Judge Martin Vera Cruz of Pagadian, the Philippines, and a sister, Leonor Retota of Vallejo, Calif.
