        Dr. Ralph W. Tyler, an educator who sought to find what students were learning in school by helping to devise a national testing program, died on Friday at St. Paul's Health Care Center in San Diego. He was 91.
        The cause of death was cancer, said a daughter, Ann Fathy.
        At the request of Federal officials, Dr. Tyler initiated the National Assessment of Education Progress, a series of surveys in the 1960's. They were intended to monitor the skills of American elementary and high school students. The first results confirmed that the knowledge and learning skills of students and young adults were greater when textbook information was reinforced by experience.
        Later surveys intended to determine the ability to read produced varying results. In 1976, a study showed that reading abilities had not deteriorated, but a survey in 1981 indicated that test scores were declining. The studies also called into question basic writing abilities, as well as students' comprehension of science and mathematics.
        Dr. Tyler helped to develop the studies in his position as the first director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, an independent research center established in 1953 by the Ford Foundation in Palo Alto, Calif. He retired from that center in 1967 and later joined the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif. In later years he was an academic consultant.
        He joined the University of Chicago in 1938, and became dean of its division of social sciences before leaving for Palo Alto 15 years later. Earlier, he had held academic posts at universities in Nebraska, North Carolina and Ohio.
        Dr. Tyler is survived by a son, Ralph W. Jr., of Manhattan; two daughters, Helen Parisi, of Evanston, Ill., and Mrs. Fathy, of San Diego, and a brother, Keith I., of Columbus, Ohio.
