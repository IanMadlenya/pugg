        Peter French, a retired editor of Business Week magazine who was also an author, died on Wednesday at his home in Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said his son David.
        Mr. French was with Business Week from 1951 until his retirement in 1972 and variously held the titles of news editor, associate managing editor, managing editor and chief of correspondents. He wrote two novels, "The Southern Cross" (1958) and "The Ocean Mistress" (1961) -- both about clipper ships -- and a nonfiction book, "The Long Reach: A Report on Harvard Today" (1962).
        He was born in Neenah, Wis., received a bachelor's degree in 1939 from Boston University and served in the Navy in World War II. He worked for General Electric and for other publications before joining Business Week.
        Mr. French's first marriage, to Catherina Korthals Altes, ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son David, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Josephine Wright French of Upper Black Eddy, Pa., from whom he was separated; two other sons, Stephen, of Arlington, Va., and Walter, of Williamstown, Mass.; a daughter, Caroline McGee of Marshfield, Mass., and six grandchildren.
