        Paul Frame, an award-winning illustrator of 300 children's books and the designer of Lord & Taylor's signature rose, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Jean.
        Mr. Frame, who was known for painstaking research and attention to detail, illustrated many books in the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys series, as well as editions of "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "Casey at the Bat" and "Knights of the Round Table."
        He was widely known for a series of how-to books, including "Drawing Dogs and Puppies" and "Drawing Cats and Kittens," published in the 1970's and 80's.
        Mr. Frame was born in Riderwood, Md. He studied at the Maryland Institute of Art and at the National Academy of Design. In the 1930's, he worked at Lord & Taylor, in the advertising department and with the fashion staff.
        He served with the Air Force in England during World War II. After his discharge, he returned to fashion and advertising illustration before beginning to work on children's books.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Mindy, of Manhattan, and Debbie, of Suffield, Conn.
