        Dr. George Sherman Avery Jr., a plant physiologist who headed the Brooklyn Botanic Garden from 1944 to 1969, died on Friday at Greentree Manor Convalescent Center in New London, Conn. He was 92 and lived in Quaker Hill, Conn.
        He had been in declining health in recent years, said Elizabeth Scholtz, who was the Botanic Garden's director from 1972 to 1980.
        Before becoming director, Dr. Avery, whose Ph.D. was from the University of Wisconsin, was the director of the Connecticut Arboretum in New London, and professor of botany at Connecticut College, also in New London, where he had joined the faculty in 1931.
        A brief history of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, published in 1985 by the garden, said that Dr. Avery's time as director "has often been referred to as the Golden Years of the Garden." New gardens were added inside its 50 acres just east of Prospect Park. In the 1950's, the Iris Garden, the Fragrance Garden for the Blind and a garden of natural dwarf plants were established. In 1964, the replica of the Ryoanji Garden in Kyoto, Japan, was also built there.
        In addition, three new properties outside Brooklyn were acquired by the Botanic Garden in the 1950's and 1960's: the Kitchawan Field and Research Station, on more than 200 acres in Westchester County near Mt. Kisco; the Teatown Lake Reservation, with more than 400 acres for children and adults, also near Mt. Kisco, and the Clark Garden, a 12-acre plot with ponds, a rose garden and other attractions, in Albertson in Nassau County.
        Dr. Avery's writings included the book "Hormones and Horticulture" (1947), of which he was a co-author.
        In the 1950's, he served as president of the Botanical Society of America and of the Museums Council, comprising representatives of more than 40 museums, botanical gardens and other educational institutions in New York City. He was also a trustee of Brooklyn Hospital and Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn.
        Dr. Avery was born in Benton Harbor, Mich. and received a B.S. from Tulane University and an M.S. from Dartmouth College.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Virginia Kellogg, whom he married in 1926; a daughter, Mary Virginia Craig of Toms River, N.J.; and six grandchildren.
        Correction:  August 17, 1994, Wednesday
        An obituary on Aug. 8 about Dr. George Sherman Avery Jr., a plant physiologist who headed the Brooklyn Botanic Garden from 1944 to 1969, misstated his age and the date of his death. He was 91, not 92, and he died on Aug. 6, not Aug. 5. The obituary also omitted his surviving great-grandchildren. There are seven.
