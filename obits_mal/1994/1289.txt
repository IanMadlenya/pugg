        Harold H. Wein, a retired professor of economics and business management, died on Oct. 13 at Michigan Capitol Medical Center in Lansing. He was 78 and lived in Okemos, Mich.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Professor Wein taught at Michigan State University from 1959 until his retirement eight years ago. He helped develop anti-trust legislation and the regulation of public utilities and organized the university's Institute of Public Utilities. During a leave in the early 1960's he served as chief economist for the Federal Power Commission.
        He was born in New York City, and received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from City College and a master's degree in economics from Columbia University.
        He worked as a senior economist in the antitrust division of the Justice Department before starting his academic career at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1954, the year he completed his doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh.
        Professor Wein is survived by his wife of 55 years, Helen Koven Wein; a son, Louis, of Everett, Wash.; two daughters, Joan Brigham of Charlotte, N.C., and Margaret Wein of Chicago; a sister, Shirley Warshaw of Floral Park, L.I., and two granddaughters.
