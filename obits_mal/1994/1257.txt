        Preston Townley, president and chief executive of the Conference Board, a not-for-profit business-research organization, died on Friday at Baptist Medical Center on Amelia Island, Fla. He was 55 and lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
        He suffered a heart attack on a tennis court on the island, where he was attending a business meeting, said his daughter, Alison.
        Mr. Townley became president of the Conference Board, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, in 1988, after being dean of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota for four years. He was executive vice president for consumer foods at General Mills from 1981 to 1983.
        More than 2,500 corporations in over 50 countries underwrite and participate in the Conference Board's programs, which include carrying out surveys on consumer confidence, international economic trends and business management practices. It also holds conferences involving business and government figures and organizes meetings of business executives.
        At his death, Mr. Townley was a director of the Donaldson Company, GoodMark Foods Inc. and the TCF Financial Corporation.
        He was born in Minneapolis and received a bachelor's degree in 1960 and a master's degree in business administration in 1962 from Harvard University. He joined General Mills in 1964 and was president of the Harvard Alumni Association in 1988 and 1989.
        In addition to his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Marcia Kinnear and two sons, Patrick of Minneapolis and Michael of Manhattan.
