        William S. Renchard, who guided Chemical Bank from a largely regional institution into what was to become a global financial power, died on Monday at Glen Cove Hospital. Mr. Renchard, who lived in Glen Cove, L.I., was 86.
        The cause was a stroke, his daughter, Christine Huffman, said.
        Mr. Renchard was with Chemical Bank for 48 years, serving as president from 1960 to 1973 and chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors from 1973 until 1978, when he retired.
        During his leadership the bank doubled its assets to more than $15 billion. It was during this period that the bank, then a regional financial institution with only one foreign office, expanded its international presence. Today, Chemical Bank is represented in 33 countries.
        Mr. Renchard began working at the bank at the start of the Depression in a position, as he put it, that was "at the bottom of the barrel" -- clipping coupons from bonds -- and began a slow but steady climb up the corporate ladder.
        He also served from 1973 to 1977 as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent watchdog group that monitors the financial practices of New York's city and state governments.
        Mr. Renchard graduated from Princeton University in 1928 and served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Alice Renchard of Glen Cove; three daughters, Jeanie Renchard-Adcock of Carbondale, Colo., Cynthia French of Boulder, Colo., and Mrs. Huffman of Great Falls, Va.; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
