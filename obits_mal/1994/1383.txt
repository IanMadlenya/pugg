        Dr. George D. Sands, a NASA project scientist who was the spokesman for the Viking spacecraft missions to Mars in 1976, died on Nov. 2 at his home in Williamsburg, Va. He was 75.
        He died after a long illness, said his daughter, Kimberley Sands of Maryville, Tenn.
        As the "voice of Viking," Dr. Sands answered questions from scientists and reporters about the unmanned spacecraft's landings on July 20 and Sept. 3, 1976. The craft transmitted more than 1,400 photographs back to Earth showing deep canyons and channels carved into the planet's volcanic surface.
        At his retirement in 1979, Dr. Sands was chief of scientific and technical information programs at the Langley Research Center in Virginia.
        He received a bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary in 1939 and a doctorate in physical chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1945. He was a professor of chemistry at William and Mary from 1948 to 1959.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 52 years, Margaret; a son, Dr. William Douglas Sands of Pittsburgh, and a brother, William Balthis Sands of Decatur, Ill.
