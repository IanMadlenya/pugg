        Richard Kitchen, a home furnishings designer in Manhattan, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was 44 years old.
        The cause was AIDS, said a brother, Gregory.
        Mr. Kitchen, with his twin brother, Robert, designed household products like china, sheets and towels. They maintained a design studio in Soho.
        Richard Kitchen graduated from the State University at Stony Brook and received a master's degree in education from the City University of New York.
        Mr. Kitchen is survived by his brothers, Gregory and Robert, both of Manhattan, and his parents, James and Margaret Kitchen of Alexandria, Va.
