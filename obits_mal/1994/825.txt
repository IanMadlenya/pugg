        Robert L. Bates, a geologist who was a teacher, science writer and editor, died on Tuesday at Riverside Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. He was 82 and lived in Columbus.
        The cause was a heart attack at home, said his daughter, Dr. Helen McDermott.
        He taught geology at Ohio State University from 1951 until his retirement in 1977, rising from assistant professor to full professor. He was a specialist in nonmetallic earth materials, and his writings included "Geology and World Deposits," a 1990 book of which he was a co-author.
        He was born in Brookings, S.D., grew up in Manchester, Vt. He received his B.A. in geology from Cornell University and his Ph.D. in geology from the University of Iowa.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Rochester, Minn., Professor Bates is survived by his wife, Marion Hoftyzer Bates; a son, Steven, of Evanston, Ill., and a granddaughter.
