        Neil J. Walsh, an insurance executive and former city commissioner who helped bring the 1976 Democratic National Convention to New York, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. He was 65 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Jamie, through a spokesman.
        At his death, Mr. Walsh was the chairman of the Walsh Group, a New York-based insurance organization.
        During the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame, he was Deputy Commissioner and then Commissioner of Public Events. He was also the coordinator of the Mayor's committee that strove successfully to get the Democratic Party to hold its 1976 convention in the city.
        As part of that effort, he helped organize a presentation and a tour for the Democratic National Committee. After the choice of New York became known, he said, "The Big Apple is shining again."
        Mr. Walsh was also something of a philanthropist. After the city -- in the administration of Mayor Robert F. Wagner -- stopped underwriting the annual cost of having a four-inch-wide, two-and-a-half-mile green line painted down the center of Fifth Avenue to mark the St. Patrick's Day parade route, Mr. Walsh paid for the labor and materials. In 1977, he said he had made provisions for future line-painting in his will.
        Over the years, he was chairman of Daytop Village, a drug rehabilitation center, and prominent in the Knights of St. Patrick, the National Conference of Christians and Jews and other nonprofit groups.
        A native New Yorker, he grew up in the Bronx, graduated from Canterbury School in New Milford, Conn., and attended Georgetown University.
        His two marriages ended in divorce.
        Besides his son, of Manhattan, he is survived by two sisters, Jeanne Mahony of Bronxville, N.Y., and Marion Henze Bassett of Hobe Sound, Fla.
