        Charles G. Bolte, a former executive vice president of the Viking Press in New York and vice president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, died on Monday at Kennebec Valley Medical Center in Augusta, Me. He was 74 and lived in Gardiner, Me.
        He had a short illness, his family said.
        Mr. Bolte was born in Manhattan and graduated from Dartmouth College. He spent two years at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and joined the British Army before Pearl Harbor, losing a leg at the battle of El Alamein in North Africa.
        In 1943, he was the founding chairman of the American Veterans Committee, whose motto was "Citizens First, Veterans Second." He subsequently worked as an adviser to the Unites States Mission at the United Nations.
        He joined Viking in the early 1950's, and also served as executive secretary of the American Book Publishers Council and as a director of the American Civil Liberties Union. He left Viking in 1966 for the Carnegie Endowment.
        He moved to Maine in 1972 to become a freelance writer. He was the author of several books, including "The Price of Peace: A Plan for Disarmament" (1956).
        Mr. Bolte is survived by two sons, Guy W. 2d of White Deer, Pa., and John C. of Hollis, Me.; a daughter, Brooks B. Randolph of Pittston, Me.; a brother, Alan of Ocala, Fla.; a sister, Linda B. Whitlock of Waterford, Conn., and 10 grandchildren.
