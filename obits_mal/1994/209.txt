        Tom Morrow, a designer and painter, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A graduate of Parsons School of Design, Mr. Morrow started out as a book illustrator and designer of posters for hit shows on Broadway, including "Zorba," "Fiddler on the Roof," "Candide" and "Cabaret."
        Mr. Morrow is survived by two sisters, Carol Gilligan of Maplewood, N.J., and Joan Postol of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jimmy, of Manhattan.
