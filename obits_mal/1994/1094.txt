        Jeff Wadlington, who danced with the Paul Taylor Dance Company, died on Saturday at his home in Galisteo, N.M. He was 29.
        The cause was AIDS, said Nelson Bloncourt, his companion.
        Mr. Wadlington was a dancer with a sunny, boyish charm that was captured in the "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" solo Mr. Taylor created for him in "Company B." He trained in dance with Richard Kuch and Richard Gain at the North Carolina School of the Arts and danced in New York in the mid-1980's with the companies of May O'Donnell and Joyce Trisler.
        Mr. Wadlington was the first scholarship student at Mr. Taylor's school and the first student to graduate into the company. He performed with Mr. Taylor from 1985 to 1993. The other roles created for him included Himself, as He Reflects, in "Speaking in Tongues." Mr. Wadlington's choreography was performed at the Marymount Theater in New York City and Railyard Performance Space in Santa Fe, N.M.
        In addition to Mr. Bloncourt, he is survived by his parents, Kathy and Roger Wadlington; two brothers, Michael and Mark, and a sister, Kelly, all of Pine Bluff, Ark.
