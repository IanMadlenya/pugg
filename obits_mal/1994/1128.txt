        Nicky Hopkins, a keyboardist who played on albums by the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks and other top rock bands of the 1960's and 70's, died on Tuesday at the St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville, where he lived. He was 50.
        The cause was complications from previous intestinal surgeries, said his stepson, Tristan Buchanan.
        Mr. Hopkins, who was born in London, began his career as a member of the flamboyant British rock band Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages in the late 1950's. In the 1960's, he started working as a studio musician and remains best known for playing on the Rolling Stones songs "Jumping Jack Flash" and "Sympathy for the Devil." Though he recorded with the Beatles on only one single, "Revolution," he went on to perform on solo albums by all four members of the band. He declined offers to join the Rolling Stones and an early incarnation of Led Zeppelin because he did not want to leave session work. tktktkEarly Career
        In 1967, he released his first solo album, "The Revolutionary Piano of Nicky Hopkins," and then toured briefly in the Jeff Beck Group. After recording one album with his own group, Sweet Thursday, Mr. Hopkins moved to northern California and worked with the Quicksilver Messenger Service, the Steve Miller Band, Harry Nilsson, Jerry Garcia and Jefferson Airplane, with whom he performed at Woodstock.
        In the 1970's and 1980's Mr. Hopkins shuttled back and forth between New York and London as a studio player and recorded two more solo albums. In 1990, he signed with the publisher Hamstein Music Group and turned his attention to songwriting and composing for film and television.
        Mr. Hopkins is survived by his wife, Moira, of Nashville, and his mother, Freda, and two sisters, Dee and Julia, all of whom live in England, and a brother, Paul, who lives in Austria.
