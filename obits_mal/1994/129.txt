        George B. Balamut, a retired senior partner of the law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, died on Saturday at his home in New York City. He was 81.
        His family said he had been ill for a long time.
        Mr. Balamut, who retired in 1984, had been in charge of the firm's banking practice, principally its representation of Manufacturers Hanover Trust.  He was also a personal counselor to many of its chairmen.
        He began his career at the firm of Newman & Biscoe and joined Simpson Thacher in 1952. He was instrumental in negotiating the merger of the Manufacturers Trust Company and the Hanover Bank in 1961. That merger led to five years of antitrust litigation by the Department of Justice that was resolved by the Bank Merger Act of 1966.
        Mr. Balamut is survived by his wife of 53 years, Rose Jacobs Balamut of New York City; a daughter, Susan Balamut Heath of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
