        Major Lance, a Chicago-born soul singer whose biggest hits were in the 1960's, died on Saturday at his home in Decatur, Ga. He was 55.
        The cause was heart disease, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Lance performed at music festivals and clubs until his death, said his agent, Linda Speer. In June, he sang at the 11th annual Chicago Blues Festival as part of its Chicago Soul Revue.
        Mr. Lance's 1963 hit single "Monkey Time," "signaled the birth of the Chicago Sound," The Chicago Sun-Times recalled. At this year's Chicago Blues Festival, Mr. Lance, wiry and energetic, urged the audience to do "The Monkey Time," as he had three decades before.
        That single and his 1964 hit "Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um were both written by Curtis Mayfield, who wrote and produced Mr. Lance's first single, "I Got a Girl -- Phyllis."
        Among Mr. Lance's other recordings was "Monkey Times" (Edsel Records, 1984), which has been praised as his finest collection.
        He was a boxer for a time, and started out singing gospel.
        His survivors include his wife, Christine Boular Lance, and nine children.
