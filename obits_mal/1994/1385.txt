        Maurice Robert Smith, who commanded an Army balloon unit in World War I, died on Oct. 30th at his home in Lake Wales, Fla. He had turned 100 on July 4.
        Mr. Smith had been in declining health for the last six months, his family said.
        In World War I he was a major in the American Expeditionary Force in Europe, in charge of tethered, or captive, balloons, which were used to observe troop movements and to help direct gunfire. The army deployed about a dozen such units.
        Born in Linneus, Mo., he graduated from Yale University and worked as an insurance executive.
        He is survived by a daughter, Marianne Helms of Mountain Lake, Fla., and Geneva; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
