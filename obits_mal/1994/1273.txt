        Ben Andrew Kubasik, a former public-relations executive and film critic who wrote about television for New York Newsday, died on Wednesday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 65 and lived in Larchmont, N.Y.
        The cause was fungal pneumonia, said his son Christopher.
        Mr. Kubasik was born in Erie, Pa. After earning a bachelor's and a master's degree in theater from Catholic University in Washington, he became a film critic for Newsday and later the manager of public relations at CBS News. In 1967 he was made the executive director of the National Citizens Committee for Public Television. The committee was made up of 100 leaders in the arts, education and business, who banded together to support the goals of public television and the recently created Corporation for Public Braodcasting.
        The committee disbanded in 1970, riven by internal dissension and unable to hold on to its corporate contributors. That year, Mr. Kubasik formed Ben Kubasik Inc., a public-relations company whose clients included "The Adams Chronicles," "The Cousteau Odyssey" and The New Yorker magazine. Mr. Kubasik had covered television for New York Newsday for the last decade.
        In addition to his son Christopher, of Campton, Ky., he is survived by his wife, Claire; two other sons, Matthew of Ithaca, N.Y., and Tom of Brattleboro, Vt.; a daughter, Carmel, of Larchmont; a brother, Edward, of Erie, and a sister, Josephine Kacnerski of Fairview, Pa.
