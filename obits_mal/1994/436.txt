        Mark Stevenson, an actor who performed solo shows on Keats and Shakespeare and also established a booking agency in New York, died on Wednesday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said his mother, Dorothy Stevenson.
        Mr. Stevenson's best-known show was "A Visitation From John Keats," which he performed at the Circle Repertory in New York, the Lincoln Center Library, the Edinburgh Festival and the Keats House in Hempstead, England. His other shows included "Shedding Light on Shakespeare" and "The Great F. Scott," a biographical piece about Fitzgerald.
        Mr. Stevenson's agency, Living Literature, booked solo touring shows nationwide to universities, schools and general audiences. He was a 1971 graduate of Amherst College.
        He is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert W. Stevenson of Lancaster, Pa., and three brothers, David, of Washington, John, of Mount Pleasant, Mich., and Philip, of San Francisco.
