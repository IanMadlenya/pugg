        Paul Berna, an author of children's books that were published in the United States and Britain as well as in his native France, died last Friday in Paris. He was 85.
        Mr. Berna's books -- he wrote one a year from 1957 to 1973 -- are mainly mystery and adventure stories for older children. His 1958 book, "The Horse Without a Head," about a gang of street urchins in a working-class Paris suburb, was praised for its portrayal of resourceful youngsters on a spree in the mean streets of their slum neighborhood. The book became a British-made Disney film in 1963, with a script by T. E. B. Clarke.
        Mr. Berna's 1961 book "Threshold of the Stars," about schoolboys watching a spaceship being built, was praised by American critics as sensitive, affecting and engrossing. A 1969 sequel, "Continent in the Sky," dealt with the new frontiers of space.
        Mr. Berna, whose original name was Jean Sabran, was born in Hyeres, France. He worked on a suburban newspaper in the 1930's before turning to children's books.
        He married Jeanne Saint-Marcoux in 1958. They had two sons.
