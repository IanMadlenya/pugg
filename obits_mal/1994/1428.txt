        Booker T. Washington 3d, a retired New York architect and grandson of the educator and author, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 79 and lived in Harlem.
        He had been in failing health for several years, said his wife, Joyce Dodson Washington.
        He worked for a number of firms, including Harrison & Abramovitz and Rogers Butler & Burgun, and was involved in the planning and design of the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, Rockefeller University and the Pan Am Building, among others.
        Mr. Washington was born in Tuskegee, Ala., and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1938 from the Tuskegee Institute, which was founded by his grandfather. He continued his training at New York University, Columbia University, the Institute of Design and Construction and the American Institute of Architects.
        Besides his wife of 27 years, Mr. Washington is survived by a son, Dr. Larry H., of Richmond, and a granddaughter, Amanda.
