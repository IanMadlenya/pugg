        George M. Cunha, an internationally respected expert in preserving books, documents, posters and brittle historical materials, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph Hospital in Lexington, Ky. He was 82 and had lived in Kentucky since 1980.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said the Northeast Document Conservation Center in Andover, Mass., which he co-founded and directed.
        Mr. Cunha's interest in preserving historical documents began in 1963 when he became chief conservator at the Library of the Boston Athenaeum. Within a decade he was asked by others engaged in restoring the region's history to help develop a program to halt the deterioration of historical documents, architectural drawings and the like.
        The result was the center, organized as a nonprofit institution in Topsfield, Mass., in 1973. It was conceived as a way to answer the concerns of the state librarians of the six New England states, but it soon had clients in New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware.
        Since then, the center has served about 2,000 other nonprofit institutions by providing services like bookbinding, paper conservation and microfilming brittle objects.
        Mr. Cunha was well known for his expertise in the preservation of historical materials, teaching and serving as a consultant across the United States and abroad. He was the mentor of hundreds of students and professionals in the field.
        A native of Providence, R.I., Mr. Cunha graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the United States Naval War College. He served as a combat pilot during World War II, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross, and later served as an underwater weapons specialist until 1963.
        He is survived by two sons, James H. of Lexington, and George Jr. of San Diego; a brother, Robert M. of Myrtle Beach, S.C.; a sister, Constance C. Foley of McLean, Va.; 14 grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.
