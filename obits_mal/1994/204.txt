        Dr. Roy L. Reierson, a former executive of and chief economist for Bankers Trust Company in New York City, died on Thursday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Dr. Reierson, who was 87, lived in Granite Springs, N.Y.
        The cause was complications following a fall, said his daughter, Kaari.
        After a 37-year career with the bank, Dr. Reierson retired in 1971 as a senior vice president who was widely respected on Wall Street for his conservative views on national economic policy. He was regarded as an expert on interest rates, the Federal budget and taxes and often testified before Congressional and banking groups.
        At various times Dr. Reierson served as a consultant to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and undertook special assignments for the Departments of Treasury and Commerce, and the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.
        Dr. Reierson graduated from St. Olaf College, and received master's and doctoral degrees from Northwestern University, where he later taught. Later he was a member of the faculty of the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria Reierson; two sons, Lars, of London and Kristofer, of Boston, and his daughter, Kaari Reierson of Washington.
