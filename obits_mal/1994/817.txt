        George L. Schultz, a philanthropist and former president of the toiletries manufacturer Shulton Inc., died on Friday at his summer home in Essex Fells, N.J. He was 77 and lived in Vero Beach, Fla.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Margaret S. Bilotti.
        In 1992, the Schultz Foundation, a family foundation of which he was the longtime president, gave $10 million for the construction of a laboratory building for Princeton University's molecular biology department. That structure was dedicated in 1993 and was named in his honor.
        Mr. Schultz, a Princeton alumnus, and the foundation, which was financed by his parents, provided support to numerous educational and medical institutions, and other nonprofit organizations, in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
        In 1992 the foundation gave $3 million to endow leukemia research facilities for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. The facilities also bear the Schultz family name.
        Mr. Schultz was born in New York, the son of William Lightfoot Schultz and the former Mabel LaVie. He earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton in 1940 and rose in the ranks of Shulton, the Clifton, N.J., company founded by his father.
        Mr. Schultz, who went to work for the company in 1936, went on to become president and chief executive officer from 1950 to 1971. In those years the company manufactured toiletries, perfumes and other products.
        In 1971, Mr. Schultz sold the company to American Cyanamid Company and was Shulton's chairman. He was a director of American Cyanamid until 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret F. Fraser, whom he married in 1941; four daughters, Margaret S. Bilotti, of Palm Beach, Fla., Katharine L. Fieldhouse of Santa Barbara, Calif., Marilyn S. Blackwell of Montpelier, Vt., and Elizabeth S. Vanderlinde of Rochester; seven grandchildren and a sister, Elizabeth S. Rigg of Greenwich, Conn.
