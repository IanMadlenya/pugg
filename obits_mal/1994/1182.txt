        Lawrence K. Rosinger, an author of books on China who was questioned by the Senate Internal Security subcommittee in 1952, died last Wednesday in the nursing home unit of the Hillside Terrace retirement community in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 78 and lived in Ann Arbor.
        He had Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Lillian.
        Mr. Rosinger's 1945 book, "China's Crisis," was praised by one critic as distinguished by penetrating judgments, careful marshaling of facts and easy readability.
        In the book, Mr. Rosinger, who had worked as a researcher in Asian issues, said that moderate Chinese could provide a balance between the Chinese Nationalists and the Chinese Communists and enable them to work together.
        When questioned by the Senate subcommittee, he refused to say whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party, as other witnesses had said he was.
        Around that time, his wife recalled on Monday, "the possibility of getting a job in his field dried up." He later taught English in Michigan.
        Mr. Rosinger was born in Manhattan and earned degrees from City College and Columbia University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Judy Goings of Ann Arbor; a son, Bill of Farmingville, L.I.; and two grandchildren.
