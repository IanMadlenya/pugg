        Douglas W. Bryant, the director of Harvard University's libraries from 1972 to 1979, a period of rapid expansion, died on Sunday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Mr. Bryant, who lived in Lexington, Mass., was 80.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Rene.
        Mr. Bryant was also head of a trust that replaced American publications destroyed when bombing raids damaged British museums during World War II.
        At Harvard, Mr. Bryant joined the library staff in 1952. He became university librarian in 1965 and director of the library system in 1972, the year he was also named a professor of bibliography.
        As director, he helped Havard establish new library buildings on the campus and create a computer-based catalogue of works to be made freely available to scholars. It later became the Research Libraries Group, a national consortium. A Second Career
        After retiring from Harvard in 1979, Mr. Bryant became executive director of the American Trust for the British Library and served briefly before his death as its president.
        The trust raised money to replace American books, magazines and other printed material destroyed during the air raids over Britain. During one bombing, in 1941, more than 6,000 volumes devoted to Americana burned in what was then the British Museum.
        Mr. Bryant oversaw the microfilming of many copies sent to British libraries as replacements, and he played a crucial role in establishing the David and Mary Eccles Center for American Studies in London. Last year the center became an affiliate of the English-Speaking Union of the United States.
        Mr. Bryant was a graduate of Stanford University and received a master's degree in library studies from the University of Michigan. He served as a Navy lieutenant commander in Washington during World War II.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Heather Jordan of Concord, Mass., and two grandchildren.
