        Jacob Fisher, an author and an expert on aging, died on Thursday at his home in the Collington Retirement Community in Mitchellville, Md. He was 89.
        The cause was neuro-degenerative disease, his family said.
        Mr. Fisher was born in what is now Poland and came to the United States as an infant. He graduated from New York University in 1926 and received a master's degree from the Jewish School of Social Work in 1928.
        In the 1920's and 30's, he was a case worker in voluntary social service agencies in New York City. In 1940, he joined the research and analysis staff of the Social Security Board, which had been created under what was then the newly enacted Social Security program.
        He left the board in 1954 to join the Surveys and Research Corporation, a private organization that did research on contract for the board, Federal and state agencies and private businesses.
        He was the author of "On Vanishing Ground," a book describing his coming of age in New York in the 1920's. He also wrote "The Response of Social Work to the Depression" and "Security Risk," a memoir of his experiences as a target of the loyalty-security programs for Federal employees in the 1950's.
        In his spare time, Mr. Fisher was a naturalist and a gardener and once operated a nursery near Centerville, Va.
        His survivors include his wife of 62 years, Cora; a daughter, Judith Goodkind of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Stephen, of Wilmette, Ill.; a sister, Ruth Hollinger of Tamarac, Fla., and five grandchildren.
