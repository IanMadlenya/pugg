        Fred (Sonic) Smith, a guitarist for the influential rock band the MC5, died on Friday at St. John's Hospital in Detroit. He was 44 and lived in St. Clair Shores, a suburb of Detroit.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Patti Smith, the poet and musician.
        Mr. Smith was born in West Virginia but soon moved to Detroit. He began playing guitar when he was 12, performing in a number of local bands before joining the MC5 in the mid-1960's. With Rob Tyner (who died in 1991) on vocals, the band helped create the Detroit sound, a high-powered, low-fidelity precursor to heavy metal and punk rock. As the entertainment wing of the White Panther Party led by its manager, John Sinclair, the MC5 also developed a reputation for radical politics.
        The band was signed to Elektra Records after its performance at the stormy 1968 Democratic National Convention, and released a controversial live record, "Kick Out the Jams." After recording two more albums, "Back in the U.S.A." and "High Time," for Atlantic Records, the group disbanded in 1972.
        Mr. Smith went on to lead his own group, Sonic's Rendezvous Band, with former members of other Detroit groups like the Stooges. In 1980 he married Ms. Smith, and the couple retreated from music until 1988, when they recorded the album "Dream of Life." They also contributed a song to the Wim Wenders film "Until the End of the World." Ms. Smith said she and Mr. Smith had been working together on several new projects that remain uncompleted.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Smith is survived by a son, Jackson; a daughter, Jesse; his parents, Dewey and Kathleen, and two sisters, Margie Provan and Pat Halett, all of the Detroit area.
