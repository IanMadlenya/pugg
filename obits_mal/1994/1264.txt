        Harry George Henn, an author of several influential law textbooks and a professor emeritus at Cornell University, died last Tuesday at a nursing home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 75 and lived in Naples, Fla.
        The cause was myelodysplastic anemia, an ailment linked to a spinal-cord disorder, his family said.
        Professor Henn's areas of expertise included corporate and copyright law. He wrote widely used casebooks and manuals and contributed to law journals, the Encyclopaedia Britannica and McKinney's New York Consolidated Laws.
        "Henn on Copyright Law: A Practitioner's Guide" was reissued in its third edition in 1991, followed by a supplement the year after that. Among his other books are "Laws of Corporations and Other Business Enterprises," on which John R. Alexander collaborated for the third edition in 1983; "Teaching Materials: Agency, Partnership and Other Unincorporated Enterprises" (second edition, 1984), and "Teaching Materials on the Laws of Corporations: Statutes, Cases and Materials on Corporations and Other Business Enterprises" (second edition, 1986).
        Professor Henn was born in New Rochelle, N.Y. He graduated from New York University and Cornell Law School.
        He practiced law in New York City for 10 years before returning to Cornell in 1953. He became a professor in 1958 and the first Edward Cornell Professor of Law in 1970. He retired in 1985.
        He was a consultant to the New York State Law Revision Commission and the Library of Congress. There, he helped to shape the Universal Copyright Convention and Copyright Revision Act of 1976.
        Professor Henn is survived by a brother, Robert A., of New Bern, N.C.
