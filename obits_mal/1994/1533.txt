        Rabbi Benjamin Morgenstern, an Orthodox Jewish religious leader and educator for many years, died on Friday at Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem. He was 87 and had retired to Jerusalem from Brooklyn nearly 20 years ago.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Seymour P. Lachman, a family friend and the dean for community development at the City University of New York.
        Rabbi Morgenstern led Congregation Sons of Israel in Brooklyn for three decades. He also was the principal of the congregation's Talmud Torah, one of the largest afternoon religious schools in the city, and as a member of Community School Board 21 when the city's public school system was first decentralized in the 1970's.
        Rabbi Morgenstern is survived by his wife of 66 years, Syd Margolis Morgenstern; a son, Jack, and a daughter, Marilyn Finkel, both of Rehovot, Israel; two sisters, Molly Belenken of Jerusalem and Evelyn Schreiber of Lawrence, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
