        Lieut. Comdr. Leon Goldsworthy, a specialist in the disposal of enemy explosive devices from Australia who helped the American Navy during the invasion of the Philippines in World War II, died on Aug. 7 in South Perth, Australia. He was 85.
        Commander Goldsworthy was Australia's most highly decorated naval officer officer in that war, The Times of London said last week.
        Among his wartime exploits was neutralizing a Nazi underwater naval mine, designed to be detonated by the noise of a passing ship, off the coast of Wales in 1944. Wearing a specially-designed diving suit, he managed to remove the mine unexploded after detaching its fuse and primer.
        Later that year, he was lent to the American Navy for the invasion of the Japanese-occupied Philippines and applied his skills to Japanese mines and booby-traps.
        After the war he was an executive in an Australian electric-sign company.
        He is survived by his wife, Georgie, and a daughter.
