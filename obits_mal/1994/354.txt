        Laurence Hugo, an actor who appeared in the original production of "Stalag 17" and starred in the television daytime drama "The Edge of Night" for 11 years, died on Wednesday at Cedars Nursing Home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 76 and lived in Rockfish, Va.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Laurence, of Schuyler, Va.
        Mr. Hugo was born in Berkeley, Calif., and studied drama at the University of California at Berkeley, graduating in 1939. He then studied with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.
        His first Broadway role was as a guard in "Distant City" in 1941. In 1943, when Montgomery Clift became seriously ill, Mr. Hugo took over as Henry in "The Skin of Our Teeth." During his breakthrough appearance on Broadway in "Decision," he was drafted into the Army. After his discharge, he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London.
        He appeared in 50 roles on Broadway, notably in "Born Yesterday," "The Bird Cage Decision," "The Enclave" and "There's a Girl in My Soup." From 1951 to 1953, he played the traitor Price in "Stalag 17." In later years he toured with Dame Judith Anderson in "Hamlet" and with Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in "Noel Coward in Three Keys."
        On television, he played the crime-fighting lawyer Mike Karr on "The Edge of Night" from 1961 to 1972.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Viki Matheny of Charlottesville, Va.; two grandaughters, and three great-grandsons. His first wife, Carolyn Gary Hugo, died in 1975. His second wife, Ludi Claire Hugo, died in 1990.
