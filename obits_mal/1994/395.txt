        Dr. Ewald T. Grether, a leader in the development of business education at the University of California, died on Friday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 94.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, the university said.
        As business school dean from 1941 to 1961, Dr. Grether reorganized the university's college of commerce, founded in 1898, into the School of Business Administration, the predecessor of the present Haas School of Business. He is credited with helping move American business education to its modern emphasis on markets and economies from its early vocational focus on individual industries.
        He is survived by a son, David, of Altadena, Calif.; a daughter, Virginia Moose of Sacramento, Calif., and a sister, Dora Woelfle of Loveland, Colo.
