        George Greenspan, a retired textile manufacturer and philanthropist, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 93.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Greenspan graduated from Columbia University, where he later served as chairman of the advisory board of the Counselor to Jewish Students. He also was a treasurer and vice president of the American Fund for Israel Institutions.
        Mr. Greenspan held the same positions at the America Israel Cultural Foundation and helped bring about the Israel Philharmonic's American debut, in New York, in 1950.
        As a textile industrialist, he served as treasurer and vice president of the Textile Distributors Institute. He was a founder and first president in 1937 of Waumbec Mills of Manchester, N.H., an early manufacturer of synthetic fabrics. He also was president and treasurer of the Cantor-Greenspan textile concern, which was sold to J. P. Stevens & Co. in 1962. Mr. Greenspan retired three years later as a consultant to J. P. Stevens.
        He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Corinne Lappert Greenspan; a son, Andrew, of Westport, Conn., and a brother, Saul, of Manchester, N.H.
