        Joseph C. Hawthorne, a former conductor of the Chattanooga and Toledo Symphony Orchestras, died on Sunday at the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Mass. He was 85 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        He died after a long illness, said his wife, Hazel.
        Mr. Hawthorne was born in Provincetown, Mass., to Charles and Marion Hawthorne, painters who founded the Cape Cod School of Art at the turn of the century. After graduating from Princeton University in 1930, he studied at the Juilliard School and at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau in France as winner of a Walter Damrosch scholarship.
        After serving in the Navy during World War II, he became the associate conductor of the Dallas Symphony under Antal Dorati. In later years he was the music director and conductor of the Chattanooga Symphony, the Toledo Symphony and the Duluth-Superior Symphony Orchestra in Minnesota.
        In the late 1950's Mr. Hawthorne founded and directed the Provincetown Symphony Society, a chamber orchestra made up of professional musicians who spent summers on Cape Cod.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Carol Campbell Hawthorne-Madell of Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Nancy Dickinson of Greenwich, Conn.; a stepson, Peter Snider of San Francisco, and five grandchildren.
