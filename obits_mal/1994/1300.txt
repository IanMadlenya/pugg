        Alfred Kassab, the Long Island man whose persistence led to the indictment and eventual conviction of his son-in-law, Dr. Jeffrey R. MacDonald, in the 1970 murder of the doctor's wife and two young daughters, died on Monday at his retirement home in Rockledge, Fla. He was 73.
        The cause was emphysema, his family said.
        The case became the subject of a widely known book and a television movie, "Fatal Vision."
        At first, Mr. Kassab was a strong supporter of his son-in-law, who contended that his pregnant wife, Colette, 26, who was Mr. Kassab's step-daughter, and the couple's two daughters, Kimberly, 5, and Kristen, 2, had been slain by drug-crazed intruders. The murders took place at the family's home at Fort Bragg, N.C., where Dr. MacDonald was a Green Beret captain and Army physician.
        After studying transcripts of Army hearings on the deaths, Mr. Kassab became convinced of Dr. MacDonald's guilt and began a crusade to bring about the prosecution, which the Army and Justice Department had declined to pursue for lack of evidence.
        The resulting trial ended in a conviction, which was overturned and ultimately upheld, in 1985.
        Mr. Kassab is survived by a stepson, Robert Stevenson of Bayville, L.I.; and two sisters, Lydia Rescorl of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Olga Kroncke of Deerfield Beach, Fla.
