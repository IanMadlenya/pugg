        Maj. Gen. Douglas B. Kendrick, a doctor and retired Army officer who once headed Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, died on Friday at Watauga Hospital in Boone, N.C. He was 87 and had homes in Blowing Rock, N.C., and Tampa, Fla.
        His family said he had been in declining health.
        General Kendrick commanded Walter Reed from 1965 to 1967, when he retired from the Army. In 1966, he was among the surgeons who removed former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's gallbladder.
        In his earlier Army medical career, he had varied duties. In 1954, when he was a colonel and the post surgeon at West Point, it fell to him to announce that Army's football coach, Col. Earl Blaik, had come down with pneumonia and would miss his first game in 21 years as coach.
        In 1947, as personal physician to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, then based in occupied Japan, Lieut. Col. Kendrick declared in a statement that, contrary to reports in Washington, the general's health was excellent.
        General Kendrick was born in Atlanta. He earned his medical degree at Emory University in 1931.
        His first wife, Dorothea, died. He is survived by his wife of 14 years, the former Jean Lykes Rankin; a stepson, Thompson L. Rankin of Tampa; two stepdaughters, Louise Barrow of Tampa and Jean Burn of Riverside, Conn., and eight step-grandchildren.
