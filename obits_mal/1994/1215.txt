        Arthur Paskin, a pioneer in the development of computer graphics used in the courtroom to analyze accidents, died on Sept. 26 at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 70 and lived in Belle Terre, L.I.
        The cause was complications from lymphoma, said his wife, Charlotte.
        At his death, he was emeritus professor of physics at the City University of New York and was senior partner in Forensic Sciences, a company directed from his home, where he continued his work in accident reconstruction.
        In 1984, he and his partner, Arthur Damask, developed a simulation program that was used successfully to defend a young man accused of vehicular homicide by demonstrating, in part, that the accident could have been caused by circumstances other than reckless driving, with which the man had been charged.
        Before retiring, he was a professor of physics at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY.
        From 1963 to 1968, he worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, L.I., where he was instrumental in forming its superconductivity program. In 1983, he received a Federal Energy Department award for metallurgy and ceramics research.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Judith Paskin-Fleurlage of Ithaca, Carol Epstein of Washington and Amy Birkan of Santa Fe, N.M., and five grandchildren.
