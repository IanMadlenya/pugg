        John Bradshaw Holt, a career diplomat who was the deputy chief of the United States Embassy in Vientiane, Laos, during civil strife there in 1960, died on Friday at the Mid-Coast Hospital in Brunswick, Me. He was 84 and lived in Brunswick.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Elizabeth Holt Muench.
        Mr. Holt was deputy chief of the Vientiane embassy from 1959 to 1961. Mrs. Muench said he was in the embassy when it was shelled by rebel forces in 1960, but had taken shelter in an inner hall.
        He went on to serve in Zurich as Consul General, in Washington as an administrator at the Foreign Service Institute, and elsewhere before he retired in 1966. Later he was an administrator, concerned with refugees, with the World Council of Churches.
        Mr. Holt's wife, Elizabeth Gilmore Holt, died in 1987. In addition to Mrs. Muench, of Lexington, Mass., he is survived by two sons, John A. of Wilmette, Ill., and Peter G. of Potomac, Md; seven grandchildren; and two sisters, Frances Brewster of Pleasant Hill, Tenn., and Eugenie Arbuthnot of Bath, Me.
