        Dr. James William Corbett, a researcher in semiconductor and solid-state physics, died on Monday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. He was 65 and lived in nearby East Berne.
        The cause was brain injuries from a fall in his home, said a spokesman from the State University of New York at Albany, where he had taught for the last 25 years.
        At his death, Dr. Corbett was Distinguished Service Professor and director of the university's Institute for the Study of Defects in Solids. He had led the institute for 20 years. An International Reputation
        Dr. Corbett earned an international reputation for his contributions to semiconductor physics. He was the author or co-author of hundreds of publications, including 10 books and monographs, the most recent of which, "Hydrogen in Crystalline Semiconductors," was published by Springer Verlag in 1992.
        Solid-state physics deals with the fundamental properties of solids, such as structure, binding forces and optics. Semiconductors, like silicon or germanium, are used in transistors and for other purposes.
        Dr. Corbett was born in Manhattan, graduated from the University of Missouri and received a Ph.D. in physics from Yale in 1955. From then until he joined the Albany faculty in 1968 he was a research associate at the General Electric research laboratories outside Schenectady, N.Y.
        An adjunct professor at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the 1960's, he co-founded and directed its Joint Laboratories for Advanced Materials.
        Dr. Corbett is survived by his wife, M. E. Colander; two sons, Lee and Ross, both of the Albany area, and a sister, Eunice Gahley of Punta Gorda, Fla.
        Correction:  April 28, 1994, Thursday
        An obituary on Tuesday about James Corbett, a professor of physics at the State University of New York at Albany, misstated the surname of his wife, who survives him. She is M. E. Grenander.
