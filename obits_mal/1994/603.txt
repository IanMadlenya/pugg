        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Devaney served in the Army toward the end of World War II as a staff member of Stars and Stripes in Paris. He graduated from New York University in 1949 as he was starting his writing career.

        He wrote "The Vietnam War" (1992) for children 5 to 8, and biographies of Presidents Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan for roughly the same age group. Other subjects were Gen. George S. Patton, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and "Adolph Hitler, Mad Dictator of World War II" (1977). In sports, he wrote about Bo Jackson, Mickey Mantle, Roger Clemens, the Stanley Cup and winners of the Heisman Trophy.
