        Alexander Graham Bell Fairchild, a research entomologist at the University of Florida and the last living grandson of Alexander Graham Bell, died last Thursday at his home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 87.
        The cause was cancer, the university said.
        Mr. Fairchild, who was known as Sandy, spent almost 30 years in Central America and South America studying the role of insects in disease. Since 1970, he had been a research professor of entomology at the University of Florida and a research associate at the Florida State Collection of Arthropods in Gainesville.
        He was the author of more than 140 articles in scientific journals and was a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was named entomologist of the year in 1968 by the Entomological Society of America.
        Mr. Fairchild is survived by his wife, Elva, and a daughter, Alice Fairchild, both of Gainesville; a son, David, of Carmel Valley, Calif., and a grandson.
