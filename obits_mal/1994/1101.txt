        Harry Saltzman, who with Albert R. Broccoli produced early James Bond films like "Dr. No" and "Goldfinger," died yesterday at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb. He was 78 and lived in a village near Versailles.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Adriana.
        He was born on Oct. 27, 1915, in New Brunswick, Canada, and was brought to the United States as an infant. He entered the film business in the mid-1940's and made his name in Britain with hard-hitting social dramas, including "Look Back in Anger" in 1958 and "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning" in 1960.
        Mr. Saltzman and Mr. Broccoli rounded up the screen rights to practically all of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and began the film series in the early 1960's. The two struck it rich with the highly profitable movies, most of which starred Sean Connery as Agent 007. Their Bond films included "From Russia With Love," "Thunderball," "Diamonds Are Forever" and "The Man With the Golden Gun." The partnership ended in the mid-1970's.
        Among Mr. Saltzman's other productions were "The Entertainer," "The Ipcress File," "Funeral in Berlin" and "The Battle of Britain."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Steven, of Paris; two daughters, Hilary, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Merry, of Marina del Rey, Calif., and a sister, Mina Reizes of Reseda, Calif.
