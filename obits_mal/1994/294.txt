        Joseph F. Periconi, a Republican political figure in New York for 30 years who served as Bronx Borough President from 1962 to 1966, died on Wednesday in the Morris Park Nursing Home in the Bronx. He was 83.
        The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Rosemary.
        He ran for elective office as a Republican and sometimes on the Liberal Party ticket. He served three terms as State Senator from the 29th District in the Bronx, elected first in 1952 and again in 1956 and 1958. He was a member of the New York City Transit Authority board from 1960 to 1962.
        Mr. Periconi was elected Bronx Borough President, serving one term before being defeated by Herman Badillo in a close election. Held Sanitation Post
        After the defeat Mr. Periconi was named Sanitation Commissioner by Mayor John V. Lindsay, but left that post in less than a year when the Sanitation Department was shaken by scandals involving bribery and payoffs. Mr. Lindsay stressed that Mr. Periconi had not been involved in any wrongdoing.
        For the next 10 years Mr. Periconi held a series of posts in the city and state government, his last as a member of the state's Narcotic Addiction Control Commission from 1973 to 1975. In recent years he practiced law.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Periconi worked 15 years as a clerk for Consolidated Edison to pay his way through night school at St. John's University and New York Law School.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Peter, of Brightwaters, L.I., Paul, of Johnson City, Tenn., and James, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and a daughter, Laura Eisenman of Stamford, Conn.
