        E. John Lewis, a founder of the Pacifica radio network, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home in Plandome, L.I., his son Robert Lewis said. He was 78.
        In 1949, Mr. Lewis helped create the Pacifica Foundation and its flagship station, KPFA in Berkeley, Calif., which were the brainchild of his friend Lewis Hill. Mr. Lewis served as the treasurer for Pacifica, which quickly became known for its liberal and pacifist bent, and as the public affairs director for KPFA, the first listener-sponsored radio station in the country.
        During World War II, Mr. Lewis, a Quaker, was a conscientious objector. He was jailed for a time for resisting the draft, and then was pressed into firefighting duties in the Sierra Nevada in place of military service.
        Mr. Lewis was born on April 21, 1916, in southern California. He graduated from Occidental College in Los Angeles and received a master's degree in economics at Claremont Graduate School in Claremont, Calif.
        After a few years at Pacifica, Mr. Lewis worked as a sales manager with the Institute of Business Planning, and then as a sales representative for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Dolly L. Lewis of Plandome; a daughter, Joan P. Coffman of Lexington, Ky., and two sons, Robert Lewis of Port Washington, L.I., and Thomas G. Lewis of Florence, Ky.
