        C. Michael Lane, a faux-finish artist whose work was featured in HG and American Homestyle magazines, died on Aug. 7 in a New York City nursing home. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was AIDS, said a friend, Jacqueline Coumans.
        Mr. Lane, whose first name was Charles, was known for his ability to recreate centuries-old painting techniques, many of which mimicked semiprecious stone. One specialty was stucco veneziano, an ancient Italian technique for producing marblelike surfaces using tinted plaster that is then polished with beeswax.
        From the mid-1970's until early this year, when illness forced his retirement, Mr. Lane worked for prominent interior designers in the United States and Europe, including Jacques Grange and Henri Samuel.
        In recent years, he was the author of Trade Secrets, a how-to column in American Homestyle, and appeared on the "Today" program on NBC.
        He was a native of Jacksonville, Tex.
        He is survived by his parents, Faye and Jack J. Lane of Tyler, Tex.; a grandmother, Reta Barnett of Jacksonville; a sister, Karen Rike of Dallas, and two nieces, Ashley and Kiki Rike, also of Dallas.
