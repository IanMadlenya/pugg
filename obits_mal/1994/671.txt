        Heywood (Woody) McGriff, a dancer, choreographer and teacher, died on Sunday at Christopher House, a hospice in Austin, Tex. He was 36.
        The cause was AIDS, a friend, Pierre Apraxine, said.
        Mr. McGriff was a long, lean dancer of special intensity, who brought an equal passion to teaching dance. He performed in New York City with Nina Wiener, Jennifer Muller and the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company. He joined the faculty of the University of Texas, where he was an associate professor of dance at the time of his death. Mr. McGriff's last performance was in mid-March in the Austin Festival of Dance, a benefit for local AIDS services. In March the university announced the creation of an endowment in Mr. McGriff's name, to which $100,000 has been contributed, for scholarships for minority students. A studio was also named in his honor.
        Mr. McGriff was born in Massillon, Ohio. He received a degree in dance from Ohio State University. In addition to his New York performances, he also danced with Frank Holder, Bill Evans, the Sharir Dance Company, Ballet Austin and in his own solo concerts.
        Mr. McGriff is survived by his mother, Maybell McGriff, of Massillon.
