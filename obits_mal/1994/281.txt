        Count Alexander Numa Labinsky, a bass and the president of Nimbus Records, died on Friday at his home in Monmouth, Wales. He was 70.
        He died in his sleep, said Peter Elliott, a vice president of Nimbus.
        Count Labinsky began his career as a nightclub performer in the 1940's but went on to concert singing. Using the name Shura Gehrman, he worked with many artists, including Kathleen Ferrer and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and gave the premiere of Ibert's "Don Quixote" songs. He performed regularly for the BBC, and recorded songs of Schubert, Faure and others.
        Concerned with the limitations of recording techniques of the 1950's, he formed a partnership with Michael and Gerald Reynolds and established Nimbus Records, whose artists include Shura Cherkassky and the Hanover Band.
        He is survived by a sister, Jeanne Thierry of Birmingham, England.
        Correction:  February 4, 1994, Friday
        An obituary headline yesterday about a record executive misspelled his surname in some copies. He was Alexander Labinsky.
