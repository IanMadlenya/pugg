        William P. Brown, who had a long career as a New York City police commander and then became a criminal justice educator, died on Feb. 15 at the Hospice Inn at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. He was 75 and lived in Slingerlands, N.Y.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Dr. Brown was professor emeritus at the School of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany. He had joined the faculty of SUNY's School of Public Affairs in 1962 and became one of the organizers of its School of Criminal Justice.
        He was an expert on the administration of criminal justice and on the relationships among law-nforcement officials, the criminal-justice process, the community and academia. He served on national and international panels, including the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice and the United States Commission on Civil Rights.
        A native of Brooklyn, he joined the New York City Police Department in 1940, served in the Navy in World War II and then rose through the police ranks. He was a past commander of the Police Academy and helped institute the graduate program in policing at the John Jay College of the City University of New York.
        While with the New York City Police Department, he graduated from New York University, where he also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in public administration in 1961, the year before he retired with the rank of inspector and moved to Albany.
        Dr. Brown is survived by his wife, Eleanor Drum Brown; a daughter, Nelly Brown Bunk of Delmar, N.Y; a son, Paul, of Manhattan; a sister, Muriel Newell of San Francisco, and five grandchildren.
