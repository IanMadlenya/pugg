        Levering Rothfuss, a pianist and vocal coach, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. He was 42 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his mother, Reva Rothfuss.
        Mr. Rothfuss was the accompanist or vocal coach for many singers from the Metropolitan and New York City Operas, including Marilyn Horne, Tatiana Troyanos, Carol Neblett, John Alexander and William Parker. He also served on the musical staffs of the Santa Fe, Glimmerglass and Chautauqua opera companies, and was the accompanist for the MacAlister Awards and the Opera Index Awards.
        He was born in Monroe City, Mo., and received degrees in music from the University of Missouri in Columbia and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He served as a judge for the district auditions of the Metropolitan Opera and was involved in the training of young accompanists.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father, Earl, both of Monroe City, and two sisters, Susan Rothfuss and Helen Custer, both of Arlington, Va.
