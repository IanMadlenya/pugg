        Rabbi Alfred Jospe, a retired national director of B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundations, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 85.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Jospe spent 35 years with the organization, which offers cultural, religious and counseling services to Jewish students. On retiring in 1975, he recalled that his campus ministry had spanned "nine student generations, no two of which were precisely alike."
        He joined the organization in 1940 as director of the Hillel Foundation of the University of West Virginia. At the time there were fewer than 30 Hillel units in the country, and when he retired that number had grown to 326 on campuses in the United States and abroad. They served more than 400,000 students.
        Born in Breslau, now Wroclaw, in Poland, Dr. Jospe was ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary in Breslau and earned a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Breslau. He was a Reform rabbi and served a congregation in Berlin in the 1930's.
        He was briefly detained in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Germany but was allowed to leave for Britain, from where he went to Morgantown, W.Va. There, he again served as a rabbi until he took up his campus ministry at the University of West Virginia and, later, at Indiana University.
        He became national director of planning and resources at the parent Hillel organization in 1949, a post he held until he was named national executive director in 1971. He was the author, co-author and editor of many articles and several books.
        Dr. Jospe is survived by his wife of almost six decades, Eva; two daughters, Susanne Greenberg of West Chester, Pa., and Naomi Pisetzky of Petah Tikva, Israel; a son, Raphael, of Jerusalem, and 12 grandchildren.
