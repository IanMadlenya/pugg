        Ben Weberman, a financial journalist who helped strip away the mystery of interest rates and bond markets for the general public, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 71 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was complications from cancer, said his son-in-law, Kenneth Rilander.
        Mr. Weberman's 40-year career included editing positions at The New York Herald Tribune and Forbes magazine. In the late 1960's, when financiers were eager to learn the outcome of secret Federal Reserve meetings that set the course of interest rates, Mr. Weberman's articles about the Fed were so prescient that Arthur Burns, then the Fed chairman, told him that his writing was a national disservice.
        Mr. Weberman graduated fromCity College of New York and started writing for The Journal of Commerce in 1951. He then moved to The Herald Tribune, where he was the financial editor from 1961 to 1964. He was financial editor of The American Banker for 12 years and became economics editor of Forbes in 1976.  Until his death, he wrote a monthly column for Forbes.
        Mr. Weberman is survived by his wife, Sylvia; two daughters, Nancy Rilander of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Lynn Ziven of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
