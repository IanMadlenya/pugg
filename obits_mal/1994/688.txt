        Dimitri Romanoff, a dancer, teacher and longtime ballet master with American Ballet Theater, died on Feb. 6 in a nursing home in St. Helena, Calif. Mr. Romanoff, who lived in St. Helena, was 86.
        He died of natural causes, said Dr. Michael Shifflett, Mr. Romanoff's great-nephew, of Napa, Calif., who notified The New York Times of his death this week.
        Mr. Romanoff, a courtly, soft-spoken man, joined Ballet Theater (later American Ballet Theater) in its first season, in 1940, and was associated with the company for much of his career. He was appointed ballet master in 1946 and continued to work with the company until the early 1970's, with the exception of the 1958-59 season, which he spent as the ballet master of the Netherlands Opera Ballet in Amsterdam.
        A character dancer, he performed roles that included Bobiche in "Bluebeard," Hilarion in "Giselle" and Menelaus in "Helen of Troy." He also created the role of Friar Laurence in Antony Tudor's "Romeo and Juliet."
        Mr. Romanoff was born in Tsaritsyn, Russia, and educated in Japan and the United States. He studied piano and ballet in San Francisco, the latter with teachers who included Adolph Bolm, Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin. Mr. Romanoff made his professional debut in 1935, partnering Nini Theilade in the film of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," toured in concert programs with her and was the principal dancer of the San Francisco Opera Ballet before joining the Mikhail Mordkin Ballet, a precursor of Ballet Theater, where he danced from 1937-39.
        Mr. Romanoff retired from Ballet Theater and ballet in general to devote himself to gardening.
        No immediate family members survive.
