        Robert Scevers, a dancer, choreographer and teacher who worked extensively with Rebekah Harkness, died on Thursday at his home in Dallas. He was 54.
        He died after a long illness, said Nikita Talin, a colleague.
        Mr. Scevers was born in Aransas Pass, Tex. He took dance classes at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where he was studying lighting design for the theater, then began intensive dance training with Mr. Talin. In 1965 he went to New York City and began a long, colorful career with Harkness and her school and ballet companies.
        He was an accomplished teacher and a serviceable dancer, but he was best known for his relationship with Harkness. Tall, blond and handsome, he was put to work as an onstage partner and offstage companion for the eccentric millionaire. One of the few employees Harkness never dismissed, Mr. Scevers remained her friend until she died in 1982. He helped Harkness to direct dance enterprises, and his choreography was created for the most part for her companies.
        Mr. Scevers also taught dance at Southern Methodist.
        He is survived by his mother, Ruth Scevers of Mason, Tex.
