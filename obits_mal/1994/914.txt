        Rear Adm. William Halford Selby, a Briton who figured in a confrontation known as the Corfu incident, died on July 3 at his home in Wiltshire, England. He was 92.
        In 1946, Admiral Selby, then a Royal Navy captain, commanded the British destroyer Saumarez, which was one of four vessels ordered to pass through the strait between Albania and Corfu. They were told to shoot back if they came under fire from Albania, which claimed control of the waterway.
        The Albanians did not shoot, but the Saumarez hit a mine, caught fire and was later scrapped. Thirty-six crew members were killed and Captain Selby was injured.
        Both sides protested at the United Nations. Western naval officers said Albania had broken international law by secretly mining the strait. Admiral Selby testified before the International Court at the Hague, and in 1949 it upheld a British claim for $:850,000 in damages from Albania. The sum was never paid.
        The admiral retired in 1956.
