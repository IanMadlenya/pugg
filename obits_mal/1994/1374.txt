        Hal Ellson, a prolific writer of novels and short stories, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Brooklyn. He was 84.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ellson wrote dozens of novels and hundreds of short stories, many dealing with big-city teen-agers and juvenile delinquency. Much of his material came from his career as a nurse's aide in the psychiatric adolescent ward at Bellevue Hospital and as a recreational therapist.
        His stories were published in many magazines and collections, including Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and Best Detective Stories. Among his novels are "Duke," "Summer Street," "Games" and "Tomboy," which was made into a movie in France.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine; a daughter, Suzanne-Jo Magliulo; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
