        James W. Becker, one of the country's leading tournament bridge players, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 57 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, said Joan Dziekanski, his business partner at the Beverly Bridge Club in Manhattan, which he founded.
        In 1991 Mr. Becker won almost 3,000 master points, the third-highest calendar-year total of all time. This earned him the Barry Crane Top 500 title, making him the only East Coast winner in 30 years. That year he played more than 3,000 deals and attended 36 tournaments. His lifetime total of 18,700 master points placed him 14th on the American Contract Bridge League's career listing.
        He won consecutive victories in the Intercollegiate Par Championship in 1959 and 1960, the first of more than 100 titles he won. In 1983 he was the New York Player of the Year, a title awarded to the most successful performer in local events. World's Busiest Club
        In 1975 Mr. Becker bought a small bridge club, renamed it the Beverly, and built it into the busiest in the world. Now at 130 East 57th Street, the club has some 400 tables in play weekly and 60 tables of instruction.
        Mr. Becker, known as Jim, taught the game to thousands. He was responsible for seven revisions of "The Greatest Little Bridge Book in the World," a popular student text. He also translated from Italian "Precision and Super Precision" by Giorgio Belladonna and Benito Garozzo, the world champions. He served on the Greater New York Bridge Association's Board of Directors and as an alternate on the National Board.
        Mr. Becker was born in Gloversville, N.Y., and received a degree in electrical engineering at Columbia University in 1959. He worked briefly as an engineer before pursuing a career as a bridge teacher.
        He is survived by his father, Richard Becker, and a cousin, Bruce Becker, both of Gloversville, N.Y.
