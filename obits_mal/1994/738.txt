        Oliver Jackson, a jazz drummer known for his deft touch and smooth swing, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 61 and lived in Queens.
        The cause was heart failure, according to a statement by the office of the jazz impresario George Wein.
        Mr. Jackson grew up in Detroit and spent much of his early career performing there with musicians like Thad Jones, Paul Chambers and Tommy Flanagan. In 1949 he joined forces with the drummer Eddie Locke. They worked together as Bop and Locke until 1953, when Mr. Jackson began performing with the saxophonist Yusef Lateef.
        In the late 1950's Mr. Jackson moved to New York City, where he performed at the Metropole and the Embers, and began working in a swing style. He started a three-year association with Charlie Shavers in 1959, then worked with Buck Clayton, Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton and Kenny Burrell. At Jazz Events Everywhere
        From 1964 to 1970 he toured with Earl Hines. In the 1970's he worked with Sy Oliver, and in 1973 he won Downbeat magazine's international critics' poll. For the last 10 years he performed at festivals and other jazz events all over the world, appearing with Oscar Peterson and as part of George Wein's Newport Jazz Festival All-Stars.
        Regarded as one of the best mainstream drummers working, Mr. Jackson easily switched between swing and be-bop styles. He was ceaselessly elegant in his playing, with a beautiful, shimmering ride cymbal and an easy swing that kept him constantly in demand.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred, and a daughter, Alexis, of Orlando, Fla.
