        Louis A. Brown, a New York-area real-estate developer, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney.
        Louis A. Brown entered the construction business after World War I, specializing in private residences and apartment houses. Many of his developments were in Queens but he was also involved in projects in Brooklyn, Nassau and Westchester. Perhaps his largest project was a 400-family apartment complex in Forest Hills, Queens, which he helped build in 1947.
        Besides his son, Mr. Brown is survived by his wife of 67 years, Betty; ; a daughter, Carolyn Straker of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
