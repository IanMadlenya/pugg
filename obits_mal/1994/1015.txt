        Herman Goldfarb, a theatrical lawyer and artists' manager, died on Monday at the Royal Manor Nursing Home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Beginning in the 1930's with his partners, Mary Mirenberg and Michael Vallon, Mr. Goldfarb represented such performers as the band leader Woody Herman, the ventriloquist Paul Winchell, the singer Hazel Scott and the comedians Joey Bishop, Larry Storch and Jack Carter. His clients in later years included Ron Clark and Bob Ellison, both comedy writers.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Yetta, and a son, William, who is a professor at Rutgers University.
