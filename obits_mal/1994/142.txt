        John Phillips Ohl, who practiced law in Manhattan for 42 years, specializing in taxation, died on Dec. 29 at his retirement home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 84 and formerly also kept homes on Park Avenue and in London.
        He died of complications after a long convalescence from a stroke that he suffered in 1986, his family said.
        Early in his career, Mr. Ohl helped draft the Revenue Act of 1934. Later, on leave as a dollar-a-year man, he worked on the provisions that permitted the five-year amortization of war plants and on the draft of the World War II Excess Profits Tax Act.
        A native of Youngstown, Ohio, he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University. He was second in his class of 1934 at Columbia University Law School, where he was a member of the Law Review. He joined what is now Cahill Gordon & Reindel in 1934 and was a name partner at his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Ohl is survived by a daughter, Kerin Ohl of Buena Vista, Colo.; two sons, Robert and Brian, both of Palm Beach; a sister, Donna C. Allen of County Mayo, Ireland; 11 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
