        Philip P. Hallie, professor emeritus of philosophy and the humanities at Wesleyan University who wrote on the nature of cruelty, died on Sunday in Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. He was 72 and lived in Middletown.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said Jill Grossman, a spokeswoman for Wesleyan.
        Mr. Hallie was born in Chicago and served in the Army field artillery from 1944 to 1945, earning three battle stars in the European theater of operations. He received a bachelor's degree from Grinnell College in Iowa, master's and a doctoral degrees from Harvard University and a bachelor of literature degree from Jesus College, Oxford, where he was a Fulbright scholar from 1949 to 1951.
        After a year as an instructor of philosophy at Wesleyan, he was appointed a professor of philosophy at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, where he taught from 1953 to 1964. At Wesleyan, where he taught from 1964 to 1988, he was named the William Griffin Professor of Philosophy and Humanities in 1965.
        In addition to many scholarly articles, he wrote the books "Maine de Biran, Reformer of Empiricism" (1959); "Skepticism, Man and God" (1966); "The Scar of Montaigne" (1966), and "The Paradox of Cruelty" (1969).
        His best-known book was "Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed" (1979), which told the story of the French Protestants of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon, who provided a haven and safe passage abroad to 2,500 Jews during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, Louis, of Seattle; a daughter, Michelena, of North Tarrytown, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
