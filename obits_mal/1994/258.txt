        Saul Ben Schiff, once a leading executive in the shoe industry, died last Saturday at White Plains Hospital. He was 96.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Barbara Passloff of Scarsdale, N.Y.
        Mr. Schiff was the past president of the A. S. Beck Shoe Corporation and a founder of Schiff Shoes, which eventually became SCOA Industries.
        He was also an ardent supporter of Israel. In 1968, to create jobs there, he formed the American Israel Shoe Corporation, a footwear manufacturer with a factory in Bat Yam, Israel.
        A co-founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Mr. Schiff was also a director of the Bank Leumi Trust Company and a former chairman of the Greater New York Fund's shoe retail division.
        In addition to Mrs. Passloff, Mr. Schiff is survived by his wife of 66 years, Mollie S. Schiff, and two other daughters, Carole Straus and Simone Englander, all of Scarsdale; 10 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
