        Donald Jesse Atwood, a retired vice chairman of the General Motors Corporation and Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Bush Administration, died on Sunday in a hospital in Royal Oaks, Ill. He was 69 and lived in Franklin, Mich., a Detroit suburb.
        He had an ulcer operation earlier that day, G.M. reported.
        As the No. 2 man in the Pentagon under Secretary Dick Cheney, Mr. Atwood was in charge of day-to-day operations at a time of historic change, including the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Gulf war against Iraq and major reductions in the military under tighter Federal budgets. Worked on Space Projects
        A native of Haverhill, Mass., Mr. Atwood earned bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he helped research and develop inertial guidance systems. Later, at G.M., he worked to develop and produce similar systems for missiles, space vehicles and aircraft.
        He joined the company's electronics division in 1959 and rose through the corporate ranks in divisions making trucks and buses, transportation systems and equipment for missions like the Apollo lunar project. In the 1980's he was given responsibility for two major G.M. acquisitions, the Electronic Data Systems Corporation, founded by Ross Perot, and the G.M. Hughes Electronics Corporation.
        President George Bush named him Deputy Secretary of Defense in January 1989, and he served throughout the Bush Administration.
        Mr. Atwood is survived by his wife of 47 years, Curina Harian Atwood, known as Sue; a son, Donald J. 3d, of Washington; a daughter, Susan Lavoie of Ortonville, Mich., and two granddaughters.
