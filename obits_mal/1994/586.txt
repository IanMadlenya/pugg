        Dr. Dallas B. Pratt, a retired Manhattan psychiatrist who was the co-founder of the American Museum in Britain, died on Friday at his home in Garrison, N.Y. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said Shirley Fisher, a friend.
        Dr. Pratt founded the American Museum in 1961 together with the late John Judkyn, an English-born naturalized American citizen, to present leading examples of American painting and decorative arts to the British public.
        The museum, in Bath, England, features furniture, paintings, maps, documents and other artifacts representative of American society from the 17th through the 19th centuries, many of them arranged in a series of period rooms.
        A 1936 graduate of Yale University, Dr. Pratt received a medical degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he practiced psychiatry until 1960. He served as a major in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.
        In 1969 Dr. Pratt founded Argus Archives, now known as Two Mauds, a group that fights animal abuse and publishes information about animal rights.
