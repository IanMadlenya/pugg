        Timothy A. Gelatt, a lawyer and an authority on Chinese law, died late Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 39 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage that he suffered while walking near his home, said Ko-Yung Tung, a partner in the law firm of O'Melveny & Myers, for which Mr. Gelatt had worked half-time since May 1993.
        Since 1988 Mr. Gelatt (pronounced jel-LET) has also been adjunct assistant professor of law and administrative director of the Asian Law Program at New York University. He also taught and lectured at other universities.
        Mr. Gelatt, who wrote "Corporate and Individual Taxation in the People's Republic of China" (Longman, 1989), was also active in human-rights efforts. He was on the board of Human Rights Watch/Asia and a member of the Committee on International Human Rights of the New York City bar association.
        Born and raised in Manhattan, he received a bachelor's degree in oriental studies and international relations summa cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania in 1977 and a law degree from Harvard in 1981.
        Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Mr. Gelatt focused his law practice on investing and doing business in China, where he spent much time in recent years. Before he joined the Manhattan office of O'Melveny & Myers, he worked as an associate in the Baker & McKenzie law firm, and then for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, from offices in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai.
        Mr. Gelatt is survived by his mother, Esther Gelatt of Manhattan.
