        Rodney Colin Campbell, a retired journalist and editor, died on Oct. 28 while visiting his daughter in London. He was 70 and lived in Los Angeles and La Jolla, Calif.
        The cause was an aortic aneurysm, his family said.
        Mr. Campbell drew widespread attention with his book "The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration of the Mafia and the U.S. Navy" (McGraw Hill and Mondadori, 1977). It was based on the report of a New York State investigation ordered in 1954 by Thomas E. Dewey, then the Governor, and credits Charles (Lucky) Luciano and other underworld leaders with a wide variety of valuable aid to the Government in World War II.
        Mr. Campbell, who was born in London, moved to New York after the war as a newspaper correspondent and columnist, and in the 1950's became a contributing editor and associate editor of Life magazine.
        Mr. Campbell is survived by his wife, Judith; two sons, Duncan, of Los Angeles, and Colin, of San Diego; a daughter, Hallie Swanson of London, and a granddaughter.
