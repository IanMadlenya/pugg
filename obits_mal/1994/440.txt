        Don G. Goddard, a former broadcaster who became known for his work with geriatric alcoholism and other addictions, died on Sunday at Boswell Hospital in Sun City, Ariz. A Sun City resident, he was 89.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Goddard was born in Binghamton, N.Y., attended Princeton University and had a first career in print and broadcast journalism. He was the host of the ABC television series "Medical Horizons," an on-the-scene documentary about medical advances at American hospitals and research centers. He retired in 1970 as head of ABC's Biographical and History Archive, which he helped to establish.
        Mr. Goddard's second career had its roots in the 1950's, when he met Bill Wilson, co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. The two collaborated on A.A. documentaries and the publication A.A. Grapevine. That experience led to his working with alcoholism after he retired and moved to Arizona, first becoming a consultant to the Mile High Council on Alcoholism and then joining the staff of St. Luke's Chemical Dependency Program in Phoenix as a consultant and therapist.
        In Arizona Mr. Goddard developed special treatments for older people with addictions. His "Top o' the Hill Gang" for patients over 55 at St. Luke's fostered similar programs at clinics across the country.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Adele Letcher Goddard; three daughters, Marilu Nowlin of Acton, Mass., Dr. Susan Goddard of Rice Lake, Wis., and Meg Moss of Evanston, Ill.; a son, Donald L., of Manhattan, and nine grandchildren.
