        Lester D. Mallory, a retired career diplomat who had been United States Ambassador to Jordan and Guatemala, died on June 21 in Saddleback Hospital in Laguna Hills, Calif. He was 90 and lived in Lake Forest, Calif.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife of 48 years, the former Eleanor Mercedes Struck y Bulnes.
        Mr. Mallory was Ambassador to Jordan from 1953 to 1958 and to Guatemala in 1958 and 1959. He was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, dealing with Latin American affairs, in 1960 and retired from the State Department in that year. He then spent a decade with the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, Costa Rica and Panama.
        Later he played a major role in setting up the anthropology department at the University of Guadalajara, Mexico.
        A native of Maine, Mr. Mallory received degrees from the University of British Columbia and a Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
        He began working for the Government in 1931, first with the Department of Agriculture, then with the State Department. He served in Paris, Mexico City, Havana and Buenos Aires before becoming an Ambassador.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Lester D. Jr., of Houston.
