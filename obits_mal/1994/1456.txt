        Dr. Maxwell L. Gelfand, a professor of clinical medicine at New York University School of Medicine, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
        The cause was leukemia, said Dr. Ariel Distenfeld, his physician and a former student.
        Dr. Gelfand, a cardiologist, trained generations of physicians. He was an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital, University Hospital and Cabrini Medical Center, and a consulting physician at New York Downtown Hospital, where he had served as medical director from 1962 to 1973.
        He was the author of more than 70 scientific articles. His research covered areas like coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia of the blood, which is an excessive level of fatty substances like cholesterol. Most recently, he focused on mitral valve prolapse, an abnormality that may prevent a heart valve from closing properly.
        Dr. Gelfand was born in Russia and graduated from City College of New York in 1925. He received his medical degree from the School of Medicine at St. Louis University.
        After a residency at Montefiore Hospital, he opened a private cardiology practice in Manhattan and maintained it while teaching. In 1976, he was promoted to professor of clinical medicine at New York University.
        Dr. Gelfand is survived by his wife, Grace; two sons, Martin, of Seattle and Charles, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
