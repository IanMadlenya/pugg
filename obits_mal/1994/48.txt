        Dr. William M. Hewlett, a pioneering black physician in Jamaica, Queens, died on Thursday at Jamaica Hospital. He was 74.
        The cause of death was prostate cancer, said Marjorie Jarvis Hewlett, his wife of 51 years.
        In 1954 Dr. Hewlett, who was a pediatrician, became the first black physician on the staff of Jamaica Hospital at a time when blacks were allowed only courtesy privileges at Queens hospitals, said his wife. She said the hospital gave him staff privileges because he was light-skinned and could pass for white. Once on the staff, he successfully argued for other black physicians to gain similar privileges, she said.
        Dr. Hewlett was also the first black resident on the staff of Queens General Hospital and helped open a number of medical clinics in the Jamaica area. He was a founder and director of pediatrics of the Carter Community Health Center and was chief of the venereal disease clinic at Queens General Hospital. In 1974 he was elected president of the Queens County Medical Society, becoming only the third black president of a county medical society in the United States.
        Dr. Hewlett, who often served two and sometimes three generations of Jamaica families, was also known in the community for never locking the doors of his medical office in his home, even at night. His wife said no one had ever broken in.
        He was born in New York and graduated from John Adams High School, St. John's University and the Howard University College of Medicine.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Hewlett is survived by a son, Robert D., of Jamaica; a daughter, Elizabeth M., of Greenbelt, Md., and three grandchildren. His eldest son, William Jr., died of a heart attack the day before Dr. Hewlett died.
