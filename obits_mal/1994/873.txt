        Tommy Joe Eagles, the former Auburn University basketball coach who became coach at the University of New Orleans in May, collapsed while playing basketball today and died a short time later. He was 45.
        Eagles was visiting with the Phoenix Suns assistant coach Scotty Robertson and several of his former Auburn players, who were participating in the Rocky Mountain Revue at the Delta Center.
        According to Robertson, Eagles and one of his former players, the Phoenix rookie forward Aaron Swinson, remained on the floor after practice at Salt Lake  Community College to work on Swinson's shooting. After throwing a pass to him, Eagles collapsed and didn't regain consciousness.
        Paramedics were unable to revive him.
        Eagles, a Louisiana native who played and later coached at Louisiana Tech, resigned under pressure in March after Auburn posted a disappointing 11-17 season. His record was 64-78 in five seasons. He accepted the New Orleans job on May 31, succeeding Tim Floyd. Eagles was 97-40 with Louisiana Tech.
        Eagles is survived by his wife, Connie; a son, Jamie, who is a freshman basketball player at New Orleans, and a daughter, Katie, all of Mandeville, La.
