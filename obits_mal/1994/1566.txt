        Frederic Zeller, a sculptor and author of a book about his escape from Nazi Germany, died on Saturday at his home in Sag Harbor, L.I. He was 70 and also had a home in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Susan Kennedy Zeller.
        Mr. Zeller, who was born in Berlin in 1924, was able to make his way to the Netherlands in 1938, and eventually escaped to England. His parents died in a Nazi death camp. In 1957, he immigrated to the United States, where he settled in New York City. He worked as an advertising copywriter and eventually began creating sculptures and collecting art.
        His autobiographical account of the war years, "When Time Ran Out: Coming of Age in the Third Reich," appeared in 1989. The book was dedicated to the Dutch people, with profits going to a Dutch children's charity. It was selected for a New American Writing Award by the National Endowment for the Arts.
        Mr. Zeller's sculptures have been exhibited in Manhattan and at galleries in the Hamptons.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Lilian Godman of California.
