        Ralph C. Rinzler, an authority on American folk music who was an assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 59.
        He had been ill for a long time, said his wife, Kate.
        During his 27 years at the Smithsonian, Mr. Rinzler became the founding director of the institution's Festival of American Folklife and also the director of its office of folk-life programs.
        Mr. Rinzler, who was black, was widely credited with nudging the Smithsonian toward expanding its activities beyond a focus on white American culture.  Acquiring Folkways Records
        Mr. Rinzler joined the Smithsonian in 1967 and served as the Smithsonian's assistant secretary for public service from 1983 to 1990.
        In 1987, Mr. Rinzler led the Smithsonian to acquire Folkways Records, a collection of 2,200 recordings of folk and tribal music along with documentary readings. From 1990 until his death, he served as a special assistant for Folkways at the Smithsonian.
        He helped the institution win a Grammy Award in 1988 as the producer of "Folkways: A Vision Shared," a tribute to Woody Guthrie and Huddie Ledbetter, known as Leadbelly, issued by Columbia Records. Mr. Rinzler also played the banjo and mandolin, touring and recording with the Greenbriar Boys bluegrass band.
        After graduating from Swarthmore College in 1956, Mr. Rinzler spent the next seven years conducting field studies of local cultures in the United States and Europe.
        He is survived by his wife.
        Correction:  July 9, 1994, Saturday
        An obituary yesterday about Ralph C. Rinzler, an assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, misstated his race. Mr. Rinzler was white, not black. The obituary also omitted two survivors, his mother, Beatrice Rinzler of Passaic, N.J., and his sister, Judy Werman of Boynton Beach, Fla.
