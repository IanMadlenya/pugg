        Jake Dengel, a veteran character actor, died on Monday at the Group One Hospice in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He was 61 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was cancer, said Roy Brocksmith, a friend.
        Mr. Dengel's first break in the theater came when he was chosen by John Gielgud to play Puck in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Ontario Shakespeare Festival. His Broadway credits include "The Changing Room" and "Royal Hunt of the Sun," and he was in Off Broadway productions at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, the Circle Rep and the Ensemble Studio Theater, among others.
        He also appeared in numerous regional theater productions, and most recently played opposite Judd Hirsch in "Conversations With My Father" in Los Angeles. He was seen on such television shows as "L.A. Law," "Cagney and Lacey," "Hill Street Blues" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation." He also had parts in "Ragtime," "Ironweed" and other motion pictures.
        He is survived by four daughters, Bridgette, Julia and Alexis Dengel, and Laura Brown, all of New York City.
