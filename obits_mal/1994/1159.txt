        Matthew Gordon, a news executive who established the press operations of the United Nations in 1946 and ran its Office of Public Information for the next 15 years, died on Wednesday at Sibley Memorial Hospital here. He was 84.
        The cause of death was a heart ailment, said his companion, Margaret Croke.
        Mr. Gordon was news editor of the Columbia Broadcasting System when Elmer Davis of the Government's Office of War Information hired him during World War II to run the agency's foreign news bureau. After his postwar tenure at the United Nations, he worked for a time as a consultant to technology companies. In 1963, he was appointed director of information for the Communications Satellite Corporation in Washington, where he remained until retirement in 1975.
        Mr. Gordon, who was born in New York, graduated from Columbia University and its school of journalism. He worked for The New York World-Telegram and The New York American before joining CBS.
        His wife, Antonia, died in 1988. He is survived by a son, Michael, a Washington correspondent of The New York Times; a daughter, Laurie Pattison-Gordon of Arlington, Mass.; two sisters, Emily Hammer and Rita Gordon of New York, and five grandchildren.
