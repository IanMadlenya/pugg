        Samuel L. Williams, a lawyer who turned down a seat on the California Supreme Court to become the first black president of the State Bar of California, died on Thursday in Los Angeles. He was 61 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was a heart attack he suffered at home, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Williams retired in 1990 from the Los Angeles law firm now known as Hufstedler, Kaus & Ettinger.
        He led the state bar group in 1981 after spurning the judgeship earlier that  year.
        From 1974 to 1977, he headed the Los Angeles Police Commission. Earlier, he was on the commission that investigated the causes of the 1965 race riot in Watts.
        Born in Los Angeles, he earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California in Berkeley and a law degree from the University of Southern California, where he was an editor of the law review.
        He is survived by his wife, Beverly; a son, Brett, and a daughter, Dana.
