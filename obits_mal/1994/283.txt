        Seymour Herscher, a manager of more than 60 Broadway productions during a show business career that spanned 30 years, died on Saturday at the New York Hospital Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was old age, said his son, David.
        Mr. Herscher started working with Alexander H. Cohen Productions in 1958 and retired two years ago as vice president and controller. He also helped to manage the televised Tony Awards programs for 20 years, as well as other television specials about show business.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Sylvia; a daughter, Miriam, and his son, all of Manhattan.
