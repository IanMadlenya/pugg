        Harry Simmons Jr., the founder of Simmons Architects and an associate architect for the AT&T Building in Manhattan, died on Sunday in a plane crash in Massachusetts. He was 51 and lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
        Mr. Simmons was known primarily for designing and rehabilitating lower- and middle-income housing that addressed the social needs of the inner city. Often, this meant keeping residential projects low to the ground, organized around a courtyard, with communal spaces and amenities to foster a sense of social cohesion.
        Mr. Simmons was born and reared in Jacksonville, Fla. He earned a bachelor's degree in architecture from Howard University and a master's degree from Pratt Institute.
        His firm's completed projects include the Louis Armstrong Memorial Cultural Arts Center in East Elmhurst, Queens; Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn; a 267-unit apartment complex for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in Brooklyn, and the St. Albans Baptist Church in Queens.
        In 1972 Mr. Simmons was named one of the top 40 architects in America by Archictectural Record. He was a founder of the New York Coalition of Black Architects.
        He is survived by his wife, Sharon; a daughter, Candace, of Brooklyn; two sons, Harry 3d, of Brooklyn, and Carlton, of Omaha, Neb.; two brothers, Robert, of Perry, Fla., and Timothy, of Inglewood, Calif., and four sisters, Eleanor Speight of Jacksonville, Fla.; Karen Cowan of Sunnyvale Calif.; Linda Thomas of Jacksonville, Fla., and Barbara Van Blake of Washington.
