        Murat W. Williams, a longtime Foreign Service officer who was Ambassador to El Salvador from 1961 to 1964, died on Thursday at the Westminster-Canterbury retirement community in Charlottesville, Va. He was 79.
        The cause was a stroke, said his son Michael.
        Mr. Williams joined the Foreign Service after World War II and served in Romania, Greece and Israel before becoming Ambassador to El Salvador. He retired in 1965. He served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy during the war. He graduated from the University of Virginia and was a Rhodes Scholar in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan, of Charlottesville; two daughters, Kathleen, of Manakin-Sabot, Va., and Brigid, of Boston, and two sons, Nicholas, of Orlando, Fla., and Michael, of Washington.
