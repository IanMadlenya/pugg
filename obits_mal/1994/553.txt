        Stanley Mays, a British journalist who worked in New York for foreign publications for more than 40 years, died on Tuesday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. Mr. Mays, who lived in Manhattan, was 73.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his wife, Patricia.
        For the last eight years Mr. Mays operated his own company, which represented newspapers and magazines in Europe and South Africa. He also served as an agent for publications during negotiations for book serialization rights overseas and published a weekly newsletter devoted to new books.
        Mr. Mays served as a bombardier-navigator with the Royal Air Force in World War II. After the war, he moved to New York, where he was a correspondent for The London Daily Mirror. He later worked in New York for The London Daily Express.
        Mr. Mays is survived by his wife; two sons, Stephen of Berkeley, Calif., and Nicholas of San Jose, Calif., and a brother, Reginald of London.
