        Brother John P. Dondero, a former chairman of the psychology department at La Salle University, died on Saturday at the Roncalli Center, the Christian Brothers community in Philadelphia that he founded. He was 72.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, the university said.
        Brother Dondero, born in Philadelphia, served the Christian Brothers teaching order for 54 years. He was widely known as an expert on the psychology of people who choose religious vocations.
        A licensed psychologist, Brother Dondero directed dozens of counseling workshops for religious superiors, brothers, nuns, priests, military chaplains, public health officials and seminary students. His workshops were held throughout the United States and in Canada, Europe and Asia.
        He taught undergraduate and graduate classes at La Salle from 1954 until his retirement two years ago and was department chairman from 1965 to 1968 and again in the early 1970's. He was a past chairman of the university's Faculty Senate. Since his retirement as a psychology professor, he had taught part time and had done some consulting and development work for La Salle.
        He was a 1945 physics graduate of La Salle and earned master's degrees in mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh and in psychology at the Catholic University of America in Washington.
        Before he joined the faculty at La Salle, he was a high school teacher and also taught at Russell College and College of the Holy Name, both in California, and at Catholic University.
        He was the author of numerous articles in professional journals and wrote two books, "The Reconciliation of Religious Life: Opportunity or Fiction" (1979) and "No Borrowed Light: Mental Health for Religious" (1965).
        Brother Dondero is survived by three brothers, Robert M., of Philadelphia, William A., of Beach Haven, N.J., and Lawrence J., of Kensington, Md.
