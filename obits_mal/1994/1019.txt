        Dr. Hyman S. Barahal, who practiced psychiatry on Long Island for more than 50 years, died on Aug. 2 at his home in Brightwaters, L.I. He was 89.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Barahal was associated with Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood from 1946 to 1968 as clinical director, acting director and director.
        In 1968, he established a clinic on the hospital's grounds where patients were less restricted than in Pilgrim State proper. He retired from state service in 1975.
        Born in Russia, Dr. Barahal arrived in the United States as a boy and graduated from Wayne State University Medical School in Detroit. He trained at the Society of Medical Psychoanalysts in Manhattan and in the 1930's was supervising psychiatrist at Kings Park State Hospital on Long Island.
        In World War II, Dr. Barahal served as an Army major at Mason General Hospital in Brentwood as chief of psychiatry and head of its neuropsychiatric section. He was a consultant for John Huston, the director, when he filmed "Let There Be Light," a 1945 documentary on the psychological trauma of combat veterans -- a film that Federal authorities withheld from release for many years.
        He was in private practice in Bayshore and, later, Brightwaters until his health began to fail about 10 years ago. He contributed frequently to professional journals as well as publications of general interest.
        Dr. Barahal is survived by his wife of 54 years, Irene Jaffe Barahal; a son, Paul, of Smithtown, L.I.; a daughter, Susan Barahal of Chestnut Hill, Mass.; a brother, George; three sisters, Rose Palmer, Pauline Schwartz and Doris Tron, all of suburban Detroit, and four granddaughters.
