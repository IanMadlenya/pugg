        Raymond J. Burke, a founder of the law firm Burke & Parsons in Manhattan, died Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 81 and had lived in Palm Beach.
        The cause was cancer, his son Raymond Jr. said.
        Mr. Burke grew up in Manhattan, and graduated from Columbia University in 1944 and New York University Law School in 1947. A specialist in admiralty law for 45 years, Mr. Burke founded Burke & Parsons in 1965 with J. Lester Parsons. In 1975, Mr. Burke was appointed special admiralty counsel to the Government of Indonesia in connection with a financial crisis involving the national oil company, Pertamina.
        Mr. Burke is survived by his wife of 56 years, Catherine, of Palm Beach; a daughter, Katherine Murphy of Birmingham, Mich.; two sons, Raymond Jr. of Manhattan and Richard E. of New Canaan, Conn.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
