        Raymond Allen, an artistic director of the Light Opera of Manhattan who appeared in many of its productions, died on Saturday at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens. He was 72 and lived in Jamaica Estates, Queens.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Rhanda Spotton-Allen.
        Mr. Allen played leading roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan productions for which the Light Opera of Manhattan was known, including "The Mikado," "The Pirates of Penzance" and "Ruddigore." He also starred in the company's productions of "The Merry Widow," "The Desert Song" and other operettas.
        He collaborated with Todd Ellison on the music and lyrics for the company's staging of "Give My Regards to Broadway," adapted from "Little Johnny Jones," by George M. Cohan. Light Opera of Manhattan disbanded in 1990.
        Before his 21 years with the company, Mr. Allen was a member of Dorothy Raedler's American Savoyards, playing leading tenor roles. He portrayed Sir Joseph in the 1964 New York City Opera production of "H.M.S. Pinafore."
        Mr. Allen appeared at several Off Broadway and regional theaters, including the Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, in touring companies of "Oliver" and "The Student Prince," and in films and commercials.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Mildred Gics of East Meadow, L.I.
