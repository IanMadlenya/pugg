        F. Lee H. Wendell, a retired management consultant who was long active in Harvard University alumni affairs, died last Wednesday at Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Ill., where he lived. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Born in Boston, Mr. Wendell attended Milton Academy. He was a member of the class of '38 at Harvard College but took his senior year at the University of Chicago, from which he graduated. He was a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II, serving as air-ordnance officer aboard the aircraft carrier Boxer.
        After the war he joined A. T. Kearney Inc., an international consulting firm based in Chicago. He rose to senior vice president and director of marketing, and retired about 10 years ago.
        He was president of the Harvard Club of Chicago when it marked its 100th anniversary in 1953 and then served as regional vice president for Associated Harvard Clubs. He also served the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for more than 25 years as chairman of the Chicago chapter and senior vice chairman for the Midwest region.
        Mr. Wendell is survived by his wife of 32 years, Joan Monroe Wendell; a son, Peter H., of Lake Forest; a daughter, Nathalie W. Thomas of Natick, Mass.; a stepdaughter, Joan A. Anderson of Lake Forest; a stepson, Kirland B. Armour of St. Charles, Ill.; a sister, Barbara W. Kerr of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
