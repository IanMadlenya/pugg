        Capt. Robert Ford, an aviator who made his mark in the era of the flying boats with an unscheduled flight round the globe, died on Sunday at his 880-acre ranch at Penn Valley, Calif., north of Sacramento. He was 88.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Captain Ford was ferrying mail and passengers from San Francisco to New Zealand aboard a Pan American Airways Pacific Clipper on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Skirting the trouble zone and watching for enemy aircraft, he headed the flying boat west over Australia, India and Central Africa, then crossed to South America, eventually making a safe landing at the Marine Terminal at what is now La Guardia Airport in New York on Jan. 6, 1942.
        The entire trip covered 31,500 miles in 209.5 hours of flying time, some of it over war territory. The Clipper had a range of 4,500 miles, and its longest single flight was 3,583 miles across the South Atlantic from Douala, in what is now Cameroon in Central Africa, to Brazil.
        Captain Ford, who was then 35, called his round-the-world flight "a purely routine operation."
        Born in Cambridge, Mass., Captain Ford earned his wings as a naval aviator before joining Pan American Airways in 1933. He flew the Caribbean before transferring to the Atlantic division in 1939, flying Clippers between New York and Lisbon.
        He shifted to the Pacific route in July 1941. Before his round-the-globe journey, he had completed some 50 flights across the two oceans.
        At the time of his death, he had been a cattle rancher for 45 years.
        Captain Ford is survived by his wife of 63 years, Elizabeth Evans Ford; three sons, Michael of Ventura, Calif., Tim of San Anselmo, Calif., and William of San Rafael, Calif.; a daughter, Mary Jenifer Menke of Fort Jones, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
