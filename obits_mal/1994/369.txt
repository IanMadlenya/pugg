        Louis Gargiulo, who ran his family's restaurant, Gargiulo's, on Coney Island for more than 50 years, died on Tuesday at Kings Highway Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 92.
        He died of natural causes, said his son, Michael Gargiulo.
        After emigrating with his brothers and sisters from Sorrento in 1911, Mr. Gargiulo helped run the restaurant his father founded in 1907 at West 15th Street and Mermaid Avenue, just off Surf Avenue. Along with Nathan's hot dog stand, the restaurant is the oldest surviving eating establishment from Coney Island's heyday.
        Mr. Gargiulo is survived by his son, of Manhattan; a daughter, Josephine Cassata of Brooklyn; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His wife, the former Josephine Talamo, died in 1978.
