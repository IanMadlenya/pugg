        Dr. Abraham Gelbart, whose achievements in mathematics gained him an international reputation even though he never received a high school diploma, died on Wednesday. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was complications from cardiovascular surgery, said his son William.
        Dr. Gelbart co-developed the theory of pseudoanalytic functions about the behavior of materials such as air flowing around airplane wings.
        In 1959 he was founding dean of the Belfer Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University. Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv named its International Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences after him in 1990.
        Born in Paterson, N.J., to immigrants from Poland, Dr. Gelbart left high school at 14 to help support his family. He continued studying by visiting the science division of the New York Public Library, where he met Dr. Jekuthiel Ginsburg, director of the Yeshiva University Institute of Mathematics. Dr. Ginsburg helped Dr. Gelbart enter Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he received a B.S. in 1938. Two years later he received a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        His first wife, Sara, died in 1988.
        Surviving are his second wife, Mona; two sons from his first marriage, William, of Los Angeles, and Stephen, of Israel; a daughter, Carol Auer of Middletown, N.J.; two stepsons, Jay Siegel of Morganville, N.J., and Stephen Siegel of Manhattan; a sister, Frances Albert of Princeton, N.J.; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
