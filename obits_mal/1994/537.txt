        Phillips Stevens, who was headmaster of Williston Academy in Easthampton, Mass., for 23 years until retiring in 1972, died on Monday at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart, Fla. He was 80 and lived in Jensen Beach, Fla., and Old Saybrook, Conn.
        The cause was a stroke, said Sarah Stevens, his wife of 54 years.
        A native of New Haven, Mr. Stevens graduated from Williams College and earned an M.A. in German at Middlebury College. He started a teaching career at South Kent School in 1936, where he taught until 1943.
        During World War II, he helped to organize war bond sales for the local Junior Chamber of Commerce while working as a vice president of the J-B-T Precision Instrument Company of New Haven.
        He was appointed head of Williston Academy in 1949. During his tenure, he was credited with spurring its growth and developing it into one of the largest and most prestigious preparatory schools in the East. He consolidated the suburban campus, about 20 miles north of Springfield, added acreage and buildings, and raised faculty salaries.
        The school was founded in 1841 as Williston Seminary for boys. In 1971, a year before Mr. Stevens retired, it became co-ed by merging with the Northampton School for Girls to form The Williston Northampton School.
        In retirement, Mr. Stevens founded the Headmasters Letter, now known as the Head's Letter, a monthly newsletter about private schools for headmasters and headmistresses around the world.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Stevens is survived by a daughter, Ruth Stevens of New York City and San Francisco; five sons, Phillips Jr. and Timothy, both of Buffalo, Peter, of Portland, Ore., David, of Buckingham, Pa., and Jonathan, of Chicago; a brother, Carleton, of New London, N.H.; and six grandchildren.
