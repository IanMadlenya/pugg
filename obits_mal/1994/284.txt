        Tiger Haynes, a musician and actor who created the role of the Tin Man in the Broadway musical "The Wiz," died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Joy.
        Mr. Haynes was born in Fredriksted, St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, and came to the New York area as a boy. During the Depression, he traveled the country, working as a lumberjack and a prizefighter, among other jobs. It was while fighting that he changed his name from George to Tiger.
        From 1945 to 1956, he played guitar with the Three Flames, who recorded the hit "Open the Door, Richard" in 1947. In 1949, he appeared on "The Three Flames Show" on NBC, one of the first network television shows to feature black performers. The trio performed regularly at the Bon Soir club in Greenwich Village, where the producer Leonard Sillman saw him and hired him for the Broadway variety show "New Faces of 1956."
        His films include "The Mosquito Coast," "Awakenings," "Jungle Fever" and "Moscow on the Hudson." He appeared on television in "The Cosby Show" and "In the Heat of the Night."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Carol Tripodo of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., and a grandson.
