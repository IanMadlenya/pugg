        Will Roberson, a director and playwright, died on Tuesday at his home in San Diego. He was 36.
        The cause was AIDS, said Bryan Scott, a friend.
        Mr. Roberson was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., and grew up in Norco, Calif. He spent most of his professional career in San Diego, where he directed shows for the Old Globe Theater and the San Diego Repertory Theater.
        At the Old Globe, he directed and was a co-producer of the musical "Suds" in 1989. The show eventually played off Broadway. He was also the assistant director for the current Broadway production of the musical "Damn Yankees."
        Mr. Roberson worked at many theaters around the country, among them the Idaho Shakespeare Festival in Boise, the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera and the O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. He taught theater at the University of San Diego and the University of California at San Diego.
        He is survived by his parents, Eldon and Kay Roberson; a sister, Karen Armstrong, and a brother, Dale, all of Riverside County, Calif.
