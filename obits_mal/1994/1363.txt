        Frederick Jackson Bell, a decorated admiral who wrote several books about the Navy, represented an automobile industry group and eventually became an Episcopal minister, died last Saturday at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Miami. He was 91 and lived in Miami.
        His family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.
        He wrote about the Navy throughout his career, which began with his graduation from the Naval Academy in the 1920's and included command of a cruiser that rescued downed air crews in the South Pacific during World War II.
        His well-received "Room to Swing a Cat" (1938) told salty tales of the Navy of yore, of battles between frigates and the lot of ancient sailors. It was illustrated by his first wife, Pauline Gidden Bell.
        His "Condition Red: Destroyer in the South Pacific" (1944) chronicled the exploits of the destroyer Grayson, which he commanded when the Marines landed at Guadalcanal the year before. Written with humor, it was praised in reviews and became a best-seller.
        He retired in 1948 as a rear admiral and director of enlisted personnel and became a vice president of a financial consulting firm in Manhattan. In 1953, he became the executive vice president for the National Automobile Dealers Assocation and, as its principal spokesman, defended the dealers' sales practices. He also organized a committee to counter false and misleading advertising by dealers.
        He began studying for the clergy in the late 1960's and was ordained an Episcopal minister in 1971 at age 68. He was associated with the National Cathedral for 10 years.
        He is survived by a sister, Nancy Bell Welch of Long Beach, Calif.; two grandsons, and two granddaughters. His first wife died in 1968 and his second, Lelia Cook Noggle Bell, in 1983.
