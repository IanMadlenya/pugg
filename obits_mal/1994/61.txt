        Dr. Sumio Uematsu, a neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital who advanced the treatment of epilepsy, died on Tuesday at his home in Lutherville, Md. He was 59.
        He died unexpectedly in his sleep and the cause was not yet known, said his wife, Janet Uematsu.
        During his 30-year career at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Uematsu mapped the functions of the brain in the course of surgical treatment for epilepsy. He also designed a computerized skin temperature test for detecting changes in sensation caused by nerve injuries to the arms and legs.
        Born in Yamanashi, Japan, he came to the United States in 1962, entering a residency in neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins two years later. He founded and directed the neurometric laboratory at the Baltimore hospital and was an associate professor of neurological surgery at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Uematsu is survived by two sons, John, of New Freedom, Pa., and Ken, of Washington, and a daughter, Mika, of Lutherville.
