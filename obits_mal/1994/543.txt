        John Alexander Hill, who was a leading executive at two large insurance agencies and a health care concern, died on Tuesday at Parkview Hospital in Nashville. He was 87 and a resident of Nashville.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his secretary, Saralee Vaughn.
        Mr. Hill was born in Shawnee, Okla. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1928 and joined the Denver office of the Aetna Life Insurance Company, based in Hartford.
        Working in Detroit and Toledo, Ohio, he rose through the ranks to become the general agent of Aetna in Toledo. In 1958 he was named a senior vice president of the parent company, Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford, which is responsible for actuarial, underwriting and policy-service functions. He became president in 1962.
        He left Aetna in 1970 and took a senior position with the Nashville-based Hospital Corporation of America. He served as chairman from 1974 until 1977. Concurrently, until his retirement in 1978, he was chairman of the American Life Insurance Company of New York.
        He was a chartered life underwriter and a life member of the industry's Million Dollar Round Table. He held many directorships and was associated with educational institutions, including Hartford Theological Seminary, the University of Hartford and Bard College.
        He collected Western American art and served as a trustee of the Cheekwood Museum of Nashville. At his death he was a member of the Art Advisory Committee of the Department of State in Washington.
        Mr. Hill is survived by his wife of 64 years, Margaret Mikesell Hill; two daughters, Mary E. King of Albuquerque, N.M., and Jane M. Hill of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, John M., of Nashville, and six grandchildren.
