        Dr. Herbert J. Spoor, a dermatologist who practiced in Manhattan for 27 years, died yesterday in Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause was the consequences of a stroke, said his wife, Edna.
        In addition to his medical practice, Dr. Spoor was a consultant to the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries and a staff dermatologist at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. Dr. Spoor retired in 1980.
        He held doctorates in physiology from Ohio State University and in medicine from New York University. He was a former trustee of Gramercy Park.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years; two sons, Frederick of Sharon, Conn., and Thomas C. of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and a brother, Dr. William of Park Hills, Ky.
