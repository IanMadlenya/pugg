        Gilbert H. King, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who broadened representation on local juries and presided over a murder trial stemming from the 1971 Attica prison uprising, died on Feb. 11 at a hospice in Grand Rapids, Mich. He was 88.
        Justice King of Erie County retired in 1977 after 15 years on the bench. He was a native of Buffalo and a former resident of Phoenix, N.Y. He had moved to Michigan to be closer to a daughter after he learned that he had cancer.
        He graduated from the University of Buffalo and its Law School. But before practicing law, he earned a living as a truck driver, a timekeeper and a newspaper carrier, among other things. Attorney for Town
        He worked in private practice, as counsel for the Prudential Insurance Company and for 10 years as town attorney for Orchard Park, N.Y. He was also Republican chairman of Orchard Park. In 1962 he was elected a State Supreme Court justice.
        The Attica case tried in his court was known as "Indictment No. 1," the first of 42 handed up by a special grand jury investigating the rebellion of September 1971 that took 43 lives. His case arose from the murder of William Quinn, a correction officer who died of head injuries two days after the uprising started. The trial, opening toward the end of 1974, resulted in a murder conviction of one former inmate, John B. Hill, and a conviction for attempted assault of another, Charles J. Pernasilice.
        Justice King also was in the public eye during a 1974 proceeding in which he ruled that the county jury pool was illegally constituted because it was dominated by middle-aged men and deliberately excluded students and women. His opinion resulted in an overhaul of the local jury system.
        He is survived by his wife, Ellen Paul King; a son, Jeffrey, of Denver; two daughters, Cynthia Morin of Grand Rapids and Jacqueline Sutcliff of West Seneca, N.Y., and 10 grandchildren.
