        Gene Boucher, a baritone who sang with the Metropolitan Opera, and a former national executive secretary of the American Guild of Musical Artists, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60.
        The cause has not yet been determined, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the guild.
        After making his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1965, Mr. Boucher spent 20 seasons with the company, where he sang 49 roles in more than 1,000 performances.
        Born in the Philippines, Mr. Boucher was reared in Missouri, where he attended Westminster College. He served as a panelist for the National Endowment for the Arts, and was on the board of the National Music Council.
        He is survived by his mother, Inez Boucher of New York City.
