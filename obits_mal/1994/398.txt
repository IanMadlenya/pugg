        Tengiz Abuladze, a Georgian who became one of the Soviet Union's most highly regarded flm directors, died on March 6 in Tbilisi, Georgia. He was 70.
        Mr. Abuladze was best known for his 1984 film "Repentance," a fierce satire of Stalinism that won the special jury prize at the 1987 Cannes International Film Festival. It was withheld from the Soviet public for two years before being released in the new climate of openness. The film, which uses fantasy, surrealism and caricature in its portrayal of a dictatorial mayor, has been praised as a complex, coherent metaphor of the evil of tyranny.
        The director's wife, a stage actress, as well as his daughter, daughter-in-law and grandson, had roles in the film.
        Mr. Abuladze, whose father was a doctor and mother an economist, was born in Tblisi. He studied directing there and did advanced studies at the Higher State Institute of Cinematography in Moscow. The first films he worked on were documentaries about Georgian folklore.
        He won his first award at Cannes in 1956, for the feature "Magdana's Donkey." Among his other movies are "The Prayer" (1968), "Molba" (1973) and "The Wishing Tree" (1978).
        Mr. Abuladze was elected to the Soviet Parliament in 1989.
