        Michael S. Shower, a senior adviser at the United Nations Children's Fund, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said his sister, Michelle Proctor.
        As the counselor to Unicef's executive director, Mr. Shower helped plan efforts to help reduce children's diseases in many countries.
        Mr. Shower helped organize and manage the World Summit for Children, a two-day meeting at the United Nations in 1990 at which representatives of 159 countries endorsed a plan to improve the health of youngsters.
        Mr. Shower joined Unicef in 1980 as a financial officer and in 1989 became a counselor to the executive director. In 1988 he also promoted displays of the Names Project Quilt at the first World AIDS Day at the United Nations. He was involved in other activities to assist AIDS patients and was a board member of the Human Rights Campaign Fund.
        He was a graduate of the University of Missouri.
        He is survived by his parents, Ralph and Ethel Shower of St. Louis, and two sisters, Suzanne Walch of Cincinnati and Mrs. Proctor of McLean, Va.
