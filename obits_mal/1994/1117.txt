        Dr. Arthur B. Robins, a former director of New York City's Bureau of Tuberculosis Control, died on Saturday at the Park Vista Nursing Home in Fullerton, Calif., where he lived. He was 86.
        The cause was renal failure, said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the bureau's current director.
        Dr. Robins headed the bureau, part of the city's Department of Health, from 1947 to 1965.
        In that period, Dr. Frieden said, Dr. Robins was among the first in the country to establish a system of outpatient antibiotic treatment for patients leaving sanitariums. This was around the time that antibiotics were first introduced to treat tuberculosis.
        Dr. Robins promoted preventive treatment of tuberculosis-infected children with isoniazid -- the first highly effective oral tuberculosis drug, which became available in 1952 -- years before the effectiveness of that treatment was widely recognized, Dr. Frieden said.
        Dr. Robins wrote many scientific articles, was a consultant to the United Nations and taught at New York University and elsewhere.
        A native New Yorker, he grew up in Freeport, L.I., and received a bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1927, an M.D. from Columbia in 1931 and a doctorate in public health from Yale Universityin 1942. He was a medical officer in the Navy from 1942 to 1946.
        His wife, Patricia Scott, died in 1983.
        He is survived by three daughters, Sally Purdy of Laguna Beach, Calif. Dr. Lola Occhiogrosso and Dr. Catherine Robins, both of New York; a son, Dr. James Robins of Hong Kong, and seven grandchildren.
