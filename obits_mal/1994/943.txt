        Henry J. Karsch, a naval architect with a long career of designing seagoing naval and commercial vessels, died on Monday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. He was 72 and lived in Short Hills, N.J.
        The cause was a cerebral stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Karsch retired in 1986 as project manager and senior naval architect for the J. J. Henry Company, in the World Trade Center. He worked for the company for 35 years and at his death was a consultant.
        A native of Manhattan, he graduated from Webb Institute of Naval Architecture in Glen Cove, L.I., with a degree in naval architecture and marine engineering. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II. Adviser to Companies
        His work involved extensive travel in the United States, Europe and Japan, for both American and foreign shipowners. He advised such companies as Amoco, Reynolds Metals and Johnson Lines of Sweden, whose first container ships he designed.
        Mr. Karsch had a hand in the design and development of Sea-Land's SL-7 high-speed container ships. He worked on the conversion of such vessels into the combination roll-on, roll-off ships used by the Military Sealift Command as rapid-deployment vessels in the Persian Gulf War.
        A member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, he received the society's Linnard Prize in 1967 when he submitted the winning paper that year, an entry entitled "Container Ships."
        He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Therese Larkin Karsch; a son, Henry Jr., of Short Hills, and a brother, George, of Manhattan.
