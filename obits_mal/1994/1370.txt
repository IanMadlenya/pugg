        Rufus Burford Langhans, the town historian of Huntington, L.I., who once went to England to collect on Revolutionary War-era debts that were never paid to town residents, died Wednesday at Huntington Hospital. He was 72 and lived in the house Walt Whitman's grandfather built there in 1705.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his brother Paul Langhans of Reedley, Calif.
        A man for whom history was not made up of dust-covered manuscripts, Mr. Langhans was credited with breathing life into the town's past. In addition to serving 25 years as historian, he was chairman of the Huntington Historic Preservation Committee for 15 years, helping to set up six historic districts, and he was instrumental in expanding the Huntington Militia's sponsorship of events commemorating incidents from local history. In 1983, he was president of the state's Municipal Historians Association.
        As part of his job, which paid a salary, it was his duty to gather and preserve records and to see to their reprinting so they could be made available to residents researching their roots, or who were merely curious about local lore. In his work in 1975 he came across vouchers given to town residents by the British during the war. It was that $15,000 in debts that he sought to collect from the British Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was not successful.
        A year later, during the national Bicentennial celebration, he organized a re-enactment of an incident in which the town tore down a British flag and burned King George III in effigy.
        Born in Queens in 1922, he moved with his family to Huntington in 1938. He received an undergraduate degree in history from Colgate University in 1943 and master's degrees from New York University, Hofstra University and the State University of New York at Albany. He was librarian at Smithtown High School for 25 years.
        In addition to Paul, he is survived by another brother, Robert, of Ithaca, N.Y.
