        James J. Kriegsmann, a theatrical photographer in New York for 60 years, died on Friday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 85.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife of 50 years, Eugenie.
        Mr. Kriegsmann studied photography in his native Vienna and set up his own studio on Broadway in 1929 shortly after arriving in New York. He specialized in pictures of stage and screen stars, but he also photographed ordinary people, including the women who appeared in the Miss Subways promotion for more than 30 years.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Kriegsmann is survived by three sons, James Jr., of Greenwich, Conn., Eugene, of Seattle, and Thomas, of Bernardsville, N.J.
