        Richard Otts Pollard, a former director of photography for Life magazine in New York, died on Jan. 14 at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 81 and lived in that city.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Pollard oversaw the picture magazine's photo displays from 1961 to 1972. He assigned, supervised and edited the work of 40 staff and 60 freelance photographers worldwide.
        A native of Phoenix, he graduated from Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., where he majored in English and philosophy. At Pomona, Time Inc. engaged him as a stringer, and he later joined the staff, in 1936, first as a sports writer for Time magazine and then as Life bureau chief for Southern California, where he oversaw coverage of the motion picture industry.
        In World War II, he rose from private to captain in the Army Signal Corps and reported on the war through film and print. He returned to Time Inc. in 1951 as San Francisco bureau chief and oversaw the coverage there by its magazines.
        Before coming to New York as photography director in 1961, he spent two years as Life bureau chief in London, where he oversaw coverage of northern Europe.
        In 1973, after his retirement, Mr. Pollard received a Sprague Memorial Award, the top honor of the National Press Photographers Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; his daughter, Cordelia Hall of Charlestown, N.H.; his son, Reilly, of Goleta, Calif.; his brother, Dean, of Yuma, Ariz., and two grandsons.
