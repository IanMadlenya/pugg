        Capt. James W. Liebertz, who served as athletic director of the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, L.I., from 1950 to 1972, died on Monday. He was 80 and lived in Stamford, Conn.
        He died at a Stamford convalescent home after a long illness, the Academy said.
        Captain Liebertz, who was retired from the Navy, joined the Academy in 1945 as track coach and assistant head of the athletic department. During his tenure as director, the department expanded to include 16 varsity sports, from 5. In his honor, the Academy named its gymnasium the James W. Liebertz Gymnasium four years ago.
        A native of the Bronx, Captain Liebertz earned a masters degree in physical education at Columbia College. He worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation and as a track coach before enlisting in the Navy in 1940.
        His work in physical rehabilitation attracted wide attention then. He was assigned to St. Albans Naval Hospital in Queens and Asbury Park Convalescent Hospital in New Jersey during World War II.
        Captain Liebertz is survived by two sons, Jim, of Stamford and Steve, of Greenvale, L.I.; and his sister, Vivian Pearson of Middletown, N.Y.
