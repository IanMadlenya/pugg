        Stevan Dohanos, a leading illustrator who designed 40 United States postage stamps and painted many covers for The Saturday Evening Post, died on Monday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 87.
        The cause was pneumonia, said the Society of Illustrators in New York, of which Mr. Dohanos was a lifetime member. He served as its president from 1961 until 1963.
        Mr. Dohanos was born on May 18, 1907, in Lorain, Ohio, and attended the Cleveland School of Art. His first work as a magazine illustrator was published in McCall's in 1938. In the early 1940's, he moved to Connecticut, and soon afterward he sold his first cover painting to The Saturday Evening Post. Side by Side With Rockwell
        During the next 15 years, he painted more than 125 covers for the magazine, many of them inspired by the people and scenes he observed in Westport, which he saw as, in his words, "any town, U.S.A." He also worked side by side with Norman Rockwell, his early inspiration.
        In 1959, he was asked by the United States Postal Service to design a stamp commemorating the 10th anniversary of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In the years that followed, the stamps he designed included those commemorating the recognition of Alaska and Hawaii as states, depicting the Food for Peace Campaign in 1963 and the 25th anniversary of the savings-bond program in 1966. As a design coordinator for the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, he also oversaw the art work on more than 300 other stamps.
        In 1984, the Postal Service's Hall of Stamps in Washington was dedicated in his honor.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan, and a son, Anthony, of Hawaii.
