        Dr. David B. Kimmelman, an ophthalmologist who practiced in New York City for over four decades, died on Tuesday at his home in Lake North, Fla. He was 80 and also had a home in Norwalk, Conn.
        The cause was a major stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Kimmelman, a native of Philadelphia, studied at Jefferson Medical College and Harvard University. He retired from practice about 10 years ago.
        In 1964, he was one of the first doctors to go to Mississippi to treat injured civil rights workers.
        In 1969, as a member of the United States-Cuba Health Exchange, he visited Cuba at the invitation of the Cuban Ministry of Public Health and worked with ophthalmologists there.
        In 1974, he visited North Vietnam as the leader of a United States medical team. He taught eye-surgery techniques to Vietnamese doctors. Travel to North Vietnam was forbidden at the time but because the visit was strictly for medical purposes, the group was not prosecuted. Dr. Kimmelman was accompanied by his wife, an occupational therapist with a special interest in prosthetics,
        He was a founding member of Physicians for Social Responsibility, an anti-nuclear group.
        Dr. Kimmelman is survived by his wife, Edythe; two sons, Michael, of Manhattan, the chief art critic of The New York Times, and Burt, of Brooklyn; and one grandchild.
