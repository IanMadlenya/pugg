        Everett Sumner Crosby, who operated the High Tor vineyards and winery in Rockland County for more than 20 years, died on Monday at Memorial Hospital in Ormond Beach, Calif. A former resident of West Nyack, N.Y., and Ocho Rios, Jamaica, he was 82 and had lived in Ormond Beach since 1989.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Crosby, who was also a writer, bought the High Tor site with its historic Van Orden House in 1950 to prove that he could produce quality grapes and wines just 20 miles north of the George Washington Bridge. His products stood the test as he marketed as much of his Rockland White, Rockland Red and Rockland Rose as he could produce.
        He sold the vineyard in the early 1970's and published "The Vintage Years: The Saga of High Tor Vineyards."
        He next moved his family to Ocho Rios as owner and operator of Cliff Properties guest cottages. This, too, led to a book, "The Land of Wind and Water."
        A native of Alameda, Calif., he graduated from the University of Southern California, where he studied music and writing. He spent 12 years in New York City, as head of the English section of the Voice of America in World War II, and writing radio scripts.
        Mr. Crosby is survived by his wife of 63 years, Alma; a daughter, Averil Crosby Smith of Weston, Conn., and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  January 14, 1994, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about Everett S. Crosby, who operated the High Tor vineyards and winery in Rockland County, N.Y., for more than 20 years, misidentified the place of his retirement and death. It was Ormond Beach in Florida, not California.
