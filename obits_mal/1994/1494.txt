        David J. Freiman, a management consultant, died on Friday in Los Angeles. A resident of Stamford, Conn., he was 63.
        He died while attending a cable-television convention, his family said. The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Freiman was the founder, president and chief executive of the Stamford Consulting Group, a consortium specializing in the development of new businesses. He wrote extensively on marketing, packaging and solid-waste management and held more than 20 patents in those areas.
        He was a graduate of the University of Mississippi and earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering at Columbia University. Before founding his company in 1985, he spent 30 years with Corning Inc. and the Imperial Schrade Corporation, a Manhattan-based manufacturer of knives and kitchen tools. He held senior staff positions at both companies.
        At Corning, he belonged to the team that developed Pyrex glassware and Corning Ware. He also was involved in the management of Corning subsidiaries overseas.
        Mr. Freiman is survived by a daughter, Jane Freiman-Tonghini of Cherry Hill, N.J.; two sons, James, of Stamford and Steven, of Los Angeles; and two sisters, Barbara Hariton of Chicago and Harriet Schwartz of Rockaway, N.J.
