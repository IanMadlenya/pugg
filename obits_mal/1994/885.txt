        David D. Gray, a retired insurance executive in Manhattan, died on Monday at his summer home on Nantucket. Mr. Gray, who also had a home in Greenwich, Conn., was 68.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Lucile.
        Mr. Gray held several executive positions with the Continental Insurance Companies in Manhattan, which he joined in 1949. His service included the presidency of AFCO, a premium-financing group, and presidency of Diner's Club International, which were both subsidiaries of Continental. He retired in 1979.
        Mr. Gray was a 1948 graduate of Princeton University and served in Korea as a Marine Corps lieutenant from 1950 to 1952.
        Mr. Gray is survived by his wife; two daughters, Joan White of Jackson, N.H., and Lynn Gray of Weston, Conn.; four grandchildren, and a brother, Gordon S. Gray of Greenwich.
