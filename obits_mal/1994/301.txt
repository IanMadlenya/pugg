        Malcolm Hough Fraser, a founder of the Genuine Parts Company and of the Stuttering Foundation of America, died on Thursday at his home in Memphis. He was 91.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Jane Fraser Fulcher of Washington.
        Mr. Fraser and his older brother, Carlyle, founded Genuine Parts in Atlanta in 1928. In 1938, the younger brother became president of the Memphis warehouse and trained many of the employees who now manage the company, which is one of the world's largest retailers of auto supplies.
        The company, with more than 19,000 employees, had more than $4 billion in sales in 1993, a spokesman said yesterday.
        Mr. Fraser retired in 1972 as president of the Memphis warehouse but remained a director of the company until his death.
        Mr. Fraser, who had a speech impediment, wrote "Self-Therapy for the Stutterer," which has been translated into eight languages. In 1947 he founded the Memphis-based Stuttering Foundation of America and gave the group most of its $10 million endowment. His daughter succeeded him as president of the foundation.
        A native of Cornwall on Hudson, N.Y., he attended Hamilton College for two years and was graduated in 1924 from the University of Pittsburgh.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two grandchildren.
