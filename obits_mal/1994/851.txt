        Jack Harrold, a tenor who also coached other opera singers, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his sister-in-law, Dorothea Harrold.
        Mr. Harrold specialized in comic-opera roles for five decades. He sang at the New York City Opera for most of the last 50 seasons. Among his roles there were Baron Popoff in "The Merry Widow," Ko-Ko in "The Mikado," Hauk-Sendorf in "The Makropoulos Case" and both Prince Orlofsky and the jailor Frosch in "Die Fledermaus."
        This year, he won praise as the crotchety Mr. Kaplan in the Houston Grand Opera's production of Kurt Weill's "Street Scene."
        He also appeared on Broadway in the original productions of the musical comedies "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown."
        In New York, he privately taught voice and operatic repertory on and off since the late 1960's. For some years in the 1960's and 70's, he taught at the University of Oklahoma in Norman and staged student productions.
        Mr. Harrold was born in Atlantic City, the son of a Metropolitan Opera tenor, Orville Harrold. He was in the Army in World War II and studied at the Juilliard School of Music and the Academy of Music in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his brother, Edward, of Ventnor, N.J.
