        William Hale Ferguson, an executive of resort and beach clubs in Queens and Long Island, died on Thursday at his second home in Lawrence, L.I. He was 77 and lived in Sanibel Island, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, said Thomas P. August, a business associate.
        At his death, Mr. Ferguson was president of the Breezy Point Surf Club and Silver Gull Club at Breezy Point, Queens, and the Silver Point Beach Club and Sun and Surf Beach Club in Atlantic Beach, L.I.
        He graduated from Yale University in 1939 and joined J. C. Penney in Lansing, Mich. He served with the 45th Infantry Division of the Army in Europe, received two Bronze Stars and was discharged as a major.
        After the war, Mr. Ferguson worked for J. C. Penney before joining the Rockaway Point Development Corporation and eventually became involved in the management of the shore clubs on the Atlantic.
