        Robert J. Schack, a lawyer with the Attorney General's office of New York State, died late last month at his home in Manhattan. He was 49.
        His father, Dr. Jerome Schack, said his son's body was found in his apartment on Thursday and that the apparent cause of death was cardiac arrest.
        Mr. Schack supervised litigation involving the New York State Department of Social Services. He was regarded as an expert on family law, domestic violence and child protection and was the author of nine state laws dealing with prosecutions in such areas as adoption and foster care, juvenile justice and child sexual abuse.
        G. Oliver Koppell, the New York State Attorney General, said that Mr. Schack "was a committed and deeply respected advocate for reform in our legal system's treatment of abused and neglected children, battered spouses and victims of alcoholism and drug dependency."
        He was a graduate of Haverford College and New York University Law School. Before joining the Attorney General's staff, Mr. Schack had been an aide to Mayor John V. Lindsay and a lawyer with the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York.
        In 1974 Mr. Schack helped found and became the first president of the WNCN Listeners' Guild, which sought to have the station maintain its classical music format. WNCN-FM changed its format to all-rock and its call letters to WAXQ last month.
        Mr. Schack is survived by his father, and his mother, Elizabeth T. Schack, both of Manhattan; a brother, Samuel D., of Buffalo, and a sister, Elizabeth Silver-Schack of Evanston, Ill.
