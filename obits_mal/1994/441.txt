        Earnest H. Royal, a Vermont restaurateur and long-time board member of the National Restaurant Association, died on March 13 at Rutland Regional Medical Center. He was 76 and lived in Lake Bomoseen.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Willa Royal, his wife of 56 years.
        For the past 30 years, Mr. Royal and his wife ran Royal's Hearthside Restaurant in Rutland, whose regional dishes and traditional New England seafood found favor with tourists and residents alike. In 1975 he became the first black board member of the Restaurant Association and was involved in programs to attract more minority members into the restaurant business.
        Born in Boston the son of a railroad waiter, Mr. Royal started out in the business as a teen-ager working as a busboy. He learned to cook after landing a job with the Statle chain. During World War II, he served in the Merchant Marine.
        He then earned a degree in restaurant management at Boston College and moved through a number of positions in the industry. A determined saver, he finally obtained a restaurant of his own in Massachusetts. Snubbed by the banks when he tried to finance its expansion, he moved to Rutland, took over an abandoned restaurant and turned it into Royal's Hearthside.
        He also taught at Boston College and was active in other business associations, including the Canadian Restaurant and Food Services Association, of which he was an international director.
