        The cause was cancer, his family said.

He left Digital, where he was considered a major contributor to the company's success in European markets, in 1992 to take his position with A.T.& T.
        Mr. Stone graduated from Harvard University in 1964, and earned a master's degree in computer and information science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia A. of Bernardsville; two sons, David of Geneva, Switzerland, and Paul of Bernardsville; a daughter, Katherine Fedor of Nashua, N.H.; his parents, Peter L. and Eliza D., both of Beverly Farms, Mass., and two grandchildren.
