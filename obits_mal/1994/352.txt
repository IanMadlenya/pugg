        Harvey Leibenstein, an author and professor of economics at Harvard University for 20 years, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 71.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Margaret, said.
        Beginning in 1967, Dr. Leibenstein held the Harvard chair of Andelot Professor of Economics and Population. He retired in 1987.
        He was the author of several books on economic theory, including "Economic Backwardness and Economic Growth" (1957), "Beyond Economic Man" (1977) and "Inside the Firm: Inefficiency of Hierarchy" (1987).
        In his 1977 work, Dr. Leibenstein argued for a concept of "selective rationality" as the basic psychological assumption to explain human economic behavior. This, he said, is a compromise between the way people would like to see themselves behave and the way they would wish to behave in the absence of any constraints.
        Dr. Leibenstein held degrees from Northwestern and Princeton universities and was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley from 1951 to 1967.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Rabbi Ben Dov Leibenstein of Chicago.
