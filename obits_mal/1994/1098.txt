        Douglas S. Morrow, a screenwriter who won an Academy Award for "The Stratton Story," died on Sept. 9 in Kingston, N.Y., while on vacation. He was 81 and lived in Glendale, Calif.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said his wife, Margot Stevens Morrow.
        Mr. Morrow was born and reared in Manhattan, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Columbia University and a bachelor's and master's degree in law from New York University.
        After appearing in small film roles, he tried his hand at screen writing, specializing in stories about men who triumph over adversity. "The Stratton Story" (1949), with James Stewart and June Allyson, told the story of Monty Stratton, a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox who lost his right leg in a hunting accident and yet fought his way back to pitch in the minor leagues. Mr. Morrow received the Oscar for best motion picture story.
        With Vincent X. Flaherty, he wrote the screenplay for "Jim Thorpe: All American" (1951). He also wrote the screenplays for "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" (1956) and "Maurie"(1973).
        In 1951 Mr. Morrow was signed by Warner Brothers as a producer. He later wrote the scripts for some 200 television programs.
        In his later years, Mr. Morrow, an avid mountain climber, took part in the physiological training program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He was a member of NASA's advisory council and a co-chairman of its communications subcommittee. In 1991 NASA awarded him its public service award.
        He is survived by his wife.
