        Robert Kagan, a New York lawyer and a former chairman of Community Board 7, on the Upper West Side, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 67 and had lived on the Upper West Side for the last 30 years.
        The cause was pneumonia, and he had heart surgery in December, said his son Marc.
        At his death, Mr. Kagan was a longtime partner in the Manhattan law firm of Kagan & Lubic. It has worked with tenant associations involved in negotiations with landlords about converting rented apartments to co-ops.
        Mr. Kagan was chairman of the community board from 1969 to 1971 and from 1974 to 1975 and was a member for more than a decade. Its district extends from 59th to 110th Street and from Central Park West to the Hudson River.
        From 1971 to 1975 he was also the chairman of COMBO, a committee representing West Side community boards, which opposed the Westway highway project. In 1968 he was the president of the United Parents Association, a citywide parents' advocacy group. He was also a trustee of the West End Synagogue.
        Mr. Kagan was born in Brooklyn, grew up in its Flatbush section and received a B.A. from Penn State University in 1948, an LL.B. from Yale in 1951 and a master's degree in law from New York University.
        In World War II he was a sergeant in the United States Army, and in later years he was a trustee of the American Diabetes Association.
        In addition to his son Marc, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Gloria Gittelman; another son, Irving, of Manhattan; a daughter, Elena, of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
