        Alec Nove, a Russian-born British economist and longtime critic of the Soviet system, died on May 15 in a hospital in Voss, Norway. He was 78 and lived in Glasgow.
        The cause was a heart attack he suffered while vacationing in Norway, his son David said.
        Professor Nove taught at the University of Glasgow from 1963 until he retired in 1982, and also headed its Institute for Soviet and East European Studies. He taught at the London School of Economics from 1958 to 1963.
        Summing up his career on Friday in the British newspaper The Independent, Tam Dalyell, a British author and Labor Party figure, wrote, "Nove tutored informed opinion about the Soviet Union for 30 years."
        Professor Nove's books included "An Economic History of the U.S.S.R." (Viking Penguin, 1969) and "The Soviet Economic System" (Unwin Hyman, 1977).
        His 1989 book, "Glasnost in Action: Cultural Renaissance in Russia" (Unwin Hyman), was praised in the United States as a helpful and compassionate Baedeker for the bumpy road of glasnost and perestroika, no matter what unpredictable turn they might take.
        In a 1976 article, Professor Nove wrote that the prospects for Soviet agriculture were bleak unless the peasants were "again made to feel a direct interest in the result of their work." He added, "In five years' time there will still be shortages, and Soviet leaders will still be worrying about how to improve the performance of this, the weakest sector of the Soviet economy."
        He was a fellow of the British Academy and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
        Professor Nove was born Aleksandr Novakovsky in Petrograd, Russia, now St. Petersburg. He was the son of Jacob Novakovsky, a social democratic Menshevik who moved to London with his family in 1924.
        He is survived by his wife and three sons.
