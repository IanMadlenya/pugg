        John J. McCabe, an entrepreneur who founded the first company to transport horses by airplane, died on Wednesday in Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 72 and lived in Garden City, L.I.
        The cause was heart failure, said his sister, Teresa Crowe.
        Mr. McCabe was in the Naval Air Transport Service during World War II and later worked for American Airlines. While with that company he designed a system of padding and restraints that made it practical to transport horses by air.
        He founded the John J. McCabe Horse Transportation Company in Garden City in 1949, and over the years the company flew hundreds of animals owned by prominent stables to racetracks throughout the world.
        He is survived by two daughters, Virginia Erhardt of Garden City and Mary D'Aquilla of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Peter of Garden City; two sisters, Mary Sullivan of Huntington, L.I., and Mrs. Crowe of Jackson Heights, Queens, and five grandchildren.
