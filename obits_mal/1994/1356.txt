        Maurice B. Stein, owner of a well-known summer camp in upstate New York, died on Monday in the crash of an American Eagle commuter plane near Roselawn, Ind. He was 58.
        For 30 years, Mr. Stein and his wife, the former Amy Medine, operated Camp Echo Lake, five miles northwest of Lake George in Warrensburg, N.Y.
        At his death, Mr. Stein, known as Morry, was en route to his home in Hartsdale, N.Y., after working on a fund-raising program for underprivileged children at the headquarters of the American Camping Association in Martinsville, Ind., his son Tony said.
        Mr. Stein, a stalwart of the camping industry, was a former president of the American Camping Association and its New York section, as well as a former president of the New York State Camp Directors Association.
        He was 28 when he bought Camp Echo Lake from his wife's parents, who founded it in 1946. Under Maurice and Amy Stein, the camp expanded to 150 acres and its enrollment grew from 80 campers to about 450, boys and girls ages 8 to 17.
        Mr. Stein also founded the Echo Lake Idea, a scholarship program that for 25 years has brought 40 or 50 underprivileged city children from around the state to the camp for a fully paid week's vacation at the end of August.
        Mr. Stein, a native of Bloomsburg, Pa., was a 1958 graduate of Brandeis University. He received an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1960 and worked for several years in business before buying Camp Echo Lake in 1964.
        Besides his wife and son Tony, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Stein is survived by his sons George, of Manhattan, and Eric, of Hartsdale.
