        Paul J. Goldin, a former statistics professor who parlayed his son's interest in baseball cards into Score Board Inc., a multimillion-dollar marketing company specializing in sports collectibles, died on Saturday at West Jersey Hospital in Voorhees, N.J. He was 62.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, the family said.
        Mr. Goldin, a native of Brooklyn, was an adjunct professor of statistics at Drexel University in Philadelphia in 1986 when he became intrigued by the commercial possibilities of his son Ken's baseball-card hobby.
        Together with Ken, who was then 21, he founded Score Board, initially to market and distribute baseball cards. Since then the publicly-traded company, based in Cherry Hill, N.J., has expanded into other collectibles, other sports and into general entertainment merchandise.
        In addition to his son, who succeeds him as Score Board's chairman and president, Mr. Goldin is survived by his wife, Carole; a daughter, Sharon Didinsky; a sister, Betty Silverman, and a grandson.
