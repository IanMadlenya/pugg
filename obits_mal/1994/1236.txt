        James Monks, an actor who began his career on Broadway in the 1930's and later worked in films and modeling, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said Benedict Bonino, a friend.
        Mr. Monks first appeared in Broadway in George Abbott's production of "Brother Rat" in 1936. He also had roles in "Yesterday's Magic" (1942), with Jessica Tandy; "Othello" (1943), with Paul Robeson; "The Story of Mary Surratt" (1947), with Dorothy Gish, and "Auntie Mame" (1956), with Rosalind Russell.
        His film credits include "How Green Was My Valley" (1941) and "Joan of Paris" (1942). He also played dramatic roles on television.
        Mr. Monks left the theater in the mid-1950's and embarked on a successful career as a model.
        He is survived by a brother, John, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., a playwright and screenwriter.
