        Sir Robert Cockburn, a British radar specialist who helped hamper the ability of German radar to spot British and American bombers during World War II, died on March 21 in Aldershot, southwest of London. He was 85 and lived near Aldershot.
        Sir Robert was born in Belford, Northumberland, studied at London University and did research on communications and radar from 1937 to 1945.
        He headed a group of engineers and scientists who worked on measures to defeat Germany's electronic systems, including radar. The British newspaper The Independent, in an obituary on Thursday, called him "a main contributor both to the reduction of civilian casualties" from German air raids on Britain "and of losses among British bombers."
        The British developed an anti-radar technology called Window. An American military historian, Col. R. Ernest Dupuy, said Window "was the code name for barrages of metalized paper strips" sprinkled from aircraft "to confuse enemy electronic detecting devices."
        Winston Churchill wrote in 1950, in "The Hinge of Fate," that preliminary tests showed that "strips of paper with one side metalized, such as is often used to wrap up chocolate, would give radar echoes almost exactly like those produced by ordinary bombers."
        Both the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces began making extensive use of Window during missions over Germany. After the war, Sir Robert was awarded high British and United States military awards. He was knighted in 1960, after holding various scientific posts.
        Sir Robert married Phyllis Hoyland in 1935; they had two daughters.
