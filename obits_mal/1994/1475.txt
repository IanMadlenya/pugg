        Dr. Charles A. Ribaudo, who was chief of pulmonary medicine at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan for 20 years until his retirement in 1978, died last Friday at the Carillon House Nursing Home in Huntington, L.I. He was 85 and lived in Ridge, L.I.
        The cause was lung cancer, said a son, Msgr. Charles Ribaudo of Oyster Bay, L.I.
        On the staff of St. Vincent's since 1951, Dr. Ribaudo was president of the medical staff in 1969-1970. He was also the medical director of the Mount Carmel Nursing Home in Manhattan before its closing in the late 1970's, and was a medical consultant to the New York City Fire Department and the New York Giants football team during the 1950's and 1960's.
        He was born in Manhattan and received his undergraduate degree from New York University and his medical degree from the university in 1932. His private practice, which he began in 1935, was interrupted from 1941 to 1945 when he served with the Army Medical Corps in North Africa and Italy.
        Also surviving are his wife of 59 years, Anne; two other sons, Edward F., of Huntington, L.I., and Thomas P., of Stony Brook, L.I., six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
