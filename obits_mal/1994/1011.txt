        Thomas Fulton, a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, died on Thursday in Milan, Italy, where he was vacationing. He was 44 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his brother, Charles.
        Mr. Fulton made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1981 and conducted more than 20 operas for the company, most recently "Tosca" in Central Park in June. He worked frequently in Europe, conducting the Orchestre National de France and the orchestras of the Paris Opera and other houses in France and Germany.
        He was also an associate conductor of the San Francisco Opera, the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Ravinia Festival, the Opera Company of Boston and EMI Records.
        In addition to his brother, of Gainesville, Fla., he is survived by his father, Joseph, of Fairfield Bay, Ark.
