        Samuel Lipman, the pianist and critic who was the publisher of The New Criterion, a conservative review of the arts, was remembered yesterday at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan for his brilliance, integrity and devotion to the arts.
        About 500 people attended the service for Mr. Lipman, who died of leukemia on Saturday at the age of 60.
        Hugo Weisgall, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer whose Sonata for Piano was introduced by Mr. Lipman in 1983 at Carnegie Recital Hall, called him "the virtual embodiment of Beethoven when he declared, 'I want to seize fate by the throat.' "
        "Sam pursued his interests with a passionate intensity," Mr. Weisgall said.
        Norman Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary, for whom Mr. Lipman wrote music criticism, likened Mr. Lipman to Shakespeare's Iago when he said, "I am nothing if not critical," but Mr. Podhoretz added that unlike Iago, Mr. Lipman was driven by love rather than malice.
        Leonard Garment, who was a cultural adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, recalled Mr. Lipman's service on the National Council on the Arts in the 1980's and remarked: "To his last days, Sam had two unshakable convictions about the National Endowment for the Arts: that it had to be dramatically reformed and that it had to be preserved."
        "Killing it," Mr. Garment said Mr. Lipman had told him in his last days, "would make the United States seem like a nation of yahoos."
