        John Grozier, a vice president in the private banking division of Citibank, died last Friday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan and Williamstown, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Grozier graduated from Harvard College in 1956. During his 33 years at Citibank, his responsibilities included monitoring conflicts of interest and regulatory procedures in the investment management group and setting up a training program on business ethics. Most recently he specialized in trusts and estates.
        He lectured on business ethics at the Wharton School of Business and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also sat on the boards of several schools and charitable organizations.
        A lifelong commitment to music and the arts led him to serve as treasurer of the Koussevitzy Music Foundation, the Aaron Copland Fund for Music and the St. Cecilia Chorus. He was an active alumni member of the Harvard Glee Club and a director and past president of the Morningside House Nursing Home in the Bronx.
        Mr. Grozier is survived by his wife, Ann Wilson Grozier; a daughter, Kate Grozier Laguarda of Washington; three sons, John J. of Falmouth, Mass., David of Ossining, N.Y., and Theodore of Manhattan; a sister, Mary Grozier, of Brielle, N.J., and a brother, Richard of Framingham, Mass.
