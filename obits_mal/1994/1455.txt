        Lawrence R. Dewey, a retired major general who was a combat commander in World War II and chief of staff of the IX Corps in the Korean War, died last Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 93.
        His family said the cause was Parkinson's disease.
        General Dewey graduated with the 400-member West Point class of 1924, then the largest since World War I and known among Army commanders as the "thundering herd." He held several commands in a career that spanned five decades and retired in 1961 as chief of the Army Audit Agency.
        A native of Des Moines, he was a descendant of Adm. George Dewey, the Spanish-American War hero.
        Lawrence Dewey began his Army career as a cavalry commander and a signal officer. In World War II he served as an armored commander in North Africa and Italy, winning the Distinguished Service Cross twice, the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with several oak-leaf clusters and a Purple Heart.
        In his cavalry days he was a trophy-winning polo player and an honorary member of Squadron A in Manhattan, a club for men of achievement, social prominence and equestrian skill.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two sons, Lawrence, of Wintergreen, Va., and Donald, of Washington; two daughters, Elizabeth Dewey Vance of Charlotte, N.C., and Florence Dewey Hughes of Washington, seven grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
