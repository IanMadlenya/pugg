        Arthur J. Minasy, an entrepreneur and inventor who developed the surveillance tags used in retail stores to thwart shoplifters, died on Monday in Brussels. Mr. Minasy, who lived in Woodbury, L.I., was 68.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his daughter, Kathy Nicollette.
        Mr. Minasy was the founder and chairman of the Knogo Corporation in Hauppauge, L.I., which produces the small plastic tags that hang on clothing and other articles for sale in stores.
        In 1966 Mr. Minasy created and patented a device that can be attached to items offered for sale. If a thief tries to leave a store without paying for an item an alarm is set off.  Cashiers remove the tag after a customer pays.
        The company also makes magnetic strips that can be permanently fixed to articles like library books and hospital linens to prevent theft. The strips activate a sensor that flashes a light or sounds an alarm if the books or linens have not been properly checked out.
        Knogo plants in Mons, Belgium, and Cidra, Puerto Rico, produce the devices, which can be detected by either radio or electromagnetic sensors.
        Mr. Minasy graduated from New York University with an engineering degree in 1949 and a master's degree in industrial engineering in 1952. During World War II he served with the Office of Strategic Services.
        He is survived by his wife, Jayne, of Woodbury; a son, Keith, of Redondo Beach, Calif.; two daughters, Karen Hatgis of Manhattan and Mrs. Nicolette of Fort Salonga, L.I., and two granddaughters.
