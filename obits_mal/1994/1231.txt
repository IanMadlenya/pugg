        Eric Lopez, a leader in the fight to raise public awareness of epidermolysis bullosa, the rare, debilitating skin disease from which he suffered, died yesterday at his home on Staten Island. He was 24.
        The cause was kidney and liver failure due to complications of the disease, said his mother, Arlene Pessar.
        Epidermolysis bullosa causes severe blistering that scars the internal organs and deforms the hands and feet. In 1979, working with his mother, Mr. Lopez helped found Debra of America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting research into the disease.
        He testified before Congress at least six times in the 1980's, urging Federal appropriations for research as well as legislation that created five clinical centers and a national registry of patients.
        "We estimate that 50,000 to 100,000 people suffer from the disease," Ms. Pessar said, "but not with Eric's form, which is the most severe." She said that her son's form of the disease was inherited through recessive genes and that he had been "wrapped in special bandages since he was 1 month old."
        But he never complained of pain, she said, and, making himself independently mobile with a wheelchair and an electric scooter, graduated from the Brooklyn Friends School in 1988. He then studied automotive engineering for a year at Brooklyn Polytechnical Institute and attended the College of Staten Island.
        Besides his mother, of Park Slope, Brooklyn, Mr. Lopez is survived by his father, Richard, of Puerto Rico, and his grandmother Pauline Pessar of Canarsie, Brooklyn.
