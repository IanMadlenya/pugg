        Roger (Ram) Ramirez, the pianist and composer of the song "Lover Man," died on Tuesday at the Parkway Hospital in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 80.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Marcy.
        Though Mr. Ramirez is best known for "Lover Man," which he wrote in 1942, his career as a pianist spanned a good portion of jazz history. He was a child prodigy, and by the age of 20 he was performing with some of the best jazz musicians in New York. In 1933 he worked with the cornetist Rex Stewart and the drummer Sid Catlett, and a year later joined the Spirits of Rhythm. In 1935 he became a member of Willie Bryant's band.
        During the 1940's he worked with Ella Fitzgerald, the trumpeter Frankie Newton, and the big-band leader Charlie Barnet. And he spent two years working with John Kirby's influential sextet. Throughout his career he was known as a fine, sensitive accompanist who played in a swing style.
        Billie Holiday recorded "Lover Man" in 1944, and from then on Mr. Ramirez's reputation as a songwriter was set. His other tunes included "Mad About You," "I Just Refuse to the Sing the Blues" and "Shook."
        In the 1950's Mr. Ramirez took up the organ, and the late 1960's he toured with the blues guitarist T-Bone Walker, the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band and others. In 1987, because of ill health, Mr. Ramirez retired from music.
        He is survived by his wife, and a daughter, Michele Ramirez, both of Queens.
