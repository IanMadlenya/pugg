        James J. McCahon, an architect of the new American headquarters of the Bertelsmann company, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 38 years old.
        The cause was AIDS-related lymphoma, said Rob Goldfarb, his companion.
        Mr. McCahon graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago in 1979. He worked for the New York office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Grad Partnership in Newark and three other New York firms.
        In 1992, he joined Swanke Hayden Connell Architects in Manhattan, where he was a senior designer. The firm finished the interior of an empty skyscraper at 1540 Broadway, at 45th Street, after it was bought by Bertelsmann, the German media and entertainment conglomerate.
        Besides Mr. Goldfarb, Mr. McCahon is survived by his parents, John T. and Joan McCahon of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.; a sister, Joanie Murray of Collegeville, Pa., and two brothers, Joseph, of Phoenixville, Pa., and John, of Phoenix.
