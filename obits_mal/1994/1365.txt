        Dr. M. Michael Cohen, an expert in pediatric dentistry, died on Oct. 17 at a nursing home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 89 and lived in Cambridge.
        Dr. Cohen had suffered a long illness, said his son, Dr. M. Michael Cohen Jr. of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
        In his career, which included a private practice as well as teaching, Dr. Cohen was among those who broadened the study of dentistry by emphasizing oral pathology and pediatric dentistry.
        At Tufts University, where he taught for more than 40 years, he was one of the first dentists to hold a professorial rank in the pediatrics department of a medical school. At the Boston Floating Hospital, he became the first dentist appointed to deal with diseases of the mouth.
        An interest in the problems of mentally disabled and physically handicapped people led him to help found the Academy of Dentistry for Patients With Disabilities.
        He retired from teaching at Tufts in 1971. He then joined Harvard University's School of Dental Medicine, which in 1978 established a teaching and research fund in his name.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a second son, Dr. Richard M. Cohen of Boston, and four grandchildren.
