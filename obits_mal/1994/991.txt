        Konstantin Kalser, a writer, producer and director of documentary films, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 73 and lived in Amagansett, L.I.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Martha.
        Mr. Kalser won an Academy Award in 1954 for producing and directing "Crashing the Water Barrier," a short documentary about Donald Campbell who broke the speed barrier on water. He also wrote, produced and directed industrial films for many companies, including Mobil Oil, American Express and Chrysler, for which he made the Emmy-nominated film "For Years to Come." He was in charge of production for "The Unknown War," a syndicated television series about the Eastern Front in World War II.
        Mr. Kalser was born in Munich, Germany, and attended college in Switzerland. In 1937 he joined his mother, a screenwriter, in Hollywood. After serving in the Air Force in World War II, he worked as a photographer for Life magazine. In 1948 he formed Marathon International Productions, where he produced and directed some of television's first newsreels. That same year he filmed the first televised Olympic Games from St. Moritz for the Dumont Television Network. Later, his short subjects were released by Paramount, Universal, Warner Brothers and United Artists.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Terence; a daughter, Corinne; and two stepsons, Richard and David.
