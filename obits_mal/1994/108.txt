        Maj. Gen. Harold E. Watson, a pioneering Air Force pilot and aeronautical engineer, died on Wednesday at Jupiter Hospital in Jupiter, Fla. General Watson, who lived in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., was 82.
        The cause was emphysema, said a friend, Col. Ray Sleeper.
        General Watson was a specialist in air technical intelligence, collecting planes and engineering designs at the end of World War II and bringing them to the United States for inspection and analysis.
        With thousands of captured documents and scores of German and Japanese aircraft, he went on to help organize the Air Technical Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.
        He later served in a series of intelligence posts with the Air Force, retiring in 1963 to join the General Electric Company as a consultant.
        He received engineering degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the University of Michigan.
        General Watson is survived by his wife, Ruth, of Palm Beach Gardens; a son, Hunter S., of Reston, Va., and a brother, Donald C., of Summit, N.J.
