        Alain Cuny, a tall and ascetic-looking French actor who seemed made to play priests and aristocrats, died on Monday night at the Cochin Hospital in Paris. He was 85.
        Mr. Cuny was born and educated in St. Malo in Brittany, and studied acting in Paris, where the playwright Paul Claudel gave him his first big break, in 1941.
        After World War II, Mr. Cuny played the classics, particularly Shakespeare, at the Theatre National de Paris and then joined the Renaud-Barrault company.
        Although he preferred the stage, "as therapy to avoid going crazy," he gained renown through films, which included Marcel Carne's "Visiteurs du Soir," Jean Delannoy's "Hunchback of Notre Dame," Louis Malle's "Lovers," Fellini's "Dolce Vita" and "Satyricon," Marcel Ophuls's "Banana Peel," Luis Bunuel's "Milky Way" and Francesco Rosi's "Christ Stopped at Eboli." His most recent screen appearances were in "Camille Claudel" and "Knights of the Round Table."
        He made one stage appearance in New York, in 1963, when Sol Hurok presented the Marie Bell company in Racine's "Phedre." He spent the last several years giving readings from the works of great writers.
