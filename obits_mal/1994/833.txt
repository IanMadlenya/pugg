        Dr. Albert John Phillips Sr., a retired vice president and director of research for American Smelting and Refining Company, died on Tuesday in Heidelberg, Germany. He was 92 and lived in Long Boat Key, Fla., and Plainfield, N.J.
        He suffered a heart attack while on vacation with his wife, his family said.
        Dr. Phillips earned B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at Yale and went to work for the company -- now called ASARCO -- in 1931. The Manhattan-based company is a leading producer of nonferrous metals.
        He was an expert in the metallurgy involved in extracting copper, lead, zinc  and related metals, held patents in the field, and wrote a number of papers on his specialty. After his retirement in 1967, he served as a consultant to the Governments of Singapore and Colombia, assisting them in establishment mints.
        His first wife, Thelma Newsom Seeley Phillips, died in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Stapleton Phillips; a son, Albert J. Jr., of Plainfield; a daughter, Priscilla Ruddiman of Bendersville, Pa.; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
