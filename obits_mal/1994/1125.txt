        Louis E. Stahl, a retired food company executive who was a supporter of charitable and not-for-profit organizations in Massachusetts, died on Monday at Salem Hospital in Salem, Mass. He was 80 and lived in Swampscott, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Lesley Stahl, a co-editor of the CBS News program "60 Minutes."
        Mr. Stahl retired in 1979 as a vice president of Beatrice Foods. At his death he was the chairman of Rehabilitation Center for the Aged, in Swampscott, where he had also been active in the founding of the North Shore Jewish Community Center and the Jewish Rehabilitation Center for Aged of the North Shore. The other beneficiaries of his largess included Massachusetts General Hospital.
        Born in Boston, he received a B.S. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1936 and went on to become president of a family company, Stahl Finish, makers of chemicals for treating and coloring leather. He also founded another company, Polyvinyl Chemicals, whose products included erasable ink.
        The two companies were units of Stahl Chemical, with headquarters in Wilmington, Mass., when Mr. Stahl sold that company in 1964 to Beatrice Foods, with which he held a succession of executive posts.
        In addition to his daughter, Lesley, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Dorothy Tishler; a son, Jeffrey, of Boston, and three grandchildren.
