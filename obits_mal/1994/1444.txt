        Peter Thomas McKean, a pioneer in the development of the all-electronics department store, died on Tuesday while returning from a business trip to Nevada. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan, Southhampton, L.I., and West Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to his companion, Justin Baxter.
        At his death, Mr. McKean was chief executive officer of Audio Design Associates Inc. in White Plains, a company he founded in 1976. He was prominent for the last 20 years in the consumer-electronics and custom-installation businesses, creating multiroom audio-video and home theater systems for dealers in this country and abroad.
        A native of Manhattan, he grew up in Hartsdale, N.Y., and began to work for a small television shop while in high school. He studied at the RCA Institute and ran another store before he founded his "electronics Saks Fifth Avenue," as he put it.
        Mr. McKean was a direct descendant of Thomas McKean of Delaware, first president of the Continental Congress and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. In addition to Mr. Baxter, he is survived by two sisters, Judith Conlin, a resident of Westchester, and Sandra Dawson of California, and a cousin, Jan Reynolds of Manhattan.
