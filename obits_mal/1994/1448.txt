        The jazz drummer Al Levitt, who performed with Lee Konitz, Chet Baker, Lionel Hampton, Stan Getz and other musicians, died on Monday in Paris. He was 62.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said a friend.
        Mr. Levitt, who was based in France for the last 20 years, was born in New York City on Nov. 11, 1932. He studied with the pianist Lennie Tristano and began playing professionally in 1952, with Charles Mingus and Getz. He moved to the Netherlands in 1956, to Paris in 1957 and in 1958 back to the United States, where he remained until 1966, playing with Jackie MacLean and Mr. Hampton. With the Hampton band, he toured Europe and Asia several times.
        In the early 1970's he played with Mr. Konitz and Zoot Sims, and in 1975 he returned to Paris. He performed with most of the leading French jazz musicians, including Martial Solal, Barney Wilen and Stephane Grappelli.
        He is survived by his wife, Stella, with whom he had seven children.
