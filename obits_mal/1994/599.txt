        Wilbert A. Walker, who retired in 1975 as president of the United States Steel Corporation, died last Friday at his home in Belleair, Fla. Mr. Walker, a former resident of Short Hills, N.J., Manhattan and Ligonier, Pa., was 83.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Walker, who was known as Wib, was born in Pittsburgh, graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, became a certified public accountant and started his career in 1931 as a junior accountant for a Pittsburgh meat packer.
        Before joining United States Steel, now the USX Corporation, in 1941, he worked for Ernst & Ernst and the International Business Machines Corporation. His rise as a steel executive touched all aspects of accounting and financial matters.
        Mr. Walker was named vice president of accounting in 1951 and became vice president and controller in 1956. By 1970 he was chairman of the finance committee, making him the top financial officer of a corporation with an annual revenue of about $5 billion.
        He was elected president in 1973 and retired from the company two years later, but remained as a director until 1983. After stepping down as president of United States Steel, he became president of the American branch of the Moeller Steamship Company, a large shipping concern based in Denmark. He remained with Moeller until his retirement in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Ruth Kercher Walker; a daughter, Virginia Heath of South Windsor, Conn., and three grandchildren.
