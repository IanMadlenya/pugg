        Henry Horowitz, a printer and binder of specialty books for more than 50 years, died on Monday at St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Horowitz, who maintained homes in Palm Beach and Clifton, N.J., was 76.
        The cause was complications after surgery for a ruptured appendix, said his daughter, Linda Rosier.
        Mr. Horowitz was the chairman of Horowitz/Rae Book Manufacturers and two related printing companies, Augustus M. Kelly Publishers and Cachet Products, all of Fairfield, N.J.
        While a 20-year-old student at New York University, Mr. Horowitz assumed command of the family bindery business, A. Horowitz & Son, after the death of his father, Abraham Horowitz. Over the years the small pamphlet bindery in Clifton expanded into a full-service book-binding operation.
        In 1975 it was moved to larger quarters in Fairfield, and in 1987 the company acquired Rae Lithographers. The product line was expanded to include a variety of hard-bound and paper-cover books as well as blank books, sketchbooks and portfolios.
        Mr. Horowitz also operated a museum and library in Fairfield that displayed old machines and hand tools used in printing and binding, together with a collection of 2,000 technical books devoted to the trade.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in North Caldwell, N.J., Mr. Horowitz is survived by his wife of 55 years, Zelda; a son, Alan, also of North Caldwell, and four grandchildren.
