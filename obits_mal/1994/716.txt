        Boris Aleksandrov, a Soviet leader of choral groups that sang propaganda songs and pre-Soviet oldies, cheered up Red Army units in World War II and counted Stalin as a fan, died on June 16 in Moscow, the British newspaper The Independent reported last week. He was 88.
        Colonel Aleksandrov, who received that rank during World War II, won two Lenin Prizes. In 1950, while Stalin was reading aloud the list of the latest Stalin Prize winners, he spontaneously added the colonel's name.
        A native of Bologoye, Russia, the conductor, composer and choirmaster was the son of Aleksandr Aleksandrov, who had the same three metiers.
        Boris Aleksandrov finished his musical studies in Moscow in 1929 and was musical director of the Red Army Central Theater before World War II. In 1942, with the war raging, he became the chief conductor of his father's Red Army Song Ensemble, which had ties to the All-Union Radio Service.
        The ensemble toured the war front, striving to enhance the morale of Soviet troops and officers with stirring renditions of its eclectic repertoire.
        Aleksandr Alexandrov died after the war, in 1946, and Boris Aleksandrov became the artistic director as well as the chief conductor of the ensemble. He included dance numbers in its performances, renamed it the Aleksandr Aleksandrov Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble and headed it until 1986. While Stalin remained in power, he liked to have it perform for him and his foreign visitors.
