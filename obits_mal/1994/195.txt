        Job M. Evans, a dog trainer who wrote extensively about the care of pets, died on Feb. 19 at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 53.
        The cause was AIDS, said his publisher, Sean Frawley.
        Mr. Evans wrote five books about the training of dogs, beginning with "The Evans Guide for Civilized City Canines." His final book, "Training and Experience," is to be published later this year by Howell Bookhouse in New York.
        He was the president of the Dog Writers' Association of America and this month was the recipient of the Ken-L-Ration Fido Award as the dog writer of the year.
        He is survived by his parents, Dr. Leo Evans of Guayama, P.R., and Eileen Evans of Key West.
