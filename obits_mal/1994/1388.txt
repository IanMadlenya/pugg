        The Rev. Philip E. Dobson, an expert on industrial relations and a former dean of the Fordham University School of Business, died on Sunday at Fordham's Murray-Weigel Hall, a Jesuit infirmary in the Bronx. He was 85 and lived in Linden, N.J., most of his life.
        He suffered a long illness, according to the Jesuit community in Jersey City.
        Father Dobson had a long career as an educator and administrator. He was named dean in 1959, in charge of an enrollment of some 1,500 undergraduates training for business professions. He also directed the City Hall division of Fordham and advised the university's president on the construction of Fordham's Lincoln Center branch.
        His expertise was also sought for the mediation of labor disputes. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller recruited him as chairman of a fact-finding board to help settle a strike that shut down the Long Island Rail Road in the summer of 1960.
        Father Dobson was born in Manhattan and held B.A. and M.A. degrees from Woodstock College in Maryland. He taught Latin, history and English at Xavier High School in Manhattan and founded the Xavier Institute of Industrial Relations in the late 1930's.
        He returned to Woodstock in 1939 for four years of theological studies and was ordained in 1942. He was then associated with the Crown-Heights Labor School in Brooklyn until 1946, when he founded St. Peter's College Institute of Industrial Relations in Jersey City. From 1952 until his Fordham appointment, he served as rector and president of Canisius College in Buffalo.
        From 1966 to 1972, he held senior administrative positions at Catholic University's School of Business Administration and Bayamon Central University, both in Puerto Rico.
        Father Dobson is survived by a sister, Mary A. Dobson of Linden.
