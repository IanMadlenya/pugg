        Nicolas Flagello, an American composer and conductor who played a busy role in this country's postwar musical life, died yesterday in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 66.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Walter Simmons, a friend.
        Mr. Flagello, a child prodigy and later a prolific composer, is best remembered for his 1974 oratorio "The Passion of Martin Luther King," which was given its premiere by the National Symphony at the Kennedy Center in Washington played by the National Symphony, and for his 1982 opera, "The Judgment of St. Francis," first performed at the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, Italy.
        His body of work includes six operas, two symphonies, eight concertos and a variety of works in smaller forms. His style, which grew out of the Romantic tradition, became increasingly dissonant with the passing years but was still based on tonal centers and given to expansive expressions of emotion and big climaxes.
        Mr. Flagello was born in New York City. He began composing at the age of 8 and by the age of 10 had performed publicly as a pianist. He studied and later taught at the Manhattan School of Music and in later years was an opera conductor in and around New York.
        Mr. Flagello's marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his sons, Donis and Vittorio, and a brother, Ezio, a bass-baritone who sang at the Metropolitan Opera.
