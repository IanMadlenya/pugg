        Dr. Adrian Lambert, a chest surgeon and fourth-generation Manhattan physician, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital, where he was on the staff for more than 50 years. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had been ill for a long time, his family reported.
        Dr. Lambert, a native of Manhattan, graduated from the Hotchkiss School and, in 1930, Yale University. He earned his medical degree at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1934 and served as chief resident in thoracic surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.
        Besides Roosevelt and Columbia-Presbyterian, his associations included Bellevue Hospital, Southampton Hospital, Harlem Hospital, where he was chief of surgery, and Doctors Hospital, which was founded by his father, Dr. Adrian V. S. Lambert, and his uncle, Dr. Alexander Lambert.
        He was an associate clinical professor at Columbia University, life member of the American College of Surgeons and the Academy of Medicine, and past president of the New York Thoracic Society and the Medical and Surgical Society.
        Dr. Lambert is survived by his wife of nearly 50 years, Mary Alice Bacon Lambert; a son, Adrian L. Jr. of Boston; two daughters, Robin Baskett of Manhattan and Katherine Nissen of Morrisville, Pa.; a brother, Dr. John Trumbull Lambert of Old Black Point, Conn., and one granddaughter.
