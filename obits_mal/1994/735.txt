        Eric G. Nowlin, vice president of communication at R.H. Macy & Co. Inc. and an expert in laser videodisk programming, died last Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.

He received a master's degree in media communications there and a Ph.D. in communication theory and film at Northwestern University. In the late 1970's he was an assistant to the provost at Northwestern.
        In 1980, Mr. Nowlin founded Vidmax Inc. in New York to develop and market video programming for new technologies.
        He joined Macy's in 1993 as a vice president and liaison to the office of the co-chairman.
        Besides Mr. Roefaro, Mr. Nowlin is survived by his mother, Jane Nowlin of Seymour, Ind., and his brothers Joseph of Bloomington, Ind., Thomas of Gaithersburg, Md., and Timothy of Cincinnati.
