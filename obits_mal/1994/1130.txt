        Edwin K. Wiles, an energy consultant who once headed the West Virginia Coal Association, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. He was 50 and lived in Mount Lebanon, Pa.
        As a reporter for United Press International in the late 1960's, Mr. Wiles covered the rescue of coal miners trapped underground in Hominy Falls, W.Va., prompting a lifelong interest in the coal industry.
        That interest lead to jobs as vice president of corporate relations for the West Virginia Coal Association, a group representing coal mine owners, from 1970 to 1974 and president of the association from 1974 to 1985. Later, he worked as an energy consultant specializing in coal interests. Most recently, he was a vice president of the Center for Energy and Economic Development, a Virginia-based organization that promotes coal use.
        He was born in Tunnelton, W.Va., and graduated from West Virginia University.
        He is survived by his wife, Sheri; two sons, Edwin Jr. and Kevin; his mother, Mrs. Harrison Fuller of Keyser, W.Va., and a sister, Carolyn Sue Wiles of Kansas City, Mo.
