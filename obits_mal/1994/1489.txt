        Prof. Arthur Frank Shore, a British scholar who was an expert on Egypt in Late Antiquity, died on Nov. 27 at Southport, 17 miles north of Liverpool, England. He was 70.
        He had been seriously ill in recent months, The Times of London reported.
        Professor Shore, who wrote as A. F. Shore, was Brunner Professor of Egyptology at Liverpool University from 1974 to 1991 after being on the staff of the British Museum from 1957 to 1974. He was chairman of the Egypt Exploration Society for several years until last summer.
        His 1962 monograph, "Portrait Painting from Roman Egypt," has won praise for its survey of mummy portraits disinterred from burial sites in the Faiyum area of Upper Egypt. The period when Egypt was dominated by ancient Rome began in 30 B.C., with the suicide of Cleopatra, and ended in 642 A.D., when an Arab general made a victorious entry into Alexandria.
        Also in the 1960's, at a time of efforts to study and preserve relics in anticipation of flooding caused by the construction of the Aswan High Dam, Professor Shore joined Polish experts working on frescoes dating from the early Christian era at Faras, beside the Nile River near the border with Sudan.
        He was also an expert in Coptic, the form of the ancient Egyptian language that was spoken early in the Christian era, and in a simplified system of ancient Egyptian writing that was used in the last centuries before the Christian era.
        Professor Shore was born in Hertfordshire and studied at Cambridge University, with time out for army service in World War II. He was a lecturer at Liverpool University before going to the British Museum.
        He is survived by his wife of 42 years, the former Patricia Tillett; two sons and two daughters.
