        Eliot H. Sharp, the founder and for 35 years publisher of the Investment Dealers' Digest, a financial trade magazine published in Manhattan, died on Friday at his home in Morrisville, Pa. He was 90.
        The cause was the effects of old age, said his son, Timothy.
        Mr. Sharp founded the magazine in 1935, retiring in 1970. In the course of his career in financial journalism, he also published several newsletters dealing with corporate and municipal financing and, in 1949, began a series of annual investment company seminars.
        Mr. Sharp graduated from the University of Wisconsin, worked as a journalist and teacher in Tokyo and began writing about Wall Street in 1927. He was a major in the Army during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two sons, Timothy, of Morrisville, and Michael, of Pond Eddy, Pa.
