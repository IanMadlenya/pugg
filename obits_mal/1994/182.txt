        Dr. E. P. Conkle, professor emeritus of drama at the University of Texas at Austin whose plays were produced on Broadway and in theaters across the country, died on Friday at Seton Medical Center in Austin. He was 94.
        The cause was a lung infection, said his wife, Virginia.
        Dr. Conkle taught playwriting in the department of theater and dance at the University of Texas from 1939 to 1973. Several of his plays, including "200 Were Chosen" (1936) and "Prologue to Glory" (1938), were produced on Broadway.
        Among Dr. Conkle's students when he taught playwriting at the University of Iowa was Tennessee Williams; at the University of Texas, his students included Pat Hingle, Tommy Tune and Fess Parker.
        Ellsworth Prouty Conkle was born on July 10, 1899, and grew up on a farm in Nebraska. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Nebraska. He did graduate work at Yale University from 1926 to 1928, won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1929 and received Rockefeller Foundation Fellowships from 1934 to 1936. He received a doctorate in playwriting at the University of Iowa in 1936.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, E. P. 2d, of Austin; a daughter, Alice Elena Cogdill of Arlington, Tex.; two brothers, Francis, of Wheatland, Colo., and Orville, of Peru, Neb., and six grandchildren.
