        Larry Klein, a world champion yachtsman from San Diego, died Saturday in a boating accident while competing in the Big Boat Series, an annual event in San Francisco Bay. He was 42.
        Mr. Klein's mother, Diana Klein, said on Sunday that he might have died from hypothermia, but tests were incomplete.
        Mr. Klein, who was No. 48 in the world's match-race ranking, fell overboard from the 38-foot sailboat he was skippering, Twin Flyer. He fell into the bay with seven other crewmen when a rack, designed to hold the crewmen on a pipe framework outside the boat, broke. He was in the chilly bay water for at least eight minutes until crewmen from another race boat picked him up, said Cheryl Schirillo, a spokeswoman for the St. Francis Yacht Club in San Francisco.
        He was the leading contender to represent the United States in the Olympic Soling Class, and was the 1993 Soling World Match Racing champion. Mr. Klein was also Rolex yachtsman of the year in 1989.
        Mr. Klein is survived by his parents, Charles and Diana Klein, of Del Mar, Calif.; a 20-month-old son, Alexander; and a brother, Richard, of Dallas.
