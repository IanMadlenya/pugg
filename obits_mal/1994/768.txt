        James M. Slattery, founder of the Slattery group of construction companies, which built many New York landmarks, died on Wednesday at his Manhattan home. He was 98.
        Founded in 1927 as the Slattery Contracting Company, the business expanded over the years into an umbrella group over many companies that were involved in heavy construction projects in the New York Metropolitan area.
        Slattery Contracting and its affiliated companies became a major force in the building of roads, subways, bridges and tunnels. They also were involved in the building of the United Nations headquarters, the New York Coliseum, the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Seagram Building and the World Trade Center. Mr. Slattery retired in 1968.
        Born and reared in Manhattan, Mr. Slattery served in the Navy during World War I and after his discharge returned home to enter the building trades as an operating engineer running steam shovels and other heavy equipment.
        He was a benefactor of many Roman Catholic organizations, including Iona College and St. Vincent's Hospital.
        Mr. Slattery is survived by a daughter, Gloria Confort of Manhasset, L.I., and a grandson, Robert Trent of Manhattan.
