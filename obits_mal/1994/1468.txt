        B. Glenn MacNary, a retired president and director of the Continental Baking Company, died on Sunday at Barnstable County Hospital in Bourne, Mass. A former resident of Manhasset and Rye, N.Y., Mr. MacNary was 81 and lived in North Falmouth, Mass.
        He died after a brief illness, said the Chapman Cole & Gleason Funeral Home in Falmouth, Mass.
        Mr. MacNary spent nearly 40 years with the company when it still was based in Rye. He was born in Springfield, Mass., and attended Middlebury College.
        He started at Continental Baking, the maker of Wonder Bread and Twinkies, in 1929 as a route salesman, delivering bread in the New York area with a horse-drawn wagon.
        He was named a vice president in 1954 and a director in 1956, and he became executive vice president two years later. He became president in early 1967 and retired the next year, when he moved to North Falmouth.
        Mr. MacNary became an enthusiastic sailor in the late 1930's and regularly won trophies in regattas on Long Island Sound. He skippered his boats, of various classes, out of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club in Port Washington, L.I.
        He continued to win many competitions through the 1960's, when he sailed his yacht Westray in the Northport-to-Bermuda race. After he retired, he raced off New England and sailed to the Orkney Islands and the fjords of Norway.
        On Cape Cod, he was involved in environmental issues and was active in the Association for the Preservation of Cape Cod. His main concerns were clean water on and around the cape.
        Mr. MacNary is survived by his son, Donald R., of North Falmouth, and three grandchildren. His wife, Hazel Reno MacNary, died in 1991.
