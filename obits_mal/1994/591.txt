        Ashley A. Boone Jr., a motion-picture marketing and distribution executive associated with hits like "Star Wars," "The Empire Strikes Back" and the James Bond movies, died on Sunday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 55.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Boone also contributed to marketing campaigns for "West Side Story" and "Chariots of Fire." At his death, he was a marketing consultant for MGM/UA.
        Mr. Boone, a native of Springfield, Mass., and a graduate of Brandeis University, entered the film industry in 1964 as the director of foreign advertising, publicity and promotion for United Artists. Over the years, he became the first black to hold top marketing positions at United Artists, 20th Century Fox, the Ladd Company, Columbia Pictures, Lorimar Pictures and MGM.
        In 1979, as the president for distribution and marketing at 20th Century Fox, he was the highest-ranking black executive in the industry. It was a period of turmoil in the studio's executive suites, and he left at the end of that year to establish his own company, ABJ Enterprises.
        Among other films he helped to promote and market were "The Omen," "Julia," "The Turning Point," "Alien," "The Right Stuff," "Ghostbusters," "A Soldier's Story" and "Thelma and Louise."
        He and his sister Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the senior vice president for publicity at Paramount Pictures, were the first brother and sister ever to serve as governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the same time.
        In addition to Mrs. Isaacs, of Los Angeles, Mr. Boone is survived by his companion, Mark Bua; his father, Ashley Sr.; his stepmother, Doris Boone, and another sister, Velma B. Fahrer, all of Los Angeles, and a brother, Richard T. Boone of Chicopee, Mass.
