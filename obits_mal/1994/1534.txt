        Kevin Kelly, the theater critic for The Boston Globe for 32 years, died on Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 64 and lived in Norwell, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, The Globe said.
        For many years Mr. Kelly was a force in Boston theater, a role he shared with Elliot Norton, who reviewed for The Boston Herald. In 1991, Mr. Kelly received the George Jean Nathan Award for Dramatic Criticism. He also wrote "One Singular Sensation" (Doubleday, 1990), a biography of the director Michael Bennett.
        Mr. Kelly was born and educated in Boston. After receiving his master's degree from Boston University, he joined The Globe as an assistant to its theater critic, Cyrus Durgin. When Durgin died in 1962, Mr. Kelly became the newspaper's chief theater critic, a post he held until his death. He also wrote book reviews and commentary on other performing arts. His last review, of a revival of "Hello, Dolly!" starring Carol Channing, appeared in The Globe on Nov. 11.
        He is survived by his companion, C. M. Wirth, and a brother, Paul, of Manchester, N.H.
