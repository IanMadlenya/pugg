        Sidney E. Kamino, a leader in the discount retail industry, died on Monday at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida. He was 73 and lived in Delray Beach, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Eric.
        Mr. Kamino was born in Utica, N.Y. After serving in the Army from 1942 to 1946, he moved to Boston, where he began his career in discount retailing.
        In 1956, he returned to Utica and opened his first discount store, which later became Family Bargain Center. He expanded to smaller markets throughout the Northeast and at his peak owned 49 stores. In 1968, Family Bargain Centers sold stock to the public as the Kenton Corporation. Mr. Kamino served as chief executive of Kenton until selling his interest to the Rapid-American Corporation in 1972.
        He was active in civic affairs and Jewish philanthropy in Syracuse. He was a co-chairman of the United Jewish Appeal and vice president of the Jewish Home of Central New York.
        In addition to his son, of Fayetville, N.Y., he is survived by his second wife, Alma; his mother, Jenny, of Utica; a daughter, Diane Yochelson of Bethesda, Md.; a sister, Betty Kowalsky of Utica, and two granddaughters. His first wife, Lillian, died in 1988.
