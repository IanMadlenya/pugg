        Norman J. (Skip) Garrett, a press officer for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation for the last 23 years, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer of the salivary glands, his office said.
        A native of Haskins, Ohio, Mr. Garett graduated from Bowling Green University. He was a public relations officer in the Army and held other positions in promotion and public relations in the private sector before he joined the Parks Department in 1971.
        He is survived by two brothers, Garold of Worthington, Ohio, and William of Bowling Green, Ohio; a half-brother, Richard Garrett of Fostoria, Ohio, and a half-sister, Dorothy Elser of Bowling Green.
