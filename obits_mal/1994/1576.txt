        Dr. Solomon Gaon, a world leader of Sephardic Jews and University Professor of Sephardic Studies at Yeshiva University, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Dr. Herbert Dobrinsky, a Yeshiva vice president and longtime associate.
        At his death, Dr. Gaon was chief rabbi of congregations affiliated with the World Sephardi Federation. He had been a professor at the Yeshiva since 1976 and also founded and directed its Jacob E. Safra Institute of Sephardic Studies. Sephardic Jews trace their ancestry to Spain and Portugal before the expulsion of 1492.
        An international spokesman for Sephardic Jews, he was a world-renowned scholar on their history and interpretation of Jewish law. He served as president of the Union of Sephardic Congregations of the United States and Canada and, from 1949 to 1982, as chief rabbi of Sephardic Congregations of the British Commonwealth.
        He was born in Travnik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and studied at the Yeshiva of Sarajevo. Both his parents died in the Holocaust.
        He moved to England in 1934 and received a Ph.D. at the University of London five years later. He received a minister's degree in 1944 and rabbinic ordination in 1948 from Jews' College in London.
        He first became associated with Yeshiva University in New York when he was invited to establish a variety of Sephardic academic programs and community activities. He wrote and edited many scholarly articles, books, commentaries and translations, including a commentary on the Book of Prayer of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews.
        Dr. Gaon is survived by his wife of 50 years, Regina Hassan Gaon; a son, Isaac, of Toronto; a daughter, Raquel Goldstein of London, and four grandchildren.
