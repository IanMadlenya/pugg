        Garrett Scott, an independent filmmaker, died in Coronado, Calif., on March 2, two days before his documentary ''Occupation: Dreamland'' received an Independent Spirit Award at a ceremony in Santa Monica. He was 37.
        Mr. Scott died while swimming in a municipal pool where he had played water polo as a teenager. The cause was a heart attack, said Rachel Rakes, his companion.
        His death was announced at the awards ceremony on Saturday by his partner and co-director, Ian Olds, who accepted the award for both of them.
        The Independent Spirit Awards are given by Film Independent, an organization of filmmakers not associated with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
        ''Operation: Dreamland'' was honored with the organization's Truer Than Fiction Award for its account of the weeks in 2004 that Mr. Scott and Mr. Olds spent embedded with the 82nd Airborne Division of the United States Army. They were allowed to shadow eight members of the unit deployed in the Iraqi town of Falluja.
        The two men had collaborated earlier to film ''Cul de Sac: A Suburban War Story'' (2002), which was featured at the New York Underground Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival. Mr. Scott's first professional venture into film, it recorded an actual incident involving a police chase of a stolen Army tank.
        Garrett Scott was born into a military family in Munich and grew up in Coronado. He graduated with a major in English from the University of California, Santa Barbara; received a master's degree in English literature at the University of Wisconsin; and was planning a career in academia before pursuing one as a filmmaker.
        Besides his companion, Ms. Rakes of Brooklyn, Mr. Scott is survived by his mother, Lynne Scott of Coronado; his father, Terry, and stepmother, B. D. Deck Scott of San Diego; a brother, Gavin, of Arcata, Calif.; and a sister, Morgan Scott of San Diego.
