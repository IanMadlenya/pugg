        Lumumba Carson, a hip-hop artist known as Professor X and a former member of the black nationalist rap collective X-Clan, died on Friday in Brooklyn. He was 49.
        His death was confirmed by Interfaith Medical Center.
        Though X-Clan never enjoyed the commercial success of its politically minded peer Public Enemy, the group's two albums, ''To the East, Blackwards'' (1990) and ''Xodus'' (1992), earned them a loyal cult following.
        Professor X was the group's resident sage. He was known to deliver signature lines like: ''Vainglorious! This is protected by the red, the black and the green with a key, sissy!,'' on several X-Clan tracks.
        ''If you were a real X-Clan fan you could recite that phrase by heart,'' said Erik Parker, music editor at Vibe magazine. ''He had such a distinct and immediately recognizable voice, this raspy lisp that would just ring in your ears.''
        Mr. Carson and his group mates wore African medallions and were often dressed in clothing with the black nationalist colors, red, black and green.
        Professor X, son of the prominent Brooklyn black nationalist activist Sonny Carson, who died in 2002, released his first solo album in 1991. Called ''Years of the 9: On the Blackhand Side,'' it featured songs with black-empowerment political messages. His 1993 follow-up, ''Puss 'N Boots (The Struggle Continues),'' which included the tracks ''Close the Crackhouse'' and ''Shalom,'' was even more aggressively political.
        Professor X's activism was not confined to his lyrics. Following in his father's footsteps, he was a founding member of Blackwatch, a grass-roots political organization made up of Black Muslims. As hip-hop music grew more gangster in tone, however, Professor X's music was increasingly marginalized.
        His survivors include two sons.
