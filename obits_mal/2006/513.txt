        Kevin Terpstra, a partner in the trend-setting Greenwich Village home design store Mxyplyzyk, died last Wednesday at his home in New Milford, Conn. He was 48.
        The cause was liver failure, said Kevin Brynan, his business partner.
        Over the last 14 years, Mxyplyzyk has become a shopping destination for clean-lined, moderately priced contemporary furniture and home accessories, always modern in style, but not extreme. Mr. Terpstra, who did some of the buying for the store, became known for his whimsical window displays and store presentations, and for his peppery manner.
        Mr. Terpstra founded the shop in 1992 with two partners, Mr. Brynan and Peter Maase.
        Mr. Terpstra was born in Kalamazoo, Mich., and moved to New York in 1979 to study illustration at the Fashion Institute of Technology before embarking on his career. After six years as a salesman and then the display director at Bon Marche, a Manhattan shop that sold inexpensive apartment-size furniture and lighting, Mr. Terpstra left to work at a new store, Dot Zero, which was one of the first modern design outposts in the Flatiron district.
        After five years Dot Zero closed, and Mr. Terpstra and Mr. Brynan opened Mxyplyzyk (pronounced MIX-ee-PLIZ-ik). The store's name was inspired by that of a Superman comic book character, Mr. Mxyzptlk.
        Mr. Terpstra is survived by his wife, Valerie Allusson Terpstra, who lives in Montclair, N.J.; his mother, Sandra Haagsma, and stepfather, Herman Haagsma, both of Whitinsville, Mass.; and a brother, Kurtis Terpstra, and a sister, Heidi Terpstra, both of Kalamazoo.
