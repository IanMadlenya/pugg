        Philip Rauch, the former president of a clamp manufacturing company who helped start a family foundation that assists children in poor families on Long Island, died on Wednesday in East Setauket, N.Y. He was 95 and had homes in Old Westbury, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.
        The death was confirmed by his niece Nancy Douzinas, the president of the Rauch Foundation, which Mr. Rauch started with his brother, Louis.
        Mr. Rauch was president of the Ideal Corporation, a Brooklyn company founded in 1913 by his father that manufactured stainless steel hose clamps for automobiles and aircraft. He took over the business in 1932, when his father died. In 1971, Ideal merged with the Parker-Hannifin Corporation, a hydraulics manufacturer in Cleveland. Mr. Rauch was a board member of Parker-Hannifin from 1971 to 1987 and its chairman from 1975 to 1977.
        In 1961, the Rauch brothers started the family foundation, in Garden City, N.Y. Its primary mission is to provide counseling and educational support for at-risk families with young children. It also supports the Long Island Index, an annual report on education, government, housing and the economy. The foundation's endowment is $42 million, and it makes grants totaling about $2 million a year to more than 30 organizations.
        Mr. Rauch was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 25, 1911. He graduated from New York University in 1939. His wife, the former Louise Fairchild, died in 1987. He is survived by a daughter, Patricia McIrvin of Greensboro, N.C.; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
