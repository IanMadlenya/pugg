        Howard Rosenstone, a prominent theatrical agent who helped shepherd the work of some of the country's most distinguished playwrights and lyricists onto the stage, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
        The cause was pulmonary failure, said Phyllis Wender, his partner in Rosenstone/Wender, the New York-based agency he founded in 1981.
        Among the artists in Mr. Rosenstone's stable were the playwrights David Mamet, Wallace Shawn and Donald Margulies; the director and choreographer Graciela Daniele; and the playwright, lyricist and composer William Finn, whose musical ''The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee'' is currently on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theater.
        Mr. Rosenstone's job was twofold. He was partly a literary agent, reading drafts of his clients' scripts and suggesting improvements. Once the script was polished, he became a theatrical matchmaker, sending it to producers, directors, regional theaters or marquee actors -- anyone he felt could be counted on to stage a good production.
        His clients earned some of the theater's highest honors, including the Pulitzer Prize (Mr. Mamet for ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' in 1984 and Mr. Margulies for ''Dinner With Friends'' in 2000) and the Tony Award (Mr. Finn, twice, for the book and score of ''Falsettos'' in 1992).
        Howard Rosenstone was born on Aug. 20, 1937, in Paterson, N.J., and reared in Suffern, N.Y. After attending Syracuse University and the University of Grenoble in France, he began his career in the mailroom of the William Morris agency. Mr. Rosenstone eventually became an agent there, and left in 1979 to start an agency of his own. He formed his partnership with Ms. Wender two years later.
        Mr. Rosenstone is survived by his companion, John O'Connor, and a sister, Elaine Auerbach, of Roxbury, N.Y.
