        Philip Ressner, a retired book editor and the author of half a dozen successful children's books, died on Dec. 27 at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ressner worked as a subway motorman before he broke into editing. In 1965 he published the first of his books for very young readers, ''August Explains'' (Harper & Row), the tale of a wise old bear who is very good at magic.
        Writing as Phil Ressner, he followed that up with ''Dudley Pippin'' (Harper, 1965), about a boy's exploration of city delights. Other titles were ''At Night'' (Dutton, 1967), ''Jerome'' (Parent's Magazine Press, 1967), ''The Park in the City'' (Dutton, 1971) and ''Dudley Pippin's Summer'' (Harper, 1979). He also wrote short stories.
        Philip Ressner was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 29, 1922, and attended Brooklyn College and the University of Wyoming before serving with the Army in Europe in World War II. He worked as a motorman for the New York City Transit Authority for four years while studying at New York University, from which he graduated in 1956.
        He joined the staff of Harper & Row Publishers in 1959 as an assistant editor, and later worked at Harcourt Brace and at Scientific American.
        Mr. Ressner is survived by a son, Simon, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Alice Joan Ressner of Brooklyn and Anabel R. Ressner of Beacon, N.Y.; a brother, Bernard J. Ressner of Edison, N.J.; and two granddaughters.
        When he left Scientific American in the mid-1980's, Mr. Ressner revisited his early railroading days by joining the Metro-North staff of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as writer-editor of Mileposts, a monthly newsletter for Metro-North commuters. He retired again in 1997.
