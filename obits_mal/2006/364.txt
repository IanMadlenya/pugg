        Spencer B. Witty, the last of four brothers whose company, Witty Brothers, fashioned and sold elegant men's clothing through a small, prestigious chain of stores in New York, died May 29 at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.
        The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said his grandson Eric Gould.
        In 1939 Mr. Witty -- along with his brothers Frederic, Ephraim and Arthur, and a cousin, Irving -- took over a company founded by their grandfather David Witty in 1888. It started as one shop on Eldridge Street in Lower Manhattan. By the time it was taken over by the Eagle Clothes company in 1962, there were six stores, one in Brooklyn and five in Manhattan, including two on Fifth Avenue.
        ''They used luxurious fabrics, cashmere, Scottish tweeds,'' said Mr. Witty's daughter, Jane Gould, ''and this was coming out of the Great Depression.'' An article in The New York Times about the ''Witty boys'' in 1952 said it was their insistence on retaining the high quality of their forebears that kept the company afloat through the Depression.
        Spencer Bernard Witty was born March 23, 1914, in Waccabuc, N.Y. He did not attend college. Like his brothers, he moved into the family business when he each reached the age of 21. Mr. Witty's first wife, Henrietta Silberstein Witty, died in 1991. Besides his grandson Eric, of Madison, N.J., he is survived by his second wife, Cecile Rosenberg Witty; his daughter, Jane, of Warren, N.J.; and another grandson, Lance Gould, of Manhattan.
        In 1967, five years after Witty Brothers was taken over by Eagle Clothes, Mr. Witty became a member of the board and vice chairman of the Merchants Bank of New York. In 1975 he became chairman of the bank, serving in that post until 2001, when it was acquired by Valley National Bank.
