        Dr. Richard Bellucci, a New York ear surgeon who invented an early instrument for microsurgery that is still in use, died on Dec. 22 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 91 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The death was announced by his family.
        Dr. Bellucci was a researcher, inventor and a former chairman of otolaryngology at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital and New York Medical College. He was an early practitioner and teacher of microscopic inner-ear surgery. He devised the Bellucci Micro Ear Scissors, a long, thin pair of scissors with tiny cutters, for use in such surgery.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from New York University in 1936 and received his M.D. from Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha in 1942. He trained in otolaryngology at Grassland Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., and Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, where he joined the staff in 1946.
        He was named department chairman in 1963 and retired in 1979 as surgeon director emeritus. At New York Medical College he served as a professor and chairman from 1966 until 1980.
        He was an attending physician and consultant at many other hospitals, a past president of the American Otological Society, the author of many articles on ear surgery, and author or co-author of three textbooks.
        Dr. Bellucci is survived by his wife of 55 years, Dr. Eleanor De Paoli Bellucci; their daughter, Dr. Eleanor B. Handler of Bayside, Me.; and a grandson.
