        Ronald Mansbridge, a publisher who, in the late 1940's, established the first American branch of Cambridge University Press, died last Friday at his home in Weston, Conn. He was 100.
        His family confirmed the death.
        Mr. Mansbridge began his association with the press in the early 1930's, when he joined the New York office of Macmillan, which was then an agent for Cambridge University Press in the United States. In 1949, he established the press's American branch, which he supervised until his retirement in 1970.
        During his tenure, the press expanded its paperback publishing program and published the New English Bible, a modern translation issued jointly with Oxford University Press starting in the 1960's.
        Mr. Mansbridge was later acting director of the M.I.T. Press and managing director of the London office of Yale University Press.
        Frederick Ronald Mansbridge was born in Sanderstead, England, on Nov. 11, 1905. He received a bachelor's degree in English from Cambridge in 1928 and a master's in English there in 1931. In the late 1920's, he taught briefly in the English department of Barnard College in New York.
        Mr. Mansbridge's first wife, the former Georgia St. Clair Mullan, whom he married in 1931, died in 1988. His second wife, the former Janet Dunning Van Duyn, whom he married in 1990, died in 2003. He is survived by two children from his first marriage, Jane Mansbridge of Cambridge, Mass., and Bruce Mansbridge of Austin, Tex.; two stepdaughters, Barbara Van Duyn of Weston and Ruth Pratt of Fairhope, Ala.; and two grandchildren.
