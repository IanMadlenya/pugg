        Charles H. G. Rees, a former president of the Whitney Communications Corporation, which once owned a third of The International Herald Tribune, as well as numerous magazines, small newspapers and cable television stations, died last Wednesday in Westerly, R.I. Mr. Rees, who lived in Stonington, Conn., was 84.
        The cause was complications of abdominal surgery, said his daughter Camilla Rees, of San Francisco.
        For more than 30 years, until his retirement in 1985, Mr. Rees was associated with various businesses started by John Hay Whitney, a financier and the last publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, which went out of business in 1966.
        In 1981, Mr. Rees was named head of Whitney Communications. By the time he retired, the company owned more than a dozen magazines, including Parade, Interior Design, Art in America, The Hockey News and Corporate Design, as well as trade publications like Oil Daily, Coal Industry News and Boating Industry.
        Besides its stake in The International Herald Tribune, it also owned 40 community newspapers in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia; cable television systems in Maine and New Hampshire; and 10 percent of Cablecom, a cable television group with 350,000 subscribers.
        In 1991, The International Herald Tribune was sold to The New York Times and The Washington Post; it is now solely owned by The Times.
        Charles Henry Gallagher Rees was born on March 6, 1922, a son of Albert and Helen Gallagher Rees of Lawrenceville, N.J. His father was a banker. His graduation from Princeton, officially with the class of 1945, was delayed until 1948 because of his service in World War II.
        Besides his daughter Camilla, Mr. Rees is survived by his wife of 51 years, Nancy Thomas Rees, of Stonington, Conn.; three other daughters, Nancy Wall and Liberty Rees, both of Manhattan, and Hilleary Coleman, of Bedford, N.Y.; a brother, Albert, of Lawrenceville, N.J., and five grandchildren.
