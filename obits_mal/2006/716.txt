        Stanley Rothenberg, a lawyer who was an expert in copyright and entertainment law and a past president of the Copyright Society of the U.S.A., died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 76.
        The cause was complications after surgery for a popliteal aneurism, a weakened blood vessel in the leg, said his companion, Dr. Carol Schneebaum. He lived in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
        Mr. Rothenberg, who wrote books and articles and taught at Fordham and other law schools, was president of the Copyright Society from 1980 to 1992. He was chairman of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York from 1977 to 1980.
        Since 1979, he had been a partner with Moses & Singer, a law firm in Manhattan, where he specialized in copyright and entertainment law cases, including ones that involved ''Rocky and Bullwinkle,'' ''Cats'' and ''Amos 'n Andy.''
        Among Mr. Rothenberg's books were ''Legal Protection of Literature, Art & Music'' (1960, reissued in 1988) and ''Copyright and Public Performance of Music'' (1954, reissued in 1987).
        Mr. Rothenberg was born in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn on June 8, 1930. After graduating from New York University, he earned a law degree at Harvard and then a doctorate in law from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands.
        Mr. Rothenberg is survived by his sons David, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., Michael, of Brooklyn, and Seth, of Passaic, N.J.; his brother, Dr. Allan Rothenberg, of Atlantic Beach, N.Y.; his stepdaughters Katherine Schneebaum, of Red Bank, N.J., and Jessica Hunsinger, of Charlotte, N.C.; and nine grandchildren.
