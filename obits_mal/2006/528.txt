        William Edman Massee, one of the first American wine writers in the post-World War II era, died on Aug. 5 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 87.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his son, John.
        Mr. Massee was a prolific writer, and much of his work in the 1950's, 60's and 70's coincided with the beginning of America's postwar preoccupation with good living. His books championed American wines at a time when connoisseurs dismissed them as inconsequential. They included ''Massee's Wine Handbook,'' ''Massee's Wine Almanac'' and ''Joyous Anarchy: The Search for Great American Wines.''
        He wrote articles on food and wine for many magazines, including Harper's Bazaar and Esquire, where he was an editor for a time. For several years, he taught a wine course at the City University of New York and wrote a weekly article on wine for The Daily News.
        Early in his career, Mr. Massee's writing skills came to the attention of the wine expert and importer Alexis Lichine, who was planning his own wine book. Mr. Lichine knew wines but was not a professional writer. He hired Mr. Massee, and their collaboration produced ''The Wines of France'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1951), one of the first significant wine books in English in the postwar period.
        The book went through several revisions but without Mr. Massee's help. The two men had a falling out over the extent of Mr. Massee's contribution and parted ways.
        Many of Mr. Massee's books were illustrated by his wife, Dorothy Ivens, an artist who was also a co-author with him of a book on Italian food called ''Pasta Pronto!'' She died in 1991. Mr. Massee was born in Hackensack, N.J., and had lived in New Mexico since the mid-80's.
        Besides his son, a sculptor who lives in Santa Fe, Mr. Massee leaves a daughter by a previous marriage and a granddaughter.
