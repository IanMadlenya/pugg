        Eathon G. Hall Jr., an innovative curator in New York and New Jersey who became devoted to providing art and curatorial training to high school students in Newark, died on Feb. 18 while on vacation in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. He was 40.
        His partner, Tim Merrell, said that Mr. Hall died after being struck by a car.
        He was most recently the program director at Aljira, a center for contemporary art in Newark. At the center, he developed a Young Curators Program, which provided intensive training for juniors and seniors in three Newark public high schools, culminating in a critically well-received student-organized exhibition.
        Mr. Hall was born in Georgiana, Ala., and studied art history at New York University, beginning his career as an educator at the Studio Museum in Harlem in 1994. Three years later he became assistant director of education at the Newark Museum.
        He was curator of educational and public programs at the Bronx Museum of the Arts from 1999 to 2003. There he created artist residency programs that included nontraditional collaborations among artists, Bronx residents and community organizations, as well as a club series with live performances, poetry readings and multimedia installations.
        In addition to Mr. Merrell, of Brooklyn, Mr. Hall is survived by his mother, Mary Ann Pritchett of Newark, N.Y.; a sister, Jackie Thomas; two brothers, James Yon and Anthony Hall; and a grandmother, Mary T. Coleman.
