        Christopher Glenn, a longtime CBS News correspondent whose soothing, authoritative baritone voice became familiar to millions as he read the news to adults, explained it to children and often reported it himself, died on Tuesday in Norwalk, Conn. He was 68.
        The cause was liver cancer, CBS said.
        For 35 years of his 45-year broadcasting career, Mr. Glenn worked in many positions for CBS News on radio and television. One was narrator of ''In the News,'' a long-running television news program geared to children and youths. At the end of his career, he was successively the anchor for the radio newscasts ''The World Tonight'' and ''CBS World News Roundup.''
        He reported on events ranging from political conventions to the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. His many awards included an Emmy for ''In the News,'' which ran 13 seasons between Saturday morning cartoons.
        On Monday, failing health prevented him from attending a meeting of the Radio and Television News Directors Association, at which he was given in absentia the Edward R. Murrow award for the best newscast of 2005. He won the same award the year before.
        He was scheduled to be inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago on Nov. 4. He will now be inducted posthumously.
        Joseph Christopher Glenn was born in Queens on March 23, 1938, and graduated from the University of Colorado in 1959 with a degree in English. He served in the Army in the 1960's as a broadcaster in Korea and New York.
        After a succession of broadcasting jobs, he joined CBS in 1971 as a producer. He was promoted to reporter the next year and to correspondent in 1976.
        Mr. Glenn is survived by his wife, the former Dianne West; his daughters, Rebecca Glenn of Los Angeles and Lindsey Glenn of Dennisport, Mass.; and his sister, Patricia Rooney.
