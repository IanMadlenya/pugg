        Stephen Papich, a former Hollywood choreographer and stage producer and a biographer of Josephine Baker, died on Dec. 16 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, his companion, Robert Wood, said.
        As a contract choreographer at 20th Century Fox in the waning days of the studio system, Mr. Papich worked on many costume dramas of the 1950's. Among them were ''Desir√©e'' (1954), ''The Egyptian'' (1954), ''The Silver Chalice'' (1954), ''Demetrius and the Gladiators'' (1954) and ''The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing'' (1955).
        In later years, Mr. Papich was a producer and director at the Hollywood Bowl, and also produced nightclub acts for performers like Baker, Judy Garland, Dorothy Dandridge and Mae West.
        Mr. Papich published an account of Baker's life, ''Remembering Josephine'' (Bobbs-Merrill), in 1976. Reviewing the biography in The New York Times Book Review, Ishmael Reed called it ''a memorable, entertaining and moving book.''Stephen Joseph Papich was born on May 22, 1925, in St. David, Ill. He served in the Navy during World War II, and after the war studied dance at the Katherine Dunham School in New York. He later produced ''Bamboche!,'' a dance revue directed and choreographed by Ms. Dunham, which opened on Broadway in 1962.
        Mr. Wood, his partner of 33 years, is Mr. Papich's only immediate survivor.
