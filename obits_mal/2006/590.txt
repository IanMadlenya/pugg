        Robert Mitchell, a scenic designer for shows on and off Broadway as well as for dance and music performances, died on Aug. 18 in Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause was complications of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, a rare disease of the blood vessels, said his partner, Patrick Horrigan.
        Mr. Mitchell's work spanned the cultural spectrum from Emerson, Lake & Palmer concerts to Greek tragedies. On Broadway he designed the scenery for Minos Volanakis's 1973 production of ''Medea'' starring Irene Papas and, four years later, for the musical ''Beatlemania.'' Other Broadway shows that he designed included the 1977 production of ''The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel'' with Al Pacino, and Mr. Volanakis's ''Oedipus Rex'' at Lincoln Center in 1984.
        Off Broadway, Mr. Mitchell was drawn to avant-garde and classical productions. In 1971 he designed the English-language premiere of Jean Genet's ''Screens'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, an immense production that lasted more than five hours. In 1982, at Mr. Volanakis's urging, the National Theater of Greece asked Mr. Mitchell to design a production of ''Oedipus Tyrannos,'' in the ancient theater at Epidaurus. He was the first American to design a play there.
        In addition to his theater work Mr. Mitchell was active in designing for dance, working with the Pennsylvania Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal.
        Robert Deatrick Mitchell was born on April 14, 1929, in Passaic, N.J. After graduating from Yale, he worked as an assistant to the stage designer Boris Aronson and to Jo Mielziner, whom he helped design the interior of the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. Mr. Mitchell later collaborated on the design of the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on 42nd Street, now the Hilton Theater.
        In addition to Mr. Horrigan, his partner of 45 years, survivors include his brother Fred, of Lovell, Me.
