        Harold Levitt, known as Bunny, who in 1935 sank 499 consecutive free throws in a basketball contest and traveled with the Harlem Globetrotters demonstrating his shooting prowess, died on Sunday in Ocala, Fla. He was 96.
        His death was announced by his wife, Edith.
        Levitt, who stood 5 feet 4 inches, made the 499 shots at an event sponsored by The Chicago Sun-Times on April 6, 1935.
        ''I missed on my 500th shot,'' Levitt said in an interview in the spring 2005 issue of Ocala Life Magazine. ''I must have choked.''
        Levitt's skill at the free-throw line was commemorated on a Quaker Oats trading card issued in 1954. The card, in the ''Quaker Sports Oddities by Jimmy Evans'' series, was listed on an eBay auction on Wednesday night with a starting bid price of $75.
        Levitt was born in Chicago and got the nickname Bunny from his mother because he was ''small and quick, like a rabbit,'' he told Ocala Life.
        Recruited by Abe Saperstein, general manager of the all-black Globetrotters, Levitt, who was white, traveled with the team, showcasing his free-throw skills between quarters, as well as competing against those who dared to go head to head with him. The prize for outshooting Levitt was $1,000; the Globetrotters never had to pay a dime.
        After his tour with the Globetrotters, Levitt became a salesman with Converse and also presided over basketball clinics sponsored by Converse.
        Levitt moved to Ocala from New Jersey in 1976. He served in the Army Air Corps during World War II, part of the time as a physical fitness instructor on Long Island, where he met his wife.
        At the conclusion of the war, Levitt went back to Converse.
        During his retirement, Levitt did volunteer work with youth basketball.
        Levitt is survived by his wife; his daughter, Ellen Levitt; and a sister, Josie Lustig.
