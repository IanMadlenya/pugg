        Barry Cowsill, a member of the popular 1960's and early 70's singing family the Cowsills, was identified Tuesday as among the dead nearly four months after he disappeared when Hurricane Katrina flooded this city. He was 51.
        Mr. Cowsill's body, recovered Dec. 28 from the Chartres Street Wharf, was identified with dental records, said Dr. Louis Cataldie, head of the state hurricane morgue in Carville. The cause of death has not been determined.
        Mr. Cowsill, who lived on and off in New Orleans, had not been heard from since he left phone messages for his sister on Sept. 1, his family's Web site said.
        The Cowsills, the inspiration for the television series ''The Partridge Family,'' recorded a series of top hits between 1967 and 1970, including ''The Rain, the Park and Other Things'' and ''Hair.'' They also appeared in commercials and print ads for the American Dairy Association.
        Four Cowsill brothers played in the band: Barry on bass, Bill on guitar, Bob on guitar and organ, and John on drums. Their mother, Barbara, and sister, Susan, eventually joined the group.
        The Cowsills got their start in Newport, R.I., where by 1965 they had a regular gig at a club. They were spotted by a producer for NBC's ''Today'' show who booked them for an appearance that led to a record deal.
        The band broke up in the 1970's, amid acrimony that left some members estranged for several years.
        Barbara Cowsill died in 1985.
        In addition to his siblings, Mr. Cowsill is survived by two daughters and a son.
