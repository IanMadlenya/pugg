        Luis Barragan, 34, president and chief operating officer of 1-800-Mattress, a company founded by his father, died yesterday in a swimming accident while on vacation in Salisbury, Conn.
        According to state police reports, Mr. Barragan had been swimming in a lake called South Pond, northwest of Salisbury, when he developed cramps. The police said that his wife, Leslie, and others brought him to shore and performed CPR. He was taken to Sharon Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the police said.
        Mr. Barragan was responsible for day-to-day operations at the company, which is based in Long Island City, Queens, and has annual sales of $170 million. Founded in 1976 by his father, Napoleon, an Ecuadorean immigrant, the company sells a variety of mattress brands and bedding accessories over the telephone, the Internet and in 104 stores in the Northeast and California.
        At the company, Mr. Barragan expanded mattress distribution from the telephone and brought it into the Internet age.
        ''He was able to see the growth of the Internet as a credible retailing channel,'' his father, the company's chief executive, said.
        He also oversaw the development of distribution centers in Chicago and California to provide for quicker customer deliveries.
        After Hurricane Katrina, Luis Barragan quickly shipped 3,000 air mattresses to the affected region.
        A native of Queens and a resident of Douglaston, Queens, Mr. Barragan graduated from St. Francis Prep in Fresh Meadow. He attended St. John's University, studying business, and joined the company in 1992, starting as a purchasing agent.
        He was named director of operations in 1996 and become president and chief operating officer in 2002. Mr. Barragan was also vice chairman of the Better Business Bureau for Metropolitan New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Leslie; three children; two sisters and a brother; and his parents, Napoleon and Kay.
