        Leon Daniel, who covered a parade of major news events of the last half-century as an editor and correspondent for United Press International, died on March 19 in Glen Ellyn, Ill., where he moved last summer. He was 74.
        The cause was complications after angioplasty, said his daughter, the Rev. Dr. Lillian Fant Daniel. He retired from U.P.I. in 1993 as chief correspondent, after 36 years there.
        A native of Etowah, Tenn., Mr. Daniel fought with the Marines in Korea and left the University of Tennessee to join United Press in 1956. He was in the Dominican Republic in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent in 4,000 troops during a rebellion there, and he reported extensively on the civil rights movement. Later, he covered the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars.
        One of the few reporters to remain in Saigon after it fell to the Communists, he was asked after he was eventually expelled why he had stayed so long. ''I had to,'' he said. ''The A.P. correspondent was there.''
        Besides his daughter, Mr. Daniel is survived by his companion, Judith Paterson, and two grandchildren.
