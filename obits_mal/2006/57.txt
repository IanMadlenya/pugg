        Richard W. Couper, a prominent foundation executive who was the first full-time president of the New York Public Library, died on Wednesday at a hospital in New Hartford, N.Y. He was 83 and lived in Clinton, N.Y.
        He died after a long illness, according to a spokesman for his alma mater, Hamilton College.
        At his death a president emeritus of the library, Mr. Couper was its president and chief executive from 1971 to 1981. He was also a president emeritus of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, an educational philanthropy based in Princeton, N.J.
        Under Mr. Couper's stewardship, the library computerized its card catalog of more than 30 million entries; balanced its budget for the first time since 1924; and increased the number of private donors to 40,000 from 3,000. It also erected a building in Harlem to house the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
        Mr. Couper was succeeded as the library's president by Vartan Gregorian, who held the post until 1989.
        Richard Watrous Couper was born on Dec. 16, 1922, in Binghamton, N.Y., the son of Edgar Williams Couper and the former Esther Watrous. He enrolled at Hamilton, becoming part of the sixth generation of his family to attend the school, and interrupted his studies for service in the Army.
        Mr. Couper received a bachelor's degree from Hamilton in 1947 and a master's in American history from Harvard the next year. From 1948 to 1962, he worked as an insurance executive.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Couper was an official at Hamilton, serving as provost, vice president and acting president. From 1969 to 1971, he was deputy commissioner for higher education in the New York State Education Department. He was president of the Wilson Foundation from 1981 to 1990.
        Mr. Couper is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Pogue, whom he married in 1946; a sister, Katharine Couper Watrous, of Binghamton, N.Y.; three children, Frederick, of West Hartford, Conn.; Thomas, of Los Angeles; and Margaret C.
