        O. Milton Gossett, a New York advertising executive who played a large role in the globalization of the industry in the 1980's, died on March 1 in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in South Salem, N.Y.
        The cause was a stroke, his daughter, Lorraine said.
        Mr. Gossett was chairman and chief executive of Compton Communications in 1982 when he engineered its sale to Saatchi & Saatchi, then a six-year-old British advertising concern. The deal between the venerable, some would say stodgy, New York company and the much smaller upstart instantly made Saatchi the largest foreign-owned agency in the United States.
        Mr. Gossett became chairman of the new company, Saatchi & Saatchi Compton Worldwide, holding the position until his retirement in 1986.
        He had spent his entire career at Compton, a company founded in 1908 and known for its blue-chip clients like International Business Machines, Johnson & Johnson and United States Steel. Starting as a copywriter, he became the agency's president in 1968, its chief executive in 1975 and its chairman two years later. As chief, he oversaw the growth of the company overseas, extending its operations to 31 countries.
        He was elected to the American Advertising Federation's Hall of Fame in 1998. He was also one of the first recipients of the federation's diversity achievement awards, given for a program he developed after his retirement to introduce minority students to the advertising industry.
        Oscar Milton Gossett was born in Manhattan; he never used his first name. He was in the Navy during World War II, serving in the Pacific.
        He is survived by his wife, Anna, of South Salem, N.Y.; two daughters, Susanne Dowdall of Wellesley, Mass., and Lorraine Loomis of Chicago; two sons, Michael and Thomas, both of South Salem; and 11 grandchildren. A son, James, died in 1985.
