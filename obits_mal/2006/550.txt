        Marvin Barrett, an educator and authority on broadcast journalism whose best-known books describe his struggles with serious illness, and how those struggles became occasions for spiritual discovery, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Mary Ellin.
        From 1968 to 1984, Mr. Barrett was a senior lecturer at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. He was for many years the director of the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards for broadcast journalism, which the school administers.
        Mr. Barrett wrote several books on broadcasting, including ''Rich News, Poor News'' (Crowell, 1978) and ''The Eye of the Storm'' (Lippincott & Crowell, 1980, with Zachary Sklar).
        He also wrote two highly personal memoirs. His first, ''Spare Days'' (Arbor House, 1988), chronicles his experience with life-threatening illness. When he was in his early 60's and already living with heart disease, he found he had cancer. He did two restorative things immediately: he went to Baskin-Robbins for ice cream, and he began a journal, which became the core of his book.
        Mr. Barrett's later memoir, ''Second Chance: A Life After Death'' (Parabola Books, 1999), had its roots in another journal, which he began after a near-death experience in which his heart stopped briefly.
        Marvin Galbraith Barrett was born in Des Moines on May 6, 1920. His father, Edwin, taught communications at Drake University there. The elder Mr. Barrett was also a radio actor, and Marvin and his brother Dirk often appeared with him on a local radio program for children.
        In 1942, Marvin Barrett received a bachelor's degree from Harvard, where he studied English literature. He returned to school more than three decades later, earning a master's in English from Drake in 1976.
        From 1942 to 1946, Mr. Barrett served with the Navy in the South Pacific. He married Mary Ellin Berlin, a daughter of the songwriter Irving Berlin, in 1952.
        Mr. Barrett was a contributing editor for Time magazine from 1948 to 1952 and for Newsweek from 1955 to 1959. He was briefly executive editor of Show Business Illustrated, then was managing editor of Show magazine from 1961 to 1964. He was also a longtime contributing editor for Parabola, a magazine of myth, spirituality and tradition.
        Among Mr. Barrett's other works are a novel, ''The End of the Party'' (Putnam, 1976), and several books he edited, including ''The Politics of Broadcasting'' (Crowell, 1973), ''Moments of Truth?'' (Crowell, 1975) and ''Broadcast Journalism, 1979-1981'' (Everest House, 1982).
        Besides his wife, Mr. Barrett is survived by their four children, Elizabeth Matson of Cooperstown, N.Y.; Irving, of Newport, R.I.; Mary Ellin Barrett Lerner of Washington; and Katherine Swett of Manhattan; his brother Dirk, of Raleigh, N.C.; and six grandchildren.
