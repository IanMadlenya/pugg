        Charles O. Henry, a former chief of the New York City housing police who commanded some of the city's toughest precincts in troubled times, died at his home in Las Vegas on Feb. 1. He was 78.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Henry joined the New York Police Department in 1951. In his 31-year career, he was often in command of precincts with high crime levels, and he worked to improve relations with people in those communities. He was among the first black officers to rise to high rank.
        As a lieutenant in 1966 he was assigned to the 75th Precinct, which covers East New York, Brooklyn. He also served during the Ocean Hill-Brownsville riots in 1968, and in 1977, after being promoted to inspector, was appointed commanding officer of the 103rd Precinct. At the time it had one of the highest crime levels in the city.
        In 1979, in initial efforts to unify the city's three police departments (the third was the transit police), Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed Mr. Henry chief of the housing police. He remained there until his retirement three years later.
        Charles Oscar Henry was born in New York City in 1927. He attended night school at Brooklyn College while he worked with the Police Department, earning a bachelor's degree in 1968. He moved to Las Vegas in 1994.
        Mr. Henry is survived by a son, Laurence, a retired New York City police detective, of Spring Valley, N.Y.; two daughters, Andrea, of Queens, and Melanie Turner of Norwalk, Conn.; and four grandchildren.
