        Rudolf de Crignis, a New York abstract painter, died last Saturday in Manhattan. He was 58.
        The cause was an inoperable brain tumor, diagnosed in November, said his partner, Michael Paoletta.
        Mr. de Crignis was born in Winterthur, Switzerland, and studied at the Form + Farbe School for Art and Media Design in Zurich and the Academy of Fine Arts in Hamburg, Germany. He began his artistic career as a performance and video artist, and as such exhibited at the Venice Biennale in 1976 in a group exhibition in the Swiss Pavilion called ''The Environment.''
        But his interests began to shift to painting during a visit to New York in the late 1970s or early '80s, when he saw ''To the People of New York,'' a series of Minimalist abstract paintings by the German painter Blinky Palermo in the collection of the Dia Center for the Arts.
        Mr. de Crignis began making seemingly monochrome paintings, often in radiant blues or subtle grays. Built up from numerous thin layers of different colors, they had a luminous depth that was compared more than once to the light installations of James Turrell. Writing in The New York Times in 2004, Ken Johnson called Mr. de Crignis's work ''at once formally severe and materially luxurious'' and noted its ability to ''bridge the gap between the perceptual and the transcendental.''
        Mr. de Crignis had his first solo show of paintings at Galerie Palette in Zurich in 1980 and his first New York show at the Pamela Auchincloss Gallery in 1995. He had subsequent exhibitions at the Stark Gallery in 1997 and the Peter Blum Gallery in 2001 and 2004.
        Mr. de Crignis had an early marriage that ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Paoletta, he is survived by his half-sister, Elsie Chiuso of Kempten, Switzerland.
        Mr. de Crignis's work is in numerous public collections, including the Yale University Art Gallery, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Fogg Art Museum and the Kunsthaus ZÃ¼rich.
