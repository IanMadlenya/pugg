        Robert Earl Jones, a stage and screen actor and the father of the actor James Earl Jones, died on Sept. 7 in Englewood, N.J. He was 96 and a longtime resident of Manhattan.
        Mr. Jones died of natural causes, according to Dale Olson, a spokesman for the family.
        The senior Mr. Jones made his Broadway debut in 1945 in ''The Hasty Heart.'' Among his other Broadway credits are ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' (1949); ''All God's Chillun Got Wings'' (1975); ''Mule Bone'' (1991); and the role of Creon in ''The Gospel at Colonus,'' a musical adaptation of the Oedipus cycle, in 1988.
        Mr. Jones's best-known film role was as Luther Coleman, the confidence man who is Robert Redford's mentor in ''The Sting'' (1973). His other films include ''Cockfighter'' (1974), ''The Cotton Club'' (1984) and ''Witness'' (1985).
        Robert Earl Jones was born on Feb. 3, 1910, in Senatobia, Miss. As a young man, he married Ruth Connolly, but they separated before James Earl was born in 1931. The couple later divorced, and the elder Mr. Jones did not come to know his son until the mid-1950's.
        In the 1930's, Robert Earl Jones worked as a prizefighter under the name Battling Bill Stovall and became a sparring partner of Joe Louis. Moving to New York, he took a job with the Works Progress Administration and later found his way into acting.
        Blacklisted for his political associations during the 1950's, the elder Mr. Jones worked as a floor finisher and studied at the American Theater Wing in New York. He appeared with his son in several Off Broadway productions, including ''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl'' (1962).
        Mr. Jones's second marriage, to Jumelle P. Jones, ended in divorce. In addition to his son James, of Manhattan, he is survived by another son, Matthew Earl Jones, of Chandler, Ariz., and a grandchild.
