        William F. Quinn, the first elected governor of Hawaii, died on Monday in Honolulu. He was 87.
        The death was confirmed by Russell Pang, a spokesman for the current governor, Linda Lingle.
        A proponent of land reform and development, Mr. Quinn was elected on July 28, 1959, after Congress voted to admit Hawaii as the 50th state. A Republican, he was appointed territorial governor in 1957 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        As governor, Mr. Quinn pushed to develop islands beyond overcrowded Oahu.
        William Francis Quinn was born on July 13, 1919, in Rochester to Charles and Elizabeth Quinn. He graduated from St. Louis University in 1940 and went to the Harvard Law School.
        He interrupted his studies to serve as a naval intelligence officer in Hawaii and then returned to Harvard and graduated cum laude from the law school.
        In World War II, Mr. Quinn married Nancy Ellen Witbeck. She and their seven children survive him.
        In 1947, Mr. Quinn returned to Hawaii to work in a law office in Honolulu.
        After gaining notice in civic activities, he entered politics and served on the Hawaiian Statehood Commission, from which Eisenhower appointed him territorial governor.
        After statehood, Mr. Quinn ran for governor and defeated John A. Burns, who was the territory's delegate to Congress. In 1962, Mr. Burns unseated Mr. Quinn.
        From 1965 to 1972, Mr. Quinn was the president of the Dole Company, one of the biggest companies in the state.
