        Ken Keuffel, the head football coach for 21 years at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey and for 6 years at Wabash College and one of the last exponents of the single-wing offense, died Sunday at the University Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 82 and lived in Lawrenceville, outside Princeton.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his son, Ken Jr., said.
        In the 1940's, when Keuffel played at Princeton University for Coach Charlie Caldwell, almost every team used the single wing. The backfield consisted of a quarterback who was essentially a blocker, a tailback who took most of the snaps and ran or passed, a fullback and a wingback. The center would snap the ball to the tailback or the fullback.
        The formation combined power and deception. It was last used in the National Football League by Coach Jock Sutherland of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1947. It has all but disappeared from colleges and survives in only a few high schools. Keuffel regretted that, telling The New York Times in 1973:
        ''For us, it presents many advantages. One of the big ones is that rival teams find it difficult to prepare for us. They aren't familiar with the single wing.''
        That was not Keuffel's fault. His books ''Simplified Single Wing Football,'' published in 1964, and ''Winning Single Wing Football'' (2004) are definitive textbooks for the formation.
        Kenneth William Keuffel (pronounced KOY-fell), a native of Montclair, N.J., started his college career in 1943 as a Princeton fullback, then left for service in the Army Air Forces. He returned to Princeton as a kicker and single-wing quarterback.
        As a freshman, his 29-yard field goal with a minute remaining gave Princeton a 17-14 victory against Pennsylvania, the nation's third-ranked team. There was a near riot when Princeton fans among the 72,000 spectators tried to knock down the goal posts. Despite the efforts of Philadelphia's mounted police, they succeeded.
        In 1948, after he earned a bachelor's degree in English, Keuffel tried to become a kicker for the Philadelphia Eagles of the N.F.L. but was cut in training camp. In 1951, he earned a doctorate in English literature from Pennsylvania.
        He became a freshman coach at Pennsylvania (1953), an assistant at Lawrenceville (1954-55), and the head coach at Lawrenceville (1956-60), Wabash (1961-66) and Lawrenceville again (1967-82). His career records were 159-89-8 at Lawrenceville and 28-20-5 at Wabash.
        He is survived by his wife, Betsy; a son, Ken Jr., of Winston-Salem, N.C.; two daughters: Elizabeth Ann Keuffel of Nashua, N.H., and Catherine Almond of Portsmouth, N.H.; and four grandchildren.
        Lawrenceville, a private school, opened in 1810 with 10 students. It had more than 600 when Keuffel was coaching, and he proudly pointed out that half of that number were playing varsity, junior varsity or club football.
