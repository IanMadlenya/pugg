        James L. Wattenbarger, a former University of Florida education professor often called the father of the state's community college system, died Monday while visiting friends in the Atlanta area. He was 84 and lived in Gainesville.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Wattenbarger's doctoral dissertation at the University of Florida outlined a master plan that the state used in 1955 to create the modern community college system. Under his guidance, enrollment at community colleges in Florida increased to more than 75,000 in 1967 from fewer than 3,000 just a decade earlier.
        Dr. Wattenbarger was born in Cleveland, Tenn., a child of the Depression, and was a 1941 graduate of Florida's first community college: Palm Beach Junior College, now named Palm Beach Community College. He was inspired to expand the community college system in large part because he was a personal beneficiary of it, said his son Frank.
        After serving for several years in consulting, Dr. Wattenbarger returned to the University of Florida in 1968 and helped to establish the Institute of Higher Education, created to discover ways for colleges and universities to operate more efficiently.
        He stayed active at the University of Florida until his retirement in 1992.
        In addition to Frank Wattenbarger, his survivors include his wife, Marion, and two other sons, Carl, of Gainesville, and Bob, of Springville, Va.
