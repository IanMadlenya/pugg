        Charles E. Brady Jr., a former space shuttle astronaut and amateur radio enthusiast, died July 23 at his home in Oak Harbor, Wash., the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has reported. He was 54.
        A cause of death was not given, but an obituary published on the Web site of the American Radio Relay League said Dr. Brady, a former flight surgeon and captain in the Navy, had died after a lengthy illness.
        Selected by NASA as an astronaut in 1992, he flew aboard the shuttle Columbia in 1996 on a 16-day science mission. During that flight, he was one of the first operators of the Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment, or Sarex, which allowed astronauts to talk with ham radio operators around the world.
        Dr. Brady sustained his interest in amateur radio long after his astronaut career, later taking radio equipment with him on scientific research visits to the South Pacific and broadcasting from some infrequently visited islands there.
        While with NASA, he held a number of jobs with the agency's astronaut office and was chief of space station astronaut training before leaving to return to Navy duty.
        Born in Pinehurst, N.C., he attended the University of North Carolina before graduating from medical school at Duke University in 1975. After graduation, he became a sports medicine specialist and served as a team physician at several universities before joining the Navy in 1986 and becoming a flight surgeon. His assignments as a medical officer included duty aboard the aircraft carrier Ranger and serving as flight surgeon for the Blue Angels flight demonstration team from 1988 through 1990.
        In 1998, he had an asteroid named in his honor, now officially known as Minor Planet (7691) Brady.
        Dr. Brady is survived by his fianc√©e and their 4-year-old son, Charlie; and a sister, Jerry Ann Kennedy of Burlington, N.C.
