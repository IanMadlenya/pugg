        Peter Hamilton, a dancer who performed with Charles Weidman and in Broadway musicals, died on Jan. 31. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said Don Liberto, his companion of 62 years and only immediate survivor.
        Born in Trenton, N.J., Mr. Hamilton discovered dance in his 20's when he got a job cleaning at the Perry-Mansfield Performing Arts Camp in Steamboat Springs, Colo. He studied acting and dancing there and came into contact with Weidman and Doris Humphrey, leading modernists of the time, with whom he performed as a lead dancer from 1941 to 1945. He danced with Weidman until 1960.
        His career in the commercial theater included appearances as a soloist at Radio City Music Hall, at the Rainbow Room and on Broadway in shows including ''Sing Out Sweet Land!,'' for which he won a Donaldson Award as a promising young performer.
