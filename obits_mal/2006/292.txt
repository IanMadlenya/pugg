        Boris Koytchou, a colorful contract bridge player who represented France and later the United States in major international competitions, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 86 and had lived in New York for more than 50 years.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Koytchou's family fled Russia shortly after he was born in 1919, settling first in Constantinople and then moving to Paris. He learned about bridge by watching his father play.
        He joined the French army and was captured after the Germans invaded France in 1940. He spent the rest of the war in a German prison camp. He said later that he played poker and many other games there, but no bridge. Thanks to a small inheritance, he began playing bridge full time when he returned to Paris after the war and was soon recognized as an expert. He represented France in the European Championship in 1948, 1949 and 1950.
        In 1951 he moved to Manhattan, bringing letters of introduction to the Cavendish Club and the Regency Whist Club. He played rubber bridge at the Regency, but did not adjust to the different style of play and lost money. He also felt lonely in New York, so after a few months he returned to Paris. But to avoid having his visa expire, Mr. Koytchou came back to New York in 1953. This time he did much better and stayed for good.
        Teaching and playing rubber bridge filled most of his time, but he also competed in tournaments.
        He played for the United States in the 1957 Bermuda Bowl and the 1982 World Pair Olympiad. He won three national team titles, the Spingold Master Knockout Teams in 1956 and 1960, and the Chicago Trophy (now the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams) in 1963.
        Mr. Koytchou found duplicate events tiring and retired from serious competition many years ago. He was happiest playing rubber bridge at the Regency, which he did five days a week.
        He is survived by Louise Bookstaver, his companion of 34 years.
