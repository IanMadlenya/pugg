        David Levy, a leader of the reform wing of the New York Democratic Party who ran unsuccessfully in 1962 against the party's Bronx boss, Representative Charles A. Buckley, died on Wednesday at his home in Pompton Lakes, N.J. He was 79.
        The cause was a stroke, his son Paul said.
        Mr. Levy, a New York State Supreme Court justice in the Bronx when he retired in 1996, was a 35-year-old lawyer when he ran against Mr. Buckley in the 1962 Congressional primary. Mr. Buckley was elected to Congress in 1934, representing a stretch of the borough along the Hudson and Harlem Rivers, and had been the Bronx county leader since 1953.
        In the early 1960's, reformers struggled to loosen the grip on the state party held by entrenched bosses like the Manhattan Tammany Hall leader Carmine G. De Sapio and Mr. Buckley. In his race, Mr. Levy received endorsements from Eleanor Roosevelt, former Gov. Hebert H. Lehman and Mayor Robert F. Wagner. But President John F. Kennedy, who had received strong support from the Bronx Democratic organization two years earlier, backed Mr. Buckley. Mr. Levy lost by 2,940 votes out of about 37,400 cast. (Mr. Buckley was defeated in a re-election bid in 1964.)
        Remaining active in reform politics, Mr. Levy was elected to the New York City Civil Court in the Bronx in 1974 and the State Supreme Court there in 1981.
        Born in the Norwood section of the Bronx on April 22, 1927, Mr. Levy was the son of Jack and Lillian Raff Levy. His father was a traveling salesman for an electronics company. Mr. Levy served in the Navy during World War II. He graduated from New York University in 1948 and from Columbia Law School in 1951.
        Mr. Levy's wife of 50 years, Diana Hochstein Levy, died in 2003. Besides his son Paul, of Ardsley, N.Y., he is survived by two other sons, Robert, of Branford, Conn., and Bruce, of Morris Plains, N.J., and six grandchildren.
