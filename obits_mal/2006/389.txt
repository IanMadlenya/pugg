        Ingo Preminger, a Hollywood agent and producer who represented several blacklisted screenwriters the anti-Communist fervor of the postwar years, died on Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 95.
        Mr. Preminger's family announced the death.
        A brother of the producer and director Otto Preminger, Ingo Preminger was also known for producing the movie ''M*A*S*H,'' released in 1970.
        As an agent, Ingo Preminger represented two members of the Hollywood 10, Ring Lardner Jr. and Dalton Trumbo, as well as other blacklisted writers. During the worst years of the blacklist, they wrote scripts under pseudonyms or were uncredited.
        Ingo Preminger was born on Feb. 25, 1911, in Czernowitz, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, later in Romania and today in Ukraine. Reared in Vienna, he earned a law degree from the University of Vienna, fleeing the country with his family in 1938. He settled first in New York and in 1947 moved to Los Angeles, where he joined the Nat Goldstone Agency. He opened his own agency the next year.
        Mr. Preminger is survived by his wife, the former Katharina Musil, known as Kate, whom he married in 1936; a son, Jim, a literary agent, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Eve, the former Manhattan Surrogate Court judge, and Kathy Kauff, a retired lawyer, both of New York City; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. Otto Preminger died in 1986.
