        Gabor Peterdi, a painter and printmaker who worked in New York during the heyday of Abstract Expressionism but who chose to retain ties to nature in his work, died on Aug. 13 at a hospice in Stamford, Conn. He was 85.
        Born in Budapest, the child of poets, Mr. Peterdi won a Prix de Rome to study painting at age 15. After a year in Italy, he studied engraving in Paris with the American-born printmaker William Stanley Hayter. In 1939 he immigrated to New York, then served in the Army in Europe during World War II. After the war he worked again with Hayter, who had moved to New York. He went on to teach at the Brooklyn Museum School of Art, and later at Hunter College (1952-60) and at the Yale School of Art (1960-87).
        Mr. Peterdi was represented for 25 years, beginning in 1950, by the Grace Borgenicht Gallery in Manhattan. His work is in many museum collections internationally. Particularly admired for his prints, he wrote a long essay on printmaking for the 15th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, published in 1975, and a book, ''Printmaking: Methods Old and New,'' still a standard text.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan Niquette Peterdi, of Stamford, Conn.; a stepson, Andrew Major of New York; and two daughters, Mary Peterdi Simon of New York and Martha Gwyn Peterdi of Woodbury, Conn.
