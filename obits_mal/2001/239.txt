        Phil Berger, a sportswriter, author and screenwriter, died on Monday at his home in Jackson Heights, Queens. He was 58.
        The cause of death was colon cancer, said Veronica Vera, his companion.
        Mr. Berger, who was a boxing reporter for The New York Times from 1986 to 1992, wrote more than a dozen books. Most explored his twin passions -- basketball (''Knight Fall: The True Story Behind America's Most Controversial Coach,'' 2000; ''Forever Showtime: The Checkered Life of Pistol Pete Maravich,'' 1999; ''Miracle on 33rd Street: The New York Knickerbockers' Championship Season,'' 1970) and boxing (''Blood Season: Mike Tyson and the World of Boxing, 1996; ''Punch Lines: Berger on Boxing,'' 1993). He wrote the screenplay for a feature film last year about boxing, ''Price of Glory,'' which starred Jimmy Smits.
        He also wrote about comedy (''The Last Laugh: The World of Stand-Up Comics,'' 1975) and death in 1930's Hollywood (''Deadly Kisses,'' a 1984 paperback mystery).
        He was at work until shortly before his death on ''Total Boxing,'' a book with Bert Sugar that is scheduled for publication this fall.
        Born in Brooklyn and raised in Stamford, Conn., he graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1964 and received a master's degree in creative writing from Hollins College in 1965. He began his career as a summer reporter for The Greenwich (Conn.) Time, then became an associate editor at Sport magazine. He joined The Times in 1986 after several years as a freelance writer.
        In addition to Ms. Vera, he is survived by his mother, Fanny Berger of Delray Beach, Fla.; his daughter, Julia Berger, from his marriage to Leslie Berger of New York; and his  sister, Cynthia Darling, of Laurel, Md.
