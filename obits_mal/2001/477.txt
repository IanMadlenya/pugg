        Francis Ruivivar, a musical performer whose Broadway credits included ''Miss Saigon'' and Stephen Sondheim's ''Passion,'' died on Wednesday in Las Vegas. He was 40.
        The cause was leukemia, said a publicity agent for ''Miss Saigon.''
        In 1991 Mr. Ruivivar stepped into the role of the Engineer for two weeks while the show's star, Jonathan Pryce, was on vacation. When Mr. Pryce left the show, Mr. Ruivivar won the part -- the first Asian-American to play the Engineer -- and starred through March 1993.
        Born in Hong Kong, he was of Chinese-Filipino descent. His Broadway debut was in ''Chess'' in 1988. He was also in ''Starlight Express'' and ''Shogun: The Musical.''
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine.
