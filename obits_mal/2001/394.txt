        Michael S. Modell, a co-president of the Modell's Sporting Goods chain and a philanthropist, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from Hodgkin's disease, said his brother, Mitchell, the other co-president of the company for some years and now its president.
        Michael and Mitchell Modell became the fourth generation in their family to preside over Modell's, which was established in 1889 by their great-grandfather Morris A. Modell. The chain now has 88 stores and 3,800 employees.
        Their father, William, is the company's chairman.
        After Michael Modell learned at age 13 that he had Crohn's disease, a digestive disorder, his parents founded what is known today as the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America.
        Michael Modell, who became vice president, raised millions of dollars for the foundation's work. He was also the founder and chairman of Sports for a Cure, which works for bone-marrow transplantation to treat cancer.
        Michael Steven Modell was born on March 11, 1953, in Brooklyn and grew up there and on Long Island. He began working in his family's stores while he was in high school. After earning a bachelor's degree from American University in Washington and a law degree from St. John's University School of Law in Queens, he became an executive of Modell's Sporting Goods.
        In addition to his parents, William D. and Shelby, of Hewlett Harbor, N.Y., and his brother, Mitchell, of Cliffside Park, N.J., he is survived by his wife, the former Abby Marcia Grossman, whom he married in 1981; two sons, Alex and Andrew; a daughter, Ashley; and a sister, Leslie, all of Manhattan.
