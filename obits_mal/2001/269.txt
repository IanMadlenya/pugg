        Edward John Fee, who worked his way up from a clerk's job to overseeing the building of New York landmarks like Peter Cooper Village and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, died Monday at his home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 92.
        Born in Queens, Mr. Fee took night courses in engineering at Queens College. But instead of graduating, he started a 50-year career at what is now the Starrett Corporation.
        His first job, as a plan clerk, was to make sure that building plans were in order. By 1929, he was a junior field supervisor at the building site of 40 Wall Street. He was there when the Empire State Building appeared on the Midtown skyline and had a hand in the Parkchester complex in the Bronx, meanwhile rising to vice president for operations at Starrett Brothers & Eken.
        As superintendent of construction, he was the hard hat in chief at big  projects like Stuyvesant Town, Starrett City in Brooklyn, the Atlantic Bank building on Wall Street and parts of the Metropolitan Life complex. He also oversaw the rise of the Gateway Center in Pittsburgh, an early urban renewal project, and Camp Blanding in Florida, built during World War II.
        For many years he was active as a representative of the construction industry in its dealings with the building trades unions. He retired from Starrett in 1977 but at his death remained a consultant on the industry's labor policies and practices.
        Mr. Fee is survived by two daughters, Joan F. Kelly of Bedford, N.Y., and Ellen M. Fee of Elmhurst, Queens; two sons, Edward, of Arlington, Va., and Robert, of Orangeburg, N.Y., who is president and chief executive of the Manhattan-based Turner Construction Company; seven grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. His wife, Rose Anne McNaboe Fee, died in 1983.
