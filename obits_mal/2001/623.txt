        Ernst Baier, a German figure-skating star of the 1930's, died on July 8 at a hospital in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a winter resort in southern Germany. He was 95 and lived in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, the site of the 1936 Winter Olympics.
        By the time Baier turned professional in 1941, he and his skating partner, his wife, Maxi Herber, had won the Winter Olympic pairs championship in 1936, four world championships, five European championships and seven German championships. He also competed as a singles skater, and he won more than 50 medals, including a silver medal in singles in the 1936 Games.
        Baier, who was born in Zittau, Germany, toured the United States with Herber in the winter of 1935, and they married in October 1940. After his figure-skating career ended, he founded the Berlin Ice Revue in 1951 and owned it for a dozen years.
        When the couple won the Olympic gold medal in 1936, The Associated Press reported that Baier and Herber ''were especially good in brilliant pirouettes, spirals and dance combinations.'' After Baier's death, the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung recalled: ''In comparison with today'' his and Herber's ''program contained hardly any jumps. Instead, everything revolved around the search for complete harmony in the dance and in the turns and pirouettes.''
        Baier once described his journey through life as ''loving, learning and teaching.'' His marriage to Herber, the first of his three wives, ended in divorce after they had two sons and a daughter. They remained in touch and she survives him.
