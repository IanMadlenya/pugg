        Ralf D. Bode, a cinematographer who contributed indelible images to films like ''Rocky,'' ''Saturday Night Fever'' and ''Coal Miner's Daughter,'' died last Tuesday at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 59.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Christine.
        Among the more memorable sequences for which he was responsible in a career that included more than 40 films were the scenes of Sylvester Stallone running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art as the movie's theme music played in ''Rocky'' (1976) and the heated dance floor scenes in ''Saturday Night Fever'' (1977).
        Born in Germany, Mr. Bode moved to the United States at 14. He graduated from the University of Vermont, served in a pictorial unit of the United States Army and after his discharge, moved to New York City. A brief career as an actor led him to enroll in the graduate program of the Yale Drama School.
        Mr. Bode contributed the Philadelphia sequences to ''Rocky,'' directed by John G. Avildsen, and was director of photography for ''Saturday Night Fever'' for the director John Badham. He made three films with the director Jonathan Kaplan, including ''The Accused,'' for which  Jodie Foster won an Oscar for best actress, and five with Michael Apted,  among them ''Coal Miner's Daughter,'' for which Sissy Spacek won a best actress Oscar and Mr. Bode an Oscar nomination.
        Mr. Bode also directed concert films, documentaries, commercials and videos. His work for television included ''Gypsy,'' starring Bette Midler; ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' with Jessica Lange; and last year's film of ''Annie,'' for which he was nominated for an Emmy.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Paul and Max, and  a brother, Peer. He was a member of the American Society of Cinematographers. Last year he began teaching cinematography at the Los Angeles Film School, where an annual student award for cinematographer has been named in his honor.
