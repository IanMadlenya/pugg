        Bob Williams, who had been a New York Post television columnist for 21 years, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. He was 86 and lived in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his ex-wife, Beatrice Williams-Rude.
        Robert Colburn Williams was born in Syracuse, graduated from high school there, became a journalist at 17 and had his first journalism jobs in Syracuse and Albany.
        He joined The Post in 1946 as a reporter. He was a Post television columnist from 1957 to 1978, and for most of that time was its only television columnist. He resigned from The Post in 1978 and became public information officer for the borough of the Bronx. He retired from that position in 1991.
        His marriage ended in divorce.
        His survivors include a son, Mark, of Alexandria, Va., and a granddaughter.
