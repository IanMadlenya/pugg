        Edwin Shapiro, a former president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, an American Jewish refugee agency, and a leader in other Jewish organizations, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        Mr. Shapiro died of cancer, his family said.
        As president of the society from 1979 to 1984, Mr. Shapiro helped direct efforts to provide services for Jews leaving the Soviet Union and resettling in Israel, the United States and elsewhere. He was a member of the American delegation to the 1979 meeting in Geneva to address the Indochinese refugee crisis.
        Mr. Shapiro was also chairman of the B'nai B'rith Hillel commission and chairman of the executive committee of the New York Association of New Americans.
        He is survived by his wife, Dena; two sons, Steven, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Len, of Woodstock, N.Y.; a brother, Milton, of Lakewood, N.J.; and a sister, Lillian Kushell of Brooklyn. He is also survived by his stepchildren, Alan and Renee Zellner of Memphis. A previous marriage, to Claire Zucker, ended in divorce.
