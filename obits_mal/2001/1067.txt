        Judge Theodore J. Labrecque Jr., who presided over many highly publicized criminal trials in New Jersey, died on Dec. 23 at a hospital in Long Branch, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, the family said.
        A Superior Court judge for 14 years, Judge Labrecque had just retired on Dec. 4, his 70th birthday, as required by law. He had been the presiding judge of the criminal part of the court in Monmouth County.
        His most recent high-profile case was the murder trial last summer of Ambrose Harris, a death row inmate who stomped and beat to death another death row prisoner, Robert Simon, in the state prison at Trenton in 1999. Mr. Harris, who said he had acted in self-defense, was acquitted.
        Judge Labrecque also presided over the trials of Philip H. Reardon, who killed a 79-year-old woman he had kidnapped from a supermarket parking lot; Jamie Pandure, who, with the help of his brother and brother-in-law, killed his wife for her life insurance; and Suzanne Price, who stabbed her newborn son to death with a pair of scissors.
        Judge Labrecque, whose father was also a Superior Court judge, was born in Long Branch in 1931. His family was established in Monmouth County legal circles.
        He graduated from Villanova University in 1953, spent four years in the Navy and then went to law school at Fordham University. He was president of the county bar association and had just been elected president of the state bar association when he was appointed to the bench in 1987 by Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
        Judge Labrecque is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Oceanport, N.J., and Theodore J. III of Fair Haven, N.J.; a daughter, Nancee M. of Matawan, N.J.; three grandchildren; four sisters; and two brothers.
