        Ken Weston, who with Scott Millan and Bob Beemer won an Academy Award last month for best sound production on ''Gladiator,'' died on April 13 at his home in Wimbledon, in southwest London. He was 53.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Weston, who was highly regarded as a sound technician, began his film career in the 1970's as a boom operator, working on films like Alan Parker's ''Midnight Express'' and Stanley Kubrick's ''Shining.'' His early work with sound mixing included ''Krull'' and ''Another Country.''
        In the 1990's he received an Oscar nomination for mixing for ''Evita,'' with Madonna in the title role. He also worked on the sound for ''Amadeus'' and ''Angela's Ashes.''
        His Oscar-winning work on ''Gladiator'' involved the painstaking recording of everything from the sounds of battle and the roars of arena spectators to whispered conversations. He was too ill to accept the award in person.
        He is survived by his wife, Janice Warnes; a son and daughter from his first marriage; two stepsons and a stepdaughter.
