        Charles W. Mathews, the program manager of NASA's Project Gemini in the 1960's, died on Sept. 10 in a hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He was 80 and lived in Gainesville.
        The cause was kidney failure, said the Forest Meadows Funeral Home in Gainesville.
        Mr. Mathews, an aeronautical engineer, became Gemini's manager in 1963. He was in charge when the first flight by astronauts in the Gemini program, the Gemini 3 mission, took place in March 1965.
        The next Gemini flight, Gemini 4 in June 1965, included the first spacewalk by an American. On later Gemini missions, the spacecraft practiced the maneuvers needed to dock and rendezvous in orbit.
        Mr. Mathews also had NASA management roles in the Apollo lunar program, which came after the Gemini program in the late 1960's.
        His last post at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was as chief of its office for applications, in Washington, which sought ways to apply space technology to uses on earth. He retired in 1976.
        A native of Duluth, Minn., Charles Wesley Mathews graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. Then he joined the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics at Langley Field in Virginia.
        The advisory committee became NASA in 1958.
        In 1947, Mr. Mathews married Marietta Short, who died in 1981.
        His survivors include his wife, Ruby Van Velzer Mathews; a son, Douglas C., of Kingston, Tenn.; a daughter, Elizabeth Allison of Orange Park, Fla.; a sister; a brother; four grandchildren; and two stepchildren.
