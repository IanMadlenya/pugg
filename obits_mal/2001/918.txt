        Spike Robinson, a lyrical jazz saxophonist who had careers in both music and engineering, died last Monday at his home in his adopted hometown of Writtle in central Essex, England. He was 71.
        His death was reported Friday in The London Daily Telegraph, which said that after settling in England in 1991 he became ''a cricket-loving honorary Englishman.''
        Mr. Robinson's sound was distinguished by a mellow tone and an easygoing, cool sensibility.
        Living in England after World War II, Mr. Robinson played with British bebop artists, developing a cult following. In 1951, he took a 30-year leave from full-time music. He returned to the United States, earned an engineering degree and worked on aerospace projects for the Honeywell Corporation and others.
        In 1981, he began to record again, starting with the album ''Spike Robinson Plays Harry Warren.'' It restarted his jazz career. He retired from engineering and made a series of well-received recordings.
        Mr. Robinson is survived by his wife, Susan May, and a son and daughter from a previous marriage.
