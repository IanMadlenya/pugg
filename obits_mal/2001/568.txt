        Dr. Maurice Victor, a neurologist, teacher and textbook author, died on  June 21 at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 81.
        The cause was metastatic prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Victor was author, with Dr. Raymond D. Adams, of ''Principles of Neurology,'' a widely used textbook on diseases of the nervous system. The book was first published by McGraw Hill in 1977, and its seventh revised edition appeared in January. It was translated into German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
        The son of immigrant parents from what is now Belarus and Lithuania, Dr. Victor was born in Canora, Saskatchewan, and was reared in Winnipeg. He graduated in 1938 from the University of Manitoba, where he received his medical degree in 1943.
        He immediately entered the Canadian army. Rising to captain in the medical corps, he was decorated for his service in Europe.
        He immigrated to the United States to train in hematology and neurology.
        Dr. Victor specialized in neurology, and in 1951 he joined the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital and began to teach in the department of neurology at Harvard Medical School. Eleven years later, he became a professor at Case Western Reserve University and the director of the neurology department at Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospital. He retired in 1986.
        Dr. Victor stayed academically active, and spent the next six years at the V.A. Hospital in White River Junction, Vt.
        After that, he volunteered as a mentor to students and young doctors at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.
        He was the author of several other books and more than 200 scientific articles, notably those on the effects of alcoholism on the nervous system and their treatment.
        Dr. Victor is survived by his wife of 44 years, Dr. Betty Banker Victor; a son, Dr. Benjamin A., of Montreal; and a brother, David I., of Winnipeg.
