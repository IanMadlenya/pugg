        Harrison Mosher Hayford, a leading expert on Herman Melville, died on Dec. 10 in Evanston, Ill. He was 85.
        A professor of English at Northwestern University for 43 years, he was general editor of the multivolume Northwestern-Newberry edition of ''The Writings of Herman Melville,'' published by Northwestern University Press. The edition is considered the first to offer readers the total body of Melville's writing in a critical text. Thirteen volumes have been published, and the final two are to be published in the next few years.
        Work on the series began in 1965, when Dr. Hayford organized a team of editors, many of whom had been his students.
        Northwestern University Press will publish Dr. Hayford's collected essays on Melville next year.
        As a sideline Dr. Hayford became an avid collector and dealer of books, selling them to libraries around the world. He once sold some 50,000 books of classic American literature to a university in Japan.
        Harrison Mosher Hayford was born on Nov. 1, 1916, in Belfast, Me., where his family had maintained the Hayford farm for more than a century. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in English from Tufts University and earned a doctorate from Yale in 1945.
        He joined Northwestern in 1942 and was on the faculty until his retirement in 1985.
        Dr. Hayford's wife, Josephine Wishart Hayford, a retired professor at Kendall College in Evanston, died in 1996.
        He is survived by four children, Charles Wishart Hayford of Evanston, Ralph Harrison Hayford of Toms River, N.J., Alison Hayford of Regina, Saskatchewan, and Deborah Weiss of Valparaiso, Ind.; and eight grandchildren.
