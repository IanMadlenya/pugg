        Robert Kraus, a children's book author and a cartoonist, illustrator and publisher, died on Aug. 7 in a nursing home in Kent, Conn. He was 76 and had lived in Manhattan in recent years.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son C. William Kraus.
        Mr. Kraus wrote, illustrated and edited more than 100 children's books from 1955 to the late 1990's.
        When Barbara Bush was first lady and mounting her literacy campaign, she read one of his most successful books, ''Leo the Late Bloomer'' (1971, HarperCollins), on television to a young audience. The book is about an underachieving young tiger who finally catches up with his young tiger contemporaries.
        About 450 of Mr. Kraus's cartoons appeared in The New Yorker magazine, and he drew 21 New Yorker covers. For some years he was president of Windmill Books, which published children's books by numerous writers.
        Born in Milwaukee, he attended the Art Students League of New York in 1945.
        Besides his son C. William, of Norwalk, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Pamela; another son, Bruce, of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.
