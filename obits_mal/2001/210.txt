        Ivan Biro, a sculptor and a founding member of 55 Mercer Gallery, an artists' cooperative in SoHo, died on Feb. 9 at a hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. He was 74.
        The cause was pneumonia after surgery, said his wife, Juliane.
        Mr. Biro was born in Paris in 1926 and grew up in Budapest. He survived imprisonment in a Nazi labor camp during World War II and in the late 1940's studied sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest.
        He immigrated to the United States in 1957, settling in New York,  where he began making abstract sculptures out of globes and spheres of highly finished polyester.
        Mr. Biro helped found 55 Mercer in 1970 and showed there for eight years. He was also a designer in the fashion and toy industries and taught at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and the Silvermine School of Art in New Canaan, Conn.
        In addition to his wife, of Lewisboro, N.Y., he is survived by a son, Matthew, of Ann Arbor, Mich.
