        Conte Candoli, a jazz trumpeter who gained national renown as a musical mainstay of the ''Tonight'' show in the Johnny Carson era, died last Friday in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 74 and lived in Bermuda Dunes, Calif.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Born Secondo Candoli in Mishawaka, Ind., he started playing professionally at 16 with the Woody Herman Orchestra during high school summer vacations. His style evoked the bebop artistry of Dizzy Gillespie.
        His career closely paralleled that of his brother Pete, another noted trumpeter. When not occupied with ''Tonight'' they often performed studio work backing up top artists like Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald.
        Conte Candoli also worked in nightclubs and on concert stages. His wife, Kristen Candoli, said he continued to play in the United States and Europe until he fell ill in October.
        Besides his wife and his brother, of Los Angeles, Mr. Candoli is survived by a daughter, Marcia, of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Marla Kapoor of Portland, Ore.; and a sister, Gloria Henke of Mishawaka.
