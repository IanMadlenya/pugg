        Edward T. Rogowsky, one of 13 members of the New York City Planning Commission, died of a heart attack Sunday night as he got into a car at Kennedy International Airport on his return from a Florida vacation.
        He was 60, and had homes in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and in Southold, on Long Island.
        In 1990, Mr. Rogowsky was appointed to the commission by the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden.
        Mr. Rogowsky was professor emeritus of political science at Brooklyn College, where he was director of the Brooklyn College Graduate Center for Worker Education. At CUNY-TV, the television station operated by the City University of New York, he was city editor and host of ''Metro View,'' a weekly public affairs program. He also coordinated university internship programs in public affairs.
        Mr. Rogowsky participated avidly in Democratic Party politics. In the presidential campaign of Bill Bradley, he worked nationally to organize gay supporters. He helped draft the city's zoning rules for sex-oriented businesses, incorporating his concern that they not infringe on the constitutional rights of homosexuals.
        Mr. Rogowsky is survived by two sons, Joshua, of New York City, and Mark, of San Francisco; one grandson; and his partner, Peter McGarry.
