        Paul E. Dietrich, an architect and founding member of the firm Cambridge Seven Associates in Cambridge, Mass., died on Saturday at a  Boston hospital. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Andrea Dietrich.
        Mr. Dietrich was born in Hammond, Ind., and attended DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind., and the University of Nebraska.
        In studies at Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's Institute of Design in Chicago and the Harvard School of Design, where he earned a master's degree in architecture, Mr. Dietrich was influenced by Bauhaus theories and became interested in civic architecture.
        He worked in Europe and in Santa Fe, N.M., before moving to Cambridge. In 1962 he was one of seven artists -- including architects, graphic designers, filmmakers and urban planners -- who founded Cambridge Seven Associates, which became known as an innovative group that worked on civic buildings and large-scale projects like aquariums, museums, universities and mass transit projects.
        Among Mr. Dietrich's designs were the New England Aquarium in Boston, the firm's first project; the United States Pavilion at Expo '67 in Montreal; the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.; the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts; and subway station guidelines for Boston and Atlanta.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; five children; four grandchildren; and a sister, Eleanor Foltz of Camden, Me.
