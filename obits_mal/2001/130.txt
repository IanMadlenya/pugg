        Leon Beer Schachter, a union organizer, negotiator and former head of the Washington office of the Amalgamated Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen, died on Jan. 25 at a nursing home near Philadelphia. He was 91.
        Born in Romania, Mr. Schachter came to the United States as a teenager and got a job in a Philadelphia poultry shop. He lost his job for leading a strike, prompting him to become an organizer for the Amalgamated, a part of the American Federation of Labor.
        The union sent him to South Jersey in 1941 to sign up the workers at Seabrook Farms, a large grower and processor of food. His successful drive was one of the earliest efforts to organize farm labor. in the United States.
        Mr. Schachter made a name for himself as a skilled bargainer and was elected to the national board of the Amalgamated Meatcutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in the late 1940's. Over the years, he helped settle many bitter labor disputes.
        From 1952 to 1954 he served as labor attach√© in the United States Embassy in Turkey. He then founded his union's Washington office and led it until 1980, when he retired.
        He helped write a 1957 bill that extended meat inspections to poultry. His Washington office also played a role in shaping legislation on issues that included the minimum wage, civil rights, Medicare and housing.
        Before retiring, he was a principal architect of the merger of his union with the Retail Clerks International Union to form the 1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial Workers Union International.
        Mr. Schachter is survived by his wife, Bernice Berkow Schachter; two daughters, Sandra Wasserstrom of Melrose Park, Pa., and Ina Bransome of Brooklyn, and three grandchildren.
