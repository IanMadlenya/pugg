        Thomas F. Irvine Jr., the founding dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on June 2 at his home in St. James, N.Y. He was 78.
        The cause of death was listed as cardiopulmonary arrest, his wife said.
        After serving for 10 years as dean, Professor Irvine stepped down in 1972 but remained at Stony Brook as a professor of mechanical engineering until his retirement.
        He was a vigorous advocate of international cooperation in his field, and held appointments at laboratories in Germany, Yugoslavia, Britain and Italy.
        Professor Irvine is survived by his wife, Sondra; a sister, Janet Farrell of Atlanta; six daughters, Laura Irvine of Miami, Kay Lynne Stark of Phoenix, Phoebe Hoff of Austin, Tex., Jill Irvine of Norman, Okla., Sadi Delaney of Bloomsbury, N.J., and Tanya Irvine of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a son, Thomas, of Ithaca, N.Y.; four stepchildren; 13 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
