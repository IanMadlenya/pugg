        Jerome Shelby, the former co-chairman of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, one of America's oldest law firms, died yesterday. He was 70.
        The cause was leukemia, according to the firm.
        A graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Shelby joined the firm in 1953 at age 23 and held the position of partner for nearly 30 years, specializing in shipping and real estate finance. In the 1970's, sometimes referred to as the heyday of American shipping, Mr. Shelby structured some of the industry's largest deals, both for the private sector and the military. He stepped down as a partner in 1992 but never fully retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Adrian, of Verona, N.J.; a son, P. Austin Shelby, of West Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Dr. Karen Shelby Anderson, of Bedford, N.H.; a brother, Stuart Shelby, of Santa Monica, Calif.; and five grandchildren.
