        Maxwell H. Tretter, executive director of the New York City Housing Authority in the mid-1940's, died on Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 95.
        Mr. Tretter, a lawyer, was counsel in charge of the authority's legal division from 1938 to 1941, assistant to its chairman from 1941 to 1944, and its general counsel as well as its executive director from 1944 to July 1947, when he resigned. The authority was begun to build low-rent housing during the Depression.
        Mr. Tretter won praise for his handling of the authority's complex finances, involving state, federal and local laws and the management of loan and subsidy funds from all three levels of government. He was adept in the floating of bond issues, and he drafted housing and financing laws that became models for other states.
        In 1967, the authority shifted its responsibility for building housing to the Housing and Development Administration, but it kept its responsibility for overseeing its many apartments.
        After leaving the authority, Mr. Tretter entered private practice, based in Manhattan, and represented nonprofit groups and developers in the newly emerging development of publicly assisted middle-income housing, particularly co-op housing for middle-income people. He retired around 1980.
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from Boys High School there. He got a bachelor's degree and a law degree from Cornell, won several honors from its law school and went on to hold various legal posts before joining the authority.
        Surviving are his wife, Beatrice, whom he married in 1929; a daughter, Flora Tretter Bortner of Scarsdale; a son, Franklin, of Manhattan and Southampton, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
