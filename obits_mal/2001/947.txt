        David W. Brumbaugh, a former Time Inc. executive who played a role in the adoption of ZIP codes, died on Saturday at a hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.
        He was 93 and lived in Glen Head, N.Y.
        Mr. Brumbaugh joined Time Inc. in 1933 and became executive vice president, treasurer and a director in 1960. An accountant, he switched in 1968 from treasurer to chairman of the finance committee at Time Inc. He retired in 1971.
        Mr. Brumbaugh played an important part in the planning and introduction of Life magazine, part of Time Inc., in 1936.
        A history of the corporation from 1960 to 1980, ''The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise'' (1986) by Curtis Prendergast with Geoffrey Colvin, says Mr. Brumbaugh ''represented Time Inc. in long tussles with the government over postal rates.'' But, it says, his presentations, to postal officials in Washington, ''of Time Inc.'s system of using zoned cities to speed magazine deliveries influenced the Post Office Department's development of ZIP codes, a fact recognized in a special merit award to the company from the department in 1965.''
        Mr. Brumbaugh had a Time Inc. nickname, Mr. Zip. He was also a former chairman of the Magazine Publishers Association.
        He was born in Roanoke, Va. He received a bachelor's degree from Roanoke College and an M.B.A. from Harvard.
        In 1934, he married Dorothy Seay, who died in 1956. He married Juanita Cooley in 1958; she died in 1999.
        Mr. Brumbaugh is survived by a daughter, Ann Brumbaugh, of Manhattan, and a son, David Jr., of Rye, N.Y.
