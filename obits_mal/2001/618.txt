        Dr. Robert F. Rushmer, a pediatrician and physiologist who used bioengineering to monitor living hearts and track fetal cardiac function, died on Friday at home at a retirement community in a Seattle suburb. He was 86.
        Dr. Rushmer was the founding director of the Center for Bioengineering at the University of Washington.
        He began his work on the Seattle campus in 1947, when there were few ways to study heart functions in animals except under anesthesia or by removing the heart. He and his team of physics and engineering students developed a battery of equipment to examine the hearts of healthy animals without inflicting pain. That allowed researchers to monitor heart functions in engineering terms.
        Dr. Rushmer applied Doppler ultrasound in imaging the pumping heart and measuring blood flow soon after the technique was introduced in Japan in the 1950's. His diagnostic devices were credited with reducing premature deaths from circulatory ailments. They were also used to monitor the fetal heart rate.
        Robert Frazer Rushmer was born into a medical family in Ogden, Utah. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1935 and received his medical degree at Rush Medical College (now Rush University) in 1939. He trained in pediatrics and aviation medicine at the Mayo Foundation and joined the Seattle campus in 1947 as an assistant professor of physiology and biophysics.
        In 1967 he founded the Center of Bioengineering, now jointly operated by the university's School of Medicine and College of Engineering. He retired in 1985 as professor emeritus of bioengineering.
        Dr. Rushmer is survived by his wife of 59 years, Estella Dix Rushmer; a son, Dr. Donald S., of Portland, Ore.; two daughters, Anne R., of Whidbey Island, Wash., and Dr. Elizabeth Harris of Edmonds, Wash.; and four grandchildren.
