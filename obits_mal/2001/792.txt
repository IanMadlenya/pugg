        William I. Spencer, who as the No. 2 executive at the holding company for what became Citibank helped propel the bank to the top of the industry, died on Sept. 9 at his home in Larchmont, N.Y. He was 84.
        He worked under Walter B. Wriston, the chairman, who cited Mr. Spencer's agility in financing loans to the oil industry, but said his contributions extended well beyond that. ''Everything we did was a partnership,'' he said Saturday.
        Mr. Spencer was president of the First National City Corporation, which evolved into Citicorp and then Citigroup, and its bank, First National City Bank, now Citibank, from 1970 to 1982.
        Mr. Spencer, a big-game hunter and ardent conservationist, made many speeches arguing that the emerging global economy required greater awareness of the world's diversity.
        ''The political boundaries of nation-states are too narrow and constricted to define the scope and sweep of modern business,'' he said in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt in 1972.
        William Ira Spencer was born in Grand Junction, Colo., on July 24, 1917. He graduated from Colorado College in 1939. His charitable involvement was broad, including leading a campaign to reorganize the New York City blood bank.
        Mr. Spencer's first wife, the former Kathryn Cope, died in 1992. He is survived by his wife, Susan Hammel-Namm; a stepson, Adam Namm of Arlington, Va.; a stepdaughter, Leslie Coplin of Larchmont; and two granddaughters.
        Correction:  September 20, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about William Spencer, former president of Citibank, omitted his permanent residence and a reference to one survivor. Mr. Spencer lived in North Palm Beach, Fla., and is survived by a grandson in addition to two granddaughters.
