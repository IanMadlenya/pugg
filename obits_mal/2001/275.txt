        Mark F. Kessenich Jr., a former Citicorp executive who helped shape the way corporate and government bonds are traded, died on Tuesday at his home in Westhampton, N.Y. He was 62.
        The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, according to the family.
        Mr. Kessenich took over Citibank's North American investment division in 1975, just as the rising national debt began to increase the popularity of bonds as a tool of corporate and government finance. To manage the boom, Mr. Kessenich helped revamp the way bond houses did business, essentially transforming them from liaisons between businesses and investors into risk-takers that underwrote many of the deals themselves.
        Under Mr. Kessenich's tenure, Citibank's bond division grew from a single New York office of 110 employees to a worldwide business with 2,200 workers, making it one of the largest on Wall Street at the time.
        In 1986, Mr. Kessenich was recruited to help revive an embattled E. F. Hutton Group, which had pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud charges in 1985. His defection was widely considered a coup for E. F. Hutton, but the firm's economic woes worsened with the stock market crash of 1987, and it ultimately merged into Sherson Lehman in 1988. Mr. Kessenich formed Eastbridge Capital Inc., a bond-trading firm in New York, that year. He served as president and chief executive until his illness forced him to retire in 1998.
        Mr. Kessenich is survived by his former wife, Diane Kessenich; three children, Barbara Kessenich Robertson of Greenville, S.C.; Mark F. Kessenich III of Westhampton, N.Y.; and Paul T. Kessenich of New York City; a sister, Joanne K. Knief, of Ocala, Fla.; and eight grandchildren.
