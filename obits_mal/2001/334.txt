        Dr. Donald McKay Shafer, a New York eye surgeon who developed innovative operating techniques to forestall blindness and trained generations of ophthalmologists, died on  April 4 in Clearwater, Fla. Formerly of Westport, Conn., he was 89 and had retired to Dunedin Isles, Fla.
        Dr. Shafer's specialty was the eye's vitreous body, the clear jellylike substance that fills the eyeball between the retina and the lens.
        In the early 1950's Dr. Shafer devised a procedure to detect indications of retinal detachments and tears, known as Shafer's sign. His treatment of vitreoretinal disease led to technological advances that allowed doctors to remove and replace the vitreous for the repair of complex retinal detachments.
        Born in Grove City, Pa., Donald Shafer graduated from Columbia College in 1932 and from Cornell University Medical College in 1936. In World War II he was an Army lieutenant colonel in command of a hospital ophthalmology unit.
        He joined the staff of Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in 1948 and the faculty of Cornell University Medical College in 1958. He served as chairman of ophthalmology at both in the 1970's and retired as surgeon director emeritus of the hospital in 1979.
        Dr. Shafer is survived by his wife of 63 years, Ann Brady Shafer; two daughters, Susan Shafer of Westport, and Nancy DeVries of Baltimore; a sister, Rosemary Villchur of Woodstock, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
