        John Ardoin, the music critic for The Dallas Morning News for more than 30 years and the author of four authoritative books on the life and work of the soprano Maria Callas, died on Sunday in San José, Costa Rica, where he lived. He was 66.
        The Dallas Morning News said the cause was complications from lymphoma.
        Mr. Ardoin was renowned for his encyclopedic knowledge not only of opera and singers, his specialty, but of conductors and orchestras as well.
        He was born in Alexandria, La., in 1935 and earned a bachelor's degree in composition and music theory from the University of Texas and a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma.
        After moving to New York in the late 1950's, Mr. Ardoin became editor of Musical America magazine and the managing editor of the program books for Philharmonic Hall (now Avery Fisher Hall). He was also a critic for The Saturday Review and the New York music correspondent for The Times of London.
        He became the music critic for The Dallas Morning News in 1966. An avid admirer of Maria Callas, he became friendly with her during the 1960's but did not allow their relationship to interfere with his critical judgment. The friendship foundered after he wrote a negative review of one of her performances in 1974.
        The break, however, did not dim Mr. Ardoin's passion for her work. His 1997 book, ''The Callas Legacy,'' is an overview of her recordings. His ''Callas at Juilliard'' (1988) focuses on her master classes in the 1970's.
        His other books include ''The Furtwängler Record'' and ''The Stages of Menotti.''
        There are no immediate survivors.
