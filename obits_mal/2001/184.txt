        Robert Weiskopf, who wrote scripts for ''I Love Lucy,'' ''Maude,'' ''All in the Family'' and several other hit television comedies, died on Tuesday in Los Angeles. He was 86.
        Mr. Weiskopf's longtime writing partner was Robert A. Schiller. The pair, who got together in 1953, won an Emmy Award in 1971 for their work on ''The Flip Wilson Show'' and another in 1978 for ''All in the Family.'' They also received the Writers Guild Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for Television in 1988 for their contributions to ''the literature of television.''
        Mr. Weiskopf, born in Chicago, started out in radio. He moved to Hollywood in 1940 and soon began writing for the Eddie Cantor and Rudy Vallee radio programs. He also wrote for Bob Hope and Fred Allen.
        When he and Mr. Schiller joined forces, they moved into the new world of television comedy. Among their early credits were Danny Thomas's ''Make Room for Daddy'' and Eve Arden's ''Our Miss Brooks.'' Their first effort for ''I Love Lucy'' was the episode titled ''Lucy Visits Grauman's.'' They went on to write for Red Skelton, Carol Burnett and Phyllis Diller. In addition to their Emmy Awards, they also won two Peabody Awards and a Golden Globe Award.
        Mr. Weiskopf is survived by his wife, Eileen; two sons, Kim and Walt, and two grandchildren.
