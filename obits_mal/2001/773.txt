        Peter Rosenthal, senior executive vice president of the Manhattan public relations firm Rubenstein Associates, died on Monday. He was 54 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Terri Thompson.
        Mr. Rosenthal joined the company in 1976 as an account executive and rose to be head of its business and financial section.
        He is survived by his wife, the director of the Knight-Bagehot journalism fellowships at Columbia University; his mother, Rita Rosenthal; a brother, Tom; and a son, Daniel, all of Manhattan; and another son, Joel, of Cambridge, Mass.
