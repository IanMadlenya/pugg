        Norman D. Forster, owner and president of Léron Inc., a luxury linen shop in Manhattan, died on Aug. 30 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        For more than 50 years, he ran the company his parents, Charles and Margaret Forster, founded in the early 1900's in Paris to sell handmade custom linens. Later they moved to Manhattan.
        By 1971, when the New York store was on Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th Streets, it had been selling fine linens for 40 years. Now it is on the corner of Madison Avenue and 65th Street.
        Norman Forster ran the business much as his parents had, but he did not resist change. ''All our original customers,'' he once said, ''went down on the Titanic.''
        When the store was founded, most of its linens were white. But in the early 1950's, Mr. Foster began selling embroidered bed linens and table linens in colors, to suit customers' décor. He also had new designs executed by artisans in Europe for a new generation of customers.
        In the mid-1960's, he started selling dresses and blouses.By 1971, he was offering more place mats, which were in increased demand because they are easy to launder.
        Born in Manhattan, he attended the Sorbonne.
        His marriages to Elizabeth Chapman in 1940 and to Helga Aichorn in 1969 ended in divorce.
        Mr. Forster is survived by his son, David, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., who runs the business now; his daughter, Priscilla Sellery of Rowayton, Conn.; his brother, Clifford, of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
