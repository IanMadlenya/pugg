        Dr. Irving Rust, a Bronx physician who was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case Rust v. Sullivan, which sought to affirm the right of doctors in federally financed institutions to mention abortion to their patients, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. He was 71.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Alexander Sanger, a former president of Planned Parenthood of New York City and a longtime colleague.
        Dr. Rust was the former medical director of the HUB-the Bronx Planned Parenthood Clinic and a longtime member of its staff.
        During the administration of President George Bush, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, then secretary of Health and Human Services, said that the government had a right to withdraw federal funds from clinics that provided abortion counseling. Dr. Rust, among many other physicians who counseled women about unplanned pregnancy, saw the issue as one of free speech.
        As director of an institution that got government funds amounting to a quarter of its total budget and that offered abortion counseling, he lent his name as chief plaintiff. When the case reached the United States Supreme Court, the plaintiffs lost in a 5-to-4 decision. However, the federal policy was reversed by President Bill Clinton on Jan 22, 1993, his second day in office. At a White House ceremony on that occasion, when Dr. Rust shook hands with the president, he said: ''Thank you, Mr. President. I'm no longer gagged.''
        He was born on June 25, 1930, and studied at New York University and the University of Louvain in Belgium. He returned to the United States and completed his residency at Lincoln and Jacobi Hospitals before working for Albert Einstein Hospital. In 1977, he joined Planned Parenthood as medical director of the South Bronx clinic, retiring in 1998.
        Dr. Rust is survived by his wife, Cora, of Larchmont; a daughter, Leslie; and three sons, Christopher, Anthony and Jonathan.
