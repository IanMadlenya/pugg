        Herman Liveright, who was dismissed in 1956 as program director for the New Orleans television station WDSU after refusing to tell a Senate panel whether he was a Communist, died on Jan. 19 in a hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex. He was 89, lived in Lenox, Mass., and spent winters in Texas.
        Mr. Liveright also declined to answer other questions put to him in 1956 by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. His view was that the First Amendment guarded him against having to reply. His 1957 conviction for contempt of Congress was overturned in 1962 by the Supreme Court.
        In 1972, Mr. Liveright and his wife, Betty, established the Berkshire Forum, an educational center near Lenox that backed workshops on political controversies for two decades.
        Surviving, in addition to his wife, are a son, Dr. Timothy, of Newtown, Pa.; a daughter, Beth Liveright of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Lucy Wilson of Newton; and two grandchildren.
