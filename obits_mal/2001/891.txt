        W. Barry McCarthy, an executive at The New York Times Company for two decades, died last Wednesday in Stamford, Conn. He was 79 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        The cause was complications from cancer, his family said.
        Mr. McCarthy joined the Times Company in 1968 as director of broadcasting and affiliated publications. In 1971 he became a group director overseeing the subsidiaries WQXR, Golf Digest and Golf World.
        In 1972, he established the company's corporate communications department. He was the department's director, also serving as spokesman for The Times, from 1972 to 1980, and went on to be the director of agency relations for Golf Digest and Tennis magazines before retiring.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Isabel Moldenhauer; two daughters, Pegeen Genader of Westport, Conn., and Melissa Meager of Fairfield, Conn.; two sons, Barry Jr. of Los Gatos, Calif., and Marc of Colorado Springs; and three grandchildren.
