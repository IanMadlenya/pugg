        The Rev. Dr. Howard Schomer, a former president of the Chicago Theological Seminary and activist on behalf of human rights and civil rights, died on June 28 in a hospital in Oakland, Calif. He was 86 and moved to Oakland in the 1980's.
        Dr. Schomer was ordained a Congregationalist minister in 1941. In 1948, while he was an aide to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, he assisted in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly.
        He received a doctoral degree in divinity in 1954 from the Chicago Theological Seminary. Later he worked with the World Council of Churches in Geneva, striving to save religious freedom in the East Bloc.
        He went on to be president of the Chicago seminary and professor of church history there from 1959 to 1966. In those years, the student body and faculty grew, and an extensive building program was carried out.
        While he headed the seminary, he also took part in integration demonstrations in Alabama, Georgia, Washington and Chicago. He traveled to Selma, Ala. to march with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
        From 1972 to 1981, after Congregationalists merged with other Protestants and formed the United Church of Christ, he worked for it as officer for social responsibility in investments.
        He was born in Chicago and graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College. During World War II, he was a conscientious objector assigned to Civilian Public Service.
        His wife, Elsie, died in 1996.
        Surviving are two daughters, Karine Schomer of El Cerrito, Calif., and Ellen Schomer of Hawaii; two sons, Mark, of Guatemala, and Paul, of Petaluma, Calif.; and three granddaughters.
