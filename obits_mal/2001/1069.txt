        Dr. Walter John Moore, a physical chemist, textbook author and biographer, died on Dec. 20 in Bloomington, Ind. He was 83.
        The cause was heart disease and kidney failure, his family said.
        His book ''Physical Chemistry'' (Prentice-Hall, 1950) remained a standard text for more than 30 years. Its fourth edition appeared in 1972 in eight languages.
        He gained a general readership with his biographies ''A Life of Erwin Schrödinger'' (1994) and ''Schrödinger: Life and Thought'' (1989), about the Austrian theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate.
        When the first biography appeared, the American Association of Publishers cited it as the year's outstanding book of its genre. ''It is an attempt to analyze a soul,'' The New York Times Book Review said in January 1990, ''and in that respect, it surpasses even 'The Double Helix' by James Watson in its examination of the most visceral drives of a great scientist.''
        Walter Moore was born in New York. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University and earned a Ph.D. from Princeton.
        He was a researcher for the Manhattan Project and taught at Indiana University and the University of Sydney. After 10 years in Australia, he returned to Indiana in 1983 to be an adjunct professor and work on his books.
        He was the author or co-author of more than 200 papers in photochemistry, solid-state chemistry, neurochemistry and protein chemistry.
        Surviving are his wife of 58 years, Patricia Bacon Moore; a son, Anthony, of Fairbanks, Alaska; two daughters, Julia McCready of New South Wales, Australia, and Dr. Kate H. Moore of Sydney; a sister, Mary W. Wiecha of Belfast, Me.; four grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
