        Eugene Brooks, a lawyer and writer who gave frequent readings with his brother, the poet Allen Ginsberg, died on Wednesday. He was 80.
        Mr. Brooks, who was born Eugene Ginsberg, changed his surname after he was discharged from the Army in 1945. He graduated from Montclair State Teachers College and New York University Law School and became a specialist in international law.
        His own poems, which included many written while he was serving in a radar unit in Britain and France during World War II, were eventually collected and published as ''Rites of Passage'' in 1973. From the 1970's through the early 90's, he often took part in poetry readings with his brother, who was most famous as the author of ''Howl'' and ''Kaddish.'' Ginsberg died in 1997.
        Mr. Brooks is survived by his wife, Constance; four sons, Alan, Peter, Lyle and Neil; a daughter, Anne; a stepbrother, Harold Collins; and a stepsister, Sheila Maltz.
