        Rabbi Avrohom Pam, an elder of the Orthodox Jewish community in the United States, died early Friday at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 88 and lived in Flatbush.
        The cause was cancer, said Abraham Biderman, his longtime student.
        Rabbi Pam was a member of the Council of Sages of Agudath of America, an umbrella organization of Orthodox groups. He was the dean of Yeshiva Torah Vodaath in Flatbush, a seminary for the training of Orthodox rabbis.
        His funeral on Friday afternoon drew thousands of mourners to the yeshiva on East Ninth Street between Cortelyou Road and Ditmas Avenue. Associates of the rabbi said the size of the crowd on such short notice was the more remarkable since many were out of town this time of year.
        Rabbi Pam was born in Russia and was brought to Brooklyn as an infant. He received his religious education and was ordained at the same yeshiva where he later taught for 64 years, starting in 1937. He became dean in 1970.
        He was a mentor to thousands of students and alumni and a spiritual guide for many others at Agudath Israel and beyond. He lectured widely on complex Talmudic subjects and frequently addressed Jewish audiences concerning ethical issues, with emphasis on interpersonal relations and the importance of respect and consideration between spouses.
        The rabbi was active in various projects for young people in this country and in Israel, particularly those involving immigrants from the former Soviet Union, and campaigned strongly for a school for them in Israel called Shuva.
        He also was the author of a collection of essays, ''Atara Lamelech,'' about ethical questions.
        Rabbi Pam is survived by his wife, Sarah; three sons, Aaron, David and Asher, all of Brooklyn; and many grandchildren.
