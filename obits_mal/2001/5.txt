        Douglas Howcroft Mazonowicz, a graphic artist who helped preserve some of the world's most famous prehistoric cave paintings by recreating them on silk, died on Sunday in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 80.
        Born in Swindon, in Wiltshire, England, Mr. Mazonowicz spent 15 years in France, Spain, North Africa and North America seeking prehistoric art, which he reproduced as serigraphs, or silkscreens. ''The Hand of Man,'' a book of 35 serigraphs, accompanied an exhibit of the same name at his Gallery of Prehistoric Paintings in Manhattan in 1982. His work was also shown at the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History.
        His 1975 marriage to Susan Warms Dryfoos, a great-granddaughter of Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, ended in divorce in 1982.
        He is survived by a son, Nicholas Ochs Mazonowicz; two brothers, Jack Mazonowicz of Rushford, England, and Denis Mason, of Whangerie, New Zealand; and his companion, Berna Villiers.
