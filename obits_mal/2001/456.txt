        Ross Feld, a novelist and critic, died on May 9 in Cincinnati, where he lived. He was 53.
        The cause was pneumonia related to cancer, said Josh Rubins, a friend.
        Mr. Feld was the author of four novels, ''Years Out'' (1973); ''Only Shorter'' (1982), which recounted his first bout with cancer when he was in his 20's; ''Shapes Mistaken'' (1989); and ''Zwilling's Dream'' (1999).
        ''Zwilling's Dream,'' about a failed novelist who stops writing after his wife and daughter die in an automobile accident, only to have his early work optioned for a movie with his son as the screenwriter, was named one of the best books of 1999 by The Los Angeles Times.
        Born in Brooklyn and a graduate of the City College of New York, Mr. Feld began his career in 1968 as a copy editor with Time-Life Books and became an editor at Grove Press.
        From 1978 to 1994 he reviewed fiction at Kirkus Reviews; he was also a regular contributor of essays on art, fiction and poetry to Parnassus.
        Since 1985 Mr. Feld had worked in publishing.
        His 1972 book of poetry, ''Plum Poems,'' was recently reissued.
        He is survived by his wife, Ellen; two sons, Aaron and Zachary; his parents, Herman and Lillian Feld; and a brother, Adam, all of Cincinnati.
