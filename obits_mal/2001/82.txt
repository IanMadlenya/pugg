        Claude Victor Palisca, a musicologist who specialized in the Renaissance, died on Jan. 10 in New Haven. He was 79 and lived in New Haven.
        Mr. Palisca was one of the outstanding musical scholars of his generation. His particular interest was in the stylistic turning point that took place in Italy around 1600, when the polyphony of the late Renaissance gave way to the expressive melody, the dance rhythms and the new genres -- chamber music and opera  -- of the early Baroque.
        From his research into the theoretical disputes of this period -- which concerned the nature and purposes of music and the lessons to be learned from ancient Greece -- he moved into examining the longer history of musical theory. His Renaissance-centered view of music as a humane discipline led him to engage himself actively in music education in the United States.
        The summit of his scholarly work is his ''Humanism in Italian Renaissance Musical Thought'' (1985). His other books include a widely used general study, ''Baroque Music'' (1968), and revised editions of Donald J. Grout's standard history of music.
        Born in Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia) on Nov. 24, 1921, Mr. Palisca came to the United States with his family in 1930. He studied at Queens College and then served as an Army radio operator in Marrakesh and Casablanca. Before returning home, he managed to visit London, Paris and Rome and resolved that his career would give him opportunities to return to Europe.
        In 1946 he started graduate work at Harvard, receiving a doctorate in 1954 for work on what remained his specialty, the beginnings of Baroque music in 16th-century theory and polemics. After spending 1953-59 at the University of Illinois, he joined Yale, where he was chairman of the music department from 1969 to 1975 and in 1992, the year of his retirement. He was appointed Henry L. and Lucy G. Moses professor of music at Yale in 1980.
        He was president of the National Council of the Arts in Education (1967-69), president of the American Musicological Society (1970-72) and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (from 1986).
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Carl, of East Haven, Conn.; and a daughter, Madeleine, of Tucson.
