        Joseph Weintraub, who helped make the teaching of economics mandatory for high school students in New York State, died on April 2 in the Bronx. He was 79.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his daughter, Meryl Hechtman, of East Meadow, N.Y.
        He had a 53-year teaching career, ending as an economics professor at Nassau Community College. He helped develop a mandatory economics course to be given to every high school student in the state, beginning this fall. On April 25, he was to have received the first Lifetime Achievement Award in Economics Education from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
        Mr. Weintraub was born in Queens and was a graduate of Queens College. He was in the Army Air Corps during World War II, leaving the service in 1946. He began teaching social studies in 1948, served as principal of Newtown High School in Queens for 11 years, and retired in 1982.
        In 1963, he became an adjunct economics professor at Nassau Community College and remained there until last August.
        His wife, Beatrice Kass Weintraub, a teacher, died in 1993. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, David Weintraub, of Wantagh, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.
