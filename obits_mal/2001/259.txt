        Paul D. Paganucci, a former vice president of Dartmouth College, died on Monday at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 69. The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Marilyn.
        Mr. Paganucci, a Dartmouth alumnus, joined the college in 1972 as a business professor and associate dean at the Tuck School of Business. He was named vice president and treasurer of Dartmouth in 1975, a position he held until 1986. During Mr. Paganucci's tenure as the college's chief financial officer, he reorganized the endowment and tripled it in size to $478 million from $142 million.
        Mr. Paganucci also concluded an agreement to build a new campus for the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Paganucci is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth, of Plainfield, N.H., and a son, Thomas, of Hanover.
