        Donald C. Peirce, a specialist in American decorative art and a curator at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, died on Feb. 5 at his home in Atlanta. He was 52.
        The cause was heart disease, said a spokesman for the High Museum.
        Mr. Peirce, who was born and reared in Champaign, Ill., spent the early part of his career at the St. Louis Art Museum and the Winterthur Museum in Winterthur, Del. From 1975 to 1980 he was an assistant and then associate curator of decorative art at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. One of his projects was the reinstallation of the 18th-century period rooms. With Hope Alswang, he wrote ''American Interiors: New England and the South'' (1983).
        In 1980 he went to the High Museum as curator of decorative art. His publications included ''Art and Enterprise: American Decorative Art, 1825-1917, the Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection.''
        He is survived by his father, George Roland Peirce, and a brother, John, of Placerville, Calif.
