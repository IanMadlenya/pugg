        James M. Fleetwood Jr., the chairman and chief executive of LifePoint Hospitals, died on Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he was on vacation. He was 54 and lived in Nashville.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, the company said in a statement.
        LifePoint was spun off in 1999 from HCA-the Healthcare Company. Mr. Fleetwood was initially LifePoint's president and chief operating officer and was appointed chairman and chief executive in May 2000. LifePoint, which is based in Brentwood, Tenn., owns and operates 21 nonurban hospitals nationwide.
        Mr. Fleetwood was born in Farmville, Va., and graduated from Campbell University in Buies Creek, N.C.
        He served in the Air Force as a medical administrator from 1971 to 1975. After leaving the service, Mr. Fleetwood held a variety of hospital management positions.
        Mr. Fleetwood is survived by his wife, Gay, and two children, Ashley and Josh.
