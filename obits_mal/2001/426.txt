        Allan E. Sloane, who wrote socially conscious dramas for radio and television that won many awards, died on April 29 at his home in New Canaan, Conn. He was 86.
        Critics particularly praised his television and radio scripts involving children with physical or mental  handicaps.
        ''Allan Sloane, who for many years has wielded one of the most sensitive pens in television and radio drama, has never written a more poignant and touching work than his play last night, 'And James Was a Very Small Snail,' '' Jack Gould wrote in The New York Times in 1963. The program, on ABC, was about a family's adjusting to an emotionally disturbed child.
        Mr. Sloane and Emily Perl Kingsley also won critics' praise for their script for a 1987 CBS made-for-television movie called ''Kids Like These,'' about a child with Down syndrome. Ms. Kingsley said that the awards Mr. Sloane won over the years included three Emmys; six Peabody awards, four of them for radio and two for television; and two Writers Guild Awards.
        In 1963 he wrote scripts for a hard-edged dramatic television series, ''East Side, West Side,'' on CBS starring George C. Scott as a social worker in New York's slums. It lasted one season.
        Mr. Sloane also wrote for films, including the screenplay for ''Question 7,'' a 1961 Louis de Rochemont Associates movie.
        After Army service in the United States during World War II, he started in radio. In 1950 he wrote for the NBC radio program ''Top Secret.''
        He is survived by his wife,  Elouise; three sons, Jonathan, David and Paul, all of Connecticut; and two granddaughters.
