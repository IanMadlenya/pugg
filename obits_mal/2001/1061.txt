        Msgr. Bryan Oliver Walsh, who played a crucial role in Operation Pedro Pan, which conveyed 14,000 Cuban children to Florida early in the 1960's, died on Dec. 20 in a Miami hospital. He was 71 and had long been active in the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Miami.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, The Associated Press reported.
        The people with him when he died included a number of beneficiaries of the Pedro Pan operation, which has also been called the Cuban Children's Program. Created in the wake of Fidel Castro's seizure of power in January 1959, the operation brought the children to the United States in 1961 and 1962.
        Thousands of Cubans began arriving in Miami in 1959. From late 1960 to August 1964, more than 16,000 unaccompanied Cuban children had also come, sent by their parents to get them away from Mr. Castro.
        Monsignor Walsh's program got under way in 1960 to help those children by finding housing in foster homes, with relatives or elsewhere until they could be reunited with their parents.
        By 1964, when he was Miami director of the Catholic Welfare Service, he was a leader in finding foster care for unaccompanied children.
        By 1970 the Cuban exodus was still continuing, at a rate of about 45,000 people a year, with most settling in the Miami area. Miami had also become the preferred destination of many immigrants from virtually every Latin American country.
        Also by 1970, Monsignor Walsh was the vicar for the Spanish-speaking people of what was elevated from the diocese of Miami to the archdiocese of Miami in 1968. He coordinated social and ecclesiastical programs for the archdiocese's growing Latin membership.
        At that time, he was also director of the Centro Hispánico Católico, a social agency founded in 1959 to serve the new Spanish-speaking parishioners.
        In 1969, the agency answered more than 115,000 requests for aid, Monsignor Walsh said in an interview in 1970. He regarded himself as a sort of ombudsman for Latin-American Catholics in Miami.
        Born in Portarlington, Ireland, he attended Mungret College in Ireland and was recruited to pursue his priestly duties in Florida.
