        Andrew E. Gibson, a shipping executive who was an assistant secretary of commerce in the Nixon administration, died on July 8 at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Gibson went to Washington in 1969 at the beginning of the Nixon administration and was maritime administrator, assistant secretary of commerce for maritime affairs and assistant secretary of commerce for domestic and international business.
        He left the government in 1973 to become president of the Interstate Oil Transport Company in Philadelphia but was nominated in 1974 by President Gerald R. Ford to be federal energy administrator. That nomination was withdrawn after the disclosure that under his contract with Interstate, Mr. Gibson would receive severance pay of almost $90,000 a year for 10 years.
        Mr. Gibson was born in New York and was a captain in the merchant marine in World War II. After the war, he graduated from Brown University and spent two years as a lieutenant in the Navy. Mr. Gibson had graduate degrees from New York University and the University of Wales.
        Before and after his time in the government, Mr. Gibson was an executive with companies in the shipping business.
        Mr. Gibson is survived by his wife, Judith Spofford Gibson, and five children from a previous marriage, Drew, of Fairfield, Iowa; John, of Hadley, N.Y.; Alexander, of Atlanta;  Janet Fricke of Ridgewood, N.J.; and Ann Cullen of New York. He also had seven grandchildren.
