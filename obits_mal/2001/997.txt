        Gregoire C. R. B. MacArthur, a member of one of America's wealthiest families and a supporter of human rights and liberal causes, died Nov. 18 at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 53.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. MacArthur came to public notice when he formed a group called Citizens for Strategic Voting to back Ralph Nader and the Green Party in the 2000 presidential election. Its full-page newspaper advertisements sought to reassure voters that ''voting for a candidate who can't win is the smartest thing you'll ever do.''
        ''And don't worry,'' the ads said. ''A vote for Nader is not a vote for Bush.''
        Mr. MacArthur's group tried to garner Green Party votes by contacting independents; supporters of John McCain, the senator and presidential candidate who lost the Republican nomination to George W. Bush; and ''disgruntled Democrats.''
        Mr. MacArthur was a director of the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation, which his father established in 1976 to further social justice and civil rights. His father, known as Rod, created the annual ''genius grant'' program of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of the richest foundations in the country; it, in turn, was set up by his father, John D. MacArthur.
        Greg MacArthur founded a London-based group known as Article 19, the International Center on Censorship, in 1987. The year before, he established the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit public-interest law firm affiliated with the University of Chicago Law School.
        Mr. MacArthur's interests extended to television productions with social and political themes, including the films of Michael Moore and the satellite television network Free Speech TV.
        Gregoire Christian Roderick Bruce MacArthur was born in Paris. He graduated from Goddard College in Vermont in 1972. He started a career as a reporter for the City News Bureau of Chicago and later reported for The Associated Press from France and North Africa.
        In December 1984, he returned to the United States upon the death of his father, a Chicago businessman and philanthropist, to help look after the family interests.
        Mr. MacArthur is survived by his wife, Gina MacArthur of Manhattan; their two children, Henry, and Grace; his mother, Christiane L'Entendart MacArthur of Manhattan; a brother, John R. MacArthur, also of Manhattan; and a sister, Dr. Solange MacArthur of Washington.
        ''He was a very versatile philanthropist who went beyond charity to support groups working for systemic justice,'' Mr. Nader said. ''He was very informed about the recipients of his grants, and he often networked with other philanthropists to support various initiatives.''
        As for the Green Party, Mr. Nader added, ''He advised the party, and he called people we could not reach, celebrities we wanted to appear at events.''
        Correction:  December 11, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary on Thursday about Gregoire C. R. B. MacArthur, a supporter of human rights and liberal causes, misstated his age. He was 52, not 53.
