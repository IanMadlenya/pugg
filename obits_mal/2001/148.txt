        Shepard Kurnit, a longtime advertising executive, died on Saturday. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan and Boca Raton, Fla. The cause was a brain tumor, said his son Rick.
        Mr. Kurnit helped break down the barrier between art direction and copywriting in the 1960's and created wacky, entertaining advertising campaigns. One of his ads for Talon Zippers showed the Statue of Liberty with a zipper down her back.
        Mr. Kurnit was a strong proponent of the advertising industry's responsibility to the public. Over several decades his name figured prominently in many agencies, including one that he started in 1986, at age 62, Kurnit Communications, that was largely devoted to pro bono work.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; three brothers, Harold, Victor and Norman; three sons, Paul, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Rick and Scott, both of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.
