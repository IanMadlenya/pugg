        David Joseph Goldberg, a lawyer who was chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority as well as the state's first commissioner of transportation, died on Monday at his home in Lawrenceville, N.J. He was 70.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Goldberg practiced law for 45 years, focusing on environmental,  administrative and municipal matters. He retired last year from the firm Drinker Biddle & Shanley in Princeton.
        A native of Chester, Pa., he graduated from Rutgers University in 1952. He received his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1955, and he lectured on transportation and government at the university's Wharton School and at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.
        Mr. Goldberg was counsel to Gov. Richard J. Hughes from 1964 to 1966. In 1966, the State Legislature created the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and Mr. Hughes appointed Mr. Goldberg as its commissioner, a position he held until 1970.
        Mr. Goldberg was chairman of the Turnpike Authority from 1990 to 1994. Before that, he was a member and chairman of several other agencies, including the Delaware River Port Authority and the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.
        Mr. Goldberg is survived by his wife, Barbara Berman Goldberg; a son, Daniel, of Lawrenceville; a daughter, Debra Bernier of Palm Bay, Fla.; four siblings, Jacob, Edward and Rose Goldberg and Shirley Rosenberg, all of Ewing Township, N.J.; and four grandchildren.
