        Dan Lacy, a former executive of the McGraw-Hill Companies and a nationally recognized expert on copyright law, died on April 17 at a retirement home in Durham, N.C. He was 87.
        In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Mr. Lacy to the National Advisory Commission on Libraries and Information, and in 1975 he was named by President Gerald R. Ford to the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works. Both organizations dealt with copyright legislation.
        In 1966, Mr. Lacy became senior vice president of the McGraw-Hill Book Company, and subsequently senior vice president and executive assistant to the president of the McGraw-Hill Companies.
        After his retirement from McGraw-Hill, he served for a number of years as vice president and director of the Business Council for Effective Literacy.
        Born on Feb. 28, 1914, in Newport News, Va., Mr. Lacy graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1933. He also received a master's degree in history and a Ph.D. in literature from U.N.C.
        After teaching history at the university for a short while, he became assistant state director of the Historical Records Survey -- a national Works Progress Administration project. He later served as assistant national director of the program.
        He joined the staff of the National Archives in Washington, eventually becoming its director of operations and later the assistant archivist of the United States.
        In 1951, he transferred to the State Department to reorganize the Information Service Center.
        Mr. Lacy is survived by his wife, Hope; three children, Philip of Columbia, S.C., Dudley of Durham, Elizabeth of Pelham, N.Y.; and six grandchildren.
