        Lawrence Minard, founding editor of Forbes Global, the international edition of Forbes magazine, died on Aug. 2 while climbing Mount Rainier, near Seattle. He was 51.
        Mr. Minard had a heart attack, collapsed and died while climbing with his daughter Julia in a guided party up Disappointment Cleaver, a rocky outcrop bordering the Emmons Glacier.
        In 1997, the Forbes family decided to start an international edition of its business magazine to be called Forbes Global, and appointed Mr. Minard, who had worked at Forbes since 1974, to be its first editor. The first edition appeared in April 1998.
        At first, Mr. Minard edited Forbes Global from New York. But at the start of this year he moved to London to pursue the magazine's mission of covering the business world outside North America. It appears twice a month.
        Under his leadership, the circulation of Forbes Global rose from an initial 50,000 to more than 110,000 this year, with readership concentrated mainly in Europe and Asia.
        Born in Seattle on Nov. 19, 1949, Mr. Minard earned a B.A. from Trinity College in Hartford and then studied political economy at New School University in New York. He joined Forbes as a researcher and reporter in 1974, became special correspondent in Asia in 1978, European bureau chief in London in 1979 and West Coast and Asia bureau chief in Los Angeles in 1983.
        He was appointed assistant managing editor of Forbes in 1985, deputy managing editor in 1987 and managing editor in 1989.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Bailey Minard, and their daughters, Sara and Julia, of Brooklyn.
