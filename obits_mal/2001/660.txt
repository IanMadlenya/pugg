        Donald H. Rivkin, a lawyer with an international practice who helped build stronger ties between legal communities here and in Europe, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause was complications from lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Rivkin represented foreign companies in corporate transactions and litigation and ran the Manhattan office of the Philadelphia firm of Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis.
        Mr. Rivkin helped forge an agreement between the Paris bar and the New York bar that made it easier for American and French lawyers to practice in each other's jurisdictions, and he promoted similar ties with British lawyers.
        He also set up a City Bar Association committee on Eastern Europe and, after the fall of communism, organized a colloquium at a Czech university on the role of lawyers in a free society.
        Mr. Rivkin worked on arms control issues at the Council on Foreign Relations and wrote a book, ''Achieving Effective Arms Control.''
        He was a founder of Operation Crossroads Africa, a nonprofit group promoting education and development in Africa.
        Mr. Rivkin, who was born in Iowa, held bachelor's and law degrees from Yale University and was a Rhodes Scholar.
        His wife, Lois, died in 1999.
        He is survived by two sons, David, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Daniel, of London; a daugher, Judith Rivkin of Manhattan; seven grandchildren and a sister, Mary Jane Pollack of Chicago.
