        Maynard Mack, the Sterling Professor Emeritus of English at Yale University and a renowned expert on Shakespeare and Alexander Pope, died on Saturday at his home in New Haven. He was 90.
        Professor Mack was a member of the Yale faculty for 45 years, having begun as an instructor in English in 1936. He was chairman of the English department during the 1960's and was named Sterling Professor in 1965.
