        Hans Richard Rathsack, whose personal cheerleading as head of Wüsthof knives in the United States helped make them a popular brand among chefs and cooking enthusiasts, died on Sunday while sailing on Long Island Sound. He was 59 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
        His company said Mr. Rathsack, an accomplished yachtsman, was on the waters off Huntington when he was stricken with a heart attack.
        Mr. Rathsack was the president of Wüsthof-Trident of America in Hawthorne, N.Y. Earlier in his career, he worked for J. A. Henckels, another top maker of cutlery. He formed Wüsthof's American subsidiary in 1985.
        The knife maker was founded in 1814 by Eduard Wüsthof and remains in family hands. Its present head, Wolfgang, is the sixth-generation Wüsthof at the helm.
        Mr. Rathsack became a personal campaigner for the heavy, expensive knives in America, meeting with prospective retailers, demonstrating the knives at food and cooking seminars and pitching them on QVC, the television shopping network. The knives are now sold through virtually every major department store, cooking and household specialty store and catalog in the United States.
        Hans Rathsack was born in Anklam, a historic town in northern Germany.
        He apprenticed as a teenager with J. A. Henckels Zwillingswerk in Solingen, a cutlery center famous for fine blades since the Middle Ages. Henckels eventually posted him to its Toronto office and then to its United States headquarters.
        He was the head of all Henckels operations in the country when the company Ed. Wüsthof Dreizackwerk, also of Solingen, recruited him to form its American subsidiary.
        Mr. Rathsack is survived by his wife of 37 years, Barbara Schumann Rathsack; a son, Stephan, of White Plains; a sister, Rose Irene Schwickerath, of Solingen; and a granddaughter.
