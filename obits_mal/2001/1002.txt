        Dr. J. Herbert Fill, a psychiatrist who was New York City's commissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services for part of the Lindsay administration, died on Sunday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 77 and had lived on the Upper East Side.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, his family said.
        He was acting commissioner of mental health services from 1967 to 1969, when Mayor John V. Lindsay named him to the commissioner's post, which he held until 1972.
        The budgets he oversaw in those years grew to more than $150 million. Eight comprehensive community mental health centers were established during his tenure.
        Born in Chiusa, Italy, Joseph Herbert Fill received his medical degree in 1954 from the University of Innsbruck in Austria.
        After residency at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., he held psychiatric and administrative posts in the Virgin Islands and with the New York City Community Mental Health Board before becoming acting commissioner. In 1972, Dr. Fill resigned as commissioner, voicing concern that despite ''spending hundreds of millions on better and more efficient programs, we still see more and more mental disturbance'' and other problems.
        In later years he practiced medicine and psychiatry in Manhattan. He visited China in 1976 to learn acupuncture and included it in his treatment of some patients. He retired in 1999.
        He is survived by Antje Mullikas Fill of Southampton, N.Y., from whom he was divorced and with whom he later lived for some years; a son, Eric Christian Fill of Manhattan; and a grandson.
