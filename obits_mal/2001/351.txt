        Mitchell Stern, a violinist and violist who taught at the Manhattan School of Music, died on April 9 in Manhattan. He was 45 and lived in River Vale, N.J.
        The cause was complications after surgery for a brain aneurysm, said Deborah Kinzler, the director of public relations at the music school.
        Mr. Stern was born in Cleveland on July 26, 1955. He studied the violin and viola at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, where he earned a bachelor's degree in music in 1978, and at the Juilliard School. His teachers included Dorothy DeLay, Ivan Galamian, Arnold Steinhardt, Charles Castleman and Margaret Randall.
        He won several competitions, including one held by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1974 and the Washington International Competition in 1975. He won the Leventritt Award in 1978.
        From 1980 to 1990 Mr. Stern was the first violinist in the American String Quartet, with which he made several recordings. He also performed as a member of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra and Music From Marlboro and was the concertmaster of the American Symphony Orchestra from 1991 to 1994 and of the Little Orchestra Society in 1994.
        In addition to teaching the violin and viola and coaching chamber music at the Manhattan School of Music, Mr. Stern held faculty positions at several other institutions, including the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the State University of New York at Purchase, the Philadelphia Music Academy, the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y., and the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine; his father, Myron Stern of Cleveland; and two brothers, Eric, of West New York, N.J., and Joel, of Chicago.
