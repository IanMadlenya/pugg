        Tom Dardis, a biographer whose work was enriched by his own experiences, died on Nov. 2 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his wife, Ellen Ervin.
        Mr. Dardis's book ''Firebrand: The Life of Horace Liveright''(1995) was a best-seller and was named a Notable Book of 1995 by The New York Times Book Review, which said it was ''a brisk, concise, unpedantic biography of the salesman turned publisher who created the modern style of aggressive book promotion and advertising.''
        Mr. Dardis was a former teenage movie usher with an interest in screenwriters, and his book ''Some Time in the Sun: The Hollywood Years of F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Nathanael West, Aldous Huxley and James Agee'' (1976, Limelight) was a Literary Guild Selection.
        He was also an alcoholic who had stayed sober for more than 30 years and believed that Faulkner, Fitzgerald and Hemingway had been adversely affected by alcohol. He expressed that view in ''The Thirsty Muse: Alcohol and the American Writer'' (1989, Ticknor & Fields).
        He also wrote biographies of the silent-film comedians Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.
        Born in Brooklyn, Thomas Anthony Dardis received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia, all in English.
        From 1952 to 1971 he was in book publishing, serving for some years as editor in chief of Berkeley Books, the Manhattan paperback house.
        His first marriage, to Jane Buckelew, ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children from his first marriage: two sons, Anthony of Brooklyn and Francis of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Anne Dardis of Manhattan; and a grandson.
