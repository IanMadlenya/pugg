        Thomas W. Dewart, former president and publisher of The Sun, the long-defunct New York newspaper, died on Sept. 2 at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 90.
        On Jan. 4, 1950, Mr. Dewart and his family sold The Sun to the New York World-Telegram, a Scripps-Howard newspaper. The combination became The World-Telegram and Sun. Its name disappeared in a merger with The New York Herald Tribune in 1966; its successor, The World Journal Tribune, closed in 1967.
        Thomas Wheeler Dewart, born on Oct. 1, 1910, in New York City, joined The Sun in 1931 as assistant treasurer under the tutelage of his father, William T. Dewart. Thomas Dewart became president and publisher in 1944. He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Elizabeth Landman Dewart; his children by a previous marriage, Elinore Dewart Killebrew of Stamford, Conn., Mary Dewart Dooney of Greenwich, Phyllis Dewart Greene of Ipswich, Mass., and Thomas Wheeler Dewart Jr. of Eugene, Ore.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
