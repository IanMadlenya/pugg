        Paul J. Fitzgerald, the lead defense lawyer in the murder trial of Charles M. Manson and three young women who were his followers, died on Oct. 1 at his Beverly Hills, Calif., home. He was 64.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. Fitzgerald was a Los Angeles public defender in 1969 when he was assigned to represent one of the followers, Patricia Krenwinkel. The four defendants were convicted of the murders of seven people, including the actress Sharon Tate.
        The four went on trial in Los Angeles in 1970, a year after the killings at Miss Tate's home in Benedict Canyon above Beverly Hills.
        After their convictions in 1971 they were sentenced to death. The sentences were reduced to life imprisonment after the Supreme Court made the death penalty illegal.
        Born in Minneapolis, Mr. Fitzgerald held a law degree from the University of Minnesota. His marriage to the former Dyanne Olsen ended in divorce.
        He is survived by two daughters, Teresa Nersesyan of Los Angeles and Elizabeth Fitzgerald Simonian of South Lake Tahoe, Calif.; and five grandchildren.
