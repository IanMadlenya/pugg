        Stanley I. Tannenbaum, a longtime top executive at the advertising agency Kenyon & Eckhardt and an educator at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, died on Monday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 73.
        The cause was complications from dialysis, said his daughter, Nancy Tannenbaum of San Francisco.
        Mr. Tannenbaum joined Kenyon & Eckhardt in New York in the mid-1950's, holding positions including copywriter, creative director and chairman, a post he held for at least a decade.
        He worked for 26 years at Kenyon & Eckhardt, a predecessor to what is now the Bozell Group unit of True North Communications, for clients like Brylcreem, which used ads that carried the well-known jingle ''a little dab'll do ya.''
        In 1980, he left the agency to join a client, Turtle Wax in Chicago.
        In 1981, he became president at Bentley, Barnes & Lynn in Chicago.
        Mr. Tannenbaum joined Medill in 1983 as a professor of journalism in the advertising department.
        Mr. Tannenbaum received a bachelor's degree in economics from Temple University in 1950. He was born on April 14, 1928.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Audrey; two sons, Frederic of Chicago and George of New York; and four grandchildren.
