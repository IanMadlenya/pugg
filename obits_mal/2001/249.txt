        Ernesto Jofre, a political refugee from Chile who became a trade union leader and champion of low-income workers in New York City, died on March 5 at his home in Queens. He was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said Kevin Finnegan, a friend and colleague.  Before moving to the United States in 1976, Mr. Jofre spent three years in prison for political activity. In this country, he joined the trade union movement and rose to become international vice president of Unite, the garment workers' union.
        Mr. Jofre was born on Oct. 13, 1937, in Tocopilla, Chile. In the United States, he became a member of Local 169 of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. In 1995, the union merged with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to form Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
        Mr. Jofre is survived by his wife, Beatriz, of Queens, and six children: Esteban, of Queens; Ernesto, of Ithaca, N.Y.; Eduardo, of Syracuse; Yazna Jofre of Tocopilla; Ernesto Luis and Pablo Ocampo, both of Queens; and 10 grandchildren.
