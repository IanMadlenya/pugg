        Piero Corsini, a dealer in old master paintings who had galleries in New York and Monaco, died on Monday in Monaco. He was 63 and lived in Monaco.
        The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Corsini was born in Florence, Italy, and began to acquire and study antique furniture and paintings when he was 18. For the next 25 years he dealt privately, living in Florence and often visiting the United States. In 1981 he moved to Manhattan, opening a semiprivate gallery in a brownstone on East 63rd Street, where he lived with his family.
        Mr. Corsini dealt in European paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries and participated in art fairs in Maastricht, the Netherlands; Paris; London; New York; and Venice. Clients included leading American and European museums.
        He was known especially for his expertise in Renaissance and Baroque art and for his good hunches about the authenticity of dingy paintings he bought. He suspected that a ''Madonna and Child'' listed as School of Jacopo Bellini was by the artist himself. Once he had it cleaned, scholars agreed with him. It was acquired by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for about seven times the $100,000 he had paid.
        A ''Madonna and Child,'' attributed to Titian's workshop and bought for around $50,000, was also conserved and upgraded, selling in 1986 to the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth for $1.5 million.
        Mr. Corsini founded his Monaco gallery in 1997.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjetta; two daughters, Benedetta, of New York and Milan, who is a private dealer, and Alessia, of Monaco; and a son, Lorenzo, of London.
