        Sidney H. Kelley, a member of the family of used-car dealers who developed the Kelley Blue Book on car prices, died Wednesday in Norco, Calif. He was 92.
        The Kelley Kar Company started in 1918 with three Model T Fords in an open lot and in its heyday after World War II was the biggest used-car business in the world. It was begun by his older brother, R. Leslie Kelley.
        Sidney, known as Buster, began to work as a lot boy and eventually ran the company's repair shop.
        Kelley Kar published its first Blue Book in 1926. The book eventually became a standard guide for the automotive trade and the courts in determining the value of cars of all makes and model years.
        The family sold the business, including the Blue Book, in 1962, but retained a management role in the book's publication as it expanded to cover motorcycles and recreational vehicles.
        Mr. Kelley is survived by a son, Robert; a daughter, Deborah Sanchez; eight grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. His brother, Leslie, died in 1990.
