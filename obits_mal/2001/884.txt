        Louis Zara, a publisher and editor of magazines and books who was best known for his own historical novels, died on Oct. 5 in his Manhattan apartment. He was 91.
        Mr. Zara was known for long, weighty novels, many of them with historical heroes, from Stephen Crane to Herman Melville to Philip II of Spain. His style, a New York Times reviewer observed in 1935, was ''heavy, vital and impressive.''
        His book ''This Land Is Ours,'' published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940, told the panoramic story of life and death in the Eastern Mississippi Valley between 1755 and 1835 through the experience of one family.
        His other novels included ''Blessed Is the Man'' (1935), ''Give Us This Day'' (1935), ''Some for the Glory'' (1937), ''Against the Rock'' (1943), ''Ruth Middleton'' (1946), ''Rebel Run'' (1951), ''In the House of the King'' (1952), ''Blessed Is the Land'' (1954) and ''Dark Rider'' (1961).
        Mr. Zara did not confine himself to writing. He was an executive of the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company in Chicago from 1946 until 1961 and then was editor in chief of the adult trade division of the Follet Publishing Company.
        He was also a coin collector and had a magnificent jade collection. He was a fellow of both the American Numismatic Society and the Royal Numismatic Society. In addition to his novels, he wrote a book about his favorite gem, ''Jade'' (1969). He was editor in chief of Cameo, a magazine for collectors of art medals.
        Shara Gilman, his niece, said he also wrote a book about locks and keys, wrote poetry and was active in civil rights and civil liberties causes.
        He wrote for radio and television shows, including ''Stump the Stars'' in the mid-1940's.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Dillman Zara; a sister, Jean Bernstein of Skokie, Ill.; and his sons Philip, of Monument, Colo., and Daniel, of California. His niece said he had a number of grandchildren from several marriages.
