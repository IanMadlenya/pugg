        Former Representative Thomas Nelms Downing, a conservative Democrat who represented the Peninsula district of eastern Virginia from 1958 to 1976, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Newport News, his hometown. He was 82.
        The cause was emphysema and cancer, his law firm said.
        Mr. Downing retired from Congress as chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. He returned to a law practice in Newport News and at his death was of counsel to the firm of Jones, Blechman, Woltz & Kelly.
        A 1940 graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, he rose to the rank of major with the Third Army in Europe and won the Silver Star for bravery. He received his law degree at the University of Virginia in 1947 and practiced in Newport News and Hampton, Va.
        He was a municipal judge before his election to Congress from Virginia's First District.
        Mr. Downing's first wife, Virginia Martin Downing, died in 1995 after 48 years of marriage. His second wife, Betty Cutler Downing, died earlier this year. He is survived by a daughter, Susan Downing of Hampton, and a son, Dickerson Downing of Stamford, Conn.
