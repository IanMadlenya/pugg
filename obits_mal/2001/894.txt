        William F. Melville Jr., the former chief executive of a large credit card company and executive of a bank, died on Oct. 10 at a nursing home in Arnold, Md. He was 80 and lived in Severna Park, Md.
        The cause was respiratory failure stemming from Alzheimer's disease, The Baltimore Sun said.
        Mr. Melville retired in 1985 from the credit card company MBNA America in Delaware; he was its first president and chief executive. The company was established in 1982 by Maryland National Bank, based in Baltimore. He became senior vice president of the bank in 1969.
        A Baltimore native, he attended Loyola College there and was in the Army in Europe during World War II. In 1946, he entered banking in Baltimore as a teller for Fidelity Trust, which Maryland National Bank took over later.
        His wife, Shirley, died last year.
        Mr. Melville is survived by a daughter, April M. Clark of Severna Park; a grandchild; and two sisters, Mary Melville of Perry Hall, Md., and Ethel Wille of Madonna, Md.
