        Otis L. Guernsey Jr., whose love affair with theater led to 36 years of chronicling its achievements as editor of the annual ''Best Plays'' volumes, died on Wednesday at his home in Woodstock, Vt. He was 82.
        Mr. Guernsey, a former film and theater critic and arts editor for The New York Herald Tribune, retired from ''Best Plays'' a few weeks ago,  just months after his induction into the Theater Hall of Fame.
        Mr. Guernsey began editing ''Best Plays'' in 1964 and chose his Top 10 plays each year. Each May during his heyday as editor, in the opening essay to ''Best Plays,'' Mr. Guernsey gave his opinion of previous season.
        Mr. Guernsey attended the Taft School and Yale University. He joined The Herald Tribune as a copy boy and became a reporter and drama critic. He left the newspaper in 1960.
        In addition to his wife, Dorianne, he is survived by two brothers, Peter E., of Manhattan, and David T., of North Falmouth, Mass.
