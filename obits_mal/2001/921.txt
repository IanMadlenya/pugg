        Angelo Ippolito, a painter and one of the founders of the Tanager Gallery, an artist-run space that was part of the New York School of Abstract Expressionists in the 1950's, died on Oct. 29 in Johnson City, N.Y., near Binghamton, where he was a professor emeritus of art at the State University. He was 79.
        The cause was a stroke, said his son Jon.
        Mr. Ippolito was born in Italy and came to New York at age 9. In 1952 he helped found the Tanager Gallery on East Fourth Street in Manhattan. A year later the gallery moved to East 10th Street, where it showed Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, among many other artists.
        Mr. Ippolito's paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
        He is survived by two sons, Jon, a media curator at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and Michael, of Yellow Springs, Ohio; a brother, Joseph, of Mahwah, N.J.; two sisters, Connie Cevasco of Malverne, N.Y., and Ann Juhasz of Morrisville, N.C.; and two grandchildren.
