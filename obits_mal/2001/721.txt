        Neil Cooper, the founder of the ROIR record label, which released music by underground rock and reggae bands, died on Aug. 13 at his home in Manhattan. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his son Lucas.
        Mr. Cooper was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Columbia Business School in 1954. He had worked as an agent for MCA and Famous Artists, where he represented performers like Shirley Bassey and Charles Mingus.
        After booking bands at an Upper East Side nightclub called the 80's and taping many shows, he decided to start a record label. He incorporated ROIR (an acronym for Reach Out International Records) in 1979 and put out its first release in 1981, by James Chance and the Contortions.
        The album was released on cassette only, which came to be the label's hallmark. Mr. Cooper quickly produced an extensive catalog of some of the most notable artists of the era, including Glenn Branca, Television, Suicide, the New York Dolls and the Skatalites.
        The label adopted the cassette format because many of its artists were already signed to exclusive contracts with other record labels; but cassettes, often of live recordings or other miscellany, did not violate their contracts, said Lucas Cooper, who has taken over the business.
        One of ROIR's most popular releases was the first, untitled album by the Bad Brains, an ultrafast punk band of Rastafarians from Washington whose only previous recorded output had been a two-song single. The album was released in 1982.
        The label has continued to release new material, eventually switching over to CD's and reissuing many of its classic tapes in that format.
        In addition to Lucas, of New York, Mr. Cooper is survived by another son, Nicholas, of Santa Fe, N.M., and a half-brother, Jerry Cooper of Florida.
