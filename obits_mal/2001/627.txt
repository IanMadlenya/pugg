        Scott Merrill, who played Macheath -- Mack the Knife -- in the hit 1954 production of ''The Threepenny Opera'' by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht at the Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village, died on June 28 at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 82 and lived in Bristol, Conn.
        Mr. Merrill not only starred with Weill's widow, Lotte Lenya, who played Jenny in ''The Threepenny Opera,'' but also appeared with Tallulah Bankhead as Felix da Costa, a shallow European dilettante, in ''Eugenia,'' Randolph Carter's 1957 Broadway adaptation of the Henry James novel ''The Europeans.''
        Mr. Merrill's performance in ''The Threepenny Opera'' prompted Daniel Blum, editor of Theater World, to call him one of the ''most promising personalities of the Broadway stage.'' Others mentioned in that category were Orson Bean, Harry Belafonte, James Dean, Ben Gazzara and Eva Marie Saint.
        Mr. Merrill's appearance as Macheath was his first nondancing role in New York, where he initially attracted notice in shows like ''Bloomer Girl,'' ''Paint Your Wagon'' and a revival of ''Pal Joey.'' He was first seen in New York in 1941 in ''Lady in the Dark,'' which starred Gertrude Lawrence, Danny Kaye and Victor Mature. Other credits included  ''Love Life,'' ''Small Wonder,'' ''Oklahoma!'' and a 1955 musical adaptation of ''Seventh Heaven.''
        He also appeared on television, performed in summer stock and choreographed nightclub shows and touring revues.
        Mr. Merrill was born in Baltimore, where his parents ran a cocktail bar. According to his companion, Edward O. Buffe, who survives him, when Mr. Merrill was a boy he was told he had diabetes. The doctor who made the diagnosis recommended that he take up dancing, and his mother enrolled him in dancing school, which led to his career in show business.
        In his 50's Mr. Merrill became the director of a center for the elderly in Bristol, where he worked for about a dozen years until he retired.
