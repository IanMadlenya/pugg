        Eugene J. Casey, a marketing designer who founded the firm that designed the logo for the Merrill Lynch bull, died on Jan. 30 in Guilford, Conn., at the home of a son. He was 83.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his daughter Susan C. Engel.
        In 1953, Mr. Casey founded King-Casey Inc. in New York with a fellow designer, Fred King. The agency designed and redesigned products and logos, including credit cards for American Express and Shell Oil as well as the Merrill Lynch bull.
        In 1980, Mr. Casey retired to Bonita Springs, Fla., and left the company to his son, Eugene Jr., who died in 1998. King-Casey still operates, now in South Norwalk, Conn.
        In addition to his daughter Ms. Engel, of New Canaan, Mr. Casey is survived by his wife, Ines; three sons, Brian S., of Guilford; Francis X., of Lake Tahoe, Calif.; and Robert P., of Weston, Conn.; three other daughters, Maureen LeFebvre, of Sutton Junction, Quebec; Christina Rovics, of Danbury, Conn.; and Mary Tsujimoto, of Brooklyn; 12 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren.
