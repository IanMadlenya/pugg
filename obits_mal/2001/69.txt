        Harvey J. Klaris, a producer of the Tony Award-winning musical ''Nine,'' died on Jan. 12 in New York. He was 61 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Jane.
        Mr. Klaris, a lawyer and investment banker, was a producer of the Broadway show ''The Tap Dance Kid'' and the Off Broadway show ''Cloud Nine.'' He was the founder and president of Cloud Nine Capital, an investment banking concern in New York, and a former co-owner of Sardi's. In the 1980's he formed and ran Precision Films.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by four sons, Edward, Joshua and Alexander, all of Manhattan, and Adam Nathan of London; two daughters, Grace, of Manhattan, and Lorin,  of Westport, Conn.; a brother, Kenneth Klaristenfeld of West Hills, Calif.; his father, William Klaristenfeld, of Southfield, Mich., and Pompano Beach, Fla.; and seven grandchildren.
