        Robert P. Samuels, chief executive at Milton Samuels Advertising in New York, died on April 4 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 71.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his son, Steven Samuels, of Westport, Conn.
        In 1965, Mr. Samuels took over Milton Samuels from his father, for whom the agency was named. Over 35 years, he opened offices in Los Angeles and Miami and increased offerings to include services like promotions and public relations.
        Mr. Samuels joined the agency in the early 1950's as an account executive. He was born on March 6, 1930, in Washington Heights.
        Besides his son, Mr. Samuels is survived by his wife, Shirley, of Floral Park, N.Y., and Boca Raton; a daughter, Laurie, of Dix Hills, N.Y.; a sister, Claire Fein, of Torrance, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
