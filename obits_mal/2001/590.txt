        Harold S. Grossbardt, a founder of Colony Records, the famed collector's store now on Broadway at 49th Street in Manhattan, died on June 10 at his home in Aventura, Fla. He was 85.
        Mr. Grossbardt, who was known as Nappy, helped make Colony a fixture of Tin Pan Alley, the center of New York's music publishing industry. He founded the store in 1948 with his partner, Sidney Turk, and the first shop fast became popular with music lovers and musicians.
        In the 1950's, with nightclubs like the Copacabana and Birdland nearby, Colony, then at 52nd Street and Broadway, became a frequent late-night stop for concertgoers and nightclub patrons. Hundreds of musical artists, from Frank Sinatra to John Lennon to Michael Jackson, have passed through its doors.
        The store underwent a number of expansions, moving in 1970 to its current location. Mr. Grossbardt also operated Nappy's and Tin Pan Alley, two offspring of Colony, in the 1950's and 1960's.
        Mr. Grossbardt was born in Brooklyn, and went to work after the seventh grade. He was a salesman at the Melody Music Shop in Brooklyn and at Colony Sporting Goods. When that store closed, Mr. Grossbardt took it over and renamed it Colony Records. He worked there until his retirement in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, Estelle; two sons, Michael J., of Roslyn, N.Y., and Alan R., of Great Neck, N.Y., who is an owner of Colony Records; a brother, Jerome, of Manhattan; a sister, Dorothy Capobianco, of Delray Beach, Fla.; and a grandson.
