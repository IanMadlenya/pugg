        George C. Lamb Jr., a former chairman and chief executive of United Parcel Service who guided the company through one of its largest and most significant growth periods, died on Tuesday at Duke University Medical Center. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said Elizabeth B. Lamb, his wife of 49 years.
        Mr. Lamb joined U.P.S. in 1952 as a shop clerk, logging addresses. He remained with the company until he retired in 1984 as chief executive.
        Mr. Lamb oversaw the company's transformation from a loose patchwork of domestic routes to a tightly knit national network that became the springboard for sending packages overseas, first as head of national operations through much of the 1970's and then as chairman, starting in 1980.
        Before deregulation changed the industry in the 1980's, Mr. Lamb supervised the task of getting separate approvals to operate in each state. This effort helped string together the company's disjointed operations, creating a base to ship packages to virtually every destination in the nation, by ground or air.
        With a domestic network in place, Mr. Lamb then oversaw the company's first forays into the overnight delivery business, as well as its expansion overseas. Although U.P.S. began experimenting with Canadian service in 1975, and with making deliveries inside Germany a year later, it did not bridge the Atlantic and begin regular shipments to Europe until 1985.
        By then, any gaps in the company's domestic distribution system had been closed. Mr. Lamb remained on the company's board until 1990.
        In addition to his wife, Elizabeth, of Durham, N.C., he is survived by two sons, George, of Dallas, and William, of Atlanta; two daughters, Claire Solley, of Alpharetta, Ga., and Margaret Lamb, of Chatham, Mass.; and six grandchildren.
