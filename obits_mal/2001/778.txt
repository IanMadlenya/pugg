        The Rev. Mychal F. Judge, a chaplain with the New York City Fire Department since 1992, died amid a rain of debris at the World Trade Center on Tuesday as he ministered to victims. He was 68 and lived in a Franciscan friary across West 31st Street from a firehouse.
        His head was struck by debris, according to friars at the Holy Name Province of the Franciscan Friars.
        Firefighters carried his body to St. Peter's Church on Barclay Street, then to the firehouse.
        Father Judge, who was born in Brooklyn, joined the friars 46 years ago. He was an assistant to the president of Siena College in Loudonville, N.Y., before becoming pastor of St. Joseph's Church in West Milford, N.H., in 1979. In 1986, he became a pastor at the Church of St. Francis of Assisi on West 31st Street in Manhattan.
        When Trans World Airways Flight 800 exploded off Long Island in 1996, Father Judge helped console families of victims, said the Rev. Charles Miller of the province.
        Father Judge went with his friend Steven McDonald, a New York police officer who was shot and paralyzed in 1986, on a recent peace mission to Northern Ireland, Father Miller said.
        He is survived by two sisters, Erin McTernan and Dymphna Jessich, both of Berlin, Md.
        Correction:  September 17, 2001, Monday  An obituary on Thursday about the Rev. Mychal Judge, a Fire Department chaplain who died ministering to World Trade Center victims, misstated the location of the parish where he served from 1979 to 1986. It is in West Milford, N.J., not in New Hampshire.
