        Gordon R. Dickson, a science fiction author best known for his Dorsai  books, died on Jan. 31 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 77.
        The cause was complications from severe asthma, said his brother, Craig.
        Mr. Dickson wrote over 80 books and many works of short fiction, including the Hugo Award-winning novella ''Lost Dorsai'' (1981, St. Martin's). The Dorsai books, set in a remote future, portray different genetic offshoots of humanity. The Dorsai offshoot, bred as professional soldiers, is used to explore ethical questions raised by militarism.
        Mr. Dickson was president of the Science Fiction Writers of America from 1969 to 1971 and is considered  one of the writers of the golden age of science fiction, the 1950's.
        He was born in Edmonton, Alberta, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota.
        He is survived by his brother, who lives in Shakopee, Minn.
