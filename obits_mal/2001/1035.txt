        Arthur F. Kelly, chief executive of Western Airlines in the 1970's, died on Nov. 20 in Gig Harbor, Wash. He was 88 and lived in Gig Harbor.
        A skilled marketer, he became chairman of Western, the Los Angeles-based airline, in 1976, when it faced tough competition.
        In the late 1970's, a main aim of the federal government's deregulation of the airlines industry was to stimulate competition, and Mr. Kelly won praise for offering reduced fares for tourists and business travelers.
        But in 1979, discount fares and higher costs were hurting airline earnings, and he telephoned Robert F. Six, chairman of Continental Airlines, and suggested that the two airlines merge.
        The union was formally proposed but was rejected in 1979 by the Civil Aeronautics Board, on the ground that it would diminish competition.
        After a second effort to merge failed, Western merged instead with Delta Air Lines in 1986.
        Born in Tombstone, Ariz., Arthur Francis Kelly graduated from the University of Utah. He joined Western in 1937 and became an Army colonel in the Air Transport Command in World War II. Then he rose through Western's executive ranks. He was Western's president and chief executive from 1973 to 1976, chairman and chief executive from 1976 to 1979 and then chairman until 1981, when he left the company.
        He married Sally Payne in 1942; she died in 1999.
        Surviving are a son, Arthur F. II, of Port Orchard, Wash.; three grandchildren; five great-grandchildren; and a brother, James, of Bellingham, Wash.
