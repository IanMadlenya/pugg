        Melville J. Ulmer, a liberal-minded economist, died at a group home in his hometown of Potomac, Md., on Feb. 9. He was 89.
        Mr. Ulmer was chairman of the economics departments at American University and later the University of Maryland and the author of eight books. Mr. Ulmer spent much of the 1970's in battle against more conservative-minded economists over possible cures for the economic woes of that decade.
        He is survived by his wife, Naomi Ulmer; two children, Melville Paul Ulmer of Evanston, Ill., and Stephanie Marie Ulmer of Pittsburgh; and three grandchildren.
