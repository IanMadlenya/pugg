        David Klein, an emeritus professor of social science and pediatrics and human development at Michigan State University and a prolific author, died May 19 at his home in Seattle. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, family members said.
        Professor Klein wrote more than a dozen books on subjects that included recreational boating, writing and estate planning. His first book, ''The Army Writer,'' written while he was in the Army during World War II, was long used as a military textbook.
        He later became executive vice president of Basic Books Inc. and then publications director of the Association for the Aid of Crippled Children, both in New York City.
        In 1964, Professor Klein began an academic career at Michigan State in East Lansing, where he taught, conducted research and continued to write scholarly and popular books and articles. He was a columnist for Seventeen magazine, a consumer affairs reporter for National Public Radio and a restaurant critic.
        David Klein was born on March 31, 1919, in New York. He graduated from City College and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1941. He retired in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Marymae; two daughters, Helen McGough of Seattle and Edith Klein of Toronto; a sister, Judith Crist, the film critic, of New York City; and two grandchildren.
