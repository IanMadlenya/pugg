        Ben Wright, a former publisher of This Week magazine, died on April 10 at his home in Colorado Springs. He was 89.
        Mr. Wright joined the publication, a Sunday supplement syndicated to newspapers across the country, as executive vice president in 1959. He became publisher the next year and remained as publisher until 1967.
        The magazine closed in 1969. While it was once the country's most widely circulated magazine, with a circulation of 14 million at its peak, it fell victim to television when national advertisers turned to commercials.
        Ben George Wright was born in Saginaw, Mich., and graduated from Eastern Michigan University in 1935. He started as a paperboy at The Saginaw News and worked his way through college reporting for The Associated Press and The Free Press of Detroit.
        In World War II he was a press liaison officer for the Ninth Air Force in Europe. He worked in public relations for American Airlines until 1949, when he joined the publishers Henry Holt & Company as vice president for the magazine division and publisher of Field and Stream.
        He was a former president of the Overseas Press Club Foundation, helping set up its Edward R. Murrow Memorial Fund and other projects.
        Mr. Wright is survived by his wife of 60 years, Dolly Barber Wright; a daughter, Susan Cogswell of Colorado Springs; a sister, Florence Cummings of Springfield, Ohio; and two grandchildren.
