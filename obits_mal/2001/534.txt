        Joe Darion, the lyricist for ''Man of La Mancha,'' whose inspirational ballad, ''The Impossible Dream,'' became one of the most beloved pop anthems of the 1960's, died on Saturday in Lebanon, N.H. He was 90.
        ''Man of La Mancha,'' which opened in New York in November 1965 and ran for 2,328 performances, won Mr. Darion and his composing partner Mitch Leigh a Tony Award for best score. Inspired by Cervantes's ''Don Quixote'' and adapted from Dale Wasserman's television play ''I, Don Quixote,'' it went on to become the third-longest-running Broadway musical of the 1960's.
        A prolific lyricist who worked in every field of music from popular songs to opera, Mr. Darion was born in New York City on Jan. 30, 1911. He attended City College and served in the Navy during World War II.
        In the early 1950's he had three Top-10 hits: the Patti Page ballad ''Changing Partners'' (music by Larry Coleman), the Teresa Brewer novelty ''Ricochet'' (music by Mr. Coleman and Norman Gimbel) and Red Buttons's comedy hit ''The Ho-Ho Song.''
        Mr. Darion's first Broadway show, the innovative jazz opera ''Shinbone  Alley'' in 1957 with music by George Kleinsinger, was a musical adaptation of Don Marquis's popular ''Archy and Mehitabel'' stories. The show evolved out of a popular recording featuring Carol Channing and Eddie Bracken. He also wrote ''Illya Darling'' (1967), a Broadway adaptation of the movie ''Never On  Sunday,'' with music by Manos Hadjidakis. It ran for 320 performances.
        Mr. Darion is survived by his wife, Hellen; a brother, Sidney; and seven nieces and nephews.
        He also wrote librettos in collaboration with the composer Ezra Laderman. They included an oratorio, ''Galileo Galilei,'' and the cantatas ''And David Wept,'' ''A Handful of  Souls,'' ''The Questions of Abraham'' and ''A Mass for Cain.''
        At the time of his death, Mr. Darion was working on another show, ''Oswego.''
