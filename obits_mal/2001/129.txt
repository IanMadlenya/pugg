        Laurence R. Goodyear Jr., a former investment banker with Kidder Peabody and the Fiduciary Trust Company, died last Friday while on a hunting trip near Los Lunas, N.M., on the Rio Grande. Mr. Goodyear, a resident of Bethesda, Md., was 65.
        The cause of death was probably a stroke, said his wife, Lorraine Gallard.
        Mr. Goodyear started Bonness Enterprises, an investment advisory company for individuals, in April 1977. Before that, he was a vice president at Kidder Peabody, and, from 1967 to 1973, a vice president and portfolio manager at Fiduciary Trust.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1958 and began his career in the international banking division of what is now Citibank, in Pakistan and Singapore.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Lauren Goodyear Schramm of Washington, Mary Cameron Goodyear and Dana R. Goodyear, both of New York; his sons, Laurence H. Goodyear of Avon, Conn., and Solomon Kuckelman of Bethesda, Md.; a sister, Wendy Griswold of Baltimore, and a brother, Daniel M. Goodyear of Robesonia, Pa.
