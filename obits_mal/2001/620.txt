        David E. Babcock, a former chairman and chief executive of May Department Stores, died last Friday in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 86.
        The cause was complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, said Michael J. Babcock, his son.
        Mr. Babcock joined the May company as vice president for organization, planning and development and was named a member of the board. Moving up the ranks, he became chairman in 1975 and, a year later, chief executive.
        During his tenure, Mr. Babcock introduced initiatives that allowed the company to expand through mergers and acquisitions without stretching its management. He started a tandem management structure in which two executives, one specializing in merchandising and the other in operations, were assigned to each of the eight store companies.
        Mr. Babcock also introduced a management-by-objective practice, which appraised employees' performance based on a specific set of objectives assigned to them. And he built a board from executives outside the company and introduced profit sharing for employees.
        Before joining May, Mr. Babcock spent 16 years at the Dayton's department store chain, which is now the Target Corporation. After retiring in 1980, he served on the Postal Service board of governors and on several corporate boards.
        He was born on Nov. 15, 1914, in Manitowoc, Wis. When he was 4, his mother died of the flu, and at his father's request, an aunt and uncle raised him and his 7-year-old brother. Mr. Babcock was left on his own at the age of 13, when his uncle died. After graduating from high school in Holcolm, Kan., Mr. Babcock worked as a farm laborer and cowboy.
        He is survived by his second wife, Dianne, of Vero Beach; three children from his first marriage, David Jr., of Minneapolis, Michael, of Vero Beach, and Mary Christine, of Tulsa, Okla.; and six grandchildren.
