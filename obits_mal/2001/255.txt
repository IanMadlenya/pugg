        H. Gordon Skilling, a Canadian expert on Czechoslovakia who aided and encouraged dissidents there when it was a Communist state, died on March 2 at his home in Toronto. He was 89.
        Dr. Skilling, a political scientist, retired in 1982 from the faculty of the University of Toronto.
        Mark Kramer, a scholar of East European history and politics who directs the cold war studies program at Harvard, said Dr. Skilling had repeatedly visited Czechoslovakia, beginning in 1937.
        Dr. Kramer said Dr. Skilling supported important dissidents, including the writer Vaclav Havel, who became president after the downfall of Communism in 1989.
        Dr. Skilling smuggled Western newspapers, journals and books into Czechoslovakia that encouraged dissidents.
        Among the books was his ''Charter 77 and Human Rights in Czechoslovakia'' (1981), a positive overview of the human rights and political reform movements.
        Charter 77 was a movement of Czechoslovak dissidents and intellectuals who came together to sign a petition that called on the government to honor basic human rights and freedoms. Mr. Havel was among its leaders. The signing began in 1977, and signers were persecuted.
        Dr. Skilling's other books include ''Czechoslovakia's Interrupted Revolution'' (1976), about the brief democratization in 1968 and its consequences.
        He was born in Toronto. Dr. Skilling received degrees from the universities of Toronto and London and Oxford.
        His wife, Sara, died in 1990. He is survived by two sons, David, of Victoria, British Columbia, and Peter, of Bangkok.
