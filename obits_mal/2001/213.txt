        H. Harding Isaacson, a longtime fixture at Manhattan debutante balls, sometimes as the announcer who introduced the debutantes to society, died on Feb. 26 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his stepdaughter, Christine Krais Schott of Manhattan.
        Mr. Isaacson had his own public relations firm and was also employed for years at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, where he directed some celebrities' funerals.
        A native New Yorker, he grew up in Sayville, N.Y.
        His first and second wives, the former Barbara Todd and the former Mary-Ann Boyer, died.
        Besides his stepdaughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Janet McCarthy Conner Krais, and a brother, Rousseau Isaacson of Rockville Centre, N.Y.
