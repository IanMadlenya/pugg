        Wells C. Klein, a longtime advocate for the rights of immigrants and refugees wanting to settle in the United States, died April 5 at his home in Stowe, Vt. He was 74.
        Mr. Klein had spent most of his life reorganizing and reinvigorating  groups set up to help refugees and immigrants. He also fought for stronger legislation to protect them.
        In 1975 he took over the American Council for Nationalities Service, a largely moribund organization that had originally assisted refugees from Eastern Europe. He turned it into a major resettlement agency, which helped many of the 130,000 Southeast Asian refugees in the United States after the Vietnam War.
        In 1981 he revived another almost inactive body, the U.S. Committee for Refugees, and absorbed it into the American Council's structure. The committee now publishes an annual World Refugee Survey. The American Council became the Immigration and Refugee Services of America.
        He worked with Congress on the Refugee Act of 1980, which for the first time codified the definition of a refugee. In the early 1980's, Mr. Klein helped establish the National Immigration Forum, an organization promoting the rights of immigrants and refugees.
        Born in New Haven, Mr. Klein served in the Navy during World War II and then attended Sarah Lawrence College and Cornell University, where he studied anthropology. He began his career with refugees working for CARE.
        Mr. Klein, who never married, is survived by his brother, Malcolm, of Los Angeles, and his nieces, Laurie Klein of Northboro, Mass., and Leigh Vanderklein of Montclair, N.J. A memorial service will be held July 12 in Washington.
