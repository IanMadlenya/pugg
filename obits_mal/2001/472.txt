        Stanley L. Neisloss, a major home builder on Long Island, died on Sunday at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Brookville, N.Y.
        He died of causes related to Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        In a career that spanned more than half a century, he built thousands of single-family houses and rental apartments on the Island and was among the top three rental builders there, according to the Long Island Builders Association.
        He was born in Brooklyn on May 29, 1922, and got his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College in 1943. He was a navigator in World War II, flying more than 50 bomber missions into Germany.
        His father, Harry Neisloss, who died in 1971, was also a builder of garden apartments, mostly in Queens. In 1950, he and a partner, Donald G. Partrick, founded Heatherwood Properties, now based in Islandia, N.Y., first building single-family houses and later rental apartments and office space. Martin Monas joined the company in 1963 as a partner and counsel.
        Heatherwood's first project was a 50-house subdivision in Syosset, where two-bedroom ranch houses, many bought by World War II veterans, sold for $7,950. They required only a $500 down payment and included all appliances and wall-to-wall carpeting.
        The company built more than 5,000 houses until 1972, concentrating thereafter on rental development. To date it has built almost 4,500 rental apartments, mostly in Suffolk County, along with about 350,000 square feet of commercial space.
        Heatherwood always kept ownership and management of its rental complexes, the first of which, the 272-unit Heatherwood House in Port Jefferson, was built in 1962. The most recent, the 360-unit Spruce Pond in Holbrook, was completed in 1999.
        Mr. Neisloss's son, James, also became a residential developer, going into partnership in 1993 with Mr. Partrick's son, Douglas. Their company, Meadowood Properties, is also in Islandia.
        In addition to James, Mr. Neisloss's survivors include his wife of 53 years, Irma; two daughters, Susan Neisloss of Santa Monica, Calif., and Kathy Leventhal of Tenafly N.J.; his brother Melvin, of Westport, Conn.; and seven grandchildren.
