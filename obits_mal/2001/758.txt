        Dr. Edward Victor Zegarelli, a retired Columbia University dean and oral pathologist who cataloged and documented the more than 400 known diseases of the mouth and jaw, died on Sunday at his home in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. He was 88.
        Dr. Zegarelli served more than 40 years on the faculty of the Columbia School of Dental and Oral Surgery. As director of the division of stomatology from 1958 to 1977, he began to identify and systematically describe those illnesses and correlate them with microscopic findings.
        Broadening his research, he developed therapies to treat some of the diseases he described and taught his findings to generations of students.
        Dr. Zegarelli wrote four textbooks in the 1960's for his field. He also contributed to books on the thyroid, diagnostic X-rays and cancer of the head and neck, as well as 750 articles in professional journals.
        A native of Utica, N.Y., Dr. Zegarelli graduated from Columbia in 1934. When he received his degree in dental surgery at the School of Dental and Oral Surgery in 1937, he was  asked to join the faculty as an assistant. He rose to full professor by 1957. He served as dean from 1974 until his retirement in 1978. In the 1970's, he also directed the dental service at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
        He was a former president of the New York Board of Dental Examiners and a founder and former chairman of the North East Regional Board of Dental Examiners. The board provided for newly graduated dentists to receive licenses valid in more than 30 states, and Dr. Zegarelli contributed the written part of its exam.
        He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Irene Ceconi Zegarelli; four sons, Edward Jr., of Keuka Park, N.Y., Dr. David J., of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., Philip E., the mayor of the Village of Sleepy Hollow, and Dr. Peter J., of Pocantico Hills, N.Y.; two sisters, Lillian Stivali and Anne LaPorte of Utica; and 11 grandchildren.
