        Robert Z. Rosenthal, the former president of Martin's, a family-owned chain of women's apparel stores in Brooklyn, Long Island and New Jersey, died on Saturday at a hospital in Sarasota, Fla. He was 87 and moved to Sarasota from Sands Point, N.Y., in 1986.
        He was president of the apparel chain from 1972, when it had five stores, to 1978, when it had six.
        The chain was owned by the Zeitz family, of which he was a third-generation member. It was bought by the Seedman Merchandising Group in 1977, and after some years the stores ceased operating under the Martin's name.
        He was president of the Metropolitan New York Retail Merchants Association from 1975 to 1978 and a director of the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        Robert Zeitz Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from Poly Prep, a college preparatory school there, and from Cornell University. He served in the Pacific during World War II as a lieutenant in the Navy.
        His wife, Ruth, died before him.
        He is survived by two sons, Joseph, of Great Neck, N.Y., and Dr. Robert, of Dallas; and two grandsons.
