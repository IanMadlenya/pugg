        Francis Bebey, a composer, writer and performer who was an authority on African traditional music, died on May 28 in Paris. He was 72.
        Mr. Bebey was the author of ''African Music: A People's Art'' (1975), a survey of Africa's varied musical heritage as well as a discography and a collection of photographs of African musicians and their often exotic instruments. His published work also included ''The Ashanti Doll'' (1977), a novel set in Ghana.
        Born in Douala, Cameroon, in 1929, Mr. Bebey studied in the United States and France and settled in Paris, where he worked for Unesco and eventually became head of the agency's music division before retiring in 1974 to concentrate on writing and composition.
        He wrote music for a variety of instruments, ranging from classical guitar to the Pygmy flute, and recorded a number of his own compositions, often performing with his son Toups.
        His music also blended African rhythms with musical forms from around the world.
        In addition to Toups, he is survived by another son, Patrick, and a daughter, Kiddy.
