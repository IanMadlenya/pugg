        Elijah Masinde, the leader of western Kenya's Dini ya Musambwa sect and an opponent of colonial and independent Kenyan governments, died Monday. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Masinde, who regarded himself as a prophet, founded his fundamentalist sect in 1942 as a direct challenge to the authorities. He urged his followers to destroy their identity cards and not pay taxes. He spent much of his life in prison as a result of his activities.
