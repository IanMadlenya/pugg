        Ministry officials did not disclose the cause of death.
        Mr. Lardinois, a member of the former Roman Catholic People's Party, was Agriculture Minister in three consecutive Dutch Governments from 1967 to 1972 before joining the Brussels-based European Commission, the Community's executive body.
        Even before his four-year stint there, he warned against the rapidly growing surpluses of agricultural produce in Common Market nations. He was also an early proponent of a uniform currency system in Western Europe.
        In 1977, Mr. Lardinois joined Rabobank, a major Dutch bank. He retired as chairman last year.
