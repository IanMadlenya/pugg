        Hayden Rorke, a stage, screen and television actor whose career spanned six decades, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Toluca Lake, Calif. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Rorke appeared in 53 movies, including ''Pillow Talk,'' ''An American in Paris'' and ''The Nightwalker,'' in which he had the title role.
        Born in New York, Mr. Rorke attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared in 70 Broadway productions, including ''The Country Wife,'' ''The Philadelphia Story,'' ''The Iceman Cometh'' and ''A Moon for the Misbegotten.''
        He was perhaps best known, however, for his television role as Dr. Alfred Bellows, the space agency psychiatrist and antagonist of the astronaut played by Larry Hagman on ''I Dream of Jeannie,'' which ran from 1965 to 1970 on NBC.
        Mr. Rorke also made some 400 guest appearances in such TV series as ''I Love Lucy,'' ''The Loretta Young Show,'' ''Dr. Kildare,'' ''Bonanza,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''Barnaby Jones.''
        He is survived by two brothers.
