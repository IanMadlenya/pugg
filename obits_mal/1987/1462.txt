        Joseph Lumsden, chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie tribe of Chippewa Indians and a key figure in a landmark settlement of disputed Indian fishing rights, died in War Memorial Hospital here Sunday after a long illness, a tribal spokesman said, He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Lumsden was chairman of the 15,000-member tribe since 1976, when it gained tribal status, and was president of its predecessor group, Original Bands of Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa Indians, since 1973.
        He was one of the chief negotiators of a 1985 Federal court agreement in a 16-year-old dispute between commercial Indian fishermen and sports anglers. The agreement regulated where and when commercial fishing could take place in three of the Great Lakes: Huron, Michigan and Superior.
        Mr. Lumsden is survived by his wife, Susie, and four children.
