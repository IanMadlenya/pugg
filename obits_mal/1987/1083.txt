        Henry U. Harris, the retired chairman of Harris Upham & Company, a major Wall Street brokerage, died Thursday at his home in Glen Head, L.I., after a long illness. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Harris retired in 1976 from the firm - founded by his father, John F. Harris - when it merged with Smith Barney & Company. The merged firm, Smith Barney Harris Upham & Company, is being acquired by the Primerica Corporation.
        Mr. Harris was born in Chicago and graduated from Harvard College in 1923. He became a partner in Harris Upham & Company in 1929 after several years at a predecessor firm, Harris Winthrop & Company.
        He served for many years on the board of governors of the New York and the American Stock Exchanges and was a former director of Texaco, Southern Pacific, Stone & Webster and Chemical Bank, among other companies.
        In the early 1950's, he brought together a group that raised funds to build Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, Calif., and he was at one time chairman of the attraction.
        He had been a president and trustee of the Fay School and a trustee of St. Mark's School, both in Southborough, Mass., and a trustee of the Community Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, Henry Jr., of Glen Head, and David, of Greenwich, Conn.; three daughters, Joan Hawkey, of Brookville, L.I., Evelyn Van Ingen of Glen Cove, and Mary Ann Livens of Boston; 15 grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
