        Jacques A. Francois, the civilian member of the three-man National Governing Council, died today. He was 78 years old.
        Anaise Chavenet of the Ministry of Information said Mr. Francois had been hospitalized for several weeks earlier this year. Since January, he had not been present at the junta's rare public appearances. He was considered a civilian figurehead in the junta, which is controlled by Lieut. Gen. Henri Namphy and Gen. Williams Regala.
        Mr. Francois was a member of the provisional government that took over after Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to France on Feb. 7, 1986. In March 1986, he was replaced as Foreign Minister by Col. Jean-Baptiste Hilaire and appointed member of the junta.
        Mr. Francois served during the administration of President Paul Magloire from 1950 to 1956, as Minister of the Presidency and as ambassador to several countries, including Cuba.
        After Francois Duvalier came to power in 1957, Mr. Francois returned to his native Cap-Haitien, where he taught law.
