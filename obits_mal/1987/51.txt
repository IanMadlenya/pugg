       Dale Mitchell, the former outfielder who spent almost all of his major league career with the Cleveland Indians but is perhaps best remembered for making the final out in Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, died today of a heart attack. He was 65 years old.
        Dale Mitchell, the former outfielder who spent almost all of his major league career with the Cleveland Indians but is perhaps best remembered for making the final out in Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, died today of a heart attack. He was 65 years old.
        Mitchell batted .312 over 11 big league seasons, playing with the Indians in all but 19 of the 1,127 regular-season games he appeared in. He led the American League in hits and triples in 1949, and batted .300 or better six times between 1947 and 1953.
        He struck out only 120 times in more than 4,000 major league times at bat.
        One of those strikeouts came in the fifth game of the 1956 Series between the New York Yankees and Brooklyn Dodgers. Mitchell, pinch-hitting for the Dodger pitcher, Sal Maglie, took a called third strike to end the only perfect game in Series history. In his final time at bat as a major-leaguer, Mitchell grounded out as a pinch-hitter in the seventh game of the Series, which the Yankees won.
        He played with Cleveland from the end of the 1946 season through mid-1956, when he was traded to the Dodgers.
        Mitchell is survived by his wife, Helen June, two daughters and three sons.
