        Harvey Goldberg, a historian and political advocate, died of cancer Wednesday in Madison, Wis. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Goldberg, who lived in Madison, was born in Orange, N.J., and received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of Wisconsin. While specializing in European social history and advocating leftist causes, he taught at Oberlin College from 1948 to 1951, at Ohio State University from 1951 to 1963 and at the University of Wisconsin from 1963 until illness forced his hospitalization this year.
        In 1957 he edited an anthology, ''American Radicals,'' and in 1962 he was the author of ''The Life of Jean Jaures,'' which traced the intellectual development of the French socialist leader.
        He is survived by a sister, Ruth Gorrin, of Union, N.J., and a nephew, Eugene Gorrin of Edison, N.J.
