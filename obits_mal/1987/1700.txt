Mr. Phillips had pneumonia when he died.  Born in Chicago, Mr. Phillips received a bachelor's degree in early childhood education from the City College of New York and studied dance for 13 years with Thelma Hill, a noted New York modern dance teacher. He was a counselor at the Bronx Psychiatric Children's Hospital, and earlier worked as a dance therapist at Our Children's Center in Brooklyn. In 1977 Mr. Phillips organized a tribute to the late Ms. Hill, out of which grew the Peforming Arts Center, which served chiefly as a producer of black dance and music programs.
        Mr. Phillips is survived by his mother, Novella, his brothers Lionel, Edward and James, and his sisters Ann Garette, Darlene Lewis, Carolyn Phillips, Benetta Phillips and Caroleta Phillips, all of Chicago.
        Funeral services are at 11 A.M. today at the Redding Funeral Home, 325 West 14th Street, in Manhattan.
