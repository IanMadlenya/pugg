        Mr. Herwitz, a graduate of Dartmouth College and Brooklyn Law School, entered public service in 1932 as an investigator for the Seabury Commission on corruption in city government and was an assistant district attorney from 1935 to 1942.
        He was appointed assistant Corporation Counsel in 1951 and prosecuted police officers implicated by Harry Gross, the convicted king of New York bookmakers. He left that office in 1955 to establish his own practice.
        Last January, the state bar association honored Mr. Herwitz with its annual 50-Year Lawyer Award. He was a founder of the Lexington Democratic Club and, over the years, held positions in the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the Park Avenue Synagogue and the Metropolitan Council of the United Synagogue of America, of which he was a past president.
        Mr. Herwitz is survived by his wife, the former Harriet Hershfield; a daughter, Ellen H. Pollack of Nashville; a brother, Oren, of Manhattan; a sister, Edith Sapiro of Weston, Conn., and three grandchildren.
