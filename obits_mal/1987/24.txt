        Joseph Hirkala, a New Jersey State Senator since 1972, died Thursday, apparently of a heart attack, in his hometown of Passaic. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Hirkala, a Democrat, had just left a party in honor of the city clerk of Passaic when he was stricken while sitting in his parked car.
        Mr. Hirkala had served in city government for 37 years, 9 of them as city clerk, before stepping down last year.
        He was elected to the New Jersey Assembly in 1968, and served there for four years before winning election to the Senate in 1972.
        In the Senate, Mr. Hirkala served as assistant minority leader, majority whip, assistant majority leader and president pro tempore.
        Born in Passaic, Mr. Hirkala attended public schools there, before joining the Navy at 17. He was discharged in 1945.
        Before his entry into state politics, Mr. Hirkala served as city clerk, assistant tax assessor and registrar of vital statistics in Passaic.
        Senator Carmen Orechio, Democrat of Nutley, said that Mr. Hirkala, the father of two retarded children, ''championed the cause of the handicapped'' and was ''concerned for the urban poor, children and the elderly.''
        He is survived by his wife, Josephine; a daughter, Karen, and a son, Robert, both of Passaic.
