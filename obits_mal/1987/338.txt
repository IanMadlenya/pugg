        Warne M. Marsh, a tenor jazz saxophonist who toured with the Lennie Tristano band and was known for his improvisations, died of an apparent heart attack Friday after collapsing in a performance. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Marsh, whose cool tones were heard on many jazz recordings, was improvising a chorus of ''Out of Nowhere'' at Donte's Jazz Club in North Hollywood when he ''just slipped off his stool'' and collapsed, said Ross Tomkins, the pianist who was leading a quartet at the time.
        Mr. Marsh had recently returned to the Los Angeles area after a long stay in New York and was planning to open a club here, friends said.
        The son of a cinematographer, Mr. Marsh played as a youth with the old Hollywood Canteen Kids and played behind Hoagy Carmichael on radio.
        He joined the Army in 1946 and met Mr. Tristano, with whom he studied and played. He made some legendary free jazz recordings with Lee Konitz and Billy Bauer for Capitol Records in 1949.
        Mr. Marsh toured and recorded with Mr. Tristano and Mr. Konitz, and in 1953 he was the saxophone soloist on the Metronome All Stars's recording of ''How High the Moon.''
        He and his wife, Geraldine, lived in New York and the Los Angeles area while raising their two sons. Mr. Marsh and his wife had separated when he returned to Los Angeles last year.
