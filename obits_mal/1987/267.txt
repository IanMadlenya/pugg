        Mr. Byington, a career Foreign Service officer, was the deputy chief of the United States Mission in Rome from 1948 to 1950, director of the State Department's Office of Western European Affairs from 1950 to 1954 and deputy chief of the United States Mission in Madrid from 1954 to 1957.
        He was awarded a Medal of Freedom in 1946 for service as a deputy political adviser at the Allied Forces Headquarters for the Mediterranean in Caserta, Italy. In World War II, he was acting chief of the press relations division of the State Department.
        The diplomat continued a three-generation family tradition in Naples, where he was born, when his great-grandfather Homer was completing a term as the American Vice Consul. His father, Homer, held the same post from 1920 to 1929, and he was the Consul General there from 1963 until he retired in 1973.
        He was an alumnus of Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and of Yale College.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jane McHarg; a son, Homer M. 3d, of Brooklyn Heights; two sisters, Jean Grant, of Fripp Island, S.C., and Janice Hinkle, of New Canaan, Conn.; two brothers, James, of Bay St. Louis, Miss., and Ward, of Norfolk, Va.; and two grandchildren.
