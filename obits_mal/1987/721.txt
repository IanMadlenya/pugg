        Johan Otto von Spreckelsen, the Danish architect who designed a 24-story arch in a business and residential complex, La Defense, outside Paris, died Wednesday in a Copenhagen hospital. He was 57 years old.  The cause of death was withheld at the request of the family.
        President Francois Mitterrand of France, in a telegram to the family, called Mr. von Spreckelsen ''one of the greatest architects of our time.'' Mr. Mitterrand continued, ''He offered to Paris and all of France his most beautiful work: the arch at the head of La Defense.''
        La Defense is a vast, ultra-modern office and residential complex on the western edge of Paris. Mr. von Spreckelsen's design was chosen in 1983 from among 424 entries. The architect referred to the arch, which is still under construction, as the ''window on the world.''
        Mr. von Spreckelsen left the project last year after disagreements with the French architects working on La Defense. The arch is to be completed by 1989, the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
        Mr. von Spreckelsen was best known in Denmark for his churches in Esbjerg, Farum, Hvidovre and Vangede. Starting in 1978, he taught at the architecture school at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts.
        ''He was very quiet about his private life,'' said one of the teachers at the architecture school, Karin Skovsboell, ''but when it came to his artistic and architectural ideas, he was ardent and enthusiastic, and would never dream of compromising.''
        He is survived by his wife and four children.
