        Dr. Henry B. Makover, a physician and educator who helped plan the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, died of prostate cancer Wednesday at University Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Dr. Makover, who was clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry of Albert Einstein, was one of a group who helped in the college's formation, drawing up the blueprint for affiliating the college and the nearby Bronx Municipal Hospital. The college began in 1955.
        Dr. Makover, who was born in Baltimore, studied at Johns Hopkins University, receiving his medical degree there in 1933. Over the years, his medical career included internal medicine, public health and psychiatry.
        He maintained a practice in internal medicine in Baltimore until 1942, then served four years in the United States Public Health Service, where he helped to develop a medical-care program for migrant farm workers.
        He was then, in turn, associate medical director of Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, a consultant to the Federation of Jewish Charities of Philadelphia and medical director of the Central Manhattan Group of Health Insurance Plans of Greater New York.
        After helping in the formation of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he joined the college faculty. He was initially professor of preventive and environmental medicine and then, from 1968 to 1978, clinical professor of psychiatry.
        He also maintained a private practice of psychiatry in Mamaroneck.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred; two sons, Dr. Richard B., of New London, Conn., and Dr. Michael E., of Great Neck, L.I., and three grandchildren.
