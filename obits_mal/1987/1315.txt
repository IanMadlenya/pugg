        Giles A. Wanamaker, former president and chief operating officer of the Hertz Corporation, died Sunday in Punta Gorda, Fla., where he had lived for the past 14 years. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Wanamaker was elected president of Hertz in 1962, after serving as executive vice president and a director of the vehicle renting and leasing concern.
        A native of New York, Mr. Wanamaker was born Aug. 29, 1907. He began his long career in the vehicle renting and leasing industry in the 1930s. He joined Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing, in 1938.
        After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II as a lieutenant colonel, he rejoined Metropolitan Distributors in 1946. A year later, he founded Rentways Inc., a New York truck leasing company, serving as its president.
        When both his concern and Metropolitan Distributors were acquired by Hertz in 1954, Mr. Wanamaker was named a vice president of Hertz. In 1960, he was elected vice president for administration, and in May 1961, was elected executive vice president and a director. He retired in 1967.
        While a resident of Punta Gorda, he served as director of the First Florida Bank. Before moving to Florida, he was a resident of Manhattan, where he served as president of the West Side Association of Commerce.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Eller of Warrensburg, Mo.; two sons, Giles A. Jr., of Skaneateles, N.Y., and Roger D., of Darien, Conn., and four grandchildren.
