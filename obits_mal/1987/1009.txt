        Ed Davis, the tribal elder and ''spiritual leader'' of the Snoqualmie Indians, died Wednesday. He was 108 years old.
        Mr. Davis was born with the name Sulz-ached and outlived three wives and five children, according to his second cousin, Mary Anne Hinzman.
        She said that when he was a young boy Mr. Davis worked in the forests, helping loggers for 25 cents a day. He continued to work in various logging jobs until he was 83.
        Mr. Davis was a leader in an effort by the Snoqualmie tribe to regain recognition from the Federal Government after being stripped of its tribal status in 1956. The effort is still pending.
        ''This was always in the back of his mind, to get back our land,'' Ms. Hinzman said. ''He wanted a place for our people to go.''
        ''He had always said he wanted to hang in there and wait for recognition and for other rights,'' said Karen Boney, a member of the Snoqualmie Tribal Council. ''He was our conscience and our spiritual leader.''
