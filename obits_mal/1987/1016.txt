        Baron Leon Lambert, a banker and art collector, died last Thursday at Erasmus Hospital in Brussels. He was 58 years old.
        Baron Lambert went into cardiac arrest 10 days ago and lapsed into a coma from which he never emerged, according to officials of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the Wall Street investment firm in which he had an interest.
        He was the great-grandson of Baron James de Rothschild and the great-great-grandson of Samuel Lambert, who established the family-owned Banque Lambert in 1840. It merged with Banque de Bruxelles in 1974, forming Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's largest banks.
        His connection with Drexel Burnham began in the 1970's. Baron Lambert invested in William D. Witter, a Wall Street research company. In 1976, the Drexel Burnham Group merged with Baron Lambert's holding company, Lambert Brussels Witter, to create the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group.
        Millions of dollars in art from his extensive collection - impressionist, modern and postwar paintings, prints and sculptures - have been scheduled for sale by Christie's, the New York art auctioneer. The art is from several floors of the bank's office building in Brussels and from the baron's apartment above the banking floors.
        Baron Lambert, who was born in Belgium, attended Yale and Oxford as well as the University of Geneva.
        He is survived by a brother, Phillippe, of Geneva, and a sister, Lucy of Brussels.
