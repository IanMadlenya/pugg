        Former Federal District Judge Noel P. Fox, whose career included a controversial ruling allowing Indian tribes to fish commercially in the Great Lakes without Government interference, died Wednesday at the Villa Elizabeth Nursing Home, where he had lived since February 1986, Mary Ann Greenhoe, director of nursing, said today. He was 76 years old.
        Judge Fox was appointed in 1962 by President Kennedy and retired in 1985.
        He drew fire from fishing enthusiasts in 1979 when he ruled that two 19th-century treaties between three northern Michigan Indian tribes and the Federal Government permitted members of the tribes to fish commercially in parts of lakes Huron and Michigan.
        His rulings also included desegregation plans for the Kalamazoo, Benton Harbor and Lansing school districts of Michigan, and decisions that the state's strict meat-labeling laws were constitutional but that grooming codes for high school students were not.
        He attended Marquette University and graduated at the top of his class at Marquette University Law School. Before becoming a Federal judge, he served as assistant prosecutor for Muskegon County and as a circuit court judge. He also served in the Navy during World War II, said his lifelong friend Harry Knudsen.
        Judge Fox is survived by his daughter, two brothers and two sisters.
