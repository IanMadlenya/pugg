        Hamilton S. Gregg, an investment executive, died of a heart attack Thursday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan and Falls Village, Conn.
        Mr. Gregg was chairman and owner of the Hamilton Gregg Capital Corporation, a broad-based financial enterprise, which for a time, operated out of a quaint Victorian building on the main street of Falls Village.
        The international investment and securities concern, with branches in London and New York, moved its headquarters from Wall Street as part of what Mr. Gregg saw as a way to avoid pressure and to take advantage of a larger economic trend: the use of technology in the decentralization of business activity.
        The headquarters returned to New York City two years ago, when Mr. Gregg became homesick.
        Mr. Gregg was born in Denver and graduated from St. Mark's School and the University of Pennsylvania. He was a trustee of Malcolm Gordon School in Garrison, N.Y., and a member of the University Club and the Squadron A Association.
        From 1943 to 1946 he served as a lieutenant in the Army Air Corps.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carolyn Breckenridge; his mother, Alma Gregg of Manhattan; a son, Hamilton 3d, of Ojai, Calif.; three daughters, Leslie, of Charlottesville, Va., Camron, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Kimberley, of Falls Village.
