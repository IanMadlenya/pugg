        Louis R. Lowery, a retired Marine Corps photographer, died last Wednesday after contracting aplastic anemia. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Lowery was a Marine Corps sergeant who photographed the first flag-raising on Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima Feb. 23, 1945, but the first flag was too small to be seen by troops elsewhere on the island.
        A second, larger flag was raised five hours later. Joe Rosenthal, a photographer for The Associated Press, won a Pulitzer Prize for his picture of that event.
        Mr. Lowery was a founder and past president of the Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association and retired in 1983 as photographic director of Leatherneck magazine, a Marine Corps publication.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a son; a daughter; a sister, and a grandchild.
