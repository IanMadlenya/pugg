        George Garvy, a former vice president and senior adviser of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, died Tuesday at his home in Manhasset, L.I., after a long illness. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Garvy, an economist, was an authority on monetary policy. In 1969, he wrote a report, with Martin R. Blyn, that sought to discredit the economist Milton Friedman's theory that changes in the supply of money are a key determinant of economic change.
        The son of two revolutionaries in Riga, now part of the Soviet Union, Mr. Garvy received his secondary education in Berlin and earned degrees at the Sorbonne and the Institute of Statistics in Paris.
        At the outbreak of World War II, he joined the French Army. After the war, he moved to the United States and in 1951 received a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University.
        Mr. Garvy was appointed as an officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1953 and became a vice president and senior adviser in 1974. He also taught at New York University, Columbia and the School of Business at Stanford University.
        Survivors include his wife, Juliette, of Manhasset; a daughter, Helen, of Santa Cruz, Calif., and a sister, Sylvia Gourevitch of San Diego.
