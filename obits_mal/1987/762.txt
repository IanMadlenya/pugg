        Archie M. Gubbrud, who doubled state aid to education in his tenure as Governor of South Dakota from 1961 to 1965, died of lung cancer Sunday at McKennan Hospital here. He was 76 years old.
        ''He was kind of a people's Governor,'' said former Gov. Frank Farrar, who was Mr. Gubbrud's Attorney General, ''He was a farmer and related to the farm situation and farm problems.''
        Mr. Gubbrud, a Republican, served as a state legislator from 1950 to 1960 and was the Speaker of the State House in 1959. He also headed the state Farmers Home Administration for eight years.
        He said in a 1965 interview that he was proud that his administration had added services without dipping into voters' pocketbooks. Mr. Gubbrud considered state aid to education one of his major accomplishments. The state budget office and Custer State Hospital were started through Mr. Gubbrud's recommendations.
        In 1968 he ran unsuccessfully against Senator George McGovern, a Democrat, who won a second term.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, of Alcester, S.D., and two children, John and Maxine, both of Sioux Falls, S.D.
