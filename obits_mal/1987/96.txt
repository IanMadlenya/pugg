        Mr. Golubov was born in Kiev, Russia, and came to the United States at the age of 12. When he was 14 he first studied at an art class under John Sloan. He apprenticed himself to a commercial studio and for years had supported himself as a commercial artist.
        In 1981 a retrospective show of 102 oils and gouaches painted by Mr. Golubov from 1925 to 1980, mounted by the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, N.C., was also shown in other cities, including New York, where it was seen at the Jewish Museum.
        An exhibition of his works is currently on view at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery in Manhattan. It consists of 17 works on paper and both figurative and abstract paintings.
        He is survived by his wife, Esther, a son, Michael, and two sisters, Betty Rosenberg and Rose Levine.
