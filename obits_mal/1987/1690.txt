        Father Halligan entered the Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, N.Y., in 1947, after having spent three years in the Navy and five months as a New York City police officer. He was assigned to Peru immediately after his ordination in 1953.
        For 20 years, he worked among the Aymaras, an Indian tribe in the Peruvian altiplano. In 1974, he moved to Lima, where he worked at the Latin America Press, an ecumenical news service.
        He was born and reared in the Bronx, and attended Xavier High School and Fordham University before entering the Navy.
        Father Halligan is survived by a brother, the Rev. John J. Halligan, a Jesuit missionary in Quito, Ecuador; and four sisters, Theresa Pepper of Ridgefield Park, N.J., Patricia Walsh of Wollaston, Mass., and Sister Mary Rose Halligan and Sister Kathleen Halligan, both of the Sisters of Notre Dame, who live in Columbia, S.C.
