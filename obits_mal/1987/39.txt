        Samuel G. Fuqua, who received in the Medal of Honor for heroism at Pearl Harbor and whose story of that day helped build the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial there, died Tuesday. He was 87 years old. Mr. Fuqua, who retired from the Navy in 1953, was a lieutenant commander aboard the battleship Arizona when Japan's planes attacked on Dec. 7, 1941. He was knocked unconscious in the bombardment but recovered and directed rescue operations.
        After Mr. Fuqua's appearance on the show, ''This Is Your Life,'' in 1958, the host, Ralph Edwards, appealed to viewers to send contributions for a memorial honoring those who died on the Arizona. The U.S.S. Arizona Memorial opened in 1962 with the sunken battleship designated a national cemetery.
