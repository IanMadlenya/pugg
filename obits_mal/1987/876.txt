        Nicholas M. Acquavella, a leading art dealer in Manhattan for a half-century and the founder of the Acquavella Galleries, died Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was 88 years old.
        Under Mr. Acquavella's leadership, the Acquavella Galleries in New York introduced many leading American museums and collectors to Italian Renaissance and Baroque painting, and later to 19th- and 20th-century European masters.
        A native of Naples, Mr. Acquavella came to the United States in 1919, and began a private trade in Italian paintings. He opened his first gallery at 598 Madison Avenue in 1921, specializing in Italian works.
        In 1967, the gallery moved to its present location at 18 East 79th Street, and since 1968 it has been run by Mr. Acquavella's son, William.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Acquavella is survived by his wife, Edythe, and three grandchildren.
