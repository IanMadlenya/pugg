        Leo Polk, the most prolific blood donor on record in the United States, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 79.
        Mr. Polk, who kept detailed records of his many trips to blood banks, donated 320 pints of blood over nearly 60 years. He first gave blood in 1928 and last donated a pint at the dedication of the Broward Community Blood Center in 1983.
        The American Association of Blood Donors could find no one who had donated more blood, said Rita Cohl of the Broward Community Blood Center.
        Mr. Polk, a former A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive from Detroit, retired to south Florida in 1974.
