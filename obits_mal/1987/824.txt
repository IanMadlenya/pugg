        C. F. Louis DeWild, for many years a leading professional in the field of painting conservation and the restorer of great paintings that are now in the Metropolitan Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Frick Collection and elsewhere, died at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center on April 2. He was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Born in The Hague in May 1900, Mr. DeWild was the son and nephew of eminent picture restorers. Trained by his father, Carel DeWild, he was active in New York as an independent conservator from 1929 until his retirement 30 years later. At a time when many great paintings were leaving Europe and coming to the United States, he was entrusted with the restoration of masterpieces by Piero della Francesca, Raphael (the ''Alba Madonna''), Rembrandt, Frans Hals and others.
        Prof. Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University said yesterday that ''Louis DeWild was an outstanding picture conservator and a man of self-effacing modesty who contributed immensely to the preservation of many great works of art in this country.''
        Mr. DeWild left no survivors. His wife, the former Marie Wallberg, died in 1954.
