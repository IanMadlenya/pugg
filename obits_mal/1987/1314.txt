        Karl Slotta, a biochemist whose work in the 1930s helped research that led to the development of birth control pills, died Friday at Doctor's Hospital here. He was 92 years old.
        Dr. Slotta discovered the female hormone progesterone, which is released after ovulation. Studies on progesterone, which Dr. Slotta found sends chemical signals to the brain that prevent ovulation, eventually led to the development of the pill in the 1950s.
        A native of Breslau, Germany, Dr. Slotta began his hormone research at the Chemical Institute there. Shortly after he identified progesterone in 1935, he fled Nazi Germany for Brazil with his wife and daughter.
        He studied snake venom in Brazil, and in the 1950s moved to Miami, where he unsuccessfully looked for a polio cure using venom.
