        Zevulon Avshalomov, a composer and performer of traditional Persian and Caucasian music, died on April 4. He was 77 years old and lived in New York City.
        Mr. Avshalomov was born in the Caucasus and graduated from the Conservatory of Music in Baku, in Soviet Azerbaijan on the Caspian Sea. He moved to Iran in 1937 and later to Israel, where he regularly appeared at the Olam Khan Theater in Jerusalem and on the radio.
        He came to New York in 1969, where he played regularly in concert halls and at the Alternative Museum. ''Mr. Avshalomov plays the kemenche, a bowed lute that was originally a Persian classical instrument but, as played in the Caucasus, retains something of the lonely whine of Mongolian bowed lutes as well,'' Robert Palmer wrote in The New York Times after a concert in 1982 by Mr. Avshalomov's group, Kavkazi. ''He is also a stirring singer in the declamatory mountain style.''
        He is survived by three sons, Joshua, Shimon and Zion, and a daughter, Sarah.
