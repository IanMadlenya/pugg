        Sir Melford Stevenson, an outspoken judge who as a lawyer defended the last woman to be hanged in Britain, died of a heart attack Saturday. He was 85 years old.
        Sir Melford became a barrister in 1925 and was a judge from 1957 to 1979, when he retired.
        As a lawyer his best-known client was Ruth Ellis, who was hanged at 28 in 1955 for shooting David Blakely, the lover who rejected her.
        National outrage at the execution led to the outlawing of hanging in 1964 and the abolition of capital punishment in 1969.
        Sir Melford represented the British Government in Kenya at the nationalist leader Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal in 1954 of his conviction for involvement in Mau Mau activities.
        The judge incurred the wrath of academics, lawmakers and churchmen in 1970 by giving long sentences to Cambridge University students who had taken part in violent demonstrations against the military Government in Greece.
        As a judge, Sir Melford had a reputation for being a stern upholder of the law, but he showed leniency and compassion to defendants whom he believed to be the victims of circumstances.
        He was married twice and had three children.
