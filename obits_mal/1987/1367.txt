        David Martin, a bass guitarist for the 1960's rock group Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, died of a heart attack Monday. He was 50 years old.
        Mr. Martin co-wrote the group's No. 1 hit ''Wooly Bully.'' That song earned a gold record, as did ''Lil' Red Riding Hood.'' After leaving the group in 1966 over management conflicts, Mr. Martin returned to Dallas and began a television and video repair store.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean, of Garland, Tex.; a daughter; two brothers, and a sister.
