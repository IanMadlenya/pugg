        Victor Mollo, one of the world's leading writers on contract bridge, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in London. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Mollo wrote 30 books on the game, several of which are considered among the funniest books ever written about bridge.
        Mr. Mollo was born into a wealthy Russian family in St. Petersburg in 1909. During the political turmoil in 1917 the family fled the country in dramatic circumstances that included a transcontinental journey in a train that they had bought.
        The family settled in England where he attended the London School of Economics. He became a journalist and worked as an editor at the British Broadcasting Corporation in its European Service.
        When he retired in 1969, he concentrated on his writing career. He became famous for a series of books featuring the Hideous Hog, the Rueful Rabbit, and other denizens of an imaginary club, the Griffins. The series included ''Bridge in the Menagerie,'' ''Bridge in the Fourth Dimension'' and ''Masters and Monsters.''
        As a player Mr. Mollo won several major English titles, but he preferred rubber bridge for a money stake to the tournament game. For nearly 50 years, his typical day consisted of playing bridge in the afternoon at his club, working through the night, and sleeping in the morning.
        He is survived by his wife, Jeanne.
