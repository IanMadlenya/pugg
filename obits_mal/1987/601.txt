        Mr. Lowe, a Federal lawyer from 1971 to 1978, was one of the prosecutors of two former Nixon Administration officials, John N.

        He was born in Paterson, N.J., and was a graduate of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., and the Cornell University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rose Farrell; two daughters, Theresa and Katherine; his mother, Jane K. Lowe of Spring Lake, N.J.; a sister, Jane Hawke of Neptune, N.J., and two brothers, Thomas F., of Wayne, N.J., and Brian J., of Manasquan, N.J.
