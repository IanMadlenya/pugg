        Joseph A. Martinis, a retired New York City Criminal Court judge, died Thursday in Calvary Hospital in the Bronx, an institution that cares for cancer patients. A resident of Manhattan, he was 81 years old.
        Judge Martinis served 27 years in the courts, starting in 1950 as a city magistrate. Over the years he was also associate justice of the Court of Special Sessions, acting judge of the Bronx County Court and an acting State Supreme Court justice.
        He presided over more than 100 homicide trials in the State Supreme Court and many major felony cases.
        Among them was that of Richard Moore, the Black Panther, who Judge Martinis sentenced in 1973 to life imprisonment for attempting to kill two police officers.
        In 1975, while sentencing a man for killing a young woman on Hudson Street in a $7 robbery, he urged the State Legislature to seriously consider reinstating the death penalty in such cases.
        Judge Martinis' son, Gareth, was at the center of controversy in the 1960's. Criticism arose when the son, facing charges of drunken and reckless driving in connection with a 1963 auto accident that killed five people, was acquitted by judges who were colleagues of Judge Martinis.
        Judge Martinis was born in New York City. He studied at Columbia University and received his law degree at Fordham in 1928.
        In 1947 he was elected to the Assembly from the Bronx, but resigned in 1950 to accept appointment as a city magistrate.
        He is survived by his wife, Nell; a son, Gareth; two daughters, Denise Kenner and Lauren Balducci, and two grandchildren.
