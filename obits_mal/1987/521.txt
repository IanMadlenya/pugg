        Robert Bradford Browne, a Miami architect noted for his distinctive designs of tropical homes and buildings in Florida, the Caribbean and Mexico, died Thursday of cancer. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Browne, a native of Jacksonville, Fla., and a graduate of the University of Florida School of Architecture, was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects and the recipient of numerous awards and honors for his public and private buildings.
        He designed many large buildings and residences, but his main interest was in the open wooden homes he built in Florida and the Caribbean. He was credited with developing the notion of tropical architecture, designs that in his words ''should breathe God's air, let in His light and shade our eyes.''
        He is survived by his wife, Sally Ann Browne, four sons, two daughters and two grandchildren.
