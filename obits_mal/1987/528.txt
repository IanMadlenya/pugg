        Hugh Johnson, senior vice president of Salem House Publishers, died of a heart attack Wednesday while vacationing on Grand Cayman Island in the Bahamas. He was 67 years old and lived in Clifton, N.J.
        Mr. Johnson began his career in publishing with A. S. Barnes & Company, then spent 29 years with Hammond Inc., the publishers of maps and books in Maplewood, N.J., where he rose to become executive vice president and publisher. He left Hammond last December to join Salem House.
        He served in the Army during World War II in the North African and Italian campaigns and in the southern invasion of France. Captured by the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge, he remained a prisoner until the end of the war.
        Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, Anne Marco Vecchio Johnson, a vice president at Random House; two bothers, Howard, of Montclair, N.J., and Sidney, of Bethpage, L.I.; a sister, Mary J. Addison of Bowie, Md., and three children by his previous marriage to the late Betty Bittles: Sandi Johnson of Louisville, Ky., Virginia Greenway of Alexandria, Va., and Douglas Johnson of London.
