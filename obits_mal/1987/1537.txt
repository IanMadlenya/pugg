        He had been a Democratic Congressional candidate in 1966 and in 1968 in New Jersey's 12th Congressional District, covering the western sections of Union and Essex Counties. He ran as a peace candidate, losing first to Representative Florence P. Dwyer, a Republican, and later to Peter Frelinghuysen, the Republican candidate.
        Dr. Allen wrote nearly 200 books, articles and films, the major thrust of which was organizational and community change. His books included ''The Quiet Revolution'' (1978); ''Beat The System'' (1980), and ''The Organizational Unconscious'' (1982). His film, ''Toward a Caring Community,'' received an award from the New York Film Festival in 1982.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was graduated from Plattsburg Teachers College. He attended New York University where he earned a master's degree and a doctorate at its Center for Human Relations Studies.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Bender; two sons, Judd and Peter, both of Manhattan; a sister, Mary Socatt, also of Manhattan, and two brothers, John, of Tampa, Fla., and Joseph, of Plattsburg, N.Y.
