        Clarence Brown, a motion picture director who was nominated six times for an Academy Award, died Monday of kidney failure. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Brown's six nominations for best director place him among the most honored directors in Hollywood history. Only Billy Wilder, with 12 nominations, and Frank Capra, with six, equaled or surpassed his total.
        His 1927 silent film ''Flesh and the Devil'' launched the career of Greta Garbo, with whom he collaborated on six more movies, including ''Anna Christie.''
        ''National Velvet'' in 1944 and ''The Yearling'' in 1946 were among Mr. Brown's best-known films. Other films for which he was nominated for an Oscar were ''Romance,'' in 1930; ''A Free Soul,'' in 1931, and ''The Human Comedy,'' an adaptation of a William Saroyan novel, in 1943.
        He is survived by his wife, Marian Ruth Spies, and a daughter.
