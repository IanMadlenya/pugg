        Abdel Rahman Sharkawi, an Egyptian writer and left-wing political figure, died of a heart attack today, his 67th birthday, the Middle East News Agency said.
        Mr. Sharkawi, who had just returned from a trip to the Soviet Union, was a member of Egypt's National Assembly and Supreme Press Council.
        He was a former chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and a former chairman of the weekly political review Rose al-Youssef. He also had served as secretary general of the Supreme Arts Council.
        Mr. Sharkawi wrote a column for the semi-official newspaper Al Ahram, and his plays, poems and novels on political and heroic themes are widely read in Egyptian universities.
        His first book, ''The Land,'' explored peasant sufferings under feudalism. He wrote a play in verse about Algeria's fight for independence from France. His last novel, ''Abu Bakr al-Sedik,'' was serialized in Al Ahram last month.
        A longstanding Moslem committee ban on the staging of two Sharkawi verse dramas was lifted early this year.
        Mr. Sharkawi is survived by three sons and a daughter.
