        Morris Amchan, a senior prosecutor at the Nuremberg war crimes trials after World War II who was also an attorney for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Navy Department, died Friday in Washington after suffering a heart attack. He was 76 years old.
        A native of New York who was raised on the Lower East Side and in Brooklyn and graduated from the New York University Law School, Mr. Amchan became a deputy chief counsel for war crimes at Nuremberg.
        Among the war criminals in whose prosecution Mr. Amchan was active was Karl Krauch, chairman of the board of the I.G. Farben chemicals combine, who was sentenced to six years in prison.
        After the war, Mr. Amchan joined the Navy Department in Washington, retiring as a senior trial attorney. Before the war, he practiced law in Manhattan. He later joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington.
        Many letters by Mr. Amchan, many of them drawing on his experiences at Nuremberg, were published in The New York Times over the years.
        Mr. Amchan, a resident of Arlington, Va., is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Seewald; a daughter, Harriet Sonja Schultz of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Arthur, of Arlington; three sisters, Anne Feinman and Silvia Silberberg, both of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Ida Amchan of Forest Hills, Queens, and six grandchildren.
