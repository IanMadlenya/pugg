        Jesse H. Cutrer Jr., one of seven journalism students thrown out of Louisiana State University in a censorship dispute involving Huey P. Long, died Sunday in a Jackson, Miss., hospital. He was 72 years old. As editor of The Daily Reveille at Louisiana State, Mr. Cutrer was at the center of a 1934 controversy over a letter to the editor that was indirectly critical of Long, then a United States Senator. Long, who had been Governor of the state, saw an advance copy of the letter and ordered the school's president, James Monroe Smith, to suppress it.
        Mr. Cutrer agreed, but the newspaper staff resigned and the seven were expelled. The University of Missouri took them in.
        Years later Mr. Cutrer said the event ''opened doors that you couldn't have got opened before because they remembered your name - it was the greatest thing that ever happened to us.''
