        The nation's oldest Medal of Honor winner, Philip C. Katz, who was awarded the medal for rescuing a wounded comrade under fire in World War I, died here on Oct. 29, a month short of his 100th birthday.
        Mr. Katz was a sergeant in the 363d Infantry on Sept. 26, 1918, when he saved Phil Page, a neighbor in civilian life, who was wounded near Eclisfontaine, France. ''Voluntarily crossing an area swept by heavy machine-gun fire, Sergeant Katz advanced to where the wounded soldier lay and carried him to a place of safety,'' the citation said.
        After the war Mr. Katz was elected to the Board of Supervisors and the office of public administrator.
