        Walter G. Williams, owner of the family-operated Williams Lake Hotel at Rosendale, N.Y., in the Catskills, died of cancer Saturday at Kingston (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 74 years old and lived in Rosendale.
        The hotel was founded 58 years ago by his father, Gustave, a Finnish immigrant, and Mr. Williams had been involved in its operation since then.
        He also worked to help popularize the biathlon, a combination of cross-country skiing and rifle marksmanship. Derived from a Swedish hunting competition, it became part of the Winter Olympics in 1960.
        Mr. Williams was a founder of the U.S. Biathlon Association and helped organize its first national championships, which were held in 1965 in Rosendale.
        He is survived by his wife, Marianne Kuring Williams; three daughters, Anita Peck of Stone Ridge, N.Y.; Barbara Anne Battelle of St. Augustine, Fla., and Carol of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; a son, Edward of Brooklyn; a sister, Fannie Austin of Lake Worth, Fla., and four grandchildren.
        There will be a memorial service at the Williams Lake Hotel at 10:30 A.M. Friday.
