        Karl Davis, a fashion designer, died Saturday morning at the Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 25 years old and lived in Manhattan. His family said the cause of death was pneumonia.
        Mr. Davis began designing at age 17. While working as a design assistant, he sold his first styles to Henri Bendel, which continued to be his exclusive outlet.
        Mr. Davis also made clothes for private clients and worked at Tamala Design With Bagel, a SoHo clothing store with a food counter in back that closed last fall.
        ''He was an integral part of the downtown fashion mafia,'' the owner of Tamala, Aggie Markowitz, said. ''He gave fashion commentary while he sort of made bagel sandwiches. The commentary usually came faster than the food.''
        He continued designing until last month. Mr. Davis's last formal collection, his sixth, was shown at Caffe Roma, a restaurant in Manhattan, last May. Mr. Davis's sophisticated designs combined fine fabrics, Parisian influence and whimsical detail.
        ''I'm not out to create a new sleeve,'' Mr. Davis said last May. ''I want to make classics that will be around forever. Making it last. That's the only thing I fear.''
        Surviving are his parents, Rose and Lembert Davis of Brooklyn, and three sisters, Jackie and Robin, both of Brooklyn, and Andora Boyd of Virginia.
