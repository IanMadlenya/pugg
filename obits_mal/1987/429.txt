        Yakov B. Zeldovich, a physicist who played a major role in the Soviet military industry and helped develop theories on black holes and neutron stars, died Wednesday, the Soviet press agency Tass said today.
        He was 73 years old; the cause of death was not given.
        Tass said Dr. Zeldovich headed the theory department of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Institute of Physical Problems. He made an ''immense contribution'' in such areas as combustion and detonation theory, the physics of explosions and shock waves, nuclear and elementary-particle physics, gravitation and cosmology, astrophysics and astromony, Tass said.
        In scientific theory, a black hole is a collapsed star that is so condensed that neither light nor matter can escape its gravitational field. A neutron star is hypothesized to be a collapsed star consisting of densely packed neutrons.
        Dr. Zeldovitch was born March 8, 1914, in Minsk. He graduated from Leningrad University in 1931. In 1939 and 1940 he worked on the chain reaction in uranium fission. In 1941 and 1942 he worked on atomic energy in Kazan with the Soviet Union's top physicists and chemists. Dr. Zeldovich won the Stalin Prize in 1943.
        ''Yakov Zeldovich's contribution to insuring the country's defense capability is inestimable,'' Tass said.
        His publications in the 1950's concerned antiparticles and gas detonation, and in the 1960's he worked on light nuclei isotopes and the energy of random movement in the universe. In 1966, he published a paper entitled ''The Problem of the Century: Is Communication With Extraterrestrial Civilizations Possible?''
