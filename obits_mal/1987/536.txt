        John Leypoldt, a former place-kicker for the Buffalo Bills, died today of an apparent heart attack. He was 40 years old.
        From 1971 to 1976, Leypoldt kicked 74 field goals and 147 extra points, both team records, for the Bills. His 369 points made him the team's second-leading scorer, behind O. J. Simpson and his 420 points.
        Leypoldt was released by the Bills midway through the 1976 season and finished out the season with the Seattle Seahawks. He failed in an attempt to make a comeback with Buffalo in 1979. After his retirement, he was involved in real estate in the Buffalo area.
