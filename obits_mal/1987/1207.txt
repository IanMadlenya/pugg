        Jeffrey Dale Kint, a fashion designer and president of Jeff Kint Designs Ltd., died Sunday at his home in Manhattan, after a long illness. He was 33 years old.
        Mr. Kint was known in the fashion industry for his hand-dyed silk evening wear, represented on Seventh Avenue by Whodunnit Fashions, which he sold to specialty and department stores throughout the country.
        In September 1981, he and a partner, Thomas Reed, opened one of New York City's first late-night women's clothing stores, the Jeff Kint Boutique at 117 West Broadway.
        Mr. Kint was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and attended the University of Northern Iowa at Cedar Falls. After moving to Brooklyn, he worked for two years as property master of the now-defunct Chelsea Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
        In 1977, he started Jeff Kint Designs, working out of his apartment in Brooklyn Heights. The business will continue under the direction of Shannon Kramer, who will become president.
        Mr. Flint is survived by his parents, Leonard N. and Edna M. Kint of Cedar Rapids; a brother, Gregory, of Marion, Iowa; and a sister, Janis Lohan of Elmwood Park, Ill.
        A memorial service is to be held today at noon at the Redden Funeral Home, 325 West 14th Street.
