        Bertram Bloch, a playwright, novelist and Hollywood story editor, died of heart disease Friday at New York Hospital, according to his wife, Susanne Suba. He was 95 years old.
        Mr. Bloch was the co-author, with George Brewer Jr., of the Broadway play ''Dark Victory,'' which was subsequently turned into one of Bette Davis's most celebrated movies.
        Mr. Bloch was born in New York and continued living here even as he worked for Hollywood studios. For many years, he was Eastern story editor for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and, later, for 20th Century-Fox. While he was story editor, his studios bought properties that were made into ''Grand Hotel'' and ''All About Eve,'' among other films.
        After an early interest in writing short stories, Mr. Bloch became a playwright. His first Broadway play was ''Glory Hallelujah'' in 1926 (written in collaboration with Thomas Mitchell). His subsequent plays included ''Even in Egypt,'' ''Jewel Robbery'' and ''Spring Again,'' as well as ''Dark Victory,'' which Tallulah Bankhead performed on Broadway in 1934. He also wrote the novels ''Mrs. Hulett,'' ''The Little Laundress and the Fearful Knight'' and ''The Only Nellie Fayle.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jean Wilson; a son, Edmund Bloch; five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
