        Judge Robert H. Gollmar, who presided at the trial of Edward Gein, a murderer whose case inspired the novel ''Psycho'' and the Alfred Hitchcock film of the same name, died Monday. He was 84 year old.
        Judge Gollmar in 1981 wrote a book, ''Edward Gein, America's Most Bizarre Murderer,'' about the 1957 case. He retired in 1982 as a Walworth County judge.
        In the book, Judge Gollmar described the death of a woman whose body was found decapitated, the only person Mr. Gein was convicted of killing.
        Robert Bloch, author of the novel on which Hitchcock based his 1960 movie, said in a 1984 interview that it was not the crime itself or Mr. Gein that inspired ''Psycho'' but the situation: a small town where a man committed murders without anyone suspecting it. Mr. Gein died in 1984 at a mental health center.
