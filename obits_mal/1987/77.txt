        Dominick Labino, an artist whose works made of glass are shown in more than 100 museums, universities and public and private collections, died Saturday in his home at Grand Rapids, Ohio. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Labino, who held 60 glass-oriented patents in the United States, earned national honors for his use of industrial glass as a medium and for his research on glass composition and processing as well as fiberglass-forming machines.
        He began his professional career at the Owens-Illinois container manufacturing plant in Clairton, Pa., before moving to Toledo and working for 30 years for the Johns-Mansville Fiber Company. He retired as vice president and director of research development in 1965, but served as a research consultant until 1975.
        For his contribution to the development of molten glass as a fine-art form, Mr. Labino was given the first Ohio Art Council award in 1971.
