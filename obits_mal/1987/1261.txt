        William S. Halstead, an inventor who was a pioneer in stereophonic broadcasting, died of pneumonia Tuesday at Canoga Park (Calif.) Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Woodland Hills, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb.
        On Sept. 13, 1950, Mr. Halstead and a group of associates demonstrated one of the first stereo broadcasts by a single FM station. The process he used allowed a station to use a sideband of its main frequency to broadcast secondary or subscription programming. The process, multiplexing, ultimately did away with the need for two stations -and two receivers in the listener's home - in order to achieve the stereophonic effect.
        Mr. Halstead held more than 80 patents in radio and television and was credited with helping Japan develop the Nippon television network. He also planned television systems in India, Uganda and Jordan.
        His inventions included a portable shortwave radio system for forest rangers and a latter-day cable system that allows motorists at Los Angeles International Airport to get traffic and flight information on their car radios.
        Mr. Halstead, who was born in Mount Kisco, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree in physics at Haverford (Pa.) College in 1926.
        He is survived by his wife, Leslie; a son, Dirck, a photographer for Time magazine; a daughter, Anne York of Germantown, N.Y.,; two brothers, George of Somers, N.Y., and Gordon of Peru, Vt., and a grandson.
