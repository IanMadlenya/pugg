        Robert M. Leylan, a retired art dealer and former head of the American branch of Christie's, the London-based auction house, died of a heart attack Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. A Manhattan resident, he was 79 years old.
        Mr. Leylan, a 1929 graduate of Yale University, attended classes at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University before entering the art business with the firm of Jacques Seligman & Company. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Corps in World War II, after which he worked as an independent art dealer in Manhattan.
        He started Christie's operations in this country in the late 1950's, according to a Christie's spokesman, Lily Zimmerman. He retired in the early 1960's.
        There are no immediate survivors.
