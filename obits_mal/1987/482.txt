        Mr. Anderson, who had been a state police parkway patrolman on Long Island for three years, joined the Queens prosecutor's office in 1952 as a process server under District Attorney T. Vincent Quinn. At the time of his retirement in 1977, he was the chief rackets investigator under District Attorney John J. Santucci.
        Among the many major cases investigated by Mr. Anderson the most famous was that of Alice Crimmins, a Kew Gardens cocktail waitress who was convicted in 1971 of manslaughter in the 1965 strangulation death of her 4-year-old daughter, Alice Marie.
        Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife, Eleanor, and a sister, Gertrude McDonald of Long Island City, Queens.
