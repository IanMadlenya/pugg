        Richard F. Kahn, one of the country's leading bridge players, died yesterday of complications resulting from Parkinson's disease and heart problems at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In a highly successful bridge career that spanned more than half a century, Mr. Kahn won four major national titles: the Vanderbilt Teams in 1953, the Spingold Teams in 1955, the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams in 1949 and the Life Master Pairs in 1951.
        He also won three national mixed titles, and his many regional victories included five in the Reisinger Knockout Team in New York City.
        Mr. Kahn was noted for the speed and accuracy of his cardplay. He was a co-founder of New York's Card School and was a board member of the Cavendish Club and the Greater New York Bridge Association. In 1977, he retired as an executive of Columbia Pictures.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjorie.
