        Hans Ericson, former longtime leader of Sweden's teamsters union and one of the country's most controversial labor figures, died Saturday at the age of 59, a doctor reported.
        The doctor, Dr. Louis Riddez of Sabbatsberg Hospital, declined to give the cause of death. Mr. Ericson was admitted to Sabbatsberg two months ago for treatment of a gastric ulcer and underwent repeated surgery.
        Mr. Ericson headed the teamsters from 1968 to 1980. He had to step down after a labor court convicted him of tax fraud and misuse of union funds.
        During his leadership of the union, he expelled thousands of dissidents and was accused of autocratic methods and personal extravagance.
        In the 1960's, he persuaded his teamsters to boycott California lettuce, in support of American farm unions.
        Mr. Ericson, son of a miner, began as a cab driver in Ludvika in central Sweden. After he was forced to leave the teamsters, he worked as a private consultant on labor negotiations.
