        Norwood F. Allman, a lawyer and diplomat in China for more than 30 years, died Saturday in Carlisle, Pa. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Allman, who prepared the first English-language text of Chinese commercial laws, lived in China for most of the period from 1916 to 1950. He lived in Manhattan from 1950 until 1981.
        Born in Union Hall, Va., Mr. Allman was graduated from the University of Virginia in 1915. A year later he joined the American Embassy in Beijing as a student interpreter, and he worked with a young assistant librarian named Mao Zedong at the University of Beijing. In 1921 Mr. Allman was named United States consul in Shanghai.
        He retired from the consular corps in 1924 to practice law in Shanghai. He later served as editor of Shun Pao, a Chinese-language paper. The day after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, he was arrested by the Japanese occupiers in China and interned in a prison camp for six months.
        Upon his release and return to the United States, Mr. Allman was appointed director of the Asian bureau of the Office of Strategic Services in New York City. After the war, he returned to China and practiced law until 1950.
        He is survived by his wife, Dotti; a daughter, Nancy, of Paris, and a son, William H., of Saudi Arabia, from a previous marriage; a stepson, R. Dennis Ruth, of Carlisle, and eight grandchildren.
