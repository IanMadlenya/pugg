        Seymour Vall, a theatrical producer and playwright, died of cancer Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Vall, who was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, and studied playwriting at Columbia University, wrote television scripts for the Kraft Theater and plays for the New Dramatists Studio in the 1950's.
        A year after starting a newsletter for theatrical investors in 1959, Mr. Vall and a partner, Edwin Partikian, founded the First Theater Investing Service, a brokerage concern dedicated to raising money for Broadway and Off Broadway productions. Since the early 1960's, it has helped finance about 60 shows, including ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Mame,'' ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' ''Carnival,'' ''Luv,'' ''A Thousand Clowns'' and ''Stop the World . . . I Want to Get Off.''
        During the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Vall produced many Broadway and Off Broadway shows, including ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and ''Blood Red Roses.'' He also wrote several plays, including ''How to be a Jewish Mother'' (1967), based on the book by Dan Greenburg, and ''The Really Portable Hamlet Company'' (1973).
        Mr. Vall, a longtime resident of Manhattan, was a yachtsman who invented several devices for yacht masts.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, Jonathan and Leland, and his sister, Jessie Nagel, all of New York City.
