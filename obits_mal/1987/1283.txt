        J. Rives Childs, a former American diplomat, author and an authority on Casanova, died of a cardiac-pulmonary infection yesterday at the Windsor Nursing Home in Richmond, where he had lived for the last four years. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Childs wrote 14 books, four of them on the subject of Casanova, the 18th-century Italian adventurer and libertine. A biography of Casanova by Mr. Childs is scheduled to be published this fall, according to Mr. Childs's publisher, Kenneth S. Giniger.
        Mr. Childs was for many years the president of the International Casanova Society and the editor of the Society's magazine, Casanova Gleanings.
        He had a long and distinguished career as a United States consular and diplomatic official before retiring to Nice in 1953 to write full time.
        One of his early works was ''American Foreign Service,'' published in 1948. Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Gordon A. Craig called the book ''an informative and highly entertaining account of the organization, the traditions and the diverse operations of our diplomatic corps.''
        Mr. Childs spent 30 years in the Foreign Service, his last post being Ambassador to Ethiopia. He had served in Jerusalem, Cairo, Teheran and Tangier in various diplomatic jobs.
        Mr. Childs, who was born in Lynchburg, Va., was a graduate of Randolph-Macon College and Harvard University, where he received a master of arts degree in 1915. He was in charge of deciphering German codes in World War I. He moved to Richmond in the early 1970's after the death of his wife, Georgina, whom he met in Russia in the 1920's.
        There are no immediate survivors.
