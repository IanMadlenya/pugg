        Norman Luboff, a composer and arranger of popular choral pieces and best known as director of the Norman Luboff Choir, died of lung cancer Tuesday at his home in Bynum, N.C. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Luboff arranged and wrote original works for chorus and collaborated on the music for a musical, ''As Long As You're Healthy.'' He was also co-author of ''Songs of Man: The International Book of Folk Songs.''
        His principal work, however, was with his choir, which was formed in 1963 and performed a wide range of music on radio, television, in film and on records.
        Mr. Luboff was born in Chicago, did graduate work in music with Leo Sowerby, a composer, and spent his early career as a singer and arranger, principally for the radio. He then worked in Hollywood as an arranger for artists working in television and film, including Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra. While there, Mr. Luboff established his choir, which made 75 recordings of gospel, pop, classical and other music.
