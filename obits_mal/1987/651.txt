        Col. Gains Hawkins of the Army, retired, who was an expert on enemy forces in the Vietnam War and served as a defense witness in Gen. William C. Westmoreland's unsuccessful libel suit against CBS, died Thursday of a gunshot wound that the Clay County authorities said was apparently self-inflicted. He was 67 years old.
        Colonel Hawkins, who fought in World War II and in the Korean War, served in South Vietnam from 1966-67 under General Westmoreland as the Army's chief intelligence expert on the strength of Vietcong forces.
        In 1982, a ''CBS Reports'' documentary accused General Westmoreland of a conspiracy to alter Colonel Hawkins' estimates so that American troops would appear to hold an advantage.
        General Westmoreland filed a $120 million libel suit against CBS, and Colonel Hawkins was a key defense witness when the case went to trial in New York in 1984.
        Colonel Hawkins retired from the Army in 1970 and was the administrator of the Dugan Memorial Home, a private nursing home in West Point, Miss. Last year he had a lung removed because of cancer.
