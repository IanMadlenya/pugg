        Kevin D. Murphy, a partner of KMS Corporate Brokers, a Wall Street bond brokerage concern, died of a heart attack Friday at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was 48 years old and lived in New York City and Newtown, Conn.
        Mr. Murphy was well known among bond traders and securities dealers because of his position at KMS, a subsidiary of the Security Pacific Corporation and the largest concern of its type. Brokering concerns such as KMS act as the middlemen for trades between securities firms that wish to keep their identity secret from their competitors during a trade.
        In 1984 Mr. Murphy introduced video screens to the corporate bond market, showing bid and asked prices of various bond issues.
        Mr. Murphy is survived by his wife, Kay, and a sister, Kathleen Bebie of Fairview Park, Ohio.
