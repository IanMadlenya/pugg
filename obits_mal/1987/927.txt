        Justice Thomas L. Hayes of the Vermont Supreme Court died today after a long battle with lung cancer. He was 60 years old.
        A spokesman at the Massachusetts General Hospital said that Justice Hayes died at 12:10 A.M. but declined to give the exact cause of death.
        Mr. Hayes, a former Lieutenant Governor, was one of three Supreme Court justices who faced charges by the Judicial Conduct Board for alleged misconduct in connection with an investigation into the activities of a former Chittenden County assistant judge, Jane L. Wheel.
        He strongly denied any wrongdoing, saying in an interview in January that he was a victim of sensationalistic journalism and a judiciary too fearful to stand up to the press.
        Mr. Hayes was appointed to the state's high court in 1985 by Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin. Champion of State's Constitution
        As a justice, he was a champion of the State Constitution, writing a precedent-setting decision that focused attention on the powers in the state document.
        In the decision, which received national attention, he said the State Constitution could ''protect the rights and liberties of our people, however the philosophy of the United States Supreme Court may ebb and flow.''
        ''The State of Vermont has lost a truly eminent jurist,'' Chief Justice Frederic Allen of the Supreme Court said in a prepared statment. ''He was firmly dedicated to the principles contained in the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Rights and the constitutions of our nation and the state.''
        The Judicial Conduct Board released its charges against the three justices in January. The two other justices facing charges are William C. Hill, who is retiring, and Ernest W. Gibson 3d.
        Justice Hayes leaves his wife, Jenny, and three children.
