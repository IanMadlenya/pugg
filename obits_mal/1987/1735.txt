        Domenic Di Clerico, a former president of a transportation union local, shot and killed himself Monday while playing Russian roulette with a .38-caliber postol, the Philadelphia police said. He was 64 years old.  Mr. Di Clerico was found by his son John on the floor of his basement apartment in Philadelphia, the police said.
        Detective William Brennan of the Philadelphia police said Mr. Di Clerico and his son apparently had a quarrel over whether Mr. Di Clerico should play Russian roulette. ''The son attempted to stop him,'' Detective Brennan said.
        The police said the death was considered an accidental shooting.
        Mr. Di Clerico served as president of Local 234 of the Transportation Workers Union for 12 years. He ran for re-election and lost several years ago, Detective Brennan said, and was semi-retired at the time of his death.
        Besides his son John, Mr. Di Clerico is survived by his mother, Carmela, of Philadelphia, and three daughters, Rosemary, of Williamstown, N.J., and Ruby Ann and Donna, both of Philadelphia.
