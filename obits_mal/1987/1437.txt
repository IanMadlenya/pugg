        Todd Shuttleworth, who gained national attention by fighting to get his job back when he was dismissed after being stricken with AIDS, has died of complications from the disease. He was 34 years old.
        Mr. Shuttleworth died July 25 at San Francisco General Hospital, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Department of Health told The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
        The newspaper said today that after years of being in the public spotlight, Mr. Shuttleworth had asked that his death not be publicized, according to friends in Florida and San Francisco.
        Mr. Shuttleworth sued Broward County for dismissing him in 1984 because he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome, which attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancers. Case Settled Out of Court
        With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, he brought a $15 million Federal civil rights lawsuit against the county, saying it had violated laws against job discrimination.
        Although the case was settled out of court last Dec. 8 and Mr. Shuttleworth received $190,000 in back pay and medical benefits as well as a new job studying AIDS at the Broward County Medical Examiner's Office. But he was barely able to work; he became ill within a week and moved to San Francisco.
        Allan Terl, former chairman of the Broward County chapter of the civil liberties union, who represented Mr. Shuttleworth, said: ''His legacy is twofold. First, he set a precedent that AIDS-infected people have a right to keep their jobs. Secondly, hopefully, the public became educated about AIDS and how noncontagious it is in an employment setting.''
