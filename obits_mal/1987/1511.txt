        Charlie Smalls, whose music and lyrics for ''The Wiz'' won two Tony Awards in 1975, died of cardiac arrest during emergency surgery on Aug.. 27 in Bruges, Belgium. He was 43 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Smalls studied music at the Henry Street Settlement and was a 1961 graduate of the Juilliard School. In the years that followed, he was a pianist with the New York Jazz Repertory Company and toured with Harry Belafonte and Hugh Masekela, among others. Mr. Smalls came to prominence in January 1975, when ''The Wiz'' - a musical version of L. Frank Baum's ''Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' with a black cast -opened at the Majestic Theater. The show was a popular success and, in 1978, was made into a film starring Diana Ross and Michael Jackson.
        ''The music in 'The Wiz' probably reaches deeper into black consciousness than has been generally recognized,'' Bryant Rollins wrote in The New York Times in December 1975. ''The score by Charlie Smalls intersperses songs of fantasy and humor with songs of protest. Innovation in black music follows a tradition of protest against oppression.''
        Mr. Smalls was performing and working on a new musical at the time of his death, according to his lawyer, Michael Remer.
        Mr. Smalls is survived by a son, Michael, of Manhattan.
