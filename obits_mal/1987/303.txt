        He coached the Rams for five seasons, the last in 1982. The Rams played in the Super Bowl in 1980, losing by 31-19 to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
        Mr. Malavasi was stricken in the Federal Building here and was in full cardiac arrest when he was brought to the hospital, according to Dr. Donald Dicus of the Western Medical Center. Mr. Malavasi had undergone major heart surgery in recent years, according to Jack Faulkner, the Rams' administrator of football operations. Promoted in 1978
        An assistant with the Rams, Mr. Malavasi was promoted to head coach in 1978. He was dismissed after Los Angeles had a 2-7 record in the strike-shortened 1982 season. John Robinson replaced him as coach.
        Born in Passaic, N.J., Mr. Malavasi was a lineman for Army under Coach Earl (Red) Blaik and Vince Lombardi, an assistant coach. Mr. Malavasi also served as interim head coach of the Denver Broncos in 1966, finishing with a 4-8 record. He had a 44-41 record as coach of the Rams.
        He is survived by his wife and their five children.
