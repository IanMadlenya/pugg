        Dr. George E. Murphy, a professor of pathology at the Cornell University Medical College and chairman of the group responsible for the Upper East Side recreation complex known as Asphalt Green, died of cancer Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Murphy had been associated with Cornell since 1954, and was an attending pathologist at New York Hospital.
        In 1972, Dr. Murphy and his wife, Annette, were catalysts in preserving the abandoned Municipal Asphalt Plant at York Avenue and 90th Street.
        A charitable organization called the Neighborhood Committee for Asphalt Green was formed to renovate the plant, which was renamed the George and Annette Murphy Arts and Sports Center.
        The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission gave landmark status to the plant in 1976. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
        Dr. Murphy was born in Kansas City, Mo. He graduated from the University of Kansas in 1939, and received a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1943.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, Franklin, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Cordelia Ennis of Pasadena, Calif.
