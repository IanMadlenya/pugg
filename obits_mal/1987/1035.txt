        Dr. Clarence E. de la Chapelle, a cardiologist and medical educator who had been associated for six decades with New York University's College of Medicine and Medical Center, died June 13 in a nursing home after a long illness. He was 89 years old and a lifelong resident of Manhattan, where he also had his private practice.
        Born in Manhattan, he received his medical degree from N.Y.U. in 1922, completed his training at its affiliated Bellevue Hospital and joined the faculty in 1925. By 1938, he was a professor of clinical medicine and went on to serve several terms as assistant and associate dean.
        Dr. de la Chapelle wrote some of the earliest textbooks on heart disorders in the 1930's, a time when he and some associates were setting up free cardiac clinics at hospitals throughout the city.
        After World War II, concerned about young physicians whose education was interrupted by the war, Dr. de la Chapelle became the co-founder and director of N.Y.U.'s Regional Hospital Plan. The plan provided postgraduate training for physicians at about 20 hospitals from Pennsylvania to Connecticut and served as a model for a similar Federal program.
        He was awarded N.Y.U.'s Presidential Citation in 1963, and Bellevue named its library after him in 1971.
        He, in turn, endowed N.Y.U.'s Medical Library Archives in 1983 in memory of his late wife of 51 years, the former Lillian Buckmann.
        Dr. de la Chapelle is survived by two sons, Donald C. of Houston, and Norman F. of Eastham, Mass.; six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
