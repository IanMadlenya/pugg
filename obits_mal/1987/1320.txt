        Mr. Rosenblum, who came to this country from Poland in 1949, started Excel in 1955, with $500 as capital.
        Initially, he worked out of his home, building knotty-pine kitchens in the basement. His wife, Clara Parnes Rosenblum, made the deliveries in a red pickup truck. Today, Excel, with its headquarters in Lakewood, N.J., employs more than 1,000 people.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Rosenblum is survived by a son, Barry, of Howell, N.J., and a granddaughter.
