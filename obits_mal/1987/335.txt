        Mr. Zoll, a resident of Cambridge, began his career in publishing with Houghton Mifflin in Boston after attending Tufts University. As a senior editor with Macmillan & Company in New York in the late 1950's and early 1960's, he published such authors as James Baldwin, Edward Hoagland and Paul Goodman. He also wrote articles about the publishing industry using the pen name of Christopher Amos.
        In the mid-1960's, Mr. Zoll co-founded a construction company which built and renovated buildings in the Greenwich Village and Chelsea neighborhoods of Manhattan. He also worked for the New York City Housing and Development Administration under Mayor Lindsay. He later moved to England, where he did editing and writing on architectural subjects and established a small cabinetmaking firm.
        Mr. Zoll is survived by two sons, Nicholas and Timothy, and a daughter, Daisy, all of Cambridge, and a brother, Daniel, of Boston.
