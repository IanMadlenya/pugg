        Bill Holman, the cartoonist who drew the comic strip ''Smokey Stover,'' died Feb. 27 in New York. He was 84 years old and lived in the city.
        Mr. Holman's strip about a daffy firefighter who drove a two-wheel vehicle with his equally zany chief, Cash U. Nutt, was syndicated to some 50 newspapers by the Chicago Tribune-New York News syndicate. The strip ran for more than 40 years beginning in 1935. He also drew the single panel cartoon, ''Nuts and Bolts.''
        The Smokey Stover strips were replete with puns. In one, a fish opening a door is labeled ''calling cod.'' In many strips Mr. Holman placed the word ''foo,'' which he said had a humorous sound for him, and the words ''notary sojac,'' which he said phonetically resembled Merry Christmas in Gaelic - Nodlaig Sodhach. The Tribune syndicate terminated the strip in the 1970's.
        Before Mr. Holman was 21 years old he had drawn and sold for syndication a strip called ''Billville Birds,'' and he then sold ''G. Whizz Jr.'' to The New York Herald Tribune.
        Mr. Holman was president of the National Cartoonists Society from 1961 to 1963.
        He is survived by his wife, Dolores.
