        Dr. Georg Wittig, a winner of the Nobel Prize for chemistry, died Wednesday in Heidelberg, West Germany. He was 90 years old.
        Dr. Wittig was professor emeritus of organic chemistry at the University of Heidelberg. He shared the Nobel chemistry prize in 1979 with Dr. Herbert Brown, professor of chemistry at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.
        Dr. Wittig was honored for developing a process of regulating the regrouping of atoms in a molecule. The process, called the Wittig Synthesis or the Wittig Reaction, is a method of linking carbon and phosphorus to open new ways to synthesize biologically active substances. Dr. Brown was honored for research in a related field.
        Their work made possible the mass production of hundreds of important drugs and industrial chemicals that would otherwise have been prohibitively expensive, including the arthritis medicine hydrocortisone.
        Dr. Wittig was born June 16, 1987 in Berlin and received a doctorate in chemistry from Marburg University in 1926. He was a member of the Bavarian Academy of Science in Munich and an honorary member of the New York Academy of Science.
