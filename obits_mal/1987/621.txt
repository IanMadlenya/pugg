        Donald F. O'Donnell, who headed up Senate investigations of organized crime and labor racketeering in the 1950's and 1960's, died Wednesday. He was 70 year old.
        Mr. O'Donnell and his wife, Esther, 70, died of smoke inhalation when fire swept through their home. Fire officials say problems with the house's heating system may have caused the fire.
        A retired lawyer, Mr. O'Donnell worked for the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations from 1953 to 1970. He played a key role in labor racketeering hearings involving James R. Hoffa, then head of the teamsters' union, that resulted in Federal laws to protect workers from union abuses.
