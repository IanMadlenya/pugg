        For many years, he headed the school's Department of Fine and Industrial Arts. Dr. Ziegfeld, a native of Columbus, Ohio, retired from Teachers College in 1970 with the title of professor emeritus.
        He was a founder of the International Society for Education Through Art and the first president of the National Arts Education Association.
        He wrote and lectured frequently and was the editor of a 1953 publication for Unesco called ''Creative Teaching in the Visual Arts,'' which included contributions by Henri Matisse, Herbert Read and Jean Piaget.
        A collection of Dr. Ziegfeld's prints, which he donated to Teachers College, is on display in the college's students' lounge.
        Dr. Ziegfeld is survived by two brothers, Ernest, of Taos, N.M., and Robert, of Reynoldsburg, Ohio, and two sisters, Lillian, of Taos, and Ada, of Columbus, Ohio.
