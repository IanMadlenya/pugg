       Ray J. Madden, a Democratic Congressman from Indiana who served for 34 years before being defeated for renomination in 1976, died yesterday in a hospital in Washington, where he lived. He was 95 years old. Mr. Madden, who represented the heavily industrial Gary-Hammond area on the south shore of Lake Michigan, sat patiently in the House for 30 years, hewing to a liberal, pro-labor voting record.
        Ray J. Madden, a Democratic Congressman from Indiana who served for 34 years before being defeated for renomination in 1976, died yesterday in a hospital in Washington, where he lived. He was 95 years old. Mr. Madden, who represented the heavily industrial Gary-Hammond area on the south shore of Lake Michigan, sat patiently in the House for 30 years, hewing to a liberal, pro-labor voting record. In 1973, a month before his 81st birthday, he assumed the chairmanship of the House Rules Committee, one of the most powerful posts in Congress, ending a century and a half of control by conservative Republicans and Southern Democrats.
        But his tenure was a stormy one, as younger, more independent members of the House in the post-Watergate period began asserting themselves and breaking party ranks.
        ''They seem to run wild over there now,'' he said of the House chamber. When he was finally beaten in the 1976 Democratic primary by Adam Benjamin Jr., a man less than half his age, he parted with no great regret.
        ''I've had it,'' Mr. Madden. ''I'm glad to get out of here.''
        Mr. Madden, a native of Waseca, Minn., received a law degree from Creighton University in Omaha, where he practiced law and later became a municipal judge.
        After serving in the Navy in World War I, Mr. Madden set up a law practice in Gary. He was named Gary's City Controller in 1935 and three years later was elected Lake County Treasurer.
        Mr. Madden never married.
