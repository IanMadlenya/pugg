        Colonel Fogelson was on General Dwight D. Eisenhower's staff in World War II and was partially responsible for the oil pipeline that made possible the Allied invasion of Europe.
        He directed his philanthropic involvement toward education, and endowed a fund in his wife's name at Southern Methodist University to provide scholarships for drama students.
