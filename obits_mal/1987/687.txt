        Luis Sanjurjo, literary agent for Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Kopit, among other well-known American writers, died of cancer yesterday morning at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 45 years old.
        Among the 60 authors, playwrights and screenwriters he represented at International Creative Management Associates were William Hoffman, Wallace Shawn, Bryan Miller, Peter Ueberroth and the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Benjamin Netanyahu.
        He was born in San Juan, P.R., and later attended Fordham University and Oxford University in England; he graduated from Harvard Law School. In the 1960's, he worked as a civil-rights lawyer in New Orleans and taught at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn where he was the dean of social studies. In 1972, he served as director of the Committee for Public Justice, which organized one of the first serious inquiries into the constitutional implications of F.B.I. practices.
        Before joining ICM in 1981, he worked as an executive assistant to the director Mike Nichols and co-produced James Lapine's successful Off Broadway play, ''Table Settings.''
        He is survived by his father, Luis; his mother, Guillermia Jimenez; a half sister, Aida Manrique, and a half-brother, Pedro Manrique.
