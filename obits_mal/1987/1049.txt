        Boudleaux Bryant, who with his wife, Felice, wrote numerous country music hits, including most of the Everly Brothers standards, died of cancer on Thursday at Baptist Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. He was 67 years old and lived in Gatlinburg, Tenn.
        Mr. Bryant's songwriting credits included ''All I Have to Do Is Dream,'' ''Bye Bye Love,'' ''Wake Up Little Susie'' and ''Devoted to You.''
        He was born in Shellman, Ga., studied the classical violin and, in 1938, performed with the Atlanta Philharmonic. He took his first job as a western swing fiddler in the early 1940's, and in 1945, while on tour in Milwaukee, he met Felice Scaduto. After a brief courtship, they were married. A Successful Team
        The Bryants had their first success with Little Jimmy Dickens's 1948 recording of their song, ''Country Boy,'' which prompted the music publisher Fred Rose to invite them to Nashville where they soon established themselves as one of the city's earliest and most successful songwriting teams.
        After writing country hits for Carl Smith, Eddy Arnold and others, the couple were assigned in 1957 to write songs for the Everly Brothers, who were then rising young performers. Starting with ''Bye Bye Love,'' they created most of the songs that shaped the brothers' career, with 12 of the 27 songs they wrote for them becoming major hits.
        Other important titles in a career that produced more than 700 published songs were ''Bird Dog,'' ''Love Hurts,'' ''Mexico,'' ''Problems'' and the bluegrass standard ''Rocky Top,'' which was named the official Tennessee state song in 1981.
        He is survived by his wife and two sons, Del and Dane, both of Nashville.
