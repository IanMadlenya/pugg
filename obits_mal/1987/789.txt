        Harry G. Hackett, the first black man appointed a Federal bankruptcy judge, died here Saturday. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Hackett was appointed to the Federal Bankruptcy Court in 1954 and retired in June 1981, a few hours after he was told he would not be reappointed because of misconduct and violations of judicial canons.
        A Federal appeals judge had found that Mr. Hackett had maintained a close social relationship with a lawyer for whom he had approved large fees.
        A native of Cedar Bluff, Ala., he moved to Detroit in 1943. After serving in the Army, he worked his way through Wayne State University and its law school. He was appointed to the bankruptcy bench after serving as a law clerk to a Federal district judge.
