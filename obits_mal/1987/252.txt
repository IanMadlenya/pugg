        Tom Manning, who played a key role in the Federal Bureau of Investigation role in the D. B. Cooper airliner hijacking in 1971, died Tuesday. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Manning was in charge of a search after a man who gave his name as Dan Cooper commandeered a Northwest flight on Thanksgiving Eve 1971, obtained parachutes and $200,000 ransom, and vanished from the plane as it flew between Seattle and Reno on his orders.
        The hijacker's name was reported as ''D. B. Cooper'' as the incident unfolded that night and stuck as the legend grew. The man was never found, but years later some of the ransom money washed up along the Columbia River.
        Mr. Manning retired from the bureau in 1979, served three years as executive director of the local Chamber of Commerce and also was president of the Rotary Club and chairman of the Civil Service Commission.
