        Eddie Durham, a jazz trombonist and electric guitarist who played and composed for the Jimmie Lunceford and Count Basie Orchestras in the 1930's, died yesterday as a result of a fall at his daughter's house in Brooklyn. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Durham had played last Saturday at Oberlin College with the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, with which he had been associated for the last 10 years. He had been scheduled to appear with the band at a shopping mall in Wayne, N.J., yesterday. Born in Texas
        Mr. Durham, who was born in San Marcos, Tex., in August 1906, first became prominent with Bennie Moten's Kansas City orchestra in 1929 when Count Basie was the band's pianist. He was one of the first musicians to play an electrified guitar. Charlie Christian, who popularized the electric guitar when he joined Benny Goodman in 1939, was inspired to take up the instrument after hearing Mr. Durham play it.
        He joined Jimmie Lunceford in 1935 and moved to the Basie band in 1937. His compositions included ''Lunceford Special'' for the Lunceford band and ''Out the Window'' and ''Topsy'' for Basie. Mr. Durham was also an arranger for the Glenn Miller, Jan Savitt and Artie Shaw Orchestras. During the 1940's he was musical director of the all-woman group International Sweethearts of Rhythm. He continued writing and occasionally leading his own small groups until he joined the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band in the late 1970's.
        He is survived by two daughters, Marsha Dow, in whose Brooklyn home he died, and Lesa Durham of New York, and two sons, Edward Durham Jr. of Washington and Edward T. Durham of Yonkers.
