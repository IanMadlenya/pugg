        Father Skvir, a native of Ganister, Pa., was ordained a priest in 1943 after graduating from St. Tikhon's Theological School. He served in parishes in Ohio and Pennsylvania before his Jersey City appointment in 1952.
        In addition to his parish work, Father Skvir served the Orthodox Church in America at the national level as a member of the Metropolitan Council, its governing body, for many years and as a member of the church's department of external affairs.
        Surviving are Father Skvir's wife, the former Barbara Wisloski; three children, the Rev. Daniel Skvir of Princeton, a deacon; Natalea Skvir of Lexington, Mass., and John Jr., of Boston, and two grandchildren.
