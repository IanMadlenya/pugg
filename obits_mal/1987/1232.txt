        Mr. Huntington, a native of Nashville, headed a detachment of Army liaison officers posted to Marshal Tito's partisans in the mountains of Yugoslavia. His mission was to keep the United States informed about the guerrilla fight against the German and Italian occupation troops and arrange for parachute drops of supplies and nightly air evacuation of the wounded.
        Mr. Huntington was a director and officer of the Equity Corporation of New York from 1932 to 1941. He returned in 1945 as president and then chairman of that investment concern and its subsidiaries, retiring in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine DuBois Huntington; two daughters, Hester Huntington McClintock of Madison, Conn., and Susan Huntington Hanmer of Los Angeles, and a son, the Rev. Frederic D. Huntington of Miami.
