        In the 1940's, Mr. Paige was a leading man in B-films and musicals for Universal Pictures. He appeared in 65 films, some under the name David Carlyle. He earned an Emmy Award in 1955 for outstanding male personality, a category that no longer exists.
        He also worked as a television newscaster for ABC and served as co-host of the quiz show ''The Big Payoff'' with Bess Myerson.
        He is survived by his wife, Maxine, and a brother.
