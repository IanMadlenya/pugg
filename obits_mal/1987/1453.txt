        James Urban Brady, who for 35 years entertained millions of people as Chief Red Feather at the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park, has died of cancer. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Brady died at his home here Saturday after a four-year battle with the disease, said his son, Jimmy Brady of Anaheim.
        Mr. Brady, of Navajo and Sioux parentage, became the most photographed and sought-after personality at the amusement park until his retirement in 1983, Knott's officials said.
        Mr. Brady, married six times, is also survived by a daughter, Virginia Haddon; 11 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
