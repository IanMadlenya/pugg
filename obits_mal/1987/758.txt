        Dr. Ralph H. Gabriel, the Sterling Professor Emeritus of History at Yale University who developed a pioneering course in American thought and civilization, died Tuesday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 96 years old.
        The course that gained Professor Gabriel prominence, which he initiated in 1931, stressed the systematic study of the history of the viewpoints of American writers, scholars, statesmen and reformers.
        Books written by Dr. Gabriel included ''The Course of American Democratic Thought,'' which focused on the views of American intellectual leaders, and a widely used textbook, ''The Story of American Democracy,'' co-written with Mabel D. Casner.
        Dr. Gabriel, a native of Reading, N.Y., received B.A., M.A. and doctorate degrees from Yale and was a member of the university's faculty from 1915 until he retired in 1958. In World War I, he served in the United States Army in France, rising to the rank of first lieutenant.
        Surviving are a daughter, Susan Cunliffe, of Dalham, England; two sons, Robert T., of Lexington, Mass., and John C., of North Haven, Conn.; nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
