        Herman R. Lantz, professor emeritus of sociology at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, died Wednesday of acute myocardial infarction at his home in Carbondale. He was 67 years old.
        Professor Lantz was an internationally recognized scholar on the sociology of the family, and he played an important role in developing the college's graduate programs. He retired in 1985 after 34 years with the university.
        He was the author or co-author of eight books and scores of articles. One of his best known works was ''People of Coal Town,'' published in 1958, a study of personality, values and motivations when a town's only industry is gone. He also wrote ''A Community in Search of Itself: A Case History of Cairo, Ill.''
        He is survived by his wife, Judith; two daughters, Sarah Woodside of Brunswick, Me. and Rachel Lantz of Carbondale, and a brother, Louis, of Los Angeles.
