        Mr. Kawakami, a 10-term Democrat, was on a deer-hunting trip on Lanai Island at the time.
        Vice Speaker Emilio Alcon will serve as Speaker until House Democrats decide who will replace Mr. Kawakami, who had held the post since January.
        Mr. Kawakami was first elected to the House in 1968 and became majority leader of the House in 1984. He was president of Big Save grocery stores on Kauai, and was a director of a Toyota automobile dealership.
        Mr. Kawakami leaves his wife, Bertha, and three children.
