        Archie Campbell, the cigar-puffing comedian who served up cornpone humor to ''Grand Ole Opry'' and ''Hee Haw'' television audiences for more than a quarter-century, died early today of complications of a heart attack he suffered June 15. He was 72 years old and lived in Bulls Gap, near here.
        Mr. Campbell began his career more than 50 years ago, when he helped create the ''Tennessee Barn Dance'' radio show, a live-music broadcast that also helped start the careers of Chet Atkins and Kitty Wells. He has since been host of a revived version of the ''Barn Dance'' program.
        Mr. Campbell said the American public could identify with ''Hee Haw'' because of its simplistic humor, which he and a half-dozen others wrote. ''I hope they don't ever go too modern or high class with the show,'' he said in a 1981 interview.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, Steven, of Nashville, and Phillip, of Powell, Tenn.
