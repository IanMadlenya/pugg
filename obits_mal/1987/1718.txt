        B. Jay Becker, one of the leading bridge players in the world, died Friday at his home in Flushing, Queens. He was 83 years old.  Mr. Becker won two world championships for the Bermuda Bowl as a member of United States teams -against Italy in 1951 and against Sweden in 1953. He represented the United States on four other occasions, finishing second in 1958 and 1965, third in 1960 and fourth in 1973.
        In 1973, when he was 69, Mr. Becker became the oldest player to compete at the championship level.
        Mr. Becker won 23 major team titles in national tournaments - the Vanderbilt Knockout, the Spingold Knockout and the Reisinger Board-a-Match event - setting a record that is likely to stand many years. His last victory, in the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1981, came when he was 76 and made him the oldest winner of a major bridge event.
        In pairs competition, he set another record by winning three major titles, open pairs, life master pairs and blue-ribbon pairs, in a two-year span, from 1962 to 1964. His partner in the victories was Dorothy Hayden, and they finished third in the 1966 World Pair Championship in Amsterdam. With Many Famous Players
        Mr. Becker was trained as a lawyer in his native Philadelphia, but turned to bridge as a career after a brief involvement with checkers. He rose to prominence quickly. When the American Contract Bridge League named 10 life masters in 1935, he was No. 6. He became a grand master when the World Bridge Federation instituted that title.
        He played with virtually all the famous players. In the 40's and 50's, Mr. Becker was an important member of group that included Howard Schenken, George Rapee, John Crawford, Sam Stayman and Sidney Silodor. They dominated the tournament scene, scoring a string of victories.
        For 15 years, Mr. Becker managed famous clubs in New York City: the Cavendish from 1942 to 1947, the Bridge Whist from 1948 to 1950 and the Regency from 1951 to 1956. He then became the bridge editor for the King Features Syndicate and wrote a daily column until his death. Since 1954, Mr. Becker had been on the Laws Commission of the American Contract Bridge League.
        Surviving are his wife, Esther; two sons, Steven, of Greenwich, Conn., and Michael, of Tenafly, N.J.; a daughter, Jean DeCastro of Queens, and four grandchildren.
