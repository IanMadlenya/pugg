        George Selkirk, the man who replaced Babe Ruth in the New York Yankees' outfield in 1934, died here this morning after a long illness. He was 79 years old.
        Nicknamed Twinkletoes for his distinctive walk, Selkirk played right field for the Yankees until 1942, when he joined the Navy to become an aerial gunner. He never played in the majors again after returning from the Navy. He hit .290 in his nine-year career with the Yankees.
        He was a manager in the minor leagues at Newark and Toledo, became a scouting director for the Kansas City A's after they moved from Philadelphia and later was general manager of the expansion Washington Senators.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma, a brother and two grandchildren.
