        From 1966 to 1969, he was chairman of the company's executive committee and, from 1969 until his retirement in 1985, vice chairman of the board.
        Born in Montclair, Mr. Kidde graduated from Princeton University in 1926. Two years later, he received a master's degree in engineering from the Stevens Institute of Technology.
