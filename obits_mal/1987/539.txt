        Mr. van Tongeren was known for small, elegant, finely crafted bronze sculptures that grew out of the ''Metaphysical'' paintings of Giorgio de Chirico and the Surrealist sculptures of Alberto Giacometti. Most of them looked like miniature stage sets occupied by geometrical props rather than by people.
        The walls, columns and steps of the theaters were mysterious and incomplete. They suggested Greek and Roman theaters, but it was unclear who would take their place on stage and what roles they would assume. If the imagery was in some way inscrutable, however, the surfaces were highly finished, and the edges, shapes and arrangements were carefully resolved.
        Mr. van Tongeren was born in Holland, Mich., and received bachelor of arts and master of fine arts degrees from the University of Colorado. He taught at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, San Diego State University, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver and the University of California at Berkeley.
        Mr. van Tongeren was a fixture in exhibitions of bronze sculpture, and in recent years he began experimenting with a larger scale. He was executive director of the Johnson Atelier Foundry in Mercerville, N.J., a center for bronze casting. His work is in the collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Brooklyn Museum.
        He is survived by a son, Trygve; his mother, Mrs. Frank Smith of Lincoln, Calif., and his father, Herk Sr., of Denver.
