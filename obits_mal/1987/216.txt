        Arnold Markle, the State's Attorney for New Haven since 1968 and the prosecutor of several members of the Black Panthers in the 1970's, died Thursday, apparently of a heart attack. He was 60 years old and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.
        He was stricken at his home late Thursday afternoon and was taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly before 6 P.M. after efforts to revive him failed.
        Mr. Markle, a native of New Haven, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and the Boston University Law School after service in the United States Navy. He served as an assistant United States Attorney in New Haven before being named the first statewide chief prosecutor for Connecticut's Circuit Court.
        Mr. Markle was the prosecutor in several important criminal cases, most notably the 1971 trial of Bobby Seale, the Black Panther leader who was charged with the murder of a member of the Panthers who was suspected of being a police informer. The trial ended with a deadlocked jury, and the charges were later dropped. However, of the 13 Black Panthers brought to trial in Connecticut, one was convicted and two pleaded guilty and were sentenced to life in prison.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane White; two sons, Peter, of Bethany, Conn., and Daniel, of New Haven; a daughter, Kathy Doheny of New Haven; his father, Dr. Samuel Markle of Hamden, Conn., and his sister, Barbara Weinstein of Boca Raton, Fla.
