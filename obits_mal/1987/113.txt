        Harry Darby, a Republican political figure in Kansas, died yesterday at the Bethany Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Darby, an industrialist, was a Republican national committeeman from Kansas from 1940 to 1964. He helped manage Gov. Alfred M. Landon's unsuccessful 1936 campaign for President. He backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York in 1948, and he was one of the few Dewey advisers to suggest that a Republican victory over President Truman was not a sure thing.
        In 1950, he became a United States Senator to fill out the term of Senator Clyde M. Reed. Mr. Darby also played a key role in the choice of Dwight D. Eisenhower over Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio as the 1952 Republican candidate for President.
