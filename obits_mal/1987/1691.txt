        Bobby Walston, the career scoring leader of the Philadelphia Eagles, died of a heart attack Wednesday morning. He was 58 years old.
        Walston, an end and place-kicker, spent 12 seasons with the Eagles, setting a club career record of 881 points. He was selected to the Pro Bowl, the National Football League all-star game, in 1961 and 1962.
        Walston's best overall season was in 1954, when he caught 11 touchdown passes and kicked 36 extra points and 4 field goals, giving him an Eagles single-season record of 114 points. That record stood for 30 seasons until Paul McFadden, a place-kicker, surpassed it by 2 points in 1984. Walston's 365 points after touchdowns are also a club career record.
