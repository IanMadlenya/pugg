        Bascom N. Timmons, a Washington correspondent who served scores of newspapers over nearly six decades, advised presidents from Calvin Coolidge to Franklin D. Roosevelt, and once sought the Vice Presidency, died today of pneumonia. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Timmons died at his home here, where he had been bedridden since last year.
        Born in Amarillo, Tex., Mr. Timmons began his career at the age of 16 at The Fort Worth Record. He later worked as a reporter for The Dallas Times Herald, The Amarillo News and The Milwaukee Sentinel. In 1912 he joined The Washington Post. In the 1920's he created a Washington bureau to serve papers in Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama, Louisiana and Ohio.
        In 1932, Mr. Timmons became president of the National Press Club and later worked to save the Press Club building here, which after the Depression was on the verge of foreclosure. He presuaded President Roosevelt to sign an amendment to the Federal bankruptcy law that blocked the foreclosure.
        In 1940, Mr. Timmons was disenchanted with the idea of a third term for Roosevelt and disappointed that his friend, John Nance Garner, the Vice President, would not be on the ticket again.
        Mr. Timmons decided, somewhat as a joke, to seek the nomination for vice president. Although he had the support of some Democrats and his peers in journalism, he did not have the votes and the nomination went to Henry A. Wallace.
        He was the author of three books, ''Garner Texas,'' ''Portrait of an American: A Biography of Charles Gates Dawes'' and ''Jesse H. Jones: The Man and the Statesman.'' Jones was a New Deal executive under Roosevelt; Dawes was Coolidge's Vice President.
