        In a home workshop, Mr. Bergman crafted instruments for members of his family. His daughter, Claire, is a violist with the New York City Opera Company and his son, Robert, plays with the Tanglewood Festival Orchestra in Massachusetts. Mr. Bergman also repaired instruments for other musicians.
        His making of violins, violas and cellos, which was self-taught, grew out of a lifelong passion for music. For many years he played cello and piano with amateur symphony orchestras.
        He was an electronics and aviation engineer and worked for Kollsman Instrument, Republic Aviation and the Grumman Corporation at different times over more than 30 years.
        He began making stringed musical instruments about 1975.
        He had been an instructor in engineering at City College and an associate professor of nautical science at the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, L.I., as well as a licensed professional engineer.
        Mr. Bergman, who was born in Manhattan, received his bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from City College.
        He is survived by his wife, Shirley; three sons, Jerome, of Manhattan, Robert, of Conway, Mass., and Andrew, of Cambridge, Mass., and a daughter, Claire, of Manhattan.
