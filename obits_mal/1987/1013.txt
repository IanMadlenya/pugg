        Mr. Rey appeared in at least 50 movies, including ''Mr. Majestyk,'' ''Blindfold,'' ''Swarm,'' ''Cuba,'' ''Synanon,'' ''Terrorvision'' and ''The Ninth Configuration.''
        He also had guest roles in such television series as ''Dallas,'' ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Naked City,'' ''Fantasy Island'' and ''Love Boat.'' He directed episodes of the comedy soap opera ''Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman'' and the situation comedy ''The Facts of Life.''
        In ''The Flying Nun'' he played Carlos Ramirez, a playboy who ran a discotheque in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and always ended up doing things for the local convent. Sally Field played Sister Bertrille in the series, which ran from 1967 to 1970 on ABC.
        In ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Robin Williams played a Soviet defector to the United States who seeks help from Mr. Rey.
        Born Feb. 8, 1930, in Buenos Aires, Mr. Rey became an American citizen in 1964, said his manager, Mitl Suchin.
        He is survived by his former wife, Joyce, and a son, Brandon.
