        Sender Rahmani, a Westchester real-estate developer, died of lung cancer Tuesday at the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 87 years old and a resident of White Plains.
        Mr. Rahmani, who was born in Russia and came to the United States in the 1940's after living in Palestine and Canada, was president of his own construction company in White Plains until he became ill about a year ago. He built about 250 homes and several office buildings in Westchester County. He also built a large number of homes in Venezuela and Mexico under the Kennedy Administration's Alliance for Progress program to accelerate economic and social development in Latin America.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara; two daughters, Ilana Adler of Armonk, N.Y., and Aviva Rahmani of San Marcos, Calif., and four grandchildren.
