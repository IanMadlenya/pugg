        Mr. Tibbles began writing songs after World War II. He was nominated for a 1948 Oscar for the ''Woody Woodpecker'' tune. The song, recorded by Kay Kyser, also topped the radio Hit Parade, which featured a young Frank Sinatra singing it for several weeks.
        Mr. Tibbles wrote the scripts for all 12 seasons of television's ''My Three Sons,'' as well as episodes for ''Leave It to Beaver,'' the ''Betty White Show'' and ''One Day at a Time.''
