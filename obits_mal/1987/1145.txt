        Cantor Steinhauer, the first cantor of the Reform temple, retired last year.
        He was born in the Bronx and served in the Army in World War II. In 1948 he went to Israel for three years and worked in a kibbutz, but he returned to the Bronx because he did not like the rigid rules of the kibbutz.
        He graduated from the Hebrew Union College for Sacred Music and from Queens College, where he received a Master of Arts degree.
        Cantor Steinhauer was president of the American Conference of Cantors and editor in chief of Jewish Music Notes, published by the Jewish Music Council.
        He is survived by his wife, Sondra; two sons, Michael, of Skokie, Ill., and Joshua, of San Francisco, and a brother, Nathan, of Manhattan.
