        Lester Gaba, who staged elaborate fashion shows in the 40's and 50's and created the lifelike display-window mannequins known as the Gaba Girls, died of cancer of the colon Wednesday at Beekman Downtown Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In addition to designing mannequins, Mr. Gaba for many years contributed a weekly column on window displays to Women's Wear Daily.
        Mr. Gaba was born in Hannibal, Mo., and moved to Chicago in 1930 to study art. While working as a delivery boy for a department store he did freelance work designing posters for which he fashioned figures out of soap and then photographed them. Advertising agencies seized on the technique and soon Mr. Gaba's soap carvings were adorning magazine covers as well as being marketed as a children's soap.
        By 1932 Mr. Gaba had moved to New York, where he created the ''Gaba Girls,'' life-sized, carved-soap mannequins modeled after well-known New York debutantess for the windows of Best & Company. He is perhaps best known for designing the lifelike mannequin known as Cynthia that was created for Saks Fifth Avenue.
        From 1941 to 1967, Mr. Gaba contributed a weekly column to Women's Wear Daily titled ''Lester Gaba Looks at Display'' in which he gave his observations about the ever-changing window displays at stores in the city.
        At the same time he began staging fashion shows for the Coty Awards, the March of Dimes, and fashion trade groups. The stagings were elaborate and theatrical, often involving marionettes or props such as the Hope diamond and the Star of the East.
        There are no survivors.
