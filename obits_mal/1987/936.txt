        William Lewis, the father of Carl Lewis, the Olympic gold medalist, died Tuesday of cancer. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Lewis and his wife, Evelyn, started the Willingboro Track Club in 1969 to interest local youth in athletics. More than 3,000 youngsters have participated in the club, including several all-America athletes and national record-holders.
        The club gave impetus to the athletic careers of Mr. Lewis's children, Carl -the winner of four gold medals at the Los Angeles Games - and Carol, a world-class long jumper. Mr. Lewis also coached girls' track at John F. Kennedy High School in Willingboro for seven years, compiling a 63-19 record. In 1979, he was named New Jersey Track Coach of the Year.
