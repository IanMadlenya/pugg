        Dr. E. Allen Petersen, who brought his wife and two men to safety by sailing a 36-foot boat across the Pacific Ocean as Japanese forces advanced on Shanghai in 1938, has died. He was 84 years old.
        Dr. Petersen, an osteopathic surgeon, had retired in Sonoma County several years ago. He died June 7 and his death was reported today.
        Dr. Petersen and his Japanese wife, Tani, were trapped with thousands of refugees when Japan conquered most of coastal China in 1937 and 1938. Unable to obtain passage on commercial liners, they bought a German-registered Chinese junk named Hummel Hummel and set sail.
        They arrived in Los Angeles Harbor 85 days later after traversing 5,000 miles, dodging Japanese warships and weathering storms.
        The trip established what was then a trans-Pacific record for a small boat. The book, ''Hummel Hummel,'' which was published in 1952, was Dr. Petersen's narration of the voyage.
        Dr. Petersen, whose wife died five years ago, is survived by a sister.
