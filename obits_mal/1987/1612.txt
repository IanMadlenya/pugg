        Abdel Muneim al-Kaisouni, Former Egyptian Finance and Economy Minister, died of a heart attack today in London, the national Middle East News Agency reported. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Kaisouni, a leading economist and an architect of economic policies under President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1960's, was taken to an intensive care unit in a London hospital last week, the agency said.
        Under President Anwar el-Sadat, Mr. Kaisouni's attempts as Deputy Prime Minister to carry out an International Monetary Fund program by raising food prices touched off street riots in 1977. The Government later repealed the price increases.
