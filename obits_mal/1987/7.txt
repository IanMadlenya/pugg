        Ben-Zion, a poet, writer, painter and sculptor, died after a heart attack Friday in his home in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        An emigrant from the Ukraine, he came here in 1920. He wrote fairy tales and poems in Hebrew under the name Benzion Weinman, but when he began painting he dropped his last name and hyphenated his first, saying an artist needed only one name.
        He was a member. along with such painters as Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb, of the Expressionist group ''The Ten.'' In the 1950's, he began working with welded iron sculpture. He also wrote essays on symbolism and insight in art.
        His works are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the National Maritime Museum in Haifa, Israel.
        Mr. Ben-Zion is survived by his wife, Lillian, and a brother, Ephrain Weinman, and a sister, Zippora Koch, both of Israel.
