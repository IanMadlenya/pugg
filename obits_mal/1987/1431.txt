        John J. Conroy, a former coach of tennis and squash at Princeton University, died of pneumonia Monday at the Medical Center at Princeton, N.J. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Conroy, who retired in 1973 after more than three decades with the university, was one of Princeton's most successful coaches. His tennis teams ran up 52 consecutive victories, for example, between 1960 and 1965.
        Born in Newport, R.I., he was a graduate of the University of New Hampshire and Columbia University, where he received a doctorate in education in 1952.
        He started at Princeton as varsity squash coach and assistant tennis coach in 1939. He was named head tennis coach in 1942. After three years as a Navy gunnery officer in World War II he returned to coaching.
        In 1969 he was named Princeton's associate director of athletics. Although he continued to coach tennis he stepped down as squash coach at that time. In 1985 he was inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene; two daughters, Dana Aymond of Jackson, Mich., and Linda Vaughn of Hillsborough, Calif.; a brother, Owen, of Cocoa Beach, Fla.; a sister, Teresa Bowley of Newport, R.I., and four grandchildren.
