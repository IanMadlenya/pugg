        Dr. William Withers, professor emeritus of economics at Queens College and chairman of the New York Teachers Pension Association, died Wednesday at Riverview Hospital in Red Bank, N.J. He was 81 years old and lived in Red Bank.
        Dr. Withers joined the Queens College faculty in 1937 and taught there until 1974, when he retired.
        In 1976, he organized the New York Teachers Pension Association and was its president until recently, when he stepped down to become chairman.
        Among the many books he wrote were ''Business in Society,'' ''Public Finance,'' ''The Crisis in Old Age Finance'' and ''Politics and Economic Policy, Hoover to Reagan.''
        He was born in St. Louis, and at an early age was brought to New York, where his father, Dr. John Withers, was head of the School of Education at New York University. The son earned several degrees, including a doctorate, at Columbia Unversity.
        Dr. Withers is survived by his wife, the former Irma Rittenhouse, and a brother, Charles, of Charlotte, N.C.
