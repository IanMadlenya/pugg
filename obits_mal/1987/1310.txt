        Robert A. Olson, a soil scientists and teacher, died Saturday of injuries suffered in a car accident. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Olson, a retired agronomist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, proved that excessive nitrogen fertilizer could actually hurt crop yield. He was one of the first to warn that improper use of fertilizer eventually would pollute ground water.
        In addition to his 38 years of teaching at the University of Nebraska, he was a consultant in Paris to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation in 1958 and in Vienna in 1962 for the International Atomic Energy Agency.
        He managed the Food for Hunger Campaign Fertilizer Program for the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome from 1967 to 1969, and was acting director of the Agricultural Division of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna from 1974-75.
