        Maurice Laporte, a writer and a leader of the French Communist Party in the early 1920's, died of leukemia Wednesday at his home in Geneva. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Laporte became a member of the youth section of the French Communist Party shortly after the Russian Revolution of 1917. At Stalin's invitation, he attended Communist congresses in Moscow. When Giuseppe DiMarche, a friend in the Italian Communist Party, was executed in Moscow in the early 1920's, Mr. Laporte resigned.
        He was the author of several books, including ''Stalin,'' published in the early 1930's, and ''Under the Steel Helmet,'' published in 1934, which dealt wth the rise of Hitler. He later turned to writing for newspapers and magazines in France and Switzerland.
        Mr. Laporte is survived by a son, Henri, of Hicksville, L.I.; a daughter, Simone Laporte, of Paris, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
