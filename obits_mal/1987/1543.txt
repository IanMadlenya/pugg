        The Rev. Teofil Bogucki, the outspoken mentor of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, who was killed by security policemen, has died after a stroke, the Warsaw Metropolitan Curia said today. He was 79 years old.
        Father Bogucki, who continued Father Popieluszko's monthly masses in support of the banned union Solidarity, drew vast crowds with his fiercely anti-Communist sermons.
        The Curia said he would be buried on Saturday beside the grave of Father Popieluszko, who was kidnapped and killed in 1984.
