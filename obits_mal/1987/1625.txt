        Mr. Anders, a native of Manhattan, was the president and co-founder in 1953 of the Hearthside Press. The company, which has since gone out of business, published cookbooks, craft and gardening books, including the original Weight Watchers cookbooks. The rights to the cookbooks were later sold to the New American Library. Mr. Anders retired in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nedda Casson; a son, Richard, of Brookline, Mass.; two brothers, Sam, of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Jack, of Lauderhill, Fla.; a sister, Rose Rothenberg of Hollywood, Fla.; and a granddaughter.
