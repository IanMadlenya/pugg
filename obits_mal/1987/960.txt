        Ting-Yung Hang, a former editor in chief and publisher of The China Tribune in New York, died of cancer Saturday at Parsons Hospital in Queens. He was 79 years old and lived in Fresh Meadows, Queens.
        Mr. Hang, a native of China, was an official of the Nationalist Party who helped organize a Chinese youth corps for the resistance against the Japanese invaders.
        He came to the United States toward the end of World War II and joined the staff of The China Tribune in 1951 as an editor, rising to editor in chief and publisher. The paper is a general-news, Chinese-language publication serving the Chinese community here.
        After his retirement nine years ago, he did research at the Center for Asian Studies of St. John's University and wrote a book for which he won a prize from the Sun Yat-sen Cultural Foundation in 1982. The book chronicled and analyzed the American travels of Dr. Sun, founder of the Chinese Republic, when he was organizing the revolution against the Ching dynasty.
        Mr. Hang is survived by his wife, Lok Chu-Fen.
