        Born to Bulgarian parents, Mr. Vassilev painted the official portrait of King Boris in 1927 and two years later painted Archbishop Angelo Roncalli, then the papal nuncio to Bulgaria, who became Pope John XXIII. He moved to Palm Beach in the 1940's and became a society artist, painting portraits of many of the resort community's wealthy residents.
