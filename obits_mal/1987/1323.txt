        Cardinal Stephanos Sidarouss, patriarch emeritus of the Coptic Catholic Church, died after an illness at age 83, a church spokesman said today.
        In Rome, the Vatican announced that Pope John Paul II sent a message of condolences over the death to the Cardinal's successor, Patriarch Stephanos Ghattas II.
        The Vatican announcement said Cardinal Sidarouss's death Sunday reduced the number in the Roman Catholic College of Cardinals to 138, including 36 who are over the age of 80 and thus barred from participating in any papal election.
        There are about 200,000 Coptic Catholics in Egypt. Unlike Orthodox Copts, they recognize the Roman Catholic Pope.
        Cardinal Sidarouss became patriarch in 1958 and stepped down in 1985. The church spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said the Cardinal had been in ''bad health'' but refused to specify his ailment.
