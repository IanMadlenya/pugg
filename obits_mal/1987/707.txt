        Samuel H. Shapiro, who served briefly as Governor in 1968, died today at home. He was 79 years old.
        The Kankakee County Coroner, James Orrison, said a preliminary report indicated that Mr. Shapiro had died of natural causes. The police were sent to his home after Mr. Shapiro, a lawyer, did not appear in court, Police Chief Timothy Nugent said.
        In May 1968 Lieutenant Governor. Shapiro, a Democrat, became Governor when Otto Kerner resigned to become a Federal judge, then was defeated at the polls in November by the Republican candidate, Richard Ogilvie.
        Samuel Shapiro was an infant when his family came to the United States in 1908 from Estonia and settled in Kankakee. He served 14 years in the Illinois General Assembly, followed by seven years as Lieutenant Governor until Governor Kerner resigned.
        Mr. Shapiro devoted much of his energy to mental health programs and facilities. While Governor, he called up the National Guard, at the request of Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago, before the start of the turbulent Democratic National Convention in 1968.
