        Pericle Fazzini, the sculptor whose monumental statue ''The Resurrection'' is the backdrop for Pope John Paul II's weekly general audiences, died today. He was 74 years old.
        The sculptor, a native of Grottammare on the eastern Italian coast, began his career as an exponent of the Roman school of the 1930's. His early wooden pieces, characterized by their simple style, led to the starker later figures, which he fashioned almost exclusively in metal, particularly bronze.
        The Vatican commissioned Mr. Fazzini to provide a work for its modern auditorium. The result was ''The Resurrection,'' a statue depicting Jesus rising from a nuclear bomb crater.
        ''Suddenly there came to me the idea of Christ preaching peace for 2,000 years, and the place where He prayed for the last time: the olive grove of Gethsemane,'' said Mr. Fazzini in a book about the work. ''I had the idea of depicting Christ as if He were rising again from the explosion of this large olive grove, peaceful site of His last prayers. Christ rises from this crater torn open by a nuclear bomb; an atrocious explosion, a vortex of violence and energy.''
        ''The Resurrection'' is molded in red bronze and yellow brass and measures 66 feet by 23 feet by 10 feet.
        It was unveiled by Pope Paul VI in 1977 and dominates the stage of the Vatican hall where the pope's general audiences are held.
        Among Mr. Fazzini's works is the bronze ''Sybil'' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and a giant sculpture of a sea shell commissioned by the City of Dallas.
        Mr. Fazzini is survived by his wife, Anita, and a daughter.
