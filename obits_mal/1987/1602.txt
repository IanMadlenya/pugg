        Gen. Golbery do Couto e Silva, the political strategist behind Brazil's 1964-1985 military Government, died Friday. He was 76 years old.
        Doctors at the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo, where he had been treated several times over the last six months, said General Couto e Silva died of pulmonary insufficiency caused by lung cancer.
        The general was considered the mastermind behind the military coup that toppled President Joao Goulart in 1964.
        Born Aug. 21, 1911, in the coastal town of Rio Grande, he began his military career in 1927 at the Realengo Military School in Rio de Janeiro and emerged on the political scene during the left-leaning presidency of Mr. Goulart.
        After the Goulart ouster, General Couto e Silva was the first head of the National Intelligence Service, which he called the ''Ministry of Silence.''
        From 1967 to 1969, he headed the budget office under military President Artur da Costa e Silva.
        During Gen. Emilio Medici's five-year term, called Brazil's most repressive years, Mr. Couto e Silva worked to place Gen. Ernesto Geisel in line for the presidency.
        In 1974 General Geisel was chosen as Brazil's President and General Couto e Silva became the President's closest adviser as the Cabinet-level Minister for Civilian Liaison.
        General Couto e Silva backed the country's last military President, Joao Figueiredo, for the job and pushed for the ''political opening'' that began in 1979 with an amnesty for political prisoners and exiles.
        General Couto e Silva left public life in 1981. Four years later, Brazil returned to civilian rule under President Jose Sarney.
        General Couto e Silva is survived by his wife and two chidren.
