        Van Ellis Huff, inventor of the jalousie window, died at home here last Thursday. He was 93 years old.
        Inspired by the homemade wooden slat windows in houses in the Bahamas, Mr. Huff, who held an engineering degree from the University of Florida, designed the hand-cranked glass, aluminum and screen window popular before air-conditioning.
        Jalousies became a multimillion-dollar industry, but Mr. Huff sold his share of the company in 1956 after complaining about underbidding and his salesmen's tactics.
