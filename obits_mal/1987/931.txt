        John Pierotti, who drew editorial and sports cartoons for The New York Post from 1950 to 1977, died yesterday in Delaware County Memorial Hospital in Drexel Hill, Pa. He was 75 years old and lived in West Chester, Pa.
        Mr. Pierotti also contributed to newspaper syndicates, national magazines and foreign publications and illustrated children's books and the magazine ''Gags.''
        Mr. Pierotti, whose father was an art professor in Rome and his mother a sculptress, got his first job as a copyboy at The New York World-Telegram, carrying cartoons to the engraving room. At night, he studied at the Art Students League, Cooper Union and the Mechanics Art Institute.
        He moved to The Washington Post in 1933 as a sports cartoonist. He switched to drawing such animated cartoons as ''Popeye'' and ''Betty Boop'' for a studio in 1935, and in 1937, he went to United Feature Syndicate to do lettering and backgrounds for Ernie Bushmiller's ''Fritzi Ritz,'' which later became ''Nancy.''
        In the 1940's, he drew sports and political cartoons for two short-lived New York newspapers, PM and The Star. After they folded, he became an editor-cartoonist at the McClure Syndicate before joining The Post.
        He was a charter member of the National Cartoonists Society and was its president for four years and secretary for nine years. He won the society's award as Best Editorial Cartoonist in 1975.
        Mr. Pierotti is survived by his wife, Orla; a daughter, Melba Osborn of Fremont, Neb.; and two grandchildren.
