        Dr. Peter Vogel, clinical professor of medicine emeritus at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a pioneer in hemolytic transfusions of the newborn to overcome the ''blue baby'' problem, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Vogel became associated with the hospital in 1929 as a resident pediatrician. He organized and became the first director of the hospital blood bank in 1950. He remained with the hospital for more than 50 years, retiring in 1980.
        Along with Dr. Philip Levine, he wrote the first article on the Rh factor in newborn births. He furnished the original sera that demonstrated Rh antibody incompatibility, a problem that results in blue babies. Later, he contributed to further understanding of blood incompatiblity problems of the newborn.
        Dr. Vogel was a founder and first medical director of the Blood Transfusion Association, which was later expanded to become the New York Blood Center.
        He was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and graduated from Wesleyan University in 1923 and Tufts Medical School in 1927.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Mandlebaum; a son, Dr. James M., of Manhattan; a daughter, Josephine V. Wolk of East Lansing, Mich., two sisters, Frances Birn of Manhattan and Rose Beckwith of New Haven, and two grandchildren.
