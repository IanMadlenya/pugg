        After Britain and her allies switched their support from Gen. Draja Mihailovich, leader of the Yugoslav Nationalist Resistance Forces, to Tito in 1943, Mr. Musulin, the son of Yugoslav immigrants, was appointed chief of a mission to rescue American airmen who had been forced down while flying over Mihailovich territory.
        On Aug. 4, 1944, after a parachute drop over unfamiliar Yugoslav territory, Mr. Musulin found 250 airmen who had been rescued by Yugoslav peasants. He evacuated them on Aug. 9 and 10. The evacuations continued until the close of the year. For his efforts, Mr. Musulin was awarded the Legion of Merit.
        Mr. Musulin enlisted in the Office of Naval Intelligence and joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 1950, where he remained until he retired in 1974.
        Mr. Musulin is survived by a son, Nicolas, and three daughters, JoAnne de la Riva, Milena Sanchez and Georgene Murray.
