        Jim Brewer, a former star relief pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, died of injuries suffered in an automobile accident here today, the National League club said.
        Mr. Brewer, who was 50 years old, was involved in a head-on car collision. He was taken to Medical Center Hospital in Tyler, where he was pronounced dead.
        Mr. Brewer, a left-hander, appeared in the World Series three times and in an All-Star game once as a Dodger. He compiled a 69-65 won-lost record and 3.07 earned run average in a 17-year major league career that began with the Chicago Cubs in 1960 and ended with the California Angels in 1976.
        He recorded 132 saves, 125 of them with Los Angeles, where he played from 1964 to 1975. The Dodgers' career leader in saves, Mr. Brewer appeared in 494 games for the club. Only two Dodger pitchers, Don Sutton and Don Drysdale, have more appearances.
        A native of Merced, Calif., Mr. Brewer served as pitching coach at Oral Roberts University and Northwestern before rejoining the Dodgers organization this year as pitching coach for its Great Falls, Mont., farm team.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and three children, Mark, Scott, and Shanan.
