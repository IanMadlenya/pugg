        Prof. Alex B. Novikoff, a cellular biologist and a professor of pathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine for the last 28 years, died Friday at the college's hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        In 1953, after he refused a request by the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security to identify Communists among former colleagues at Brooklyn College, Professor Novikoff was dismissed by the University of Vermont's College of Medicine. Twenty years later, the university apologized by presenting him with an honorary degree while 8,000 people gave him a standing ovation.
        He was born in Russia, grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and received B.S., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia University, which gave him its Distinguished Service Award in 1960. He has been honored annually by the National Cancer Institute with a career professorship award since 1962.
        Professor Novikoff wrote, with Eric Holtzman, ''Cells and Organelles,'' a widely-used textbook on the substructures of cells. He also wrote science books for children.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Phyllis Novikoff, an associate professor of pathology at Albert Einstein College; two sons, Kenneth, of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Lawrence, of South Euclid, Ohio; two sisters, Lillian and Sonia, and two grandchildren.
