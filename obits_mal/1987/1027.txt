        Indian leaders paid tribute to Dr. Ali. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said he was ''widely admired and loved.''
        Born at Bombay in November 1897 into a business family, Dr. Ali developed an early interest in birds. He traveled to Berlin in 1929 to study, and when he returned to India he was appointed editor of the journal of the Bombay Natural History Society, a pioneering environmental institution.
        He received many honors, among them the Union Gold Medal from the British Orintholigists Union, the John Philips Memorial Medal from the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the International Getty Prize and the Order of the Golden Ark from the Netherlands.
        At home, he received two of the nation's top civilian awards for his work in wildlife conservation. In 1985, Prime Minister Gandhi named him to the House of Elders in Parliament.
        His wife died more than 30 years ago. They had no children.
