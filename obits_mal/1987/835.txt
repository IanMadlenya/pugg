        Franklin Bandy, who wrote mystery and suspense novels and was a director and a former executive vice president of the Mystery Writers of America, died Saturday at the White Plains Hospital Medical Center in White Plains. He was 72 years old and lived in Rye Brook, N.Y.
        For ''Deceit and Deadly Lies,'' Mr. Bandy won the Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1979 for the best paperback original mystery novel published in 1978.
        Dorothy Salisbury Davis, a director and a former president of the Mystery Writers of America, said, ''Frank wrote about fallible and vulnerable people, and he was very good at it.''
        He was born in Atlanta and earned a B.A. from the University of Illinois. After working as a newspaperman and encyclopedia editor and serving as an Army captain in World War II, he was an account executive with the Caples Company and other Manhattan advertising agencies.
        His other novels included ''Murder Trapp,'' ''The Money Murders,'' ''Bold House'' and ''Blackstock Affair.'' His eighth novel, ''Athena,'' is to be published this year.
        Mr. Bandy is survived by his wife, Beth; two sons, Franklin 3d, of Chicago, and John, of Rye Brook, and a granddaughter.
