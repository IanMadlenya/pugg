        Henry D. Baer, a retired president of the Schrade Cutlery Corporation, a manufacturer of pocket and hunting knives, died Sunday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Baer was president of the company for more than 35 years. He was also a vice president of the Imperial Schrade Corporation, Schrade's parent company.
        In 1983 he was elected to the Cutlery Hall of Fame by members of the hardware industry for his contributions to the field of cutlery. A line of pocket and hunting knives known as ''Uncle Henry'' knives was named after him.
        Mr. Baer, who was born in Manhattan, started out in his uncle's furniture hardware business here. In the early 1940's he and his younger brother Albert formed the Ulster Knife Company.
        Ulster Knife acquired the Schrade-Walden Cutlery Company and the combined venture became a major supplier of bayonets and pocket knives to the United States Government during World War II.
        After the war, Ulster and Schrade merged with the Imperial Knife Company of Providence to form the Imperial Schrade Corporation.
        Mr. Baer is survived by his wife Elsa; a son, Henry, and a brother, Albert, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
