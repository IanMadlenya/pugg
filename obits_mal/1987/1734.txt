        ''He was an inspiration to a whole generation of correspondents who looked to him for guidance, support and, when the occasion called for it, solace and comfort,'' said Nate Polowetzky, who succeeded Mr. Bassett as foreign editor in 1973.
        Known by staff members of The A.P. as a gruff and demanding chief, Mr. Bassett would drop the hard exterior as soon as he stepped out to lunch.
        Mr. Bassett started with the wire service in its Kansas City, Mo., bureau in 1930. He became foreign news editor in 1948, supervising coverage of such events as the decolonization of Africa and the Korean and Vietnam Wars.
        After retiring, Mr. Bassett contributed to Cleartime, a newsletter for former employees of The A.P. and was editor from 1980 to 1984. He was a member of Sigma Delta Chi, the National Society of Professional Journalists.
        Born in a farming family in Topeka, Kan., Mr. Bassett began his career as a reporter at The Topeka State Journal while in high school. He then became a reporter at The New Bedford (Mass.) Standard, where he stayed three years before joining The A.P.
        Surviving are his wife, Eileen Grace Ewing; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Manhattan, and two sons, Jonathan, of Denver, and W. Brian, of Easton, Conn.
