        Prime Minister Errol W. Barrow died at his residence today, the Government announced. He was 67 years old.
        The cause of his death was not announced. Relatives had reported that Mr. Barrow had been in poor health for some time, officials said.
        Deputy Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford, Minister of Education and leader of the House of Assembly, was sworn in as Mr. Barrow's successor by Governor General Sir Hugh Springer, who represents the British Crown in this Commonwealth nation.
        Mr. Barrow, a British-educated lawyer and a navigation officer in the Royal Air Force during World War II, led this island, the easternmost of the Windward chain in the Caribbean, to independence from Britain in November 1966.
        He was first elected to office in 1951 as a member of the Barbados Labor Party, but resigned from the party in 1955 to form his own Democratic Labor Party. In 1961 it gained a majority and Mr. Barrow became premier of a pre-independence, home-rule administration.
        As Prime Minister after independence, he put foward ambitious development programs for the island, diversifying an economy whose mainstays were sugar cane and tourism. He was also a vigorous supporter of pan-Caribbean movements, advocating that Barbados look toward neighbors in the hemisphere rather than toward Europe.
        He governed Barbados for three consecutive terms before he was defeated in September 1976 by the Barbados Labor Party, led by Tom Adams. However, he was returned to office in May 1986, defeating Bernard St. John, when the Democratic Labor Party won 24 out of 27 seats in the House of Assembly.
        He is survived by his wife, Carolyn, the daughter of an Episcopal priest from Montclair, N.J., and two children, Lesley and David.
