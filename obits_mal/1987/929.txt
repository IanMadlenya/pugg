        Mr. Liptrott was named president and chief executive officer in 1964, and he oversaw a major expansion of the daily newspaper's international coverage, which included closely following the reform of the international monetary system in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The newspaper also broadened its coverage of bank marketing while marketing was still in its embryonic stage within the financial industry. Mr. Liptrott retired in 1969.
        He is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Cannon of Sarasota, and Fanny Booth, of Arlington Heights, Ill.; a daughter, Sally Edmondson, of Medford Lakes, N.J., and two grandchildren.
