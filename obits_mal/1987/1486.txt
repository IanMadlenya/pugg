        Jerome L. Reinstein, an acting State Supreme Court justice who was to preside over the trial of Larry Davis next week on charges of killing four Bronx drug dealers, died Monday after collapsing in the Bronx County Courthouse. He was 59 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        Judge Reinstein, who collapsed on a stairway of the courthouse, was pronounced dead on arrival at Lincoln Hospital. A hospital spokesman said a medical examiner had determined he had had a heart attack.
        Judge Burton B. Roberts, Administrative Judge of the Bronx Supreme Court's criminal division, who called Judge Reinstein ''a scholar'' and ''a fine, fine man,'' said no decision had been made on his replacement at the trial, which was scheduled to begin Sept. 10.
        Judge Reinstein was appointed to the city's Criminal Court by Mayor Koch in 1979 and later designated an acting Supreme Court justice.
        He began practicing law after graduating from Brooklyn Law School in 1951. From 1972 to 1977, he served as a law clerk in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court. He had been an adjunct professor of real property law at Baruch College.
        He is survived by a daughter, Amy Augenstein of Manhattan, and a brother, David, of Chatsworth, Calif.
