        George Dennison, a novelist and short-story writer who was widely praised for his factual account of the education of poor children from minority families on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, died of lung cancer last Thursday at his home in Temple, Me. He was 62 years old.
        In 1964, Mr. Dennison joined the First Street School, a small private school in New York founded by Mabel Christie, who later became his wife. From his experiences there, in 1969 he wrote ''The Lives of Children,'' which became a best seller. It was published in 10 countries, and is regarded as a classic study of the free-school movement as well as of child development.
        In a review of ''The Lives of Children'' in The New York Times Book Review on Sept. 14, 1969, Herbert Kohl called it ''a moving account of a school that worked and yet failed to survive, an important contribution to the philosophy of education and a practical handbook on the creation of a small neighborhood school.'' Critic, Playwright and Therapist
        During the 1960's, Mr. Dennison began a close association with the Bread and Puppet Theater that continued until his death. At the same time, he served as an art critic, a playwright and a Gestalt therapist.
        Mr. Dennison was the author of a series of stories in 1979 called ''Oilers and Sweepers,'' a novel, ''Luisa Domic,'' in 1985, and a collection of stories, ''A Tale of Pierrot,'' this year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Susan, Rebecca and Michael, all of Temple; a brother, Richard, of Minneapolis, and a sister, Adele Peterson of Lynwood, Wash.
