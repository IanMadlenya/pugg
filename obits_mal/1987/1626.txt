        Lino Ventura, an Italian-born film actor who specialized in playing gravel-voiced tough guys on both sides of the law, died in France on Thursday at the age of 68.
        Mr. Ventura was stricken with a heart attack at his home in Saint Cloud, a suburb of Paris, according to paramedics.
        The actor was born Lino Borrini in Parma, Italy, but his family moved to France when he was 8 years old. He was a wrestling champion in his youth.
        Mr. Ventura made dozens of French films, starring in comedies as well as dramas.
        Once described as ''a French version of John Wayne,'' Mr. Ventura often played detectives in crime movies, but he was equally likely to be cast as a professional assassin, a gangster, a burglar or a rumrunner. Among his films was the award-winning ''Garde a Vue,'' a 1981 psychological thriller in which he played a police investigator.
        Mr. Ventura and his wife, Odette, had one son and three daughters, one of whom was mentally retarded. The couple established a foundation called Perce-Neige to raise money to help retarded children.
        The French Prime Minister, Jacques Chirac, issued a statement mourning the actor's death: ''Lino Ventura was certainly above all a great popular star of French cinema. He was also generous and faithful in friendship, and devoted himself to important causes. His sudden death saddens me deeply.''
