        Victor A. Lord Jr., an Albany lawyer who was a top official of the New York State Liberal Party, died Tuesday in Troy, N.Y., in what the police termed a suicide. He was 62 years old.
        Capt. Albert Prezio of the Troy police said Mr. Lord was seen by witnesses about 11 A.M. Tuesday leaping from the Green Island Bridge over the Hudson River. His car was found later in a parking lot near the bridge. The body was recovered by state police divers.
        For many years, Mr. Lord had been the leader of the Liberal Party in Albany, and he had also served as a state vice chairman of the party. Last September he was elected secretary of the party's state committee, the organization's second highest position.
        Mr. Lord was a partner in the Albany law firm of McNamee, Lochner, Titus & Williams. A graduate of Cornell University and the Yale Law School, he had been in law practice in Albany since 1951.
        He is survived by his wife, Athena; a son, Christopher, of Bridgeport, Conn., and three daughters, Sara of Washington, Victoria of Dublin, and Alexandra of Albany.
