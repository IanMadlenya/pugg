        Earl Montgomery, a supporting actor who made his Broadway debut in 1947 and appeared in many plays as well as in movies and on television, died last Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 65 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Montgomery, who was born in Memphis and who graduated from Harvard University in 1943, first appeared in New York in Brecht's ''Galileo,'' starring Charles Laughton. Over the years, he was seen in City Center productions of ''Love's Labour's Lost'' and ''The Merchant of Venice'' and with the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater company in ''The Caucasian Chalk Circle'' and ''The Alchemist.''
        His other credits included ''A Visit to a Small Planet,'' ''Becket,'' ''Summer and Smoke'' and Jean Anouilh's ''Rehearsal.'' He was last seen on Broadway in 1973 in ''The Waltz of the Toreadors'' at the Circle in the Square.
        Mr. Montgomery was a founder-member of the Association of Producing Artists, a group of actors who worked hard for little pay in the 1960's to take the classics on tour and had their Manhattan home at the Folksbiene on the Lower East Side.
        More recently, he played character roles in the movies, including ''Rocky II'' and ''Heaven Can Wait,'' and appeared in television films and series.
        Mr. Montgomery is survived by his stepmother, Ruth, of Memphis, and two stepbrothers, John, also of Memphis, and Michael of Sacramento, Calif.
