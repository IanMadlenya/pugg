        Fred N. Howser, a fiery District Attorney of Los Angeles and Attorney General of California who sparred with politicians, journalists and celebrities in the 1940's, died Sunday. He was 82 years old.
        He quarreled in and out of court with Gov. Earl Warren, lost a libel suit against Drew Pearson, the syndicated newspaper columnist, and fought with Fletcher Bowron, then Mayor, over what he said was widespread gambling and vice in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Howser was appointed District Attorney for Los Angeles County in February 1943 and was elected to the office in 1944. He defeated Edmund G. Brown Sr., who later became Governor, in a spirited campaign for State Attorney General in 1946 but was defeated for re-election in 1950.
        For the past 37 years he has been in private law practice.
