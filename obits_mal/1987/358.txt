        Raoul D. Edwards, the editor of United States Banker magazine since 1983, died of a heart attack Thursday after a staff meeting at the Westchester Country Club in Rye, N.Y. He was 59 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        Mr. Edwards, a native of Manhattan, attended New York University and Northwestern University and went to work for American Banker, another trade magazine, in 1953.
        Mr. Edwards eventually became the publication's Washington bureau chief and moved to United States Banker in 1977. Based in Greenwich, Conn., the monthly has a circulation of about 22,000 copies, read mostly by officers of commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, investment and finance firms and insurance companies.
        Mr. Edwards is survived by his wife, Jean; two sons, Jonathan and Guthrie, and a brother, Bruce, of Brooklyn.
