        Sir Geoffrey H. S. Jackson, the British diplomat who spent eight months in a dungeon in 1971 after being kidnapped by Uruguayan guerrillas, died on Thursday, his family said today. He was 72 years old.
        Sir Geoffrey, who was the British Ambassador to Uruguay, was seized by leftist Tupamaro guerrillas who ambushed his chauffeur-driven car in Montevideo in January 1971.
        He spent 245 days in a damp dungeon. The British Government refused to bargain for his release.
        The diplomat, who was widely admired for his stoicism in the ordeal, eventually persuaded his captors that there was no longer any reason to hold him. In the week before his release, virtually all the Tupamaro political prisoners held by the Uruguayan Government, whose exchange the kidnappers had sought, escaped from a Montevideo prison.
        He published three books based on his experiences.
