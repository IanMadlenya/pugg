        Gilberto Freyre, an internationally acclaimed sociologist and prolific author, died of a brain hemorrhage today, his doctor said. He was 87 years old.
        Dr. Hilton Chaves said on Radio JB that Mr. Freyre died in the northeastern city of Recife, his birthplace.
        Mr. Freyre left Recife at the age of 17 and was educated at various American universities. He returned to Brazil five years later and in 1933 wrote his most famous work, ''Casa Grande e Senzala.'' Published in English as ''The Masters and the Slaves,'' it is a study of the often harmonious but sometimes antagonistic relationship between Brazil's Portuguese colonizers and their African slaves.
        The book was translated into five languagues and established Mr. Freyre's reputation worldwide.
        In his 120 books, most of them scholarly treatises, Mr. Freyre sometimes defended highly controversial positions. He argued, for example, that the Portuguese were the best adapted to colonize tropical regions because they had liberal tendencies and their Roman Catholic traditions were tempered by Moorish and Jewish influences.
        Mr. Freyre was a federal congressman from 1946 to 1951, and helped rewrite the nation's constitution.
        He taught at many colleges, including Columbia and Stanford.
        Other books he wrote include ''The Mansions and the Shanties: The Making of Modern Brazil,'' ''Mother and Son,'' and ''New World in the Tropics.''
        Mr. Freyre is survived by his wife, Magdalena, and two children.
