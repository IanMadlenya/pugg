        He attended the three-power conferences held by the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain in Yalta and Potsdam as a member of his country's delegation and represented the Soviet Union at other conferences after the war in the increasingly acrimonious discussions about postwar Europe.

        He was then appointed counselor to the Soviet Foreign Minister.
