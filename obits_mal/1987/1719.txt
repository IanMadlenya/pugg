        Mr. Worth, born in Rome, N.Y., was originally named Coleman Rothmund. His father, a tailor, also operated a minstrel show where Mr. Worth, his sister and his brother learned to perform before running away to join the vaudeville circuit.
        Mr. Worth made his Broadway debut in 1927 in ''A la Carte.'' His Broadway credits later included ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and ''Seventy Girls Seventy,'' as well as national tours of ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''Man of La Mancha.''
        Mr. Worth and his wife, Marcia Ray, toured for many years as a vaudeville act called ''Coley Worth and Marcia.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Caroline Worth-Tyrrell of Morristown, N.J., Wendy Worth of New York City and Penny Worth Anderson of Chicago; a son, Peter, of Stuart, Fla.; and four grandchildren.
