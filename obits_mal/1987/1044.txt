        Jacob Sapirstein, the founder of the American Greetings Corporation of Cleveland, a major manufacturer of greeting cards and related products, died Wednesday at his home in University Heights, Ohio. He was 102 years old.
        Mr. Sapirstein founded the company in 1906, selling post cards from a horse drawn wagon in Cleveland. Over the years the family-run enterprise grew into a $1 billion business with 23,000 employees.
        Mr. Sapirstein emigrated from Poland to Boston in 1905 with the help of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. He worked for a time as a tailor's apprentice in Chicago. Then in 1906, relatives invited him to work in their card shop in a Cleveland hotel and he accepted.
        The card shop was later closed but Mr. Sapirstein set himself up in business in a Cleveland boarding house. He bought post cards, or ''view cards'' as they were called, and resold them to drug stores, candy stores and novelty shops.
        The Sapirstein Greeting Card Company began manufacturing cards in the 1930's.
        Mr. Sapirstein stepped down as president in 1960 and a number of years ago relinquished the chairmanship although he remained a director.
        Survivors include three sons, Irving, Morris and Harry Stone of Cleveland, all of whom changed their name from Sapirstein to Stone; a daughter, Bernice Davis of Cleveland; 12 grandchildren, 21 great grandchildren and six great-great grandchildren.
