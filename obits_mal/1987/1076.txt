        Edward A. Eppinger, who built a fishing-lure empire through the sale of the Dardevle lure, died Monday at his home here. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Eppinger sold more than 2 million Dardevle lures each year through his Eppinger Manufacturing Company. The popular spoon-style lure, developed in 1906 by his uncle, Lou Eppinger, was hailed by Field and Stream magazine as ''the one lure most likely to be found in every tackle box.''
        The lure was originally called the Osprey, but in 1918 was renamed the Dardevle to honor Marines nicknamed Dare Devils who had fought in World War I. Mr. Eppinger, who would reserve 90 days each year to go fishing, was a member of the National Fishing Hall of Fame.
