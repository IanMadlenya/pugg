        Dr. Ehrlich, who practiced in Putnam Valley, helped found Putnam County's first mental health clinic in the late 1950's. In 1986, a treatment center for the mentally disabled was named for him in Cold Spring, N.Y.
        When Dr. Ehrlich received his doctorate in psychology from New York University in 1942, he had already been teaching psychology at City College for a number of years.
        He later became chief psychologist at Bronx Community College, retiring in the mid-1970's. He also worked as a clinical psychologist of the New York City Department of Corrections.
        He is survived by a daughter, Marianne Papageorgiou of Houston, and a granddaughter.
