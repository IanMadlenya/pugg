        Christopher Maytag, the 30-year-old great-grandson of the founder of the Maytag home appliance company, died of a drug overdose on Tuesday, the Medical Examiner's office ruled yesterday.
        The heir to the Maytag fortune was found semiconscious, slumped in a hallway Tuesday afternoon at a known drug-buying location, at 140 Columbia Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, the police said.
        He was taken to Beekman Hospital where he died two hours after he arrived. The cause of death was ''chronic intravenous narcotism,'' according to Francine Caridi, a spokesman for the Medical Examiner's office.
        She said a chemical study was under way to determine the type of drug he used. His arms contained fresh needle marks from drug injections when he was found, the police said.
        The Maytag heir lived in an apartment at 8 East 63d Street, owned by his mother, Shirley King, who learned of her son's death while traveling in Europe, the police said.
        His father, Robert, who died in 1962, was the grandson of Frederick Maytag, who founded the home appliance company.
        After his death, Mrs. Maytag married Kerryn King, a senior vice president of Texaco.
        The police said no one was being charged in the death since indications were that the fatal drug dose was self-administered.
