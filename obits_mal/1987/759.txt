        The Rev. Pierre Benoit, a Dominican priest, biblical scholar and expert on the Dead Sea Scrolls, died Thursday of cancer at St. Joseph's Hospital in Jerusalem. He was 81 years old.
        Father Benoit became editor of the unpublished fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1971. The scrolls, the library of a Jewish sect of the First Century, were discovered in caves near the Dead Sea in 1947.
        As editor, Father Benoit headed a team of scholars from around the world who have published about 70 percent of the 40,000 fragments found in one of the caves.
        Father Benoit was born in Nancy, France, in 1906, entered the Dominican order in 1924 and was ordained in 1930.
        In 1933, he was appointed New Testament professor at the Ecole Biblique et Archeologique Francaise in Jerusalem. He was director of the school from 1965 to 1972 and retired in 1976, but continued to teach the topography of Jerusalem until 1984.
        From 1972 to 1987, Father Benoit was a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, a group of scholars that advises the Vatican on biblical issues.
        The funeral will be Monday at St. Stephen's Church in Jerusalem.
