        Anton Pieck, a painter whose quaint 19th-century scenes have appeared on millions of Christmas cards worldwide, died Wednesday. He was 92 years old.
        His oils, watercolors, etchings and engravings, woodcuts and lithographs number in the thousands, with millions of copies in circulation. A favorite theme was daily life, often in an idealized version in which the rags of the poor were more picturesque than pathetic.
        Mr. Pieck, the son of a lighthouse keeper, began drawing at the age of 3. He was a high school art teacher for 40 years until 1960. He then devoted himself to his artwork full time.
