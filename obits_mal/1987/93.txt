        Harry Avirom, the supervisor of the demolition of many New York City landmarks, including Ebbets Field, the old Belmont Park and the Polo Grounds, died of heart disease Sunday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 72 years old and lived in Santa Monica.
        Mr. Avirom, a longtime Brooklyn resident and Dodgers fan, offered thousands of Ebbets Field seats to other fans free when he was overseeing the demolition of the ballpark for a housing project in 1960. His press agent said Mr. Avirom was ''not insensitively tearing up'' the site. He donated key paraphernalia from Ebbets Field and the Polo Grounds to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
        Mr. Avirom, who moved to Santa Monica 12 years ago, was the president of Harry Avirom Affiliates Inc., a demolition company. He was a former manager and vice president of the Wrecking Corporation of America and a former president of the Wreckers Association, a trade group.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Boys High School.
        Survivors include a daughter, Tina, of Santa Monica; two sisters, Rose Gaday of Brooklyn and Sarah Meisel of Miami Beach, and two brothers, Sam, of North Miami Beach, and Willy, of Orlando, Fla.
