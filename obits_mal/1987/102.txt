        Matt Hazeltine, one of three former San Francisco 49ers players stricken with Lou Gehrig's disease in the last two years, died from the disease Wednesday. He was 53 years old.
        Hazeltine, a linebacker with the 49ers from 1955 to 1968, was named to the Pro Bowl in 1963 and 1965 and was team captain for five years after being drafted out of the University of California at Berkeley.
        His death from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis came a month after the death of a former 49er running back, Gary Lewis, from the same disease.
