        Mr. Newbold, trained as an engineer at Princeton University, spent his entire career in the aviation industry, starting in 1940 as a trainee test engineer with the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. In 1967 he was hired by Rolls-Royce as a consultant, and nine years later was named executive vice president of business development.
        He retired from Rolls-Royce in 1984, but continued to act as a full-time consultant and as a board member of Rolls-Royce Inc. and Rolls-Royce Holdings Inc.
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah; two daughters, Eleanor N. Sinkler of Elverson, Pa., and Marion N. Terrell of Laguna Hills, Calif.; and a son, Thomas E. of Stamford, Conn.
