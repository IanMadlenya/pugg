        Alfred Y. Allee, a former Texas Ranger who gained national attention fighting political bosses and breaking up farmworker strikes in south Texas, died of cancer Monday. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Allee worked as a deputy sheriff in Zavala County before joining the rangers in 1931. He left the group in 1933 when Gov. Miriam (Ma) Ferguson was in office. He rejoined the Rangers in 1935 after the group was placed under the direction of the Department of Public Safety, attaining the rank of captain in 1947.
        He began receiving national attention in the 1950's when he investigated political corruption in Duval County. In the 1960's he sought to break up farmworker strikes in the Rio Grande Valley and was accused of brutality against the predominantly Mexican-American laborers. He retired in 1970 in Carrizo Springs.
