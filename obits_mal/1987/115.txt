        Seymour J. Phillips, chairman of the board of Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation and vice president of Beth Israel Medical Center, died of a heart attack Friday in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
        The Manhattan-based company, which began in 1881 in Pottsville, Pa., with his grandfather, Moses Phillips, selling homemade shirts from a pushcart to coal miners, emerged under Seymour Phillips's leadership in the last 45 years to become a major manufacturer and retailer of men's apparel. Its lines include Van Heusen shirts and Cricketeer clothing.
        Mr. Phillips joined the company in 1924, after graduating from Columbia University, and succeeded his father, Isaac, as president in 1941. He served as president until 1967, when he became chairman.
        Mr. Phillips is survived by his wife, Madelyn Shapiro Phillips, of Manhattan; two sisters, Libby Marcus and Sylvia Gilman, both of Manhattan; a son, Lawrence, of Manhattan; a daughter, Carol Nash of Chicago; five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
