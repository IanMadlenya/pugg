        Carter W. Clarke, a retired brigadier general who headed a War Department investigation of the military intelligence role in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in Clearwater, Fla. He was 90 years old.
        The 1944 and 1945 investigation, one of a number involving the attack on Pearl Harbor, looked into the handling of top secret communications by military intelligence units shortly before the Dec. 7, 1941, attack.
        In September 1944, as an Army intelligence colonel, he carried a secret letter from the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. George C. Marshall, to the 1944 Republican Presidential nominee, Thomas E. Dewey, asking Dewey not to discuss the breaking of the Japanese and German codes. Dewey acceded to his request, General Marshall subsequently told a Congressional committee.
        General Clarke, who joined the Army in 1916, served in World War I, World War II and the Korean War, when he commanded forces in Osaka, Japan. Shortly before his retirement in 1954 he was an assistant to Allen W. Dulles, then Director of Central Intelligence.
        General Clarke is survived by his wife, Jessie; a son, Carter Jr., also a retired brigadier general, two grandchildren and a great grandchild.
