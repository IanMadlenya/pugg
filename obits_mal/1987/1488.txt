        Drew (Bundini) Brown, who worked as a cornerman and assistant trainer for Muhammad Ali throughout the former heavyweight champion's career, died Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles. Hospital officials declined to give the cause of death. Mr. Brown, who was 57 years old, was said to have undergone surgery earlier in the week.
        Mr. Brown joined the entourage of Ali in the early 1960's when the young boxer was known as Cassius Clay and remained with him until his final fight, a loss to Trevor Berbick in 1981. He was credited with originating the champion's famous battle cry, ''Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.''
        Mr. Brown also appeared as an actor in several films, including ''Shaft'' and ''The Color Purple.''
        Mr. Brown is survived by his son, Drew Brown 3d. The funeral will be held in Sanford, Fla., Mr. Brown's hometown, but the date has not been set.
