        Mr. Tyner began his business career with W. A. Harriman & Company, investment brokers, and from 1923 to 1930 he was associated with Paine Webber. He left to start his own firm of Peabody, Tyner & Company, Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        He entered the banking business in 1949 as executive vice president and later president of the New Rochelle Trust Company. Through consolidation with a number of other banks it eventually became the National Bank of Westchester. He was chairman of the bank from 1954 to 1967, when he retired.
        He was born in Stamford, Conn., and graduated from Wesleyan University in 1923. He was chairman of the university's finance committee for many years.
        Mr. Tyner is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Bradley; a daughter, Lydia Anderson of Old Greenwich, four grandchildren and one great-grandson.
