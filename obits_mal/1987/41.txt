        Phillip J. DiNatale, the chief investigator in the Boston Strangler case, died Sunday at the home of a daughter here. He was 67 years old. Mr. DiNatale was a Boston detective in 1963 when he was assigned to head the investigation of the killings of 13 women in the Boston area from 1962 to 1964.
        He was credited with putting together clues indicating that Albert H. DeSalvo was the strangler. Mr. DeSalvo was never tried for the killings and was slain in the state prison in 1973. He was serving a sentence for robbery, burlary and sexual assault on four women in Cambridge and Arlington, not connected to the stranglings.
        Mr. DiNatale resigned from the Police Department in 1968, after 22 years on the force, to work as a technical adviser on a film about the Boston Strangler case.
