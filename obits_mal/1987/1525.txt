        Dr. Fremont, a cardiovascular specialist, served on the staff at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan.
        He was born in Vienna on Dec. 12, 1912, and graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School in 1936.
        A Jew, he was smuggled through Nazi lines in a coffin in July 1938 after his parents were slain by German troops in Vienna.
        He came to the United States and in 1944 joined the Army Medical Corps. Dr. Fremont was a staff physician at the Nuremburg trials of German war criminals and was discharged as a major in 1947.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; a daughter, Maureen Fremont, a stepdaughter, Natalie Kessler of Pomona, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
