        Professor Cerny, who had been suffering from heart disease, reportedly died Thursday in a Prague hospital.
        Professor Cerny, a dominant cultural personality in Czechoslovakia over the last 50 years, was an author of the first Charter 77 document and had taken an active role in the movement.
        A teacher of comparative literature at Prague's Charles University and a literary critic, he specialized in Czechoslovak and French literature.
        During the Nazi occupation of World War II, Professor Cerny was a leading member of the Czechoslovak resistance until he was arrested by the Gestapo.
