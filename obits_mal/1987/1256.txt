        E. George Thiem, an investigative reporter who twice won the Pulitzer Prize at The Chicago Daily News, died Wednesday. He was 90 years old. The Daily News, which closed in 1978, won a public-service Pulitzer in 1949 based on reporting by Mr. Thiem, who, along with Roy J. Harris of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, uncovered 51 newspaper employees secretly on the payroll of Gov. Dwight Green.
        In 1956, Mr. Thiem won another public-service Pulitzer Prize for discovering that the state auditor, Orville Hodge, had embezzled $2.5 million.
        After retiring as a full-time reporter in 1962, Mr. Thiem entered politics. A Republican, he was elected to a seat in the Illinois House in 1964 and was a Sanitary District trustee from 1966 to 1974.
