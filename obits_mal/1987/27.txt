        Jack Nadel, a social worker and former executive director of the 92d Street Y, died in his sleep Monday at his home in Surfside, Fla. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Nadel was associated with the 92d Street Young Men's and Young Women's Hebrew Association for more than 50 years. After he was hired as a pin boy in the Y bowling alley in 1906, he assumed increasingly responsible positions until 1922, when he became executive director. He retired in 1957, with the title of executive vice president, and was elected a member of the board of directors, a post he held until his death.
        In 1934, he founded the Federation Employment Service, now known as Federation Employment and Guidance Service. In 1956, he received the Frank L. Weil Award for outstanding achievement in the Jewish community-center field.
        He was a past president of the National Association of Center Workers and a director of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York and of the National Jewish Welfare Board. He was also a former vice president and board member of the Yorkville Welfare and Health Council and a faculty member at Yeshiva University.
        Mr. Nadel, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from City College in 1915 and received a master's degree in law from New York University in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Clare Hersh; a daughter, Evelyn Pagnac of New Orleans; two sons, Leonard, of Roslyn, L.I., and Melvin, of Manhattan; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
