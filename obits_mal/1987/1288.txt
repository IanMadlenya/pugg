        Mr. Bram, a native of New York, was one of a group of numismatists who founded the informational, nonprofit organization here in 1967 for collectors of coins, medals, tokens, paper money and other Judaica and Americana. The organization has since become the second-largest numismatic society in the world, with 40 branches, a quarterly magazine and annual tours of Israel.
        Mr. Bram is survived by his wife, the former Lena Fleitman; a sister, Molly Krigsmer of Coram, L.I.; a son, Judge Julius Bram of Norwalk, Conn.; a daughter, Gladys Bram of Durham, N.C., and four grandchildren.
