        Marvin Rosenberg, a textile manufacturer and close friend of the late Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, for whom he served as chief fund-raiser, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Rosenberg was the president of Cameo Curtains Inc., at 261 Fifth Avenue, a company he helped establish in 1927 and sold in the early 1980's.
        His organizational talents and advice benefited Mr. Humphrey, the former Democratic Vice President and Presidential hopeful from Minnesota, in campaigns from 1960 to 1976.
        Others for whom he campaigned and raised funds were Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1969, Howard J. Samuels for Governor in 1970 and 1974, and Abraham D. Beame for Mayor in 1973. He also served on the national finance committee for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in 1979-80. A Valuable Lesson Learned
        His experience as chief fund-raiser for Mr. Humphrey in 1960 and 1968 taught Mr. Rosenberg that the money most beneficial to a candidate is that which is collected before a campaign begins. It pays for travel, staff and television time.
        That means, he noted in a 1971 interview, that a candidate cannot rely on the small giver but must pursue ''a few rich people'' to whom he will be obligated - directly or by implication. ''It's not the rising costs that should worry people,'' Mr. Rosenberg said, ''but the fact that it comes from so few sources.''
        A Manhattan native, Mr. Rosenberg graduated from the City College of New York in 1928 and from the Harvard University Law School in 1932. He was admitted to the New York bar, but never practiced law, pursuing instead his business and political interests. Endowed Intern Program
        In 1984, Mr. Rosenberg donated $100,000 to City College in memory of Mr. Humphrey. The public-affairs program he endowed enabled the college to send undergraduates to Washington as legislative interns for about two months.
        He was a past treasurer of the Westchester Democratic County Committee and held state and national positions in Americans for Democratic Action in the 1940's and 1950's.
        Mr. Rosenberg is survived by his wife, Helene; two daughters, Ellen Tovatt Leary and Linda, and a son, David, all of New York City; a brother, Bernard, of Palm Beach, Fla., and a grandson.
        Services will be held at 10 A.M. Sunday at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, 30 West 68th Street.
