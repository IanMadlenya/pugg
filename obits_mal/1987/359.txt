        Robert W. Blankshine, an American dancer and teacher and a former featured member of the Joffrey Ballet, died of a heart attack Sunday at a friend's home in New York City, according to his mother, Serene Blankshine. He was 42 years old.
        Mr. Blankshine, who had great elan and technical agility, starred in several ballets by Gerald Arpino, the Joffrey company's resident choreographer.
        His lightness and ebullience were emphasized in Mr. Arpino's ''Viva Vivaldi'' of 1965, in which he dazzled in a dancing contest with Luis Fuente as his rival. However, in 1968 he proved he was also capable of dramatic pathos when he created the leading role of the woebegone clown in Mr. Arpino's apocalyptic fantasy, ''The Clowns.''
        A native of Syracuse, Mr. Blankshine studied with Olive McHugh at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester and at the School of American Ballet. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in 1964, remaining until 1968. He then appeared as a guest artist at Radio City Music Hall and danced with the Los Angeles Ballet and in Europe with ballet companies attached to the opera houses of Geneva, Frankfurt and West Berlin. For the last four years, he taught at the Steps Studios in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his mother.
