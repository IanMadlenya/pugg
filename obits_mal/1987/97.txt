        Philip Heimlich, a retired social worker who founded a program to assist troubled youths, died Dec. 30 in Cincinnati, where he had lived for 12 years. He was 99 years old.
        Mr. Heimlich was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College in 1909. He founded the Youth Counsel Bureau in 1941, developing operations in the District Attorneys' offices in all five boroughs. The bureau began as an interfaith project to assist youths who were in trouble with the law. Three years later support of the project was taken over by the city.
        He was a welfare worker for 30 years with the Jewish Board of Guardians and served as chairman of the social services board of the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue.
        He retired at the age of 70, 29 years ago but remained active as secretary of the Prison Chaplain's Association and other organizations.
        He is the father of Dr. Henry J. Heimlich, who invented the ''Heimlich maneuver'' to dislodge foreign objects from the windpipe.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Cecelia Rosenthal of Los Angeles; two sisters, Esther Solomon and Bertha Wasch, both of Queens; five grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
