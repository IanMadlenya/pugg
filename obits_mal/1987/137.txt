        Mr. Accurso, a native of Brooklyn, studied at the Brooklyn Museum Art School, the School of Art and Design, Pratt Institute and the School of Visual Arts. His work was included in exhibits in the United States and France.
        Starting out as a wildlife artist, he also contributed drawings to various publications, including Newsweek magazine. About 20 years ago he responded to an advertisement for a television illustrator, and this led to a long association with the medium, particularly with ABC News.
        His sketches were seen on network shows and Channel 7 Eyewitness News in New York, for which he had worked since 1969. His most recent assignments included the Federal ''pizza connection'' narcotics trial and court cases involving Bernhard H. Goetz and Robert E. Chambers Jr. Mr. Accurso is survived by two sisters, Rosemary Ketzko and Connie Accurso, both of Brooklyn.
