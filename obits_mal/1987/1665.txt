        Ian McCullum, director of the American Museum in Bath, died Wednesday night at his home in Claverton Manor, England. He was 67 years old.
        Mr. McCullum was director of the museum for 27 years, during which he oversaw a comprehensive collection of American paintings and artifacts in a converted English manor on the picturesque outskirts of Bath. He considered the museum's official opening in 1961 one of his most satisfying accomplishments. Under his ambitious and imaginative directorship, the American Museum presented such memorable exhibits as the Mount Vernon Gardens in 1962 and the American Indian Gallery in 1971.
        Mr. McCullum, born in London in 1919, studied architecture in Edinburgh and served on several panels on behalf of the National Trust. Eventually, he became editor of Architecture Review. He was named director of the museum in Bath in 1959.
