        The Rev. Dennis J. Comey, a Jesuit priest who, as the arbitrator of dock disputes in the Port of Philadelphia in the 1950's became known as the Waterfront Priest, died Wednesday at Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 91 years old.  Father Comey was the arbitrator of the Philadelphia port from 1951 to 1959, handling dock grievances and averting work stoppages.
        He had been named the port's arbitrator, with unlimited authority to settle contract disputes at the scene, under an agreement between the port's maritime unions and employers.
        Having gained a reputation for impartialilty and keeping peace in the port, he wrote a book about his experiences, ''Waterfront Peacemaker.''
        In 1943, Father Comey founded the Institute of Industrial Relations of St. Joseph's College in Philadelphia, a Jesuit institution now called St. Joseph's University. He served as the institute's director until he retired in 1981.
        The institute, which has been renamed the Comey Institute, offers academic and adult education courses in industrial relations.
        From 1937 to 1943 Father Comey was president of St. Peter's College in Jersey City.
        He was born in Philadelpha, the eldest of 13 children. He studied at St. Joseph's College from 1910 to 1914 and later received a master's degree at Woodstock College in Maryland. In 1932 he received a doctorate in sacred theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University of Rome.
        He is survived by a brother, John, also a Jesuit priest, and two sisters, Margaret and Catherine, a nun. All are from Philadelphia.
