        Gilbert B. Phillips, a former president of the Automobile Club of New York, died of cancer Tuesday at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 77 years old and lived in Rockville Centre.
        Mr. Phillips, who retired in 1975 after 12 years as head of the local affiliate of the American Automobile Association, was associated for more than 50 years with the club, which has 850,000 members in the New York metropolitan area.
        Three decades ago Mr. Phillips led a campaign for the installation of median barriers on highways in New York City and its suburbs - a safety feature that has now become commonplace.
        Mr. Phillips was a strong advocate of educational programs, notably those addressed to the problem of drunken driving. He also campaigned successfully to have the adjudication of parking and minor traffic violations removed from the criminal courts and placed before administrative tribunals.
        Surviving are a son, Donald, of Elmont, L.I.; a daughter, Deirdre Creal of Alexandria, Va., and three grandchildren.
