        Biship Finis Crutchfield, a retired Methodist leader who helped AIDS victims, has died of the disease, his family said.
        Bishop Crutchfield, 70 years old, died Thursday and was eulogized Saturday at a service that drew more than 800 people. His family later released a statement saying he died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
        The statement, prepared by his son, the Rev. Charles Crutchfield, said the Bishop had not had homosexual or extramarital affairs, had not received blood transfusions and was not a drug user. Experts say AIDS is transmitted only through the exchange of blood or other body fluids.
        ''We are left with the conclusion that we simply do not know, and may never know, how he contracted the virus,'' it said.
        Bishop Crutchfield led the Texas Annual United Methodist Conference, based in Houston, from 1976 until his retirement in 1984.
        After retiring, he helped AIDS victims. ''He helped to plan and conduct funerals, provide transportation to the hospital and clean the apartments of AIDS victims,'' his son said.
