        Mr. de la Mata, a lawyer, was voted president in 1981 and was re-elected for a second four-year term in 1985. He earlier held parliamentary and government posts in Spain and was a former president of the Spanish Red Cross.
        Kurt Bolliger, president of the Swiss Red Cross and a league vice president, will fill Mr. de la Mata's post until the league's General Assembly elects a successor in November, Mr. Reid said.
        Mr. de la Mata is survived by his wife, three daughters and four sons, the spokesman said.
