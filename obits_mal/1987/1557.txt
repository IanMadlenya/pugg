        An Air Force major general who retired from the military in 1956, he had served in World War I, World War II and the Korean War.
        He learned to fly in 1917 in the Signal Corps after leaving his medical studies at the University of Nebraska. After the war, he barnstormed around the Midwest, performing at country fairs.
        While serving as a Federal aeronautics inspector in May 1927, he related in a recent interview, he spent the night before Charles A. Lindbergh took off on his nonstop solo flight across the Atlantic trying to talk him out of it. But when he saw Lindbergh was bound to go, he said, he was among those who helped give his plane, the Spirit of St. Louis, a push down the runway at Roosevelt Field, L.I., on May 20, 1927.
        Mr. Copsey, a longtime resident of Summit, N.J., was a former president of Newark Air Service, a commercial flying school and charter service. In 1928, he was appointed manager of Newark Airport and later, as director of aviation for New Jersey, oversaw airport development in the state.
        Married twice, both his wives predeceased him. He is survived by two sons, Robert, of Hidden Hills, Calif., and Ronald, of Greenville, S.C.; a daughter, Betty Mount of Millington, N.J.; six grandchildren, and one great grandchild.
