        Wilbur Darby Curtis, the inventor of the glass coffee pot and a fiber glass-bodied automobile, the Shamrock, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 82 years old. He had been ill since August, when he suffered a stroke at his home here, according to his son-in-law, A. James Liska of Agoura.
        Mr. Curtis, a native of Nutley, N.J., held 16 patents for tea and coffee brewing and dispensing equipment, and was working on a new design for a home coffeemaker at the time of his stroke, Mr. Liska said.
        Mr. Curtis became a stockbroker after high school and had made a fortune by the age of 24, but he lost his first million dollars in the 1929 stock market crash, his son-in-law said.
        He later joined the Silex company as a salesman. Mr. Curtis designed the all-glass coffee pot in 1940, and in 1941 started the Wilbur Curtis Company in Los Angeles to make the plastic-handled device.
