        Fred Silverman, the president of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, died of a heart attack Thursday while vacationing in Stratton, Vt. He was 52 years old and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.
        Mr. Silverman, who became the hospital's chief executive officer in 1977, had a reputation as an innovative administrator who developed medical assistance programs for the largely low-income community the hospital served in the central and South Bronx. Under his leadership, the hospital also began sending mobile health vans to visit schools.
        Mr. Silverman served as chairman of the Coalition of Distressed Hospitals, a group of local medical institutions that serve the indigent. He also was a member of the board of directors of the Hospital Association of New York State.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lois Leichtman; four children, Mark, Gail, Karyn and Jeffrey; his father, Joseph, and his sister, Ruth Forbes.
