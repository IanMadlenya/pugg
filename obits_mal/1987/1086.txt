        Jasper Garrison, the nation's oldest war veteran, a man described by his daughter as a straight-laced person who never smoked or drank, died Thusday at the age of 107, the Veterans Administration said today.
        Mr. Garrison, who served in the Spanish-American War beginning in 1898, died of heart failure at the V.A. hospital here, said Frances Gilliam, a hospital spokeswoman.
        ''Somebody asked him how he lived so long,'' said Mr. Garrison's daughter, Lena Hays. ''He said, 'God forgot about me.' ''
        Only three other veterans of the Spanish-American War are still alive, a V.A. spokesman, Chuck Lucas, said in confirming that Mr. Garrison was the nation's oldest living veteran.
        ''He was a very straight-laced person,'' said Mrs. Hays, of nearby Christoper, who asked that her age not be disclosed. ''He never drank, he never smoked.''
        Born May 1, 1880, in Wayne County, Mr. Garrison enlisted in the Fourth Illinois Volunteer Army in June 1898. He arrived in Havana that August and spent nine months on the island in the Spanish-American War.
        Replacing Mr. Garrison as the country's oldest living veteran is 102-year-old S. Leroy Mendel, a native of Fort Worth, Tex., now residing in Galva, Ill., Mr. Lucas said.
