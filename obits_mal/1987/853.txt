        Mr. Foulet, a native of Haverford, Pa., graduated from the University of Paris in 1921 and received a doctorate from Princeton in 1927. He joined the university's faculty that year as an instructor in the Department of Modern Languages.
        He became an assistant professor in 1930, an associate professor in 1945 and a professor in 1953. He was named professor emeritus when he retired in 1966.
        Mr. Foulet wrote scholarly articles on French literature throughout his career. In 1982, in recognition of his achievements - most notably his editing of the seven-volume 12th Century epic poem, ''Roman d'Alexandre Le Grand'' -the French Government named him an officer in l'ordre des Palmes Academiques.
        He was married to Margaret McMahon of Princeton, who died in 1970. Mr. Foulet has no survivors.
