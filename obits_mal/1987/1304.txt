        Mr. Rossbach was an avid sportsman who fished in many parts of the world and contributed articles on fishing and nature to several publications. He was the author of a book, ''Wadings and Wanderings,'' and was a financial supporter of many conservation causes.
        He was a former general partner of Ingalls & Snyder, a New York Stock Exchange firm. He had been with the firm since 1956. He was a limited partner from 1971 until his death.
        Mr. Rossbach, who was born in Manhattan, was a 1936 graduate of Yale University, where he received a degree in economics. After Yale he worked for the investment firm of Lazard Freres & Company.
        He was decorated for his service as an Army officer in World War II and was wounded and captured in an operation behind German lines.
        In 1948 he left the investment field to join a family business importing hides and skins, J. H. Rossbach & Brothers, but returned to his earlier career with Ingalls & Snyder in 1956.
        He was long active in Yale alumni affairs and also served as a vice president of the Museum of the City of New York and Goodwill Industries of Greater New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, Cynthia Stebbins, of Syosset, L.I.; a son, James, of Manhattan, and a sister, June R. B. Birge, of the Bronx.
