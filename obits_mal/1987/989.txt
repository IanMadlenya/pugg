        A native of Portland, Ore., Mr. Moore began his professional career at the age of 13 playing the piano in speakeasies during Prohibition. Later, he came to New York and performed at Cafe Society and other supper clubs, eventually forming his own jazz group, the Phil Moore Four.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne George; a daughter, Joanna Moore of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
