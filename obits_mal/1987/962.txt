        Wahid Raafat, one of Egypt's top legal scholars and a senior official of the opposition New Wafd Party, died in his sleep today. He was 81 years old.
        Party officials said Mr. Raafat had been in good health. They said his wife found him dead in bed this morning.
        Mr. Raafat was deputy chairman of the right-of-center New Wafd Party, the second largest opposition group in Parliament. The New Wafd has 36 seats in the 458-seat Parliament. President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party has 347, and the Labor Alliance, comprising the Liberal Party and the Moslem Brotherhood, has 60.
        Mr. Raafat was a member of the Egyptian Government team that handled a dispute with Israel over the border area of Taba for several years. The issue was referred last September to an international arbitration panel.
        Mr. Raafat graduated from Cairo University's law school in 1926 and received a doctoral degree in law from Paris University in 1930. He was a university professor and a judge before becoming the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser shortly before the 1952 military coup that overthrew the monarchy.
