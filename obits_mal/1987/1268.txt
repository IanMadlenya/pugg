        Dr. Thomas F. Waddell, one of the founders of the Gay Games for homosexual athletes in 1982 and a sixth-place finisher in the decathlon at the Olympic Games in 1968, died at his home in San Francisco Saturday morning. He was 49 years old. His wife, Sara Lewinstein, said by telephone that Dr. Waddell had died of complications related to AIDS.
        For the last year, Dr. Waddell was involved in a lawsuit with the United States Olympic Committee, which had prohibited the Gay Games from calling itself the Gay Olympics. Last month, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the U.S.O.C. had the legal authority to bar a homosexual rights group from using the generic word ''olympics'' in the name of its athletic games.
        Dr. Waddell, who specialized in infectious diseases, was chief physician at San Francisco's Central Emergency facility until giving up the post when his disease was diagnosed in June of last year. He also served on the board of the northern California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Waddell is survived by a daughter, Jessica, and his parents, Gene and Hazel.
