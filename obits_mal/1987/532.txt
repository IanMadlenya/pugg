        The brother and sister-in-law of the fashion designer Albert Nipon were found shot to death in their oceanfront condominium Saturday morning, the authorities said.
        The bodies of Edward Nipon, 58 years old, and his wife, Sylvia, 67, were found in the living room of their home. Police Chief Richard Fox said the door to their apartment was unlocked and that nothing appeared to have been taken.
        The Nipons were residents of Philadelphia who spent winters in southern Florida.
        Detectives were looking today for a young couple who visited the Nipons after midnight Friday for about 15 minutes, Chief Fox said.
        Edward Nipon was the youngest of four brothers who founded a maternity clothes company 33 years ago that evolved into an international women's wear design and manufacturing firm bearing the name of Albert Nipon.
        Although retired from the business, Edward Nipon remained active while his brother was imprisoned at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida on tax-evasion charges from August 1985 until last week, when he was released to a halfway house in Philadelphia, family members said.
