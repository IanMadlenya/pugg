        Pat Bashford, once the leader of Rhodesia's multiracial Center Party and a longtime opponent of Ian D. Smith, died here on Wednesday, friends said. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Bashford, an English-born farmer who came to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, in 1937, strongly opposed Mr. Smith's 1965 declaration of independence, never accepted in London, and his racial policies.
        During the seven-year guerrilla war that led to Zimbabwe's independence as a black-governed country in 1980, he remained unguarded with his family at his farm, saying his conscience was clear.
        He failed on three occasions to win a seat in Parliament against the dominance of the Rhodesian Front party of Mr. Smith, although his Center Party succeeded in 1970 in getting seven black members elected.
        Friends said he never recovered from the death of his only son, David, who was run down by a car while manning a roadblock during the guerrilla war. He retired from politics in 1977.
