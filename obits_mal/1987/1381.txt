        Dr. Andrew David Holt, president of the University of Tennessee in its period of greatest growth, from 1959 to 1970, died here Friday. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Holt, who retired in 1970, died at a Knoxville hospital. He had been hospitalized since February, when he suffered the first of a series of strokes.
        Starting as a teacher in the 1920's, Dr. Holt became a principal, superintendent and college professor.
        In 1949 and 1950 he was president of the National Education Association. As head of the organization, he lobbied for Federal aid to education.
        In 1959, after six years as vice president at the University of Tennessee, Dr. Holt became president of the university. In his 11-year tenure, the college's enrollment more than tripled, and its state appropriations increased more than 400 percent.
        ''I surrounded myself with people smarter than me, then got out of their way and let them do their jobs,'' Dr. Holt once said.
        Dr. Holt was born in Milan, Tenn., on Dec. 4, 1904. He earned a bachelor of arts degree from Emory University in Atlanta in 1927 and a doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1937.
        Survivors include his wife, Martha; two daughters, Ann Skadberg of Kansas City, Mo., and Frances Dotterweich of Knoxville; a son, Andy Jr., of Nashville; and 12 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
