        Andrei B. Severny, a leader in Soviet astronomy and an authority on the physics of the sun and the stars, died April 4, the Soviet press has announced. He was 73 years old. Dr. Severny had been director of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory since 1952, and was one of the pioneers of setting up astronomical observations on artificial satellites in orbit around the earth.
        Much of his work focused on solar flares, the sudden outbursts of energy from small areas of the sun's surface, which he sought to relate to the existence of magnetic fields on the sun. He won the Stalin Prize in 1952 for his study of solar flares.
        After World War II, he was assigned to the Crimean Observatory, which was originally based at Simeiz, on the Crimea's Black Sea coast, and was then in the process of building a new observatory at Nauchny in the Crimean Mountains.
        A full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences since 1968, Dr. Severny was well known among Western astronomers, having served as a vice president in the International Astronomical Union from 1964 to 1970. On his 60th birthday, in 1973, he was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor, the Soviet Union's highest civilian award.
