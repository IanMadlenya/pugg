       Ralph Guldahl, the tall self-taught Texan who dominated professional golf in the late 1930's only to give up the tour for lack of interest, died in his sleep early Thursday at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks. He was 75 years old and was the professional at the Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, Calif.
        Ralph Guldahl, the tall self-taught Texan who dominated professional golf in the late 1930's only to give up the tour for lack of interest, died in his sleep early Thursday at his home in the Los Angeles suburb of Sherman Oaks. He was 75 years old and was the professional at the Braemar Country Club in Tarzana, Calif.
        In a sport whose history is laced with such instantly recognizable names as Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, the name Ralph Guldahl is hardly a household word today. But in a span of four years he won the prestigious Western Open in 1936, 1937 and 1938; the United States Open in 1936 and 1937, and, after two straight second-place finishes, the Masters in 1939. He also played on three consecutive Ryder Cup teams, in 1937, 1939 and 1941.
        His consecutive victories in the United States Open have been matched by only four other men: Willie Anderson (1903-1905), John McDermott (1911-1912), Jones (1929-1930) and Hogan (1950-1951).
        Mr. Guldahl was born in Dallas, where he developed an unorthodox swing with an explosive backswing and sledgehammer down stroke. It may not have looked pretty, but it worked. Mr. Guldahl, who at 6 feet 3 inches was taller than most champion golfers, turned professional in the middle of a tournament in 1930, and in January 1931, just two and a half months past his 19th birthday, won a tournament in Santa Monica, Calif., making him what is believed to be the youngest man ever to win a tournament on the pro tour. In his first United States Open, in 1933, he came in second.
        Despite the auspicious beginning, Mr. Guldahl, who had a practice of combing his thick curly hair after almost every shot, quickly lost interest in competition. In 1935, after the birth of his son, Ralph Jr., he quit the tour.
        The layoff apparently helped. When he returned a year and a half later he was almost invincible, much to the special chagrin of Snead. In the final round of the 1937 Open, Guldahl was on the 10th tee when Snead, playing his first Open, eagled the 18th hole and finished with a 283 and a seemingly certain victory. Guldahl finished with a 281, and Snead never won an Open.
        In the 1939 Masters, Guldahl was again on the the 10th tee when Snead holed out the on the 18th for a 280. A couple of birdies and an eagle later, Guldahl finished with a 279.
        Although he played sporadically in the late 1940's, Guldahl was never a serious contender on the tour after World War II. As he later explained, ''I never did have a tremendous desire to win.''
        His achievements earned him induction into the American Golf Hall of Fame in 1972 and the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1981.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Maydelle.
