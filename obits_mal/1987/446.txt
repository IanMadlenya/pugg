        Emanuel George Venetucci, who built a model of the Milan Cathedral out of more than a million matchsticks, died Sunday. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Venetucci, who ran a drapery cleaning service with his wife, Jean, began work on his model of the northern Italian cathedral in 1949. It took him 12 years to build the 8-feet wide, 15-feet long structure, and he estimated he worked an average of 44 hours a week on it.
