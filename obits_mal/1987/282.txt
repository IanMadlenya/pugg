        Mr. Brennan joined Emigrant Savings in 1953 as vice president and assistant to the president and retired 30 years later as chairman of the executive committee. He became a trustee in 1955, president in 1957 and served as board chairman from 1967 to 1978.
        A Knight of Malta and leader in the church's lay supporters, Mr. Brennan aso was a trustee of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the College of Mount St. Vincent, as well as treasurer of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick.
        After his retirement from Emigrant, he became one of three laymen recruited from banking and industry as financial advisers to the Vatican. They were called upon to sort out the Vatican's finances after the collapse of the Banco Amrosiano, Italy's largest private bank, and the mysterious death of its president, Roberto Calvi.
        Mr. Brennan is survived by his wife, Nancy; a daughter, Sister Constance Brennan; two sisters, Anne Dillingham and Jane Sullivan, and a brother, James Brennan.
