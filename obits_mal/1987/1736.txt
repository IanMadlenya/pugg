        Edward L. Love, who rose from bank messenger to become executive vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank, died Thursday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla., where he had lived since the mid-1960's. A former Staten Island resident, he was 92 years old.
        Mr. Love, who specialized in corporate and public utility financing during his career, was a senior officer of the Chase National Bank when it merged with the Bank of Manhattan Company in 1955. He retired from Chase Manhattan later that year, but continued as a consultant to the bank until 1960.
        Later he served as chairman of Gruen Industries and of the Gruen Watch Company of Canada.
        In 1959 and 1960, he served on the Temporary State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York, which studied the city's fiscal policy among other matters.
        Mr. Love was born on Staten Island. He was educated in the city's public schools and, while working as a messenger for the former Seaboard National Bank, in night school and through correspondence courses.
        He worked in investment banking with several concerns, and eventually helping to found Love, Macomber & Company. It dissolved in 1929.
        In 1932, Mr. Love organized the public utilities department of Chase National and headed it until 1952. He was president of The Chase Bank, later called the Chase International Investment Corporation, from 1953 to 1956.
        His first wife, Harriet, died in 1962. He is survived by his second wife, Dorothy; three sons, Edward of Greenwich, Conn., John of Darien, Conn., and Robert of Thunder Bay, Ontario; a daughter, Jean L. Dykstra of Haverford, Pa.; twelve grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
