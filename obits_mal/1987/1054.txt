        E. Raymond Wilson, a founder of the Friends Committee on National Legislation, died Saturday of congestive heart failure and pneumonia, a spokesman said today. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Wilson, who died at the Sandy Spring Friends House in Sandy Spring, Md., helped found the Quaker legislation committee in November 1943 and served as its executive secretary until his retirement in January 1962, a spokesman, Ed Snyder, said. Later, he was a full-time volunteer with the Washington-based group, focusing mainly on efforts toward world disarmament.
        He wrote two books, ''Uphill for Peace'' in 1975 and an autobiography, ''Thus Far on My Journey,'' in 1976.
        He is survived by two sons - Kent of Del Mar, Calif., and Lee of Washington - and four grandchildren.
