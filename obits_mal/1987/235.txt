        Charles M. Heistand, a retired national executive of the Boy Scouts of America, died Friday at the Willow Valley Health Center in Lancaster, Pa. He was 90 years old and lived in Lancaster, where he was born.
        Mr. Heistand joined the Scouts' staff in 1910, the year the organization was founded in the United States, and retired 52 years later as assistant chief Scout executive with the national council. During those years he held local and national positions, including acting as the Scout executive for the borough of Queens from 1929 to 1937.
        He is survived by two sisters, Berniece Binkley of Elizabethtown, Pa., and Amy Hutchison of Lancaster, and a brother, O. Richard Heistand of San Antonio.
