        He also played a leading role in the post-World War II growth of savings institutions. He was a consulting economist with the United States League of Savings Institutions and served as interim director of the league's Washington office in 1973.
        At Indiana University, Mr. Weimer was a professor of real estate and land economics. Upon his retirement in 1979, the university established the Weimer Chair of Business Administration and the Weimer Fund for Innovation in honor of his contributions to the school.
