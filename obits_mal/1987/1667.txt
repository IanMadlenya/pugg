        Kamal el-Mallakh, an Egyptologist who discovered the 4,600-year-old boat of the Pharaoh Cheops next to his Great Pyramid at Giza, died of a heart attack Thursday. He was 69 years old.
        Besides being an archeologist, Mr. Mallakh was also a journalist, architect, movie critic and author. He was associate editor of the newspaper Al Ahram since 1975 and wrote several novels and four booklets about Cairo.
        In 1954 he discovered two pits just south of the Great Pyramid. He opened one and found Cheops' boat, the oldest wooden relic of Egypt's Old Kingdom. Cheops, also known as Khufu, founded the Fourth Dynasty in 2680 B.C.
        The boat, found in several layers of mainly cedar boards, was reassembled and for five years has been on display.
        Mr. Mallakh was graduated as an architect from Cairo's Fine Arts School in 1943 and received a master's degree in Egyptology from Cairo University five years later.
        A bachelor, he founded the Egyptian Society for Movie Writers and Critics in the 1970's and served as its chairman for eight years.
