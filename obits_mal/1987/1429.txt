        Fred Harold Harrison, who retired in 1983 after 31 years on the faculty of Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where he served as an instructor, coach and athletic director, died of a heart attack last Thursday while vacationing in England with his wife. He was 67 years old and lived in Little Compton, R.I.
        Mr. Harrison, known as Ted, was a 1938 graduate of the academy. As a member of the Class of '42 at Yale he won renown as a football, hockey and baseball star. He then served in the Army in Europe and was discharged in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and a Bronze Star.
        He joined the faculty of the Berkshire School the next year as a teacher and coach, took a master's degree at Trinity College in 195O and moved to Andover as a teacher of English in 1952. Three years later, he was named athletic director, a position he held until 1977.
        Mr. Harrison was a member of the President's Council on Physical Fitness in the Kennedy Administration and was named a Sports Illustrated Silver Anniversary All American in 1966.
        Besides his wife, Marjorie Alexander, his survivors include three daughters, Marjorie Fleming, Nancy Bliss and Elizabeth Hadley; and four grandchildren.
