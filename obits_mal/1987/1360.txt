        Jesse Unruh, the one-time speaker of the State Assembly who transformed the California Treasurer's office into a national economic force, died of cancer at his home tonight. He was 64 years old.
        A family spokesman, Kenneth Berk, said Mr. Unruh died at his home at Marina del Rey at 9:22 P.M.
        Mr. Unruh, who rose from poverty as the son of Kansas sharecroppers to eminence as the second-most powerful elected official in California, was best known to the public for the 7 years 3 months during the 1960's when he was the flamboyant Speaker of the California Assembly. A shrewd power broker who dominated the lower house, Mr. Unruh became known as ''Big Daddy.''
        ''Fad writers hit on the Big Daddy nickname and buried my legislative accomplishments,'' Mr. Unruh complained in later years. ''No legislator in California history has passed as much major legislation as I have.''
        Mr. Unruh is credited with California's most comprehensive body of pro-consumer credit legislation, the 1959 Unruh Credit Reporting Act that protects those who buy on installment contracts. California's civil rights act, enacted the same year, also carries Mr. Unruh's name.
        His stormy tenure as Speaker included a historic battle with then-Gov. Ronald Reagan over tuition for the University of California.
