        Ted Fagan, a simultaneous translator for 30 years at the United Nations who became the organization's chief interpreter, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Fagan, who was born in Buenos Aires and was educated in England, began working at the United Nations in 1946 and interpreted speeches there for such leaders as Fidel Castro of Cuba and President Leopold S. Senghor of Senegal. His translations of Spanish or French were delivered in a polished Oxonian accent.
        He had planned for a career in civil engineering in Buenos Aires, but during a visit to New York in 1946 he agreed to go into an interpreters' booth set up by the new world organization at the Hunter College campus in the Bronx. He was hired on the spot to join a group who had been interpreters at the Nuremburg trials and were to be the first simultaneous interpreters at the United Nations.
        He became head of the English interpreters' section in 1973 and in 1974 he became the United Nations' chief interpreter.
        In 1976, Mr. Fagan retired from the United Nations and moved to Palo Alto, Calif., where he began a project of cataloguing all vocal recordings on the Victor and RCA labels. He completed two of six volumes, and also wrote a play, ''Elizabeth Rex,'' that was produced in 1979 in West Hollywood, Calif. Last March, he returned to Manhattan to live.
        He is survived by a brother, Gerald Fagin, of Buenos Aires.
