        Anthony Casamento, a former United States Marine corporal in World War II whose persistent efforts to win the Medal of Honor were finally rewarded in 1980, died of cancer Saturday at Veterans Medical Center in Northport, N.Y. He was 66 years old and lived in West Islip, L.I.
        Mr. Casamento, who was wounded 14 times in the 1942 assault on Guadalcanal, had been totally disabled since the war. Because all the witnesses to Mr. Casamento's action were thought to have died in combat, he received no decoration until 1965, when a Navy Cross was finally awarded.
        He refused it, seeking instead the honor that he said his commanding officer felt he had deserved. In 1979, Mr. Casamento maintained a 51-day vigil outside the White House in his wheelchair.
        The next year, President Carter presented him with the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Olivia Voff; four daughters, Mary Froloff of Freeport, L.I., and Jane Rice, Ann Brooks and Catherine Casamento, all of West Islip; a brother, Rosario, of Arlington, Va.; two sisters, Frances Prior of the Bronx and Anne Tericciano of Wallingford, Conn., and two grandchildren.
