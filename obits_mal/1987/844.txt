        Dr. Adler, who was a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, conducted research on the physics of substances that conduct electricity poorly, or semiconductors.
        He was a regional editor of The Journal of Non-Crystalline Solids, an associate editor of the Materials Research Bulletin, and was on the editorial board of the publication Semiconductors and Insulators. Dr. Adler was also a fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the executive council of the society's New England section.
        In 1964 and 1965, he was a research associate at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell, England. He beame a research associate at M.I.T. in 1965 and joined the faculty in 1967.
        He was born in New York City and was a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He received a doctorate in physics from Harvard University in 1964.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alice Salzman, a daugther, Carrie, of Lexington, and two sons, Kyle S., of Belmont, Mass., and Andrew N., of Lexington.
