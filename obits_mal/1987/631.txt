        Horace Marden Albright, a conservationist who was a co-founder and second director of the National Park Service, died of heart failure early yesterday at a convalescent home in Los Angeles. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Albright, who was given the Medal of Freedom Award, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Reagan in 1981, was instrumental in convincing Congress to pass the legislation that established the National Park Service in 1916.
        He was appointed director of the National Park Service in 1929. In four years in that post he fought successfully for establishment of three national parks in the area of the Great Smoky Mountains, the Grand Tetons and Carlsbad Caverns.
        He left the Park Service in 1933 to join the United States Potash Company and was its president when he retired in 1956, though he remained active in park and conservation issues.
        He graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1912 and in 1914 he received a law degree from the Georgetown University Law School.
        Mr. Albright joined the Interior Department in 1913 as assistant to the Secretary Franklin K. Lane. He served as the first civilian superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, from 1919 to 1929.
        Mr. Albright, who lived in Studio City, Calif., is survived by a daughter, Marian Schenck of Studio City; a daughter-in-law, Mary Albright of Irvine; four granchildren and nine great grandchildren.
