        The secretary, Eleni Chrysou, said he had been sick for several days.
        Mr. Tsatsos retired from public life after resigning the presidency in 1980 but remained active as a scholar.
        He published more than 20 books on philosophy, history and law along with translations of ancient Greek writers.
        Mr. Tsatsos combined academic life with politics for much of his life and held several cabinet appointments in liberal Greek Governments in the 1950's and 1960's. He was also a law professor at Athens University.
        He became head of state after the collapse of the 1967-74 military dictatorship. He was nominated by Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis after a December 1974 referendum abolished the Greek monarchy.
        He was succeeded as President by Mr. Caramanlis in 1980.
        Mr. Tsatsos is survived by his wife, Ioanna, sister of George Seferis, the late Nobel Prize-winning poet, and two daughters.
