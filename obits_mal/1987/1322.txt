        Richard S. Harris, an author and former staff writer for The New Yorker magazine, died Sunday in a fall from his 12th-floor apartment on the Upper West Side. He was 59 years old.
        His death was listed as an apparent suicide by the police, and an autopsy was being performed yesterday by the City Medical Examiner's office. Elisabeth Scharlatt, Mr. Harris's longtime companion, said he had been under treatment for depression for a year. She said that ''by all accounts, his death was clearly some sort of hallucinatory reaction to recently taken medication.''
        Mr. Harris joined The New Yorker in 1952 as a fact checker and soon became a writer for the magazine, where he worked for 25 years as a reporter and commentator on law and politics. In 1967, he received a Sidney Hillman Foundation award for a four-part New Yorker article titled ''Medicare.''
        William Shawn, former editor of The New Yorker, said Mr. Harris's essays in the magazine ''had intellectual grandeur and great moral depth.''
        Six of the eight books that Mr. Harris wrote before leaving The New Yorker in 1978 dealt with politics and the judicial system, including ''Justice: The Crisis of Law, Order and Freedom in America,'' in 1970, and ''Freedom Spent,'' about the Bill of Rights, in 1976.
        After leaving the magazine, he wrote two suspense novels, ''Enemies,'' in 1979, and ''Honor Bound,'' in 1982. At the time of his death, he was working on a book about The New Yorker.
        Mr. Harris, a native of Saginaw, Mich., graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Conn., and St. John's College in Annapolis, Md., and earned a master's degree at Wesleyan University.
        He is survived by two brothers, William and Robert, both of Los Angeles.
