        Dr. Otto Steinbrocker, a pioneer in rheumatoid arthritis research, died of cancer Jan. 11 at his home in Delray, Fla. He was 88 years old.
        He developed a system for classifying the clinical stages of rheumatoid arthritis and the degree of functional impairment found in each of those classifications. In the late 1940's, he described the shoulder-hand syndrome, which was later named after him, in which the shoulder swells and disables the hands and fingers.
        Dr. Steinbrocker, born in Vienna on July 17, 1898, came to New York City with his parents at the age of 2. He graduated from the New York University School of Medicine in 1927, did his internship at City Hospital on Welfare Island and became an attending physician at Bellevue Hospital, where he organized and led an arthritis clinic. He became head of the section on rheumatology at Lenox Hill Hospital, serving as its chief from 1950 to 1969.
        He was a former president of the American Rheumatism Association and the Arthritis Foundation.
        He originally had planned to become a psychiatrist. However, when his mother, Eva, developed arthritis, he made that his area of special interest.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and a son, Dan of Los Angeles.
