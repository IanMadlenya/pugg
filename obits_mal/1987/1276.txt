        Corley P. McDarment, who became a hero to fellow Army Air Corps officers in 1934 when he was accused of insubordination for protesting flying conditions, died Monday of a heart attack in Rockledge, Fla. He was 95 years old.
        As a first lieutenant in 1934, Mr. McDarment was in command of a small air unit in Pittsburgh when the Army was ordered to fly the United States' air mail. Flimsy World War I biplanes, lacking radios and compasses for use in bad weather and at night, were to be used.
        Lieutenant McDarment, in a widely publicized speech, called sending the pilots out under those conditions a criminal act. After several planes crashed, killing a dozen men, the national press turned his warnings into an indictment of military leaders.
        The Army responded by ordering him before a court of inquiry, where he was charged with ''inefficiency, lack of tact and aggressiveness.'' The court recommended that he be discharged from the service, but, after influential officers and politicians interceded, President Franklin D. Roosevelt overruled the decision.
        After retiring with the rank of captain in 1937, Mr. McDarment became a journalist in Florida, where he covered all of the early American space launchings.
        Mr. McDarment's four marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his son, John Frederick McDarment, of Seattle; his daughter, Sarah McDarment Turner of Haymarket, Va.; five grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
