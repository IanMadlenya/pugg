        Waldo Salt, a two-time winner of the Academy Award for screenwriting, died of lung cancer yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 72 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        His award-winning screenplays, for ''Midnight Cowboy'' in 1969 and ''Coming Home'' in 1978, capped a triumphant return for Mr. Salt, who was blacklisted for most of the 1950's and early 1960's. Last year, Mr. Salt also received the Laurel Award, a lifetime achievement prize presented by the Writer's Guild.
        Mr. Salt entered Stanford University when he was 14, his wife, Eve Merriam, said, and he graduated in 1934. He then became a junior writer for M-G-M Studios and found early success with his writing, collaborating on the film ''Shopworn Angel,'' which starred Jimmy Stewart, among others.
        But Mr. Salt's career was interrupted by the House Un-American Activities Committee hearings, which sought to uncover Communists in many areas of American life. A hearing at which Mr. Salt was to testify was canceled at the last minute, and the committee was abolished before he appeared.
        Nevertheless, Mr. Salt could not find work in Hollywood for years and, instead, wrote for television in both the United States and Great Britain under several assumed names.
        He is survived by his wife, who is a playwright and poet, two daughters, Jennifer and Deborah, and a grandson.
