        Among his most important decisions was the ruling that allowed the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to march in St. Augustine, Fla., in the early 1960's. Judge Simpson ruled that city officials could not interfere with Dr. King's efforts to march there.
        Leon Friedman, the author of ''Southern Justice,'' wrote that ''one District Court judge who has excelled all others in his speed in enforcing the law and in his willingness to embark on new legal territory to protect Negro rights is Judge Bryan Simpson.''
        Judge Simpson, who attended law school at the University of Florida, was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in November 1966.
