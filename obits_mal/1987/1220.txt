        Mr. Bookwalter scored perhaps his most conspicuous success in ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' which he produced and directed at The Globe Theater, also playing the title role in 1975-1976. His work won him awards in all three areas, from the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle.
        He was a member of the board of trustees of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, a member of the Actors Equity Association, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.
        Mr. Bookwalter was born in Brookville, Pa., and made his professional debut in a 1962 production of ''Macbeth,'' by the New York Shakespeare Festival. He went on to play major and featured roles in classic and modern plays with regional theaters throughout the country. His roles ranged from the title roles in ''Hamlet,'' ''Richard II,'' and ''Henry V'' to Georg Nowack in the musical ''She Loves Me'' and Hildy Johnson in ''The Front Page.''
        He is survived by his wife, the actress Ruth Kidder; his parents, Merle and Berneice of Clarion, Pa.; a sister, Donna Cline of Toledo, Ohio, and a son, County Wilder Bookwalter of Manhattan.
