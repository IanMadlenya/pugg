        Winthrop G. Brown, a retired State Department official and former Ambassador to Laos and South Korea, died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 79 years old and had suffered from Parkinson's disease for several years.
        Mr. Brown entered Government service with the Lend-Lease Administration in 1941, intending to remain only ''for the duration.'' When he retired in 1972, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
        Born in Seal Harbor, Me., Mr. Brown was raised in New York City. After Yale University and Yale Law School, he established a law practice in New York in 1932.
        After joining the Lend-Lease Administration, he was soon transferred to the State Department, where he held a variety of posts, most of them concerning trade, in Washington and in London during and after World War II.
        He was deputy chief of mission at the American Embassy in New Delhi from 1957 to 1960, then was appointed Ambassador to Laos, where he served until 1962.
        Mr. Brown returned to the United States to become deputy commandant of the National War College in Washington, a job he held until he was posted to Seoul in 1964.
        In 1967 he returned to Washington to become the State Department's representative to the governors of the 50 states. In 1968 he was made Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy; a son, Winthrop, of Washington; two daughters, Julia Turrell of Des Moines, Iowa, and Anne Rodgers of Arlington, Va., and four granddaughters.
