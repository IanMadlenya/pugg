        Lawrence Skrobacs, an accompanist and repertory coach who worked with many leading artists, including Kathleen Battle, Montserrat Caballe, James McCracken and Samuel Ramey, died yesterday morning. He was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cardiopulmonary arrest, according to a spokesman from Eddie Lew, his management agency.
        Mr. Skrobacs was born in Waynesburg, Pa. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from West Virginia University. He worked as a vocal repertory coach with the Santa Fe Opera, the Opera Company of Boston and the Festival of Aix-en-Provence, France. He made two recordings of American vocal chamber music for New World Records, and accompanied Yvonne Kenny in a recital on Etcetera Records.
        Bernard Holland, reviewing a 1981 performance by Leavata Johnson in The New York Times, called Mr. Skrobacs ''an exceptionally musical and responsive accompanist.'' His last New York appearance was last November, when he accompanied the soprano Roberta Peters in a recital at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Skrobacs is survived by his parents, Milton and Grace Skrobacs of Daisytown, Pa., and a sister, Kathleen Castro of Smyrna, Del.
