        Anibal Gordon, who headed a far-right group involved in kidnapping, extortion and murder during the military dictatorship, died of a heart attack Sunday night. He was 55 years old and was operated on last week for cancer of the left lung.
        Mr. Gordon was convicted of kidnapping a former nationalist leader, Patricio Kelly, in 1983 near the end of the dictatorship's seven-year rule. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.
        Earlier this month, Mr. Gordon appealed for amnesty under the new ''due obedience'' law for crimes committed during the military Government's campaign to wipe out suspected leftists. The campaign, known as the ''dirty war,'' lasted from 1976 to 1983. During that period, at least 9,000 people vanished. Under the law, charges have been dropped against about 270 officers who maintained they were following orders.
        Mr. Gordon said he kidnapped Mr. Kelly under orders from Gen. Reynaldo Bignone, Argentina's President at the time. General Bignone has denied the accusation.
        He is survived by his wife and a son, Marcelo, who is serving an eight-year prison term for his role in the kidnapping of Mr. Kelly.
