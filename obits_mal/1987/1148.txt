        Mr. Barger, who died Monday, was a reporter for United Press in the 1930's in China and Argentina before he was hired by the United States Embassy in Buenos Aires to monitor Nazi activities in South America during World War II.
        After service in the Navy, he returned to the State Department in 1946 and, in the course of the next 27 years, served in Bolivia, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Japan and Washington before retiring in 1973 with the rank of minister.
        He then joined the Inter-American Development Bank, for which he was a senior representative in Paraguay and Chile. He retired from the bank in 1980 and was living in suburban Bethesda, Md., when he died.
        He is survived by his wife, Dolly; a son, Brian, and a daughter, Lesli Beltran of Chicago.
