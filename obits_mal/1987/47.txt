        Lloyd Haynes, an actor who was best known for his portrayal of the history teacher Pete Dixon in the Emmy Award-winning television series ''Room 222,'' died of lung cancer Wednesday in Coronado, Calif. He was 52 years old.
        ''Room 222,'' which was shown on ABC from September 1969 to January 1974 and is still in syndication, was one of the first television programs to concentrate, in a compassionate and fairly realistic manner, on problems that affected urban youth - such as drugs, dropping out and racial prejudice. A popular and critical success, the series won many awards from educational and civil-rights groups.
        Mr. Haynes was born in South Bend, Ind., and studied acting at the Film Industries Workshop and Actors West in Los Angeles. He served in the Marine Corps from 1952 to 1964 and then as a public-affairs officer for the Naval reserve, with the rank of Commander.
        He also appeared in several films, including ''Ice Station Zebra'' and ''Good Guys Wear Black.'' More recently, he played the role of Mayor Ken Morgan in the daytime soap opera ''General Hospital.''
