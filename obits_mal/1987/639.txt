        On several occasions Mr. Gould's predictions affected the Dow Jones industrial average. In April 1976, for instance, one of his gloomier reports was widely seen as setting off a two-day, 25-point plunge of the indicator.
        Mr. Gould was born in Newark and graduated from Lehigh University. He originally planned a career in engineering, but in 1922 he went to work in New York's financial district. John Moody gave him his first job, and he eventually edited Moody's stock survey and bond survey. In the 1920's and 30's, he headed the investment service's economics department.
        Mr. Gould joined Smith Barney & Company in 1943, becoming research director in 1948. He later moved to Wiesenberger & Company as a partner and wrote a bimonthly market letter, Wiesenberger Investment Report.
        In the 1960's he started the publication that became the vehicle of his success, Findings & Forecasts. When he stopped writing it about five years ago, it was published by Anametrics Inc.
        Mr. Gould is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Dempsey; two sons, Edson 3d, of Carlsbad, Calif., and Jonathan, of Brighton, Mich.; a daughter, Vanessa G. Setzer of Allentown, Pa., and eight grandchildren.
