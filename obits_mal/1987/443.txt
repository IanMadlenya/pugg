        Peter Lorenz, a conservative politician who was kidnapped by leftist extremists in 1975, died today of a heart attack at his home here, a Government spokesman reported. He was 64.
        Mr. Lorenz, who had served as parliamentary state secretary in the Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was abducted by three West German terrorists in February 1975.
        He was released six days later after West Germany agreed to allow five imprisoned West German terrorists to fly to South Yemen.
