        Mr. Stark established the center, situated along the Pattaconk Brook, in 1983 with a $250,000 gift as a memorial to his wife, who had died the year before. He was active in civic affairs and had raised millions of dollars over the years for the Norwalk Hospital. He had also been a member of the board of the National Federation of the Handicapped.
        Born in Houston, he began his career as a trader during the building of the Panama Canal. He then went into business with his brothers as a ribbon manufacturer, and later went out on his own, founding Republic Factors Corporation in Manhattan, of which he was president. He retired in the early 1970's.
        In World War II he served as a major in the Army Air Corps Intelligence.
        Mr. Stark is survived by a daughter, Joan McNally of East Norwark, and two grandchildren.
