        Mr. Maravich enjoyed his greatest success as coach of Louisiana State University from 1967 through 1972. For three of those seasons he coached his son, whose total of 3,667 career points is a National Collegiate Athletic Association record.
        Mr. Maravich began his major-college coaching career in 1965, leading North Carolina State to a 21-5 record and an appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament. After moving to L.S.U. and reviving that school's basketball program, he went to Appalachian State in 1973. His 11-year major-college record was 129-163.
