        Bishop Zoltan Kaldy, president of the Lutheran World Federation, died here Sunday after a long illness. He was 68 years old.
        Dr. Kaldy served also as Bishop-President of the Hungarian Lutheran Church, a position for which he was chosen in 1967, and chairman of the Council of Bishops of the Evangelical Church of Hungary.
        The Bishop was highly regarded by the Hungarian Government, and the Communist regime credited him with having contributed significantly to solidifying church-state relations. In the obituary published by the official press agency, Bishop Kaldy was praised for having ''upheld socialist national unity.''
        The churchman held leading positions in the Communist-sponsored peace movement.
        He was a member of Parliament, an ex-officio privilege for leaders of major religious faiths, and served also on the presiding body of the World Federation of Hungarians.
        He had served also for some years on the central committee of the World Council of Churches and the executive committee of the Lutheran World Federation. He was elected federation president when the organization held its world assembly here in 1984.
        Bishop Kaldy was the son of a pastor and began his career as a minister in the southern Hungarian town of Pecs in 1941. He was elevated to the rank of Bishop in 1958.
