        Benson Fong, an actor whose 40-year career ranged from playing one of Charlie Chan's sons in the 1940's to ''Kung Fu'' on television, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Fong, who also once owned a restaurant chain in Los Angeles, appeared in more than 200 theater and television movies. Among his film credits were ''Charlie Chan in the Secret Service'' (1944); ''Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' and ''The Keys of the Kingdom'' (1944); ''Flower Drum Song'' (1961); ''Our Man Flint'' (1966), and ''The Strongest Man in the World'' (1975).
        In the 1970's he played the Old One in ''Kung Fu,'' the martial-arts western starring David Carradine, and he also appeared in a television movie from the series in 1985.
        Mr. Fong, born in Sacramento, was a grocer in 1943 when he was asked by Paramount Pictures if he would like to be in a movie. He landed a role in ''China'' (1943), starring Loretta Young and Alan Ladd, and was offered a 10-week contract at $250 a week.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria, five children and three grandchildren.
