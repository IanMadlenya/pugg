        George S. Wunder, who wrote and drew the comic strip ''Terry and the Pirates'' for 26 years, died Sunday of a heart attack in the New Milford Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Sherman, Conn.
        In 1973, Mr. Wunder retired from the comic strip, which was created by Milton Caniff and which, at its height of popularity, appeared in more than 300 papers. With Mr. Wunder's retirement, the strip ended.
        Terry was one of the few comic strip characters who actually matured during the strip's life. In the early days, he was an adventuresome boyclad in knee breeches. Terry eventually became an Air Force pilot.
        The strip had a racy cast, including The Dragon Lady, a seductive vamp; Hot-Shot Charlie, and Big Stoop.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Wunder was a self-taught artist. He was a member of the Illustrators Club.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred, and his sister, Beatrice Bogert of Riverdale, N.J.
        A memorial service is to be held at the Sherman Congregational Church at noon Saturday.
