        Robert C. Ekins, a sculptor and Communist Party member who successfully appealed a 1950's conviction of advocating the violent overthrow of the Government, died Tuesday in the Hospital of St. Raphael. He was 79 years old and lived in New Haven.
        He was one of seven Connecticut Communist Party members arrested in 1955, convicted and sentenced to four years in prison. But a Federal appeals court overturned the convictions of Mr. Ekins and five other party members.
        Mr. Ekins served in the Army Air Corps in World War II. Later he established an arts and crafts rehabilitation program for wounded soldiers and organized a military exhibition to raise money for war bonds.
        He opened a sculpture studio in Burlington, Conn., and later exhibited his works around the country.
        He is survived by his wife, Ettie and a sister, Sara Laughlin, of Greensboro, N.C.
