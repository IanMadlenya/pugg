        Georges Franju, a French film director and co-founder of the Cinematheque Francaise, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Franju was born on April 12, 1912, in the village of Fougeres and worked on sets for the Folies-Bergere before making his first short film, ''Le Metro,'' in 1934 with Henri Langlois. The two men founded a short-lived film club, before establishing the Cinematheque Francaise, the French film archives, in 1936.
        Mr. Franju devoted many years to the Cinematheque, and - from 1938 to 1953 - was involved with the International Federation of Film Archives and the Institute of Scientific Cinematography.
        Mr. Franju turned to documentary film making in 1949, with ''Le Sang des Betes,'' a brutal study of a Parisian slaughterhouse. He made about a dozen other documentaries during the 1950's about subjects as diverse as the pioneer film director Georges Melies and the Theatre National Populaire. A Career Shift at 47
        He began directing feature films at age 47 and, during the 1960's and early 70's, made a number of critically acclaimed films based on well-known French novels, as well as several films and short features for television.
        His best-known works were ''Les Yeux Sans Visage'' (''The Horror Chamber of Dr. Faustus,'' 1960); ''Judex,'' a 1964 homage to Louis Feuillade, the silent film director; ''Thomas l'Imposteur,'' a 1965 work based on Jean Cocteau's romantic novel, and ''Nuits Rouges'' (''Shadowman'') a 1974 film about a creature of many disguises.
        He is survived by his wife, Dominique, and a son, Bjorn, both of Paris.
