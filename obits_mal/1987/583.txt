        Philip Lawrence, an actor and director noted for his work in Shakespearean and other classical stage productions, died Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan of complications resulting from diabetes. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Lawrence, a native of Little Rock, Ark., trained at the Goodman Memorial Theater in Chicago and came to New York City in the 1950's to join Donald Goldman's Shakespearewright Company. He won an Obie award as best off-Broadway actor of the 1954-55 season for his portrayal of Sir Andrew Aguecheek in the ''Twelfth Night.''
        He again won critical acclaim for his appearance as Hamlet in 1956 and took his bow as director with the ''Twelfth Night'' the following year.
        When Mr. Goldman found the troupe a permanent home at the new Players Theater on MacDougal Street, its first production in January 1959 was ''King Lear,'' directed by Mr. Lawrence. He later collaborated with George White on productions of ''Royal Gambit,'' by Hermann Gressieker, in 1959 and ''The Jackass,'' Friedrich Duerrenmatt's satirical rendition of a Greek legend, in 1960.
        In those years, Mr. Lawrence also taught opera and drama at the Julliard School of Music.
        Mr. Lawrence, who devoted his time mainly to writing and editing in recent years, was the author of the commentary on the direction of ''Julius Caesar'' for the Laurel Shakespeare edition of that play.
        He left no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.
