        Bill Tynes, the founder and the artistic director of the New Amsterdam Theater Company, died yesterday morning at his parents' home in Placentia, Calif., of complications from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, his mother said. He was 30 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Tynes founded the musical-theater company in 1981, then he and a group of friends raised $5,000 to produce a Town Hall concert version of the 1928 Sigmund Romberg-Oscar Hammerstein 2d show, ''The New Moon.'' Since then, New Amsterdam has presented acclaimed concert versions, all at Town Hall, of such vintage musicals as ''Sweet Adeline,'' ''One Touch of Venus,'' ''Jubilee'' and ''I Married an Angel.''
        Mr. Tynes came to New York from California in 1977, intent on a career as an actor or a musician. He ended up becoming a producer. ''I certainly did not pick the right business to become rich in,'' he said in an interview last February. ''In order to do this, you really have to have Broadway history in your blood.''
        Mr. Tynes is survived by his parents, John and Clairee Tynes; two sisters and two brothers.
