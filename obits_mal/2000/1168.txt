        John Kobler, a writer whose early days on the crime beat resounded in an enduring biography of Al Capone, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 90.
        He was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and was a 1931 graduate of Williams College. He worked for various news organizations as a reporter before editing the crime reportage of PM, a 1940's New York tabloid.
        In World War II he was a civilian intelligence officer posted to North Africa, Italy and France, where he was attached to the United States Embassy. He returned to freelance for The New Yorker, Colliers, Vanity Fair and The Saturday Evening Post. His first book, published in 1938, was ''The Trial of Ruth Snyder and Judd Gray.'' It interwove trial testimony with commentary about a notorious 1927 murder case. ''Some Like It Gory'' (1940) and ''Afternoon in the Attic'' (1950) were collected essays about bizarre crimes and creepy characters. ''Afternoon'' was illustrated by Charles Addams.
        He was best known for ''Capone: The Life and World of Al Capone,'' a biography published in 1971 and reissued most recently in 1992 by Da Capo Press. It remains in print, as does ''Ardent Spirits: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition'' (Da Capo, 1993).
        He also wrote biographies about Henry Luce (1968), John Barrymore (1977) and Otto Kahn (1989), the banker and arts patron. His favorite among them was ''The Reluctant Surgeon: A Biography of John Hunter'' (1960), the 18th-century Scottish anatomist and precursor of modern surgery (1960).
        He is survived by his wife, Rita Stein Kobler; a son and three daughters from previous marriages, Jay, of Green Valley, Ariz., Lynn Hannon of Washington, N.C., Karen Reiser of Davis, Calif., and Andrea Bragg of Tunbridge Wells, England; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
