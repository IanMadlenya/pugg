        Hamilton Bissell, who developed a program to recruit students who were ''long on brains and short on cash'' for Phillips Exeter Academy, died on Nov. 17 at his home in West Caldwell, N.J. He was 89.
        In 1946 Mr. Bissell became director of scholarship students at Exeter, as the boarding school in Exeter, N.H., is known. It was founded as a boys' school in 1781 but has been coeducational since 1970.
        From the 1940's through the 1970's, he crisscrossed the United States each year, seeking people who could help Exeter find prospective scholarship students. Those he called on included heads of junior high schools and newspaper executives who knew their young newspaper carriers.
        Through his efforts, hundreds of young people received scholarships to study at Exeter, where he looked after them.
        Mr. Bissell, a New Englander and an alumnus of Exeter and Harvard, also taught and coached at Exeter.
        His wife, Sally, died in 1987.
        He is survived by a son, John W., of Wayne, N.J.; a daughter, Nancy Goldcamp of Vienna, Va.; and two granddaughters.
