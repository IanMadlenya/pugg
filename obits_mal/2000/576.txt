        Tobin Rote, an outstanding quarterback for 16 years in three professional football leagues and the architect in 1957 of the Detroit Lions' last National Football League championship, died Tuesday at a hospital in Saginaw, Mich. He was 72.
        His wife, Julie, said he suffered a heart attack, almost two weeks after back surgery. His back and knees were battered from football, and he had undergone knee replacement and triple-bypass surgery.
        Rote began his pro career in Green Bay, playing for the Packers from 1950 through 1956. The Packers made Bart Starr, a future Hall of Fame quarterback, their first draft choice in 1956 -- even though Rote led the N.F.L. in touchdown passes (17) in 1955 and went on to lead the league in passing yards (2,203) and touchdowns (18) in 1956.
        During training camp in 1957, the Packers traded Rote to the Lions, who used him to back up Bobby Layne, another future Hall of Fame quarterback.
        When Layne broke an ankle in the next-to-last game of the 1957 regular season, Rote replaced him. Two weeks later, in the Western Division championship game, the San Francisco 49ers led the Lions, 24-6, at halftime, and started celebrating early.
        ''We could hear them laughing,'' Rote once recalled. ''The walls were paper thin. They were going on about how they were going to spend their championship game money. It made us angry.''
        In the second half, the Lions scored three touchdowns within five minutes and won, 31-27. The following Sunday, they routed the Cleveland Browns, 59-14, and won their third N.F.L. title in six years. Rote passed for four touchdowns and ran for one.
        The Lions were so impressed that early in the 1958 season they traded the popular, free-wheeling Layne. Then they won only seven games over that season and the next, and Rote was gone.
        From 1960 through 1962, Rote played for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and broke all their passing records. When the San Diego Chargers of the American Football League offered him a $10,000 raise to $35,000 a year, he moved there for two seasons and led them to a league title. He sat out the 1965 season, played three games for the Denver Broncos of the A.F.L. in 1966 and then retired.
        Tobin Cornelius Rote Jr. was born  in San Antonio. At 6 feet 2 inches and 211 pounds, he led Rice University to a Southwest Conference title. In 149 games over 13 pro seasons in the United States, he passed for 18,850 yards and 149 touchdowns and rushed for 3,128 yards.
        After his pro career, he became a corporate executive in Detroit. In 1993, he and his wife retired to a Lake Huron waterfront home in Port Hope, Mich.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Rock Rote, of Delafield, Wis., a sports broadcaster; daughters Julie Struble, of Bay City, Mich., and Toni Stapley, of Woodland Hills, Calif.; seven grandchildren; a sister, Barbara Rote of San Antonio; and a cousin, Kyle Rote, the former wide receiver for the Giants.
        As a Lion, he never received the credit he deserved, partly because Detroit fans considered him an interloper from Green Bay and partly because he replaced the popular, flamboyant Layne. But his teammates appreciated him.
        As Joe Schmidt, the Lions' Hall of Fame linebacker, said when he heard of Rote's death, ''It was a blessing that he was here.''
