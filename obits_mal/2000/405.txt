        Rabbi Israel Schorr, the rabbi of Congregation Beth El-Young Israel in Brooklyn, died on March 31 at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 94 and lived in Borough Park.
        Rabbi Schorr was an Orthodox Jewish leader and noted Talmudic scholar and was also learned in secular fields like philosophy and literature. He strongly advocated the interweaving of strict Orthodox learning with contemporary humanist thought.
        He was the rabbi of Congregation Beth El and then, after a merger, of Congregation Beth El-Young Israel for 62 years. He was also a past president of the Hapoel Hamizrachi, a Zionist organization, and the Vaad Harabonim, a Brooklyn rabbinical organization.
        Rabbi Schorr, an energetic man, usually delivered several sermons and lectures at his synagogue every sabbath, often to standing-room-only audiences, until two months before his death.
        He was born in a small village that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and is part of western Ukraine. He went on to be recognized as what one American Jewish publication called ''a staggering scholar,'' and he studied with Rabbi Meir Arak and other prominent rabbis in Eastern Europe.
        In 1927, at 21, he moved to the United States. He learned English and went on to study English literature at Columbia.
        He was predeceased by his wife, Bertha. He is survived by his daughter, Gail Horowitz of Lawrence, N.Y, and three grandchildren.
