        Roger Longrigg, a prolific British novelist who often wrote under pseudonyms, male and female, died on Feb. 26 at the Phyllis Tuckwell Hospice in Farnham, Surrey, England. He was 70.
        The cause of death was not announced, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Longrigg had a career in the business world as creative director for an advertising agency and made his debut as a writer in 1956 with ''A High-Pitched Buzz,'' the first of several comic novels about that world. In addition to the 12 novels he wrote under his name, which included ''Love Among the Bottles'' and ''The Jarvington System,'' he turned out more than 35 other books, writing as Laura Black, Ivor Drummond, Frank Parrish and Rosalind Erskine, among other pseudonyms.
        ''The Passion Flower Hotel,'' which became a best seller in 1962, described its author, Rosalind Erskine, as a 15-year-old at a girls' boarding school where the students operated a brothel for the entertainment of visitors from a nearby school for boys. The book later became a German film that starred Nastassia Kinski. Writing as Domini Taylor, Mr. Longrigg was also the author of ''Mother Love,'' a 1983 novel that became a BBC mini-series starring Diana Rigg and David McCallum. He also wrote books about horse racing and fox hunting.
        He is survived by his wife, the novelist Jane Chichester, and three  daughters.
