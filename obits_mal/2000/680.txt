        Robert McFarland, a former correspondent, producer and Washington bureau chief of NBC News, died on Tuesday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 62.
        The cause was lymphoma, NBC said.
        Mr. McFarland spent 28 years at NBC News before retiring several years ago.
        He was working at an Atlanta radio station, delivering overnight newscasts, when the television network hired him to report from its Cleveland bureau in 1966.
        By 1969 he was a domestic producer for ''The Huntley-Brinkley Report'' in Washington. In 1973 he was put in charge of the London bureau.
        Returning to Washington in 1977 he was a senior producer for ''NBC Nightly News'' and, in 1982, was named vice president and bureau chief. From 1990 until his retirement four years later he was a principal planning executive at network headquarters in New York.
        He was born in Burnet, Tex., and graduated from Southwest Texas University in 1963. He served in the Marine Corps before making broadcast journalism his career.
        Mr. McFarland's survivors include his wife, Elizabeth; a daughter, Lisa Major, of Thornton, Pa.; two sons, Rob, of Austin, and Lane, of Hewitt, N.J.; and his mother, Fay McFarland, also of Austin.
