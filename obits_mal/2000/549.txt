        Jim Rogers, a horse and cattle rancher who was the last surviving child of the cowboy humorist Will Rogers, died on Friday at his home in Bakersfield, Calif. He was 84.
        Mr. Rogers was also a consultant to three memorials to his father: the Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Okla.; the ranch where his father was born, near Oologah, Okla.; and the Will Rogers State Historic Park in Pacific Palisades, Calif.
        As a child the younger Mr. Rogers performed in three of his father's films. He also appeared in three Hopalong Cassidy westerns, made Army training films and was in three cowboy comedy movies produced by Hal Roach Jr.
        For a time he ran the family-owned newspaper, The Beverly Hills Citizen, with his brother Will Rogers Jr., and he was a skilled polo player.
        He was born in New York, the third son and last child of Will Rogers and his wife, Betty. The family moved in 1919 to Southern California, where Jim Rogers attended Pomona College. He left school in 1935 after his father and Wiley Post were killed in a plane crash in Alaska.
        His brother Will Rogers Jr. died in 1993; his sister, Mary, died in 1989; and his brother Fred died in 1920.
        Mr. Rogers was married for 50 years to Astrea Kemmler Rogers, who died in 1987. He is survived by his second wife, Judith Braun; two sons, James Kemmler Rogers of Nashville and Charles Edward Rogers of Cave Creek, Ariz.; a daughter,  Astrea Elizabeth Rogers Brandon of Chowchilla, Calif.; six grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
