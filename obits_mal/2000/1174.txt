        Knud W. Jensen, a well-to-do Dane who founded the Louisiana Museum of contemporary art 20 miles north of Copenhagen, died on Tuesday. He was 84 and lived in a wing of the museum, which is on 25 acres of parkland on the Danish coast.
        Mr. Jensen, a native of Copenhagen whose family had prospered in the cheese wholesaling business, was also the longtime patron and guiding spirit of the museum, which The Times of London called ''Denmark's most exciting and most visited cultural center.'' The museum attracts 500,000 visitors a year.
        The museum, which opened in 1958, bears the name of a 19th-century country house on the site. The house was named for its first owner's three wives, all of whom were named Louise. Mr. Jensen was the museum's full-time director from 1958 until he stepped down in 1995.
        From the outset, he meant the museum to be, as the critic John Russell recalled in The New York Times in 1994, ''the very antithesis of the overbearing city museums of the late 19th century.''
        ''Visitors were never to feel, as they sometimes do in encyclopedic museums, that they were in some way on trial and would almost certainly be found guilty,'' Mr. Russell added.
        As a result, he said: ''Louisiana has a therapeutic effect, totally unlike that of most other museums. During the more than 30 years that I have been going there, I have never seen a visitor who looked either hurried or harassed, tired or cross.''
        Among the museum's holdings are works by Francis Bacon, Max Ernst, Giacometti, Hockney, Picasso, Rauschenberg, Warhol and the Danish artists Robert Jacobsen and Richard Mortensen.
        Mr. Jensen is survived by his wife, Vivi.
