        Abner Levin, a music connoisseur and a former geAbner Levinneral manager of Sam Goody's record store in Manhattan, died on May 12 at a convalescent home in Hilo, Hawaii. He was 88.
        In 1948, at the dawn of the era of the long-playing record, Mr. Levin joined Sam Goody's to manage its flagship store. Goody's went on to become a New York phenomenon and the largest record retailer in the America, and one of the first to discount prices.
        Mr. Levin listened to records virtually every minute of his waking day and decided which records Goody's would stock. He was also editor, publisher and music critic of a monthly catalog, The Long Player, one of the first critical guides to LP's.
        Abner Fisher Levin, who was known as Abbey, was born on Dec. 24, 1911, in Hartford. He graduated from New York University with a degree in economics and attended Columbia University. He had scant formal music education.
        ''My musical education really began when I got a part-time job in a record store,'' he said in 1954. ''It was during the Depression and customers were scarce. I spent most of my time listening to records.''
        At the Goody's store on West 49th Street and Broadway, 4,000 customers a day would jam the aisles, browsing through bins crammed with 38,000 albums, an impressive number before the advent of chain stores and the Internet. In 1955,  Goody's cash registers rang up 7 percent of the total national sales of 33 1/3-r.p.m. disks.
        After leaving Goody's in the mid-1960's, Mr. Levin worked briefly at Folkways records with Moses Asch, the founder, before managing an Eastchester, N.Y., store owned by Columbia Records. He remained there until his retirement in 1979.
        Mr. Levin is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Flora Mishkin; a daughter, Jo Levin of Manhattan; two sons, Robert Levin of Manhattan, and Andrew Levin, a state senator in Hawaii; and one grandson.
