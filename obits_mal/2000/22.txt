        Kevin B. Crimmins, former chairman and president of Thomas Crimmins Contracting, once a prominent builder in the New York metropolitan area, died Jan. 21 at his home in Darien, Conn. He was 64.
        The cause was leukemia, said a daughter, Pamela Crimmins of Manhattan.
        Mr. Crimmins joined the family business, which was based in New York City, in the late 1950's, after graduating from Yale University.
        Specializing in excavation and foundation work, the company was founded in 1847 and until recently was the longest continuously operating general contracting concern in the history of New York.
        The company ceased its construction operations in the mid-1990's; it remains involved in real estate, however. It is best known, perhaps, as the general contractor of Shea Stadium, and it also took part in the construction of landmarks like the Pan Am Building, Macy's and the Philip Morris building.
        Kevin Bates Crimmins was born on June 7, 1935, in Manhattan. He served in the Army for two years.
        Besides his daughter Pamela, he is survived by his wife, Cynthia; another daughter, Lillian Knight, of Darien; a son, John Crimmins, of Stamford, Conn.; a sister, Doris Crimmins, of Steamboat Springs, Colo.; his father, Artemas Holmes Crimmins, of Boca Grande, Fla., and two grandchildren.
