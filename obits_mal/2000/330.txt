        Mark Stuart, a longtime newspaper columnist and editor at The Record in Hackensack, N.J., and The Paterson Morning Call, died Friday at the Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 80.
        The cause was pneumonia complicated by Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Melba, from their home in Rivervale, N.J.
        Mr. Stuart wrote a general interest column called ''Marking Time,'' which he began in 1968 at The Morning Call, where he was city editor, and then wrote for 17 years at The Record, where he was assistant editorial page editor. After retiring in 1989, he continued to write it for the weekly Ridgewood News.
        After graduation from City College in 1947, he was editor of a Manhattan weekly, The West Side News. Recognizing the potential for readers in the developments of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, which were then attracting returning veterans, he persuaded his publisher, Charles Hagedorn, to start a new weekly, Town and Village, and served as it first editor.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jane, of New York City; a son, Thomas, of Washingtonville, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
