        Nicolas Bongard, a former Tiffany & Company executive and a business partner of Jean Schlumberger, a jewelry designer, died on April 7 at his Manhattan home. He was 91.
        Mr. Schlumberger, whose jewelry was expensive and fanciful, once said the ''transmission between artist and craftsman is achieved, above all, thanks to the great sensitivity of my associate Nicolas Bongard.''
        Mr. Bongard and Mr. Schlumberger, both born in France, were boyhood friends in St.-Tropez. Mr. Bongard was trained as a designer and in the jewelry trade's technical aspects. He was in the French Army in World War II, was captured by the Germans, escaped and moved to New York in 1940.
        He ran into Mr. Schlumberger by chance on Fifth Avenue, and the two opened a shop at 743 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street. An early client was Diana Vreeland.
        Before long the two men joined the Free French. Mr. Bongard served in Libya and his partner in London.
        After the war, they were partners in an East 63rd Street salon, Schlumberger. Clients included Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Bunny Mellon, Babe Paley and Betsy Whitney.
        They became Tiffany vice presidents in 1956 and moved their operation to the Tiffany store in 1995.
        Mr. Schlumberger died in 1987. Mr. Bongard ran the business for five more years. His wife, Mary, died in 1998.
        He is survived by a niece and a nephew, both of Paris.
