        John L. Wehle Jr., the chairman of the Genesee Corporation, died on March 10 at the Genesee Region Home Care and Hospice in Rochester after a battle with cancer. Mr. Wehle, a Rochester resident, was 53.
        He had been the chairman of Genesee, the Rochester company that owns the Genesee Brewing Company and other businesses, since his father died in 1993. His grandfather, Louis, bought the brewery, which was established in 1878, in 1932, anticipating the end of Prohibition.
        The brewery produces Genesee Beer, Genny Light and Genny Cream Ale, among other labels.
        Mr. Wehle served as president from 1982 until March 1, and as chief executive from 1986 until last June. During his tenure, the company expanded into food processing, real estate and equipment leasing. It also increased distribution of Genesee Brewing's products to 37 states and started HighFalls Brewing, a specialty brewing division.
        Even with the expansion, the company has been unable to compete profitably with larger brewers like Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing. In December, the Genesee Corporation announced that it had made an agreement to sell the brewing company to Platinum Holdings, a New York investment company. That deal is pending.
        Mr. Wehle graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology with a bachelor of science in business administration in 1970.
        He joined Genesee in 1968 and served in the operations and financial areas of the company, holding the positions of vice president and executive vice president before being named president.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; his daughters, Elizabeth and Carolyn; his brothers, Charles S. and Henry, and his mother, Marjorie, all of Rochester.
