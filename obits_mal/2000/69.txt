        Edward R. Cony, a former managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1961 as a reporter for the paper, died on Sunday in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 76.
        The cause was pneumonia and complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Richard J. Tofel, vice president for corporate communications at Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Journal.
        Mr. Cony had spent the last five years in a nursing home in Santa Cruz but kept a residence in Aptos, Calif.
        Mr. Cony announced that he had Alzheimer's in March 1988, a few weeks before he was to have become president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Although he had decided not to take the post, the society's board elected him president before accepting his resignation a few hours later.
        Edward Roger Cony was born in Augusta, Me., on March 15, 1923. He served in the Army from 1943 to 1946. He earned a bachelor's degree from Reed College and a master's degree from Stanford University.
        He became a reporter, starting at The Oregonian in Portland, Ore. In 1953, he joined The Journal as a reporter in its San Francisco bureau. He later was bureau chief in Los Angeles and Jacksonville, Fla.
        In 1961, he received the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting for articles about business ethics in the timber industry.
        In 1965, Mr. Cony became managing editor, the highest ranking news position at the paper then and now. He became executive editor of Dow Jones publications and news services in 1970, was named a vice president of Dow Jones in 1972 and in 1976  became president of the Dow Jones division that published The Asian Wall Street Journal.
        In 1977, Mr. Cony became a vice president for news at Dow Jones, and in 1980 was elected to the board of Ottaway Newspapers, a subsidiary of Dow Jones. He was also president of the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund from 1981 through 1988, as well as an associate editor of The Journal from 1986 to 1988, when he retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; a son, Daniel Cony of Aptos; five daughters, Ann Cony of Sacramento, Calif., Elizabeth Hiltz of Aptos, Katherine Dunn of Manhasset, N.Y., Marilyn Cony of Portland and Lauren Cony of San Francisco; a sister, Margaret Cony of Portland; and 10 grandchildren.
