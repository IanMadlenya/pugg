        Jim Wise, who wrote the music for the 1968 Off Broadway hit ''Dames at Sea,'' died on Nov. 13 at his home in New York. He was 81.
        ''Dames at Sea,'' with book and lyrics by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller, was a spoof of Hollywood musicals of the 1930's. The show opened at the Bouwerie Lane Theater with a cast of unknowns and quickly made a star of Bernadette Peters, as a small-town girl who tap-dances her way to fame.
        The show was widely produced and was revived in 1985 at the Lambs Theater. Mr. Wise also composed settings for famous poems in a collection recorded under the title ''Gather Ye Rosebuds.'' He wrote another musical, ''Yankee Ingenuity,'' in 1976 with Richard Bimonte, and collaborated with Don Price on a 1997 children's musical, ''Olaf.''
        Born in Akron, Ohio, Mr. Wise, whose full name was James Newton Wise, received a master's degree in English literature from Columbia University. He began his musical career writing material for performers at clubs like Upstairs at the Downstairs. He also taught at the American Language Center at Columbia, at the Baruch School of the City University of New York and at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
        No immediate family members survive.
