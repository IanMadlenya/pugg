        Felix Popper, a conductor who was for many years the music administrator at the New York City Opera, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.
        Mr. Popper was born in Vienna in 1908 and earned a doctorate in law and political science from the University of Vienna while also studying music at the Vienna State Academy of Music and privately with the conductor Hugo Reichenberger. He immigrated to the United States in 1940 and was decorated for his service in the United States Army in Europe during World War II.
        He joined the New York City Opera in 1949 as an assistant conductor and vocal coach. When he was appointed music administrator in 1958, he joined Julius Rudel, the company's general director, and John S. White, its managing director, in a triumvirate that guided the company through an important period in which it established itself firmly as a house giving important opportunities to American singers. The company credited him with discovering several important Americans, including Johanna Meier, Tatiana Troyanos, Gianna Rolandi, Faith Esham and Jane Shaulis.

        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a son, Richard, of Dallas; and a sister, Steffi Schuler of New York.
