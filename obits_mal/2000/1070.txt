        Gary Bonasorte, a playwright and a founder of an AIDS research clinic, died on Thursday. He was 45 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was lymphoma, said his companion, the playwright Terrence McNally.
        Mr. Bonasorte was the author of numerous plays, many of them produced Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway in the 1980's and 90's. Last year his play ''Big Hearts'' won the best play award at the Key West Theater Festival and is scheduled for productions in Miami and Houston.
        Among his other plays were ''The Aunts,'' ''Killing Real Estate Women,'' ''Reinventing Big Daddy'' and ''Ascendancy.''
        Mr. Bonasorte was a founder of the Rattlestick Theater Company, an Off Broadway company dedicated to producing the work of new American playwrights.
        He also was a founder of the Community Research Initiative on AIDS in 1991 and worked there and served on its board until his death.
        Mr. Bonasorte was born in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Bucknell University and trained as an actor for three years at the Drama Center in London. From 1993 to 1995 he was the director of special events at the Dramatists Guild in New York.
        In addition to Mr. McNally, he is survived by his father, Francis; a brother, Mark; and a sister, Kimberly, all of Pittsburgh.
