        Dr. William G. Sharwell, president of Pace University from 1984 to 1990, died on Monday in Rye, N.Y. He was 80 and lived much of his life in Bronxville, N.Y.
        The cause was lung fibrosis, his wife said.
        Before becoming president of Pace, Dr. Sharwell was affiliated with AT&T Corporation for more than 30 years, having joined its Bell Laboratories as a staff member in the personnel department in 1953. He retired from his post as a senior vice president in 1984 to become the fourth president of Pace. In 1987, he also became the chief executive at Pace.
        Born in Newark on July 26, 1920, Dr. Sharwell graduated from Seton Hall University in 1941. He earned an M.B.A. in accounting and finance at New York University in 1950 and another M.B.A. and a doctorate in corporate finance at the Harvard Business School two years later.
        Dr. Sharwell is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; two sons, William L. and Paul L.; and his sister, Marguerite S. McCrea.
