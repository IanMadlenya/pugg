        Marvin L. Stone, a former editor in chief of U.S. News & World Report and a former deputy director of the United States Information Agency, died on Monday at his home in Falls Church, Va. He was 76.
        The Associated Press said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Stone was the chief editor of U.S. News & World Report from 1976 to 1985, overseeing a shift toward the center from the more conservative views of David Lawrence, the magazine's founder. Mr. Stone also created opportunities for members of minorities at the magazine.
        U.S. News & World Report was sold in 1984 to Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the real estate developer and publisher. In 1985 Mr. Stone accepted an offer from the Reagan administration to become the deputy director of the information agency and served until 1989.
        From 1989 to 1995, he was president and chairman of the International Media Fund, an organization dedicated to furthering a free press in Eastern Europe.
        Mr. Stone received a bachelor's degree in 1947 from Marshall College in Huntington, W.Va., and a master's degree in 1949 from Columbia University's school of journalism.
        He was a European correspondent and then director for the Far East at the International News Service from 1949 to 1958. He joined U.S. News & World Report in 1960 as an associate editor.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Sydell Magelaner, known as Terry, whom he married in 1949; two daughters, Jamie Faith Stone of Falls Church and Stacey Hope Goodrich of West Melbourne, Fla.; and a son, Torren M. Stone of Falls Church.
