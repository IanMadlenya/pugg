        Jack Mann, an award-winning sportswriter and editor, died last Saturday in Columbia, Md. He was 74 and lived in Laurel, Md. The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Mann was the sports editor at Newsday from 1960 to 1962, helping turn what had been a section with a local focus into one that covered sports events nationwide.
        He was a two-time winner of the Eclipse Award for outstanding writing about horse racing and the Walter Haight Award for turf writing. He wrote ''The Decline and Fall of the New York Yankees'' (Simon & Schuster, 1966), which described how one of the great dynasties in sports declined under the ownership of CBS.
        John Austin Mann Jr., who was born in Brooklyn, worked for The New York Herald Tribune, The Washington Daily News, The Washington Star, The Baltimore Evening Sun, The Racing Times and The Washington Times, among others.
        Mr. Mann is survived by eight children: Karen Stevenson, vice president and general counsel of Knight-Ridder Inc. in San Francisco; Alan of Long Island; Steven of Richmond, Va.; and David of New York and Donald of Ashland, Ore., from a first marriage; and Katherine of McLean, Va., Jeffrey of Santa Cruz, Calif.; and a stepson, Devin Mann of Los Angeles from a second marriage. His first marriage, to Edythe Vaughan Stevenson, ended in divorce in 1966. His second marriage, to Judith Warden Luce, now Judy Mann, a columnist for The Washington Post, ended in divorce in 1983.
