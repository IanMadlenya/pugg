        Ian Dury, an emblem of the English punk music movement, died on Monday at his home in Hampstead, London. He was 57. The cause was liver cancer; Mr. Dury had made his illness public in 1998.
        Though ailing, Mr. Dury had performed last month at the London Palladium and continued his long campaign to raise awareness about polio, which he survived as a child.
        Polio left him partly paralyzed at age 7. He eventually studied painting at the Royal College of Art and taught art in the 1970's, but he had already begun the musical career that would blossom in 1977.
        That year, as punk heralded the uncomely and unrefined, Mr. Dury and his group, the Blockheads, released the rollicking album ''New Boots and Panties'' on Stiff Records. Mr. Dury adopted a roguish persona, delivering his frank lyrics in a good-natured cockney grumble.
        The band's first hit, ''Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,'' made fun of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle while extolling its primal satisfactions. Other hits, like ''Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick,'' also celebrated simple passions, with humor enlivened by Mr. Dury's lovable gruffness.
        After the band's popularity waned, Mr. Dury acted on television and in films like ''The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' directed by Peter Greenaway.
        He periodically reunited the Blockheads. In 1998 the band toured to support ''Mr. Love Pants,'' its first album in two decades, despite Mr. Dury's illness. ''I'm not here to be remembered,'' he told the BBC last September. ''I'm here to be alive.''
        He is survived by his wife, the sculptor Sophy Tilson; two sons, Albert and Billy; and two other children from his first marriage for whom details were unavailable.
