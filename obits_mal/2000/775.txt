        Former Representative James Hobson Morrison, a populist Democrat who represented southeastern Louisiana in Congress from 1943 to 1967, died on July 20 in his native Hammond, La. He was 91.
        A lawyer, he was elected to the House from Louisiana's Sixth District, which included the state capital, Baton Rouge.
        Within days of taking the oath of office, he quit his five committee assignments because they dealt with coinage and war claims rather than with the agricultural concerns of his district.
        He was known for channeling federal highway construction money to his district. A moderate on racial issues, he was one of the few Southerners to support the Kennedy administration's effort in 1962 to enlarge the the pivotal House Rules Committee, to dilute the power of segregationists.
        In 1965, he supported the Voting Rights Act, intended to enfranchise blacks in the South. His stance cost him a year later when he lost the Democratic primary to a segregationist, Judge John R. Rarick, who went on to win the election.
        Mr. Morrison, a 1934 law graduate of Tulane University, returned to his practice in Hammond, which he maintained until recently.
        Mr. Morrison raised money for Southeastern Louisiana University and steered federal contracts to its campus in Hammond.
        His survivors include his wife of 60 years, Marjorie Abbey Morrison; two sons, James Jr., of Hammond, and Benjamin, of New Orleans; and two grandchildren.
