        Thomas M. Keenan, who for 14 years was chairman of the New York Times unit of the Newspaper Guild, died yesterday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 60 and lived in Oakland, N.J.
        The cause was colon cancer, said Barry F. Lipton, the president of the Newspaper Guild of New York.
        Mr. Keenan led the union team in five negotiations with The Times between 1984 and 1994.
        Lena Williams, who succeeded him as head of the Times unit, said that Mr. Keenan had urged her to become active in the union as part of his personal effort to increase the number of blacks and women in the top leadership.
        Mr. Keenan joined The Times in 1968 and held several jobs in various business departments. He took a medical leave of absence in 1996.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene.
