        Milton Amgott, a Manhattan lawyer who counseled Albany lawmakers and counted some prominent American writers among his private clients, died Tuesday at his home on the Upper West Side. He was 81.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Over the years, Mr. Amgott represented popular authors like Robert Ludlum and Donald E. Westlake and science fiction writers like James Blish and Theodore Sturgeon. He closed his Midtown law office five years ago.
        Active in the New York State Liberal Party, he briefly served as an assistant state attorney general -- or ''attorney colonel,'' as he put it -- in 1994 and 1995. For 20 years before that, he commuted to Albany as a paid consultant to help Assembly committee members draft bills on eminent domain, bottle deposits, the rights of mental patients and the protection of utility customers after deregulation.
        Milton Amgott was born in Manhattan and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University in 1937. He received law degrees from Brooklyn Law School in 1942 and N.Y.U. in 1948 and was fluent in several languages, including Serbo-Croatian and Middle English.
        In World War II he served in the Army's Psychological Warfare Division, preparing intelligence reports and debriefing German prisoners.
        Mr. Amgott is survived by his wife of 38 years, Madeline Karr Amgott; a daughter, Margo Amgott of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; a son, Seth, of Washington; a stepson, Andy Karr of Halifax, Nova Scotia; a stepdaughter, Katharine Karr Kaitin of Lexington, Mass.; a stepbrother, Daniel Platt of Delray Beach, Fla.; and four grandchildren. He was divorced from his first wife, Janet Laib Gottlieb, who died last November.
