        Jacques Jean Francois Goddet, the founder and for 40 years the editor of the well-known sports newspaper, L'Equipe, and for 40 years the director of the world's most important bicycle race, the Tour de France, died last Friday in Paris. He was 95.
        The French sports minister, Marie-George Buffet, called Mr. Goddet ''one of the founding fathers'' of modern sports, and said he ''knew how to speak with emotion about the beauty of sports.''
        Mr. Goddet was born June 21, 1905, in Paris. In 1924, after he had studied at Oxford, he joined the French sports newspaper L'Auto, which his father, Victor, had co-founded.
        He was the editor of L'Auto from 1928 until the newspaper folded in 1944. He then founded L'Equipe, now a six days a week French sports newspaper with a circulation exceeding 400,000. He was editor in chief until 1984, when he retired and became the honorary president.
        L'Equipe's primary interests are soccer and, in season, the Tour de France. Under Mr. Goddet's stewardship, it helped create major sports events like the European Cup soccer tournament in 1956 and the World Cup skiing circuit in 1967.
        The Tour de France is a debilitating three-week race in July of up to 150 miles a day through flat farmlands and more than 100 miles a day through the mountain peaks of the Alps and the Pyrenees. In 1903, Mr. Goddet's father was one of the three founders of the Tour, and the son became the interim director in 1936 and served as director general from 1947 to 1987.
        After World War II, the Tour was revived with a $100,000 budget that included 100 bikes (and 50 spares) for the 100 riders. Prize money totaled $18,000. Now the budget exceeds $50 million, prize money approaches $5 million and the riders supply their own bikes.
        Adding to the Tour's international allure, Americans have won five times since 1986 -- Greg LeMond three times and Lance Armstrong the last two years. The Tour has become so important that in 1997 the American cycling newspaper Velo News worried that ''it could eventually damage the complex, vibrant structure of professional cyling'' and could ''feed off the sport that created it.''
        In 1983, Mr. Goddet wrote:
        ''The Tour is a world on the move, with an astonishing entanglement of all its so varied components: its drama and laughter, its triumphs and catastrophes, its heroes and obscure servants.''
        L'Equipe praised Mr. Goddet with three pages of articles and photographs. It said he was always on the go, constantly late for meetings, but always ahead of his time.
        In 1991, in an autobiography entitled ''L'Equipe Belle,'' Mr. Goddet said that being a journalist was ''the pride of my life.''
        ''I have passionately loved this means of expression,'' he wrote, ''for its spontaneity, its diversity, for the influence it can hold.''
