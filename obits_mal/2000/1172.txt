        Lionel Rogosin, a documentary filmmaker, died on Dec. 8 in Los Angeles. He was 76.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son Daniel.
        Mr. Rogosin made his debut in the 1950's with ''On the Bowery,'' a tour of New York's notorious Skid Row that was nominated for an Academy Award and won the Venice Film Festival's documentary grand prize.
        He went to South Africa to make his next film in 1959, ''Come Back, Africa,'' persuading local authorities he was there to make a musical and then working in secret to record the struggles of black Africans living under apartheid.
        In addition to making films like  ''Good Times, Wonderful Times,'' ''Black Fantasy,'' and ''Arab Israeli Dialogue,'' he also owned the Bleecker Street Cinema in New York from 1962 to the early 70's.
        In addition to his son Daniel, of Los Angeles, Mr. Rogosin is survived by another son, Michael, who lives in France, and three grandchildren.
