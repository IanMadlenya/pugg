        Joseph Sullivan, a New Jersey businessman who ran for governor and later served as chairman of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, died Monday at a hospital in Morristown, N.J. He was 63.
        The cause was a stroke, said a son, Edward Sullivan.
        Mr. Sullivan, who lived in New Vernon, N.J., spent $1 million of his own money and came in third in the Republican primary in 1981, behind Thomas Kean, who became governor, and former Paterson Mayor Lawrence Kramer. After the election, Governor Kean appointed Mr. Sullivan to head the turnpike authority. Mr. Sullivan was later also appointed finance chairman of the state's Republican Party and served as a co-chairman of President George Bush's campaign in New Jersey in 1988.
        Known as Bo, Mr. Sullivan was born on Feb. 10, 1937, in Manhattan. He graduated from Princeton University and earned a law degree from Seton Hall University.
        Before entering politics, Mr. Sullivan was president and chief executive of Bomont Industries, based in West Caldwell, N.J., that once produced typewriter ribbons but now specializes in laser printers and industrial fabrics.
        Besides his son, Edward, who lives in Hoboken, Mr. Sullivan is survived by his wife, Eileen; three other sons, Joseph of Mendham, N.J.; Michael of Bernardsville, N.J., and James of Mendham, and 10 grandchildren.
