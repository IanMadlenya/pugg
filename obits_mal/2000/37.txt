        Yehuda Ebstein, a former executive of several Jewish nonprofit organizations, died on Dec. 27 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said a daughter, Aviva Ebstein Kroninger of Manhattan.
        Mr. Ebstein was born in Oppeln, Germany, on Oct. 1, 1924, and emigrated to Palestine in late 1938 with his family. He joined the British Army at 15, at the outbreak of World War II, and earned the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        After the war, Mr. Ebstein returned to Palestine to fight for Israeli independence and served in the Israeli Army, again rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        In 1951, he arrived in the United States and spent more than 30 years working for Jewish nonprofit groups like the Development Corporation for Israel, which sold bonds for projects in Israel. He worked there from 1952 to 1958. He then joined the American Friends of Hebrew University and the World Jewish Congress, where he was executive director of its American section.
        In 1964, Mr. Ebstein joined the National Committee for Labor Israel, the United States affiliate of Histadrut, the national labor organization in Israel. He was executive director for its New York region until 1984, when he became deputy executive vice president of the committee. He was appointed executive vice president in 1990 and retired two years later.
        Besides his daughter, Mr. Ebstein is survived by his wife, Shoshonna; another daughter, Gila Lewis of Greenwich, Conn.; a sister, Ilse Dinari of Ramat Gan, Israel, and five granddaughters.
