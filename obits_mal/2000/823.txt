        He also edited the book ''More of the Best of Milton Berle's Private Joke File'' (1994, Avon). Berle and Arnold Schwarzenegger were among the celebrities he wrote one-liners for.

        He was also a co-author of the screenplay for the film ''Do Not Disturb'' (1965) with Doris Day.
        Born in Poland, Mr. Rosen came to New York City with his family as a toddler and went on to graduate from City College. During World War II he became chief navigator of his squadron in the Eighth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations. He won the Air Medal five times, Mr. Kalisch said.
