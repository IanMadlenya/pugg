        John Robert Starr, who as managing editor of a Little Rock, Ark., newspaper led it to circulation victory over its once overpowering rival -- partly through the force of his 365-days-a-year column -- died of a heart attack just outside Del Norte, Colo., on Saturday. He was 72.
        Mr. Starr's outsize and outspoken personality took on many opponents, some of whom, like President Clinton, spoke kindly of him after his death.
        Mr. Starr was traveling from Arizona, where he had observed spring training for the Colorado Rockies baseball team, to the Colorado home of his son, John Phillip Starr.
        He retired as managing editor of The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1992. The Democrat's battle with its rival was won in 1991, when the Gazette was absorbed by the Democrat.
        Mr. Starr was born in Lake Village, Ark., on Dec. 29, 1927. He was named managing editor of the Arkansas Democrat in 1978 after 19 years as a reporter with The Associated Press.
        Mr. Starr was famous for not sugarcoating opinions in his column. He called the Gazette staff ''crybabies'' during his paper's struggle for dominance.
        After alternating periods of admiration and dislike for Mr. Clinton, as governor and president, Mr. Starr settled on consistent animosity. The perception of his coverage of Mr. Clinton is suggested by the widespread impression that he coined the nickname ''Slick Willie,'' when in fact it was Paul Greenberg, editor of the paper's editorial page, who first used it.
        President Clinton said he and his wife were saddened by Mr. Starr's death. ''John Robert was as tenacious a friend as he was a foe,'' Mr. Clinton said.
        In addition to his son John Phillip, Mr. Starr is survived by Norma, his wife of 51 years, another son, Robert Russell, and a daughter, Linda Sharon Starr.
