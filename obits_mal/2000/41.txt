        Timothy Charles Venn Elliott, a Manhattan advertising executive, died Dec. 30 at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 51.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his associates said.
        At his death Mr. Elliott, a native of England, was the managing director of the flagship office in New York of FCB Worldwide. He had previously led Foote, Cone & Belding's San Francisco office.
        Born in Dorset, Mr. Elliott was educated at Harrow School and graduated from Cambridge University, earning a B.A. in 1969 and an M.A. in 1974. In a 30-year-career in advertising, he worked for a number of agencies, including Benton & Bowles in London and, for 15 years, Ogilvy & Mather in South Africa, Canada and eventually New York, where he managed international accounts for companies like American Express and Trans World Airlines.
        He joined FCB Worldwide in New York in 1997 to handle its Citibank business worldwide and moved to San Francisco to direct its office there in 1998. He returned to New York last January to take charge of that office.
        Mr. Elliott is survived by his wife, Daryl Elliott, executive vice president of Young & Rubicam in New York.
