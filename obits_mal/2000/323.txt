        Albert R. Connelly, a retired partner at the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, died at his home in Manhattan last Wednesday. He was 91.
        Mr. Connelly spent his entire professional career, from 1932 to 1978, at the law firm. He became a partner in 1941 and practiced in many fields. He was particularly well known as a litigator and an antitrust lawyer.
        He argued nine cases before the  Supreme Court, including United States v. Penn-Olin in 1964, a case in which he obtained an affirmation of a lower-court ruling that allowed a joint venture between two large companies that were potential competitors, the Pennwalt Corporation and the Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation.
        Albert Ray Connelly was born on Nov. 24, 1908, in Manhattan. He graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School. From 1957 to 1958, he was chairman of the executive committee of the City Bar Association.
        Mr. Connelly's wife, Eleanor, died in 1997.
        He is survived by two daughters, Mary C. Graff of Urbanna, Va., and Jean C. Mooney of Healdsburg, Calif.; two granddaughters and one great-grandson.
        Correction:  March 29, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Albert R. Connelly, a retired partner at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, misstated his birthdate. It was March 24, 1908, not Nov. 24.
