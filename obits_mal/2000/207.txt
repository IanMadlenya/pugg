        Victor Edward Cohn, a prize-winning science reporter, editor and columnist for The Washington Post and, earlier, The Minneapolis Tribune, died on Monday at his home in Washington. He was 80.
        The cause was lung cancer, The Post reported.
        Mr. Cohn was the author of several books, including ''News and Numbers: A Guide to Reporting Statistical Claims and Controversies in Health and Other Fields'' (Iowa State University Press, 1988). It is a standard reference book.
        After his retirement from The Post in 1993 as a senior writer and columnist, Mr. Cohn was associated with the American Statistical Association, Georgetown University and the Harvard University School of Public Health. He was a founder of the Council for the Advancement of Science Writing.
        Mr. Cohn was the first writer to twice win the American Association for the Advancement of Science-George Westinghouse Prize for Distinguished Science Reporting, in 1951 and 1959.
        Mr. Cohn was a native of Minneapolis and a 1941 graduate of the University of Minnesota. Before joining The Post as science editor in 1968, he was a science reporter for The Tribune for 20 years.
        He is survived by a son, Jeffrey P., of Takoma Park, Md.; two daughters, Deborah Runkle of Kensington, Md., and Phyllis Beetsch of Minneapolis, and six grandchildren.
