        His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and the Butler Art Institute. He had solo exhibitions at the Smith College Art Museum, the Fort Wayne Museum and at the Farnsworth Museum in Rockland, Me.
