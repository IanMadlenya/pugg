        Dr. Joe Webb Peoples, a geologist who was key in creating Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, Conn., died on March 21 at a hospital in Middletown, Conn. He was 92 and lived in Chester, Conn.
        Dr. Peoples was head of both the geology department of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and the Connecticut State Geological and Natural History Survey in 1966, when, during excavation for a state building in Rocky Hill, a slab of rock was turned over, revealing large three-pronged dinosaur prints on it.
        Those prints were the first in what was later discovered to be a field of more than 2,000, and Dr. Peoples was instrumental in safeguarding the site and the prints, his colleagues said.
        Soon afterward, state officials agreed to preserve the land, and a state park was created on the site.
        ''Right from the beginning, Joe wanted it preserved and saved to teach schoolchildren,'' said Richard L. Krueger, a geologist who is director of the park, in a recent interview with The Hartford Courant.
        Dr. Peoples was born in Springfield, Tenn., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Vanderbilt University and his doctorate in geology from Princeton in 1932. He joined Wesleyan's faculty in 1935 and retired in 1975.
        His wife, Ruth, died in 1993. He is survived by two sons, David Webb Peoples of Berkeley, Calif., and Douglass Peoples of East Hampton, Conn.; a daughter, Penelope Peoples of Cornwall, Vt.; and four grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
