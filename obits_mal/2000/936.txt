        Harold B. Barg, a sales and marketing agent in the United States for owners of well-known vineyards and wineries in the Burgundy region of France, died on Sept. 18 in Dijon, France. He was 75, lived in Roseland, N.J., and was on a business trip.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Barg was a middleman between wine growers in France and the wine trade in the United States.
        He carried out his work through HBB International, of which he was president from 1987 until his death. The company is now based in Roseland. He also worked in a partnership with a Burgundy grower, Francois Labet, owner of Domaine Chateau de la Tour in Vougeot, near Dijon.
        Mr. Barg was an executive with Schenley Industries from 1959 to 1986. He rose to senior vice president and dealt mostly with imported wines.
        A native of Boston, he received a bachelor's degree from the University of New Hampshire.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; two daughters, Marcy Lefko of Dallas and Jane Barg of Skillman, N.J.; a son, Steven, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; and five grandchildren.
