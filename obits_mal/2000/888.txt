        William A. Lubbers, the National Labor Relations Board's general counsel from 1979 to 1984, died on Aug. 26. He was 75 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm he suffered at his home, his son Jeffrey said.
        Mr. Lubbers was a lawyer with the labor board from 1952 until he retired in 1984.
        As general counsel, he was involved in the resolution of one of the longest union disputes in American history. The dispute began after the Darlington Manufacturing Company closed its mill in Darlington, S.C., in 1956, after the workers voted to be represented by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
        The plant was owned by Deering-Milliken Inc. of New York. The union contended that the closing was illegal and that it was at least partly intended to discourage unionization of other textile plants.
        After much litigation, the United States Supreme Court upheld charges of unfair labor practice. The union had sought $20 million in back pay for the former Darlington workers. Mr. Lubbers proposed $5 million, and he announced in 1980 that each side had agreed that the sum, to be paid by Milliken & Company, formerly Deering-Milliken, would go to the 500 surviving former employees or the heirs of those who had died.
        A native of Cedar Grove, Wis., Mr. Lubbers was an infantryman in World War II. He received both his bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin.
        Besides his son Jeffrey S., of Takoma Park, Md., he is survived by his wife, Val; another son, Kevin W., of Bethesda; two daughters, K. Darcy Lubbers of Santa Monica, Calif., and Sherry L. Lubbers of Manhattan; four brothers; and three sisters.
