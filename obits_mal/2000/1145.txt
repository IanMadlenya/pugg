        John Liscio, who wrote and published The Liscio Report, a financial newsletter, died on Nov. 29 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 51 and lived in Upper Montclair, N.J.
        The cause was liver and kidney failure related to hepatitis C, said his wife, Frances.
        Mr. Liscio, whose motto was ''To trust is good, not to trust is better,'' founded his influential bond market newsletter in 1992 after working briefly as a senior editor of U.S. News & World Report. In the late 1980's and early 90's, he was on the staff of the financial weekly Barron's.
        In October, Barron's said that Mr. Liscio had made a success of himself on his own, writing for the last eight years The Liscio Report, ''an astute and irreverent look at the credit markets and economy.''
        Mr. Liscio told Barron's at that time: ''I don't try to forecast. I don't think forecasting is something within the realm of human possibility.'' But he had made a reputation for himself by forecasting the recession in the early 1990's.
        He was born in Manhattan, graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx and received a bachelor's degree from Fordham University.
        After serving in the Marine Corps, he began working as a financial writer and analyst in the late 1970's.
        Surviving are his wife of 14 years, Frances Pelzman Liscio, who is a humor writer; a daughter, Laura, 11; a son, Gregory, 9; his parents, Armand and Josephine Liscio of Delray Beach, Fla.; and a sister, Jeanette Kamciyan of Boca Raton, Fla.
