        George Edmund Sandell, a versatile viola and violin player, teacher and inventor, died on Aug. 26 in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 88 and lived in Santa Monica.
        Born in Malmo, Sweden, Mr. Sandell grew up in Denver and graduated from Denver University in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in music. He continued his musical studies in New York, notably with the viola virtuoso William Primrose, and, on a scholarship, at the Royal Swedish Conservatory in Stockholm.
        He played with the Denver Symphony Orchestra and, after moving to Los Angeles in 1938, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Pasadena and Santa Monica Symphonies. He performed as a member of classical quartets but also began to play with pop, swing and Latin music groups, including the string sections of the big bands of Harry James, Jimmy Dorsey and Xavier Cugat.
        The principal Hollywood studios hired him to play for their orchestral soundtracks, as did the arranger Nelson Riddle. With Mr. Riddle's orchestra, Mr. Sandell performed several arrangements for Frank Sinatra, onstage and in the recording studio. In 1946 the U.S.O. commended him for entertaining the troops in World War II as a soloist and as a member of the Harry James and Tommy Dorsey orchestras. The Treasury Department also cited him for helping to organize War Bond events in Hollywood.
        Mr. Sandell's life took a sidestep into business in 1947, when he began to market a kitchen gadget he invented. Patented and trademarked the Gee-Bee, it was a sponge with a plastic handle for washing dishes. To make and distribute it, Mr. Sandell formed his own company, which he sold to the DuPont Company in 1953.
        In the 1960's and 70's he played many concerts and taught master classes on both the viola and the violin.
        He is survived by his third wife, Sheila Ruby; a stepson, Arlen R. Lessin of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.
