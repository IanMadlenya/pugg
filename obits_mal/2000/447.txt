        Robert T. MacDonald, a former publisher of The International Herald Tribune, died on Friday in Sarasota, Fla. He was 69 and lived in Sarasota.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. MacDonald, a former executive vice president of The New York Herald Tribune, was named publisher of The Herald Tribune in Paris in 1966, after The Washington Post acquired a substantial interest in the paper's Paris edition.
        In 1967 the Paris-based International Edition of The New York Times was merged with The Herald Tribune's Paris edition to create a three-way joint venture named The International Herald Tribune. Now appearing six days a week, it is owned jointly by The New York Times and The Washington Post; Whitney Communications, the partner representing the old Herald Tribune ownership, sold out in 1991.
        With Mr. MacDonald as publisher, the renamed newspaper sought readers everywhere who wanted to follow news from the United States, and the number of advertisers grew.
        Mr. Macdonald resigned as publisher in 1977 and for a decade served as chairman of Hudson Research Europe Ltd., an organization based in Paris doing political and economic analyses. From 1980 to 1997 he was also the managing director of MacDonald & Company, an investment firm with headquarters in Stamford, Conn.
        Born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., Robert Taylor McDonald graduated in 1952 from Yale, served in the Navy and received a master's degree in business administration in 1958 from the University of Pennsylvania. His 1960 marriage to Christiana Barbara Besch ended in divorce in 1977.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Gillian S. Tripier, whom he married in 1978; three children from his first marriage, a daughter, Jennifer L. MacDonald, and two sons, Gregory C. and Michael S.; a sister, Mary E. MacDonald, and a grandchild.
