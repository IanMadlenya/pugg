        John J. Oliver Sr., a former president and chief operating officer of the Afro-American newspaper group, died on June 30 at a nursing home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 86.
        Mr. Oliver, a native of Brazil, Ind., was the grandson of John H. Murphy Sr., who founded the Baltimore Afro-American in 1892. He graduated from DePauw University and joined the family business in 1935.
        Mr. Oliver spent 47 years with the newspaper group, which is based in Baltimore. The Afro-American peaked with the civil rights movement in the 1960's, when it published about a dozen editions circulating from South Carolina to New Jersey. At the time, the Afro-American spotlighted racial discrimination.
        The group now publishes weekly in Baltimore and Washington.
        Mr. Oliver, who was widowed twice, is survived by a son, John J., the current publisher; a daughter, Marilyn O. Pickett of Silver Spring; and a grandson.
