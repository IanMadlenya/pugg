        The Rev. Carl Elkanah Bates, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, the country's largest Protestant denomination, died on Dec. 21 at his home in Hendersonville, N.C. He was 85.
        Mr. Bates, who led the convention from 1970 to 1972, had previously been president of the Baptist General Convention of Texas and the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina.
        He was considered a moderate who deplored the infighting between opposite wings of the church that after his presidency led to the ascendancy of the conservative wing of the convention.
        Carl Bates was born in Liberty, Miss., and became what is known as a Gideon convert. As Mr. Bates told it, he was in a New Orleans hotel room in 1934, standing by an open window and feeling despondent enough to contemplate suicide. Just then he noticed the Gideon Bible that is present in all hotel rooms and opened it.
        ''I was a self-styled agnostic,'' he once testified, ''but as I read that Bible, it dawned on me that I had cut myself off from God.''
        Mr. Bates graduated from Mississippi College in Clinton in 1937 and was ordained a minister in 1938. He earned a master's degree at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky., in 1941, and a doctorate of divinity at Baylor University in 1951.
        His ministry took him to Southern churches in several states. He became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charlotte, N.C., in 1959.
        For five years he was a senior professor of preaching and pastoral ministries at Southern Baptist Seminary, which created a Carl E. Bates Chair of Preaching in his honor.
        Mr. Bates is survived by his wife of 60 years, Myra Mae Gray Bates, who was a convention vice president in the 1970's; a daughter, Judith Stoneham of Hendersonville; a brother, Eugene Bates of Baton Rouge, La.; a sister, Mildred Day of Baton Rouge; and two grandsons.
