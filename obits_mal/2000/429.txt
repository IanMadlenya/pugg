        Paul Bao-Jen Chu, a former international labor official and retired professor at Rutgers University, died on April 6 at a hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla., where he had moved from Bethesda, Md., four years ago.
        He was 85.
        Dr. Chu also formerly lived in Geneva and Bellemead, N.J.
        A native of Shanghai, he was an economics graduate of Oberlin College and received an M.A. in international relations from the University of California at Berkeley. He was with the International Labor Organization in Geneva from 1948 to 1974, rising to chief of its workers' education branch.
        When the organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1968, it credited Dr. Chu with helping to shape and put into effect adult labor education programs and child labor laws.
        He joined the Rutgers faculty as a professor of labor education and international relations in 1974, and headed the university's labor studies department until he retired in 1983.
        Over his career, Dr. Chu was credited with some 120 publications and reports on labor laws and economics.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Phyllis Shu-Yuan Teng Chu; a daughter, Dr. Pauline Chu Pan of Denville, N.J.; a son, Donald Liang, of Morris Plains, N.J.; three brothers, Philip Bao-Mei, of Honolulu, Dr. David Bao-Shen, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Dr. James Bao-Teh, of North Haven, Conn.; two sisters, Constance Bao-Hwa Chu Chien of Manhattan and Rosalind Bao-Yuen Chu of the Bronx; and four grandchildren.
