        Pierre Clementi, the darkly handsome French character actor who made a specialty of seductive and menacing roles, died on Dec. 27 in Paris. He was 57.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Catherine Verret, the executive director of Unifrance USA, a French film association in Manhattan.
        Though he appeared in dozens of films, Mr. Clementi was probably best known for Luis Bunuel's ''Belle de Jour'' (1967), the story of a respectable woman whose sexual awakening is spurred by a foray into prostitution.
        In it, Mr. Clementi plays a young gangster, a scarred, limping lothario who slowly seduces the film's heroine, played by Catherine Deneuve. The role, which he played with a sneer and a simmering sexuality, sealed Mr. Clementi's reputation as a bad boy, both in life and on film.
        In the years after ''Belle de Jour,'' Mr. Clementi went on to appear as the devil (in Bunuel's ''Milky Way''), as a cannibal (''Pigpen''), and a bisexual jazz musician (''Steppenwolf''). While the reviews for each were decidely negative, critics almost always took note of Mr. Clementi's ability to raise a film's sex appeal.
        In 1972, he was arrested in Rome and charged with possession of LSD and cocaine. He served 17 months in an Italian prison before an appeals court acquitted and freed him. Lacking a resident visa, however, he was given 24 hours to leave Italy.
        In addition to Bunuel, Mr. Clementi was also a favorite of the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, who featured him in ''Partner'' (1968) as a drama teacher and his alter ego, and in ''The Conformist'' (1970), as a homosexual chauffeur.
        In 1998, he returned to the screen in ''Hideous Kinky,'' about the spiritual awakening of a young woman (Kate Winslet). True to form, he played Santoni, an elderly libertine.
