        David Blechman, a co-founder of the Twinlab Corporation, a nutritional supplement company that has grown with America's health consciousness over 30 years, died on July 7 at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and divided his time between Commack, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.
        He died after complications from heart bypass surgery, a spokesman for Twinlab said.
        Mr. Blechman founded Twinlab, based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., with his wife, Jean, and named it for their two sets of twin sons. The Blechmans later had a fifth son, and eventually the entire family worked for the business.
        In a 1997 interview with The New York Times, Ross Blechman, who became chief executive of Twinlab when his father retired four years ago, said the business began in 1968 with a liquid protein product.
        ''A few years later, Dr. Robert Linn wrote a book called 'The Last Chance Diet,' which involved a lot of liquid protein, and we were swept up in the craze,'' Ross Blechman said.
        Today the company markets hundreds of vitamins, minerals, herbs and sports nutrition products. Its worldwide sales are more than $300 million a year.
        David Blechman was born on Sept. 22, 1923, in Brooklyn. He attended Long Island University until he was drafted into the Army during World War II and served with the Army Medical Corps in Europe. After the war, he became a pharmaceutical salesman.
        With his sons approaching college age, Mr. Blechman realized he could not afford tuition and took a gamble starting his own business.
        ''He figured he could always go back to the sales job and be broke again,'' Ross Blechman said.
        David Blechman is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Jean Leopold; his brother, Dr. Harry Blechman of Manhattan; five sons, Ross, Dean and Neil, all of Setauket, N.Y.; Steve of Poquott, N.Y., and Brian of Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.; and 10 grandchildren.
