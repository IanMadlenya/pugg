        Dr. Guillermo C. Sanchez, an internist and medical historian associated with Massachusetts General Hospital for five decades, died on Aug. 17 at his home in West Newton, Mass. He was 75.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Sanchez, a prominent figure in Boston medicine, published articles on a variety of subjects, including the early development of ether anesthesia in the 1840's.
        Besides treating thousands of patients at the hospital and at his private practice in West Newton, Dr. Sanchez engaged in historical research that made him a regular visitor to hospital archives going back 190 years.
        He worked to improve the accessibility and scholarly usefulness of those archives and, in 1995, was elected founding chairman of Massachusetts General's new archives committee. He held that position at his death.
        Guillermo Sanchez was born in Guatemala and came to the United States to attend Harvard College. He graduated in 1945, received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1949 and completed his training in cardiology and gastroenterology at Massachusetts General.
        Fluent in several languages, Dr. Sanchez made a point of tending to patients from abroad. He also spent a year in Africa in the early 1970's to serve as chief of gastroenterology at a hospital in Kampala, Uganda, and as a consultant to Kenya's national hospital.
        Dr. Sanchez is survived by his wife, Sylvia Burleigh Sanchez; three sons, Dr. Pedro G., of Wayland, Mass., Juan Luis, of Wellesley, Mass., and Miguel A., of London; four daughters, Maria P., and Isa, both of Cambridge, Mass., Lucia, of Redwood City, Calif., and Felicia, of Boston; two siblings, Roberto and Isa Sella, both of Guatemala City; and 10 grandchildren.
