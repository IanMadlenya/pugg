        The Rev. Ruben Dario Colon, who founded one of the first Lutheran churches in New York City to conduct services in Spanish, died May 5 in Orlando, Fla. He was 76 and lived in Sebring, Fla.
        The cause was lymphatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Colon was chairman of the Puerto Rican Community Development Project, an antipoverty program for Hispanics in the 1960's, and was appointed New York Police Department chaplain in 1988, the first Hispanic to hold the post.
        Mr. Colon was born May 15, 1923, in Rio Grande, P.R. He attended Union Theological Seminary in Puerto Rico before he moved to Manhattan. ''You don't have to go to Africa to be a missionary,'' he said later.
        Mr. Colon was ordained a Baptist minister in 1950. He worked for seven years as chaplain of the Mariner's Church of the New York Port Society.
        He became a Lutheran in 1959 and founded Resurrection Church, which held services throughout the city before finding a permanent home in the South Bronx in 1968.
        He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from Adelphi University and a master's degree in social work from Fordham University.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Ramonita Orabona de Colon;  a daughter, Damaris Colon de Corchado of San Juan, P.R.; two sons, Ruben Dario Colon Jr. of Columbus, Ga., and Levi Colon of Brooklyn; a sister, Lydia Colon de Rodriguez of Bayamon, P.R.; two brothers, Eliezer Colon of Bayamon and Agustin Colon of Rio Piedras, P.R.; and seven grandchildren.
