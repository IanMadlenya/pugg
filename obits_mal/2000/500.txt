        Clifford S. Sutter, the graceful, world-ranked stylist of the 1930's and tennis populist of the 1960's who sought to expand the game from its country club base into the public schools and parks as the president of the Eastern Lawn Tennis Association, died last Thursday in Barnstable, Mass. He was 89.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Suzanne Tenney Sutter.
        In his matches with the titans of the 30's, who included the likes of Big Bill Tilden, Ellsworth Vines, Fred Perry and John Van Ryn, Sutter relied on precision over power, finesse over speed, a placid demeanor over flamboyance.
        And although he was more often the semifinalist than the champion at the end of the day -- his 4-6, 8-10, 12-10, 10-8, 6-1 loss to Vines at Forest Hills in 1932 remains the longest semifinal match, in number of games, in the history of the United States championships -- Sutter earned the unmitigated respect of his peers.
        Tilden described Sutter's game as ''steady, sure and accurate,'' in The Times in 1931, and Helen Hull Jacobs, the United States women's champion in 1934, praised the ''highly developed grace and rhythm of his strokes and footwork.''
        Sutter won national intercollegiate singles titles in 1930 and 1932 for Tulane University in his hometown of New Orleans, was undefeated in United States Davis Cup play (1931-33; 3-0 in singles) and was ranked No. 5 in the world in 1932.
        He retired from international tennis in 1934 and worked in publishing and advertising in New York, rising to vice president at Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborne in the 1960's. Meanwhile, Sutter remained a devotee of all racquet sports, winning seven national men's doubles titles in platform tennis from 1941 to 1950. He was runner-up in the 1951 national squash racquets doubles championships.
        He also continued to play tennis at the Greenwich (Conn.) Field Club and always ''maintained his loathing of losing,'' as one club member put it.
        But Sutter's legacy to the game may be the stand he made off the court in the 1960's. In 1962, concerned about tennis's declining popularity, he led a ''bloodless coup'' for leadership of the Eastern tennis association and as president initiated an ambitious program of construction, clinics and instruction in public schools and parks in the region.
        Sutter is survived by his wife of 64 years; three daughters, Rebecca Sutter Breed of Greenwich, Suzanne Sutter Augur of Portland, Me., and Michele Sutter Hodgin of Venice, Calif.; his son, Clifford Samuel Sutter Jr. of Fall River, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
