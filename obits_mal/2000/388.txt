        Jerry D. Mead, a wine writer who long crusaded against neo-Prohibitionism, died on Wednesday at his home in Carson City, Nev. He was 61.
        The cause was lymphoma and heart disease, said Edwin J. Schwartz of San Francisco, a friend.
        Mr. Mead, who described himself as The Wine Curmudgeon (often just T.W.C.), wrote a weekly column, ''Mead on Wine,'' for 32 years. It was syndicated in California and Nevada and appeared in some 30 newspapers at its peak.
        Mr. Mead found a national audience with Wine Trader, a magazine he founded 23 years ago, edited and published six times a year. The Trader was partly a politically flavored vehicle for his piquant commentary on wine issues like warning messages on labels, which he opposed. Its cover had headlines like ''Prohibition Returns to Chicago'' and ''Confirmation: Wine Reduces Heart Disease.''
        Mr. Mead, who tended to be less feisty in person than in print, became an outspoken foe of government regulation of interstate wine shipping years before it became a national issue. The rise of wine sales on the Internet only fueled his ardor.
        While Mr. Mead's targets, especially members of the Wine Institute, the California trade association, might say he accentuated the negative, he was positive about wine itself, relishing wine tasting and judging. He founded the sizable New World International Wine Competition, in San Bernardino.
        Mr. Mead is survived by his companion, Sandra McCown; two sons, Sean and Jerry Dion; a daughter, Jeanne Smith; his mother, Mary Frances Boyd Mead; two stepsons, James Riederer Jr. and Thomas Riederer, and several grandchildren, great-grandchildren and step-grandchildren.
        In 1967 he created a club for, he wrote, ''wine lovers of modest means'' -- that is, for revelers.
        ''It was not your lifted-pinky school of wine drinking,'' Mr. Schwartz said. The club is called W.I.N.O., for Wine Investigation for Novices and Oenophiles.
