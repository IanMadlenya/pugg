        Bruce Giles, a newspaper executive in the Southeast and a former chairman of the Freedom of Information Committee of the Associated Press Managing Editors association, died on Thursday in Tuscaloosa, Ala. He was 53.
        The cause of death was cancer.

In 1969, he was hired as a reporter by The Miami Herald, where he eventually covered the Statehouse in Tallahassee, Fla. He and a colleague shared the Green Eyeshades Award, presented by the Atlanta chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, for a series of newspaper articles on campaign contributions.
        Mr. Giles is survived by his wife, Sherie; a daughter, Rebecca Giles Wood of Auburn, Ala.; his parents, Everett and Velma Giles of Lincoln, Neb.; and three sisters.
