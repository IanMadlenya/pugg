        Fred McMorrow, an author and a retired editor and Long Island section columnist for The New York Times, died yesterday in a nursing home in Walhalla, S.C. He was 74.
        His wife, Jeanne Baker McMorrow, said he had recently had a stroke after a long struggle with Alzheimer's disease.
        Over his career, Mr. McMorrow, a humorist, poet and jazz pianist as well as a journeyman journalist, worked on copy desks at every surviving New York daily newspaper, often as chief or deputy chief of the desk.
        His most successful book, ''Mid olescence: The Dangerous Years'' (Strawberry Hill, 1974) was a wry look at the problems of the second adolescence sometimes called middle age. He also wrote ''Jimmy: the Candidacy of Carter'' (Strawberry Hill, 1976), published at the end of that presidential campaign.
        Frederick J. McMorrow was born in New York City on Nov. 29, 1925. He served in World War II before attending Adelphi College on Long Island.
        In 1949, he began as a cub reporter at The Long Island Press. He worked for four other newspapers, The Journal-American, The New York Herald Tribune, The New York Post and The Daily News, before joining The New York Times in 1971.
        In addition to working as an editor on the foreign and national desks and for the Style section, he wrote the weekly ''About Long Island'' column from 1980 to 1992. He also wrote short stories for magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post and Playboy.
        His first marriage, to the late Eileen Palmer, ended in divorce; he remarried in 1989.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by his brother, Thomas Ever McMorrow of New York City; his children from his first marriage, Thomas, Robert and Fred, of Long Island, and Mary Smith, of Connecticut; and four grandchildren.
