        Edward L. Bernds, one of Hollywood's first sound effects producers and a director of comedy shorts starring the Three Stooges, died on May 20 at his home in Van Nuys, Calif. He was 94.
        Mr. Bernds began his career as a radio operator in Chicago. He went to Hollywood in 1928 as a sound mixer for some of the first talking pictures and worked with such directors as Frank Capra, Leo McCarey and Howard Hawks. By the late 1930's he was at Columbia Pictures, writing scripts for the Three Stooges. He soon began directing as well as writing their films, working steadily with them from 1945 through the mid-60's on ''Monkey Businessmen,'' ''Fright Night,'' ''Out West,'' ''The Three Stooges in Orbit'' and other films.
        During that time he also directed shorts featuring Hugh Herbert, Sterling Holloway, Billie Burke and other actors.
        He directed his first feature film, ''Blondie's Secret,'' in 1948 and went on to direct four other films in the popular series, which starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake as Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead. Mr. Bernds moved to the Allied Artists studio in the 1950's to direct several films in the Bowery Boys series.
        His other directorial credits include ''Quantrill's Raiders,'' ''Queen of Outer Space'' and ''Valley of the Dragons.'' He also directed episodes of several television series, including ''Colt .45.'' He retired in 1965.
        He is survived by a son, Edward Jr., of Van Nuys, Calif., two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
