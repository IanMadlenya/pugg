        Dr. Joseph LePage McCarthy, emeritus professor of chemical engineering and forest resources at the University of Washington and a former dean of its graduate school, died on Monday in Seattle. He was 86 and lived in Seattle.
        Dr. McCarthy researched wood chemistry and taught at the university from 1941 until his retirement in 1984, serving as graduate dean from 1957 to 1974. After retiring, he accepted a professorship at Nanjing Forestry University in China.
        A native of Spokane, Wash., he graduated from the University of Washington in 1934, and received a master's degree at the University of Idaho in 1936 and a doctorate in chemistry at McGill University. His principal research interests were thermodynamics, the chemistry of cellulose and the development of cleaner techniques in pulp processing.
        Dr. McCarthy was the author of some 170 scientific papers. His studies took him to forestry laboratories from Europe to China and earned him an international reputation. An opera buff, he attended performances wherever he went and remained an active board member of the Seattle Opera until last month.
        He was a founder of the Pacific Science Center Foundation and served on the boards of the Northwest Arts Council, the Seattle Art Museum and the Seattle Library Foundation, among others. In his later years he also continued his consulting work for the Georgia Pacific and Weyerhauser paper companies.
        Dr. McCarthy is survived by two sons, Peter C., of Friday Harbor, Wash., and Joseph M., of Brooklyn; a brother, Earl, of Seattle; a sister, Marguerite Roberts of Spokane, and two grandchildren. His wife of 46 years, Jane Matthews McCarthy, died in 1991.
