        Sheldon Ross, who founded the Sheldon Ross Gallery in Birmingham, Mich., and dealt in works by the painter and collagist Romare Bearden and other artists, died on Nov. 12  in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Ross, a native of Detroit who was also a real estate investor, opened the gallery in 1976.
        He closed it in 1999 when poor health prevented him from commuting to Birmingham.
        ''Sheldon Ross was an encouraging and supportive dealer of Romare Bearden's art for many years, responsible for placing numerous works in important public and private collections,'' recalled Ruth E. Fine, the curator of modern drawings and prints at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
        ''Even during the last months of his life,'' she added, ''he and his family were enormously helpful to the organization of the National Gallery's upcoming exhibition of Bearden's work, pointing us to collages and watercolors that had passed through their hands as well as supplying information about their association with the artist.''
        The exhibition is to open in September 2002 and will move to several other museums in the United States.
        Mr. Ross is survived by his wife, the former Phyllis Willbach, and two children from a previous marriage: a son, Robert, who lives in Michigan, and a daughter, Laurie, of Manhattan.
