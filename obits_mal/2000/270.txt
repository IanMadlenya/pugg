        Spelman Prentice, one of the last surviving grandchildren of John D. Rockefeller and a businessman active in oil and natural gas exploration, died on Thursday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 88.
        For many years, Mr. Prentice pursued oil and gas operations through the company he owned, the Prenalta Corporation, in the United States, and through Bluewater Oil and Gas Ltd. in Canada. In recent years, he focused on investment management and charities.
        Mr. Prentice, the son of E. Parmalee and Alta Rockefeller Prentice, was born in New York City. He attended the Taft School and graduated from Yale College in 1934. After many years living in New York, he moved to California in 1959.
        He is survived by his wife, Mimi Walters Prentice; three children from an earlier marriage, Pamela Campbell and Michael Prentice of Houston and Alta Rockefeller Prentice of Buenos Aires; 16 grandchildren; and 19 great-grandchildren.
