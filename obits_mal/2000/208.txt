        Edwin Singer, a Texas businessman, rancher and philanthropist, died on Saturday at a hospital in Houston. He was 85 and lived in Corpus Christi.
        Born in New York, Mr. Singer  moved to Corpus Christi in 1937 to engage in business ventures in oil and gas production, refining, banking, real estate and communications. One of his interests was Whitney Communications, which he represented on the board of The International Herald Tribune of Paris while the Whitney family owned the paper  with The Washington Post and The New York Times.
        As a philanthropist, Mr. Singer, who collected modern art, helped establish the Art Museum of South Texas in his adopted hometown. He also donated land and gave other support to the Museum of Science and History, the Bayfront Arts and Science Park, the Watergarden and the Harbor Playhouse, among other Corpus Christi institutions.
        Mr. Singer is survived by two daughters, Jennifer S. Patterson and Lauret S. Bridgford, both of Corpus Christi; a sister, Hortense Ginsburg of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. His wife of 49 years, Patsy Dunn Singer, died in 1995. Their son, Kenneth, was killed in Vietnam in 1969.
