        Ji Pengfei, who took part as China's foreign minister in the Chinese-United States summitry during President Richard M. Nixon's visit to Beijing in 1972, died on Feb. 10 in Beijing. He was 91.
        Mr. Ji was born into a peasant family in Shanxi province, and at first joined Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces. But in 1931, after Chiang turned against the Communists, Mr. Ji joined them and later became a member of the party. In 1934 and 1935, Mr. Ji went on the Red Army's Long March.
        In his long political career, he was deputy prime minister, ambassador to East Germany and vice chairman of the Standing Committee of China's Fifth National People's Congress and held senior posts in the Chinese Communist Party.
        Mr. Ji, deputy foreign minister from 1955 to 1972, was foreign minister from 1972 to 1974. This gave him a prominent, although secondary, role during President Nixon's visit to Beijing, which brought a breakthrough in the hostile relations between China and the United States. The visit led to a joint agreement to forge closer relations in diplomacy, culture and commerce.
        During the visit, Mr. Ji took part in detailed discussions -- with Secretary of State William P. Rogers and others -- of future contacts between Washington and Beijing.
        In 1983, Mr. Ji became China's director of Hong Kong and Macao affairs and figured prominently in talks with Britain in the 1980's concerning the return of Hong Kong to China, which took place in 1997.
        He was chairman of the committee that drafted the Basic Law, the document that has been called Hong Kong's miniconstitution for the post-handover era.
        He was married to Xu Hanbing. Information about survivors was not immediately available.
