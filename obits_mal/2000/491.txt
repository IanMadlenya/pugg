        Maurice Uchitel, a well-known Manhattan restaurant and nightclub owner in the 1950's and 1960's, died Friday at the Nathan Adelson Hospice in Las Vegas. He was 88.
        Among his diversified business interests were El Morocco, the legendary society nightclub, which he owned from 1964 to 1970, and, in the mid-1950's, Voisin, a restaurant popular with social and entertainment figures. Before taking over El Morocco, he owned the Eden Roc Hotel  in Miami Beach for several years.
        Born in Ukraine, Mr. Uchitel came to the United States in 1917. He entered the garment business, and eventually had his own business making shoulder pads before going into the restaurant trade.
        His 1945 marriage to Patricia Pollack, a singer, ended in divorce in 1979. He is survived by two grandchildren.
