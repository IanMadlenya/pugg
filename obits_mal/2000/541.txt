        F. Barton Harvey Jr., who was managing partner, chairman and chief executive of the Baltimore investment firm that became Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., died on Monday at his home in Baltimore County, Md. He was 79.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his son Jack Locke Harvey.
        Mr. Harvey joined the firm as a stockbroker in 1946 and became a partner in 1953. He became a managing partner in 1966 and held that post until 1986. During those years, his son recalled, the firm's annual revenue rose to $260 million from about $10 million.
        Mr. Harvey was in charge during the incorporation of the firm in 1983, was its first chairman and chief executive and retired in 1986. He remained a limited partner until 1997.
        Born in Baltimore County and a graduate of Harvard College, he earned the Navy Cross as a Marine officer in the Pacific during World War II and became a philanthropist and civic leader.
        In addition to his son Jack Locke Harvey, he is survived by his wife, Grace; two daughters, Grace Harvey and Rose Gwathmey; another son, F. Barton 3rd; three sisters, Rose Finkenstadt, Ellen Kelly and Jean Baker; two brothers, Robert and Alexander II; and nine grandchildren.
