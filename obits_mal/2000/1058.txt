        Frederick S. Clarke, the creator, owner, editor and publisher of Cinefantastique, a magazine about science fiction, fantasy and horror films, died on Oct. 17 in Adair County, Iowa. He was 51 and lived in Oak Park, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
        He had been suffering from depression and committed suicide, said Steven Jay Rubin, a friend who formerly wrote for the magazine.
        Mr. Clarke began publishing Cinefantastique, based in Chicago, as a glossy magazine in 1970. Its circulation was 1,000 then and is 30,000 now, Mr. Rubin said. Mr. Clarke's wife, Celeste, the magazine's business manager, said it would continue to be published.
        Cinefantastique ''is by far the most useful U.S. fantastic-cinema magazine, being less juvenile in orientation and (apparently) less dependent on the studios for pictorial material, and thus more independent in its judgments'' than other such magazines, Peter Nicholls wrote in ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction.''
        Mr. Clarke also published another film magazine, Femme Fatales, about leading ladies in horror and science fiction films, starting in 1992. Mrs. Clarke said that it, too, would continue to be published.
        Mr. Clarke was a native of Steubenville, Ohio, and a graduate of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Whitney and Caitlin, both of Oak Park; a stepson, Drew Sikula of Reno, Nev.; a stepdaughter, Ana Sikula of El Salvador; and two brothers, George W., of Washington and Charles H., of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
