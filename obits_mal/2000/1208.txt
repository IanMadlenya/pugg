        Robert H. Wiebe, an authority on American political and social history who had taught at Northwestern University, died on Dec. 10 at a hospital in Evanston, Ill. He was 70 and lived in Evanston.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Penny Whiteside.
        Professor Wiebe, a co-author of ''The Great Republic: A History of the American People,'' retired from Northwestern in 1997 after 37 years. Born in Amarillo, Tex., he received a bachelor's degree in 1951 from Carleton College and a doctorate in 1957 from the University of Rochester.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Douglas, of Piedmont, Calif., Eric, of Durham, N.C., and Patrick, of Amsterdam, and a brother, Richard, of Berkeley, Calif.
