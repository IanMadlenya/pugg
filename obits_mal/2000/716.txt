        Former Congressman William J. Randall, a conservative Democrat who represented his native Independence, Mo., from 1959 to 1977, died there on Friday. He was 90.
        Mr. Randall, a lawyer, was an unabashed champion of Independence, the hometown of former President Harry S. Truman.
        Mr. Randall, who represented Missouri's Fourth Congressional District, was sworn in on Capitol Hill in March 1959 after winning a special election made necessary by the death of his predecessor, Representative George H. Christopher, another Democrat. After 16 years in the House, Mr. Randall decided not to seek re-election in 1976.
        He was a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Government Operations Committee. As chairman of the latter committee's Legal and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee, Mr. Randall came to national prominence in the early 1970's when he conducted an inquiry into illegal immigration from Mexico and charges of corruption in the Southwest region of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
        In his last two years in Congress, Mr. Randall also headed a special Select Committee on Aging, which conducted hearings on long-term health care for the elderly.
        William Joseph Randall graduated from the University of Missouri in 1931 and from the University of Kansas City's law school in 1936. He served with the Army in the Pacific in World War II.
        Mr. Randall then served on a Jackson County administrative court for 12 years until his election to Congress. When he left the House he worked as a railroad lobbyist before returning to Independence, where he had a private law practice.
        His wife of 47 years, Margaret Layden Randall, died in 1989. Mr. Randall is survived by a daughter, Mary, two grandsons and a great-granddaughter.
