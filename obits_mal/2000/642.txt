        Grigory Gorin, the Russian playwright, humorist and screenwriter, died here on June 15. He was 60.
        The cause was a heart attack, said the Culture Ministry.
        Like Mikhail Bulgakov and Anton Chekhov, Mr. Gorin began his working life as a doctor. In 1966 he and Arkady Arkanov wrote ''To All Europe,'' a comedy that was so successful that Mr. Gorin gave up medicine.
        He wrote many popular films, including ''The One and Only Munchausen'' and ''Formula for Love.'' His longest collaboration was with Mark Zakharov, director of the Lenkom Theater where most of his plays -- including ''Requiem'' and ''Royal Games'' -- were staged. When Mr. Gorin died he was working on his latest play, ''The Jester Balakirev,'' set in the time of Peter the Great.
        Last fall, Mr. Gorin -- whose real name was Grigory Ofshtein -- described the play. ''Toward the end of his life, the jester understands that he has been a bad jester and his climb up the social ladder hasn't happened,'' he said. ''He had been a cow herd, and maybe that was his main accomplishment. The Czar Peter also understands, toward the end, that the remaking of such a country is no easy task, that maybe he had been wrong and his son Aleksei was right. It should have been done slowly, gradually, without losing moral purpose.''
