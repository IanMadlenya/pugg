        Jack Dalton, who was dean of Columbia University's School of Library Services, died on July 7 at his home in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan. He was 92.
        Mr. Dalton headed the library services school from 1959 until 1970. The school was closed in 1992. While dean, he was a teacher as well as an administrator, and he introduced courses in information science into the school's curriculum.
        James S. Healey, the former director of library schools at the University of Oklahoma and at San Jose State University in California, studied at Columbia while Mr. Dalton was the dean.
        ''He had assembled a truly outstanding faculty, some of the best people in our field in the world,'' Mr. Healey said Friday.
        Mr. Dalton, who was born in Holland, Va., received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Virginia. He took courses at the University of Michigan in 1935 and 1936. He later was director of the American Library Association's international relations office from 1956 to 1959.
        After retiring from Columbia, Mr. Dalton directed the Library Development Center, which advocates better library services for the disabled and disadvantaged. He was also a consultant to the H. W. Wilson publishing company.
        His first wife, Mary Gochnauer Dalton, died.
        He is survived by his second wife, Margaret Stieg Dalton; a son, John Preston Dalton of Tuscaloosa, Ala.; a brother, Robert, of St. Thomas, V.I.; and a sister, Antoinette Nelson of Lynchburg, Va.
