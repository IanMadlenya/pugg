        Sidney Peterson, an American surrealist filmmaker of the late 1940's and early 50's, died on April 24. He was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Peterson, who was born in Oakland, Calif., studied at the University of California in Berkeley. He made his early films with help from  his students while teaching at the California School of Fine Arts. To support his filmmaking he worked at movie studios and in New York at the video department of the Museum of Modern Art.
        In 1975 the Whitney Museum of American Art showed four of his experimental films, including ''The Potted Psalm'' (1946), which he directed with James Broughton, and ''The Lead Shoes'' (1949). Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that the program showed him to be a serious avant-garde filmmaker.
        ''The films owe a great deal to the surreal collaborations of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, especially the first film of the program, 'The Potted Psalm,' '' Mr. Canby wrote.
        Mr. Peterson also wrote two books, ''A Fly in the Pigment'' (Hallen,  1962) and ''The Dark of the Screen'' (Anthology Film Archives, 1980).
        He is survived by a daughter, Nora Kasarda of Manhattan; a sister, Phyllis Ziegler of Albuquerque; and a grandson.
