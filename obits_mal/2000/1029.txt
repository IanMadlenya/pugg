        John Abbott, an art dealer and curator, died on Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center in New York. He was 53 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was liver failure, said Rob Wynne, an artist and friend.
        Mr. Abbott was born in Allegheny, Pa. In 1966, during his last year at the St. James School in Hagerstown, Md., he lived with a family in Nimes, France, as part of the Experiment in International Living exchange program, an experience that made him a devout Francophile. During the next three years, he studied French and French literature at the Sorbonne and in 1970 at Ohio State University.
        During the 1970's, he worked as assistant director at the Sonnabend Gallery, first in Paris and then in New York. In late 1978 he oversaw the relocation of 112 Greene Street, New York City's first alternative art-exhibition space, to a city-owned building on Spring Street and Greenwich Street in the Village, and served as director for nearly a year. The space, which was devoted to showing young, unrepresented artists, was initially renamed 112 Workshop and then, in 1980, White Columns.
        In 1983 Mr. Abbott joined with Nicole Klagsbrun and Clarissa Dalrymple to form the Cable Gallery in NoHo, which gave first solo shows to the artists James Nares, Ashley Bickerton and Christopher Wool. In 1984-85, he worked with Alanna Heiss, director of the P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in Long Island City, Queens, on the organization of the Paris Biennale.
        In 1986 he organized and led the first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Manhattan for people with AIDS.
        He is survived by a sister, Colleen Jordan of Baltimore, and two brothers, Robert, of Pittsburgh, and Thomas, of West Alexander, Pa.
