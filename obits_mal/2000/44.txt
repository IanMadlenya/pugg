        Andrew T. Stamboulidis, a retired textile executive who was active in the Greek-American community, died Thursday at New York Hospital. He was 70 and lived in Whitestone, Queens. The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        He retired in 1990 as director of administration and market research of Westpoint Peperell, now Stevens Peperell, after 38 years in the textile business.
        A native of Piraeus, Greece, he came to the United States in 1949 as a member of the Greek Air Force engaged in the transfer of American planes to Greece under the Marshall Plan. Mr. Stamboulidis was active in the American Hellenic Educational and Progressive Association and other civic and Greek Orthodox organizations. He served repeatedly as chairman of the annual Greek Independence Day parade in New York City.
        Mr. Stamboulidis is survived by his wife of 46 years, Sophia Nicholas Stamboulidis; a daughter, Elizabeth Simadis, and two sons, Ted A. Stamas and George A. Stamboulidis, all of Queens; a sister, Marika Apostolidis of Piraeus; and seven grandchildren.
