        Russell L. Wenkstern, who as the chief executive of Tonka Toys made them a household name, died on Tuesday in Spring Park, Minn. He was 87.
        Mr. Wenkstern lived in Mound, Minn., and had a winter home in Venice, Fla.
        Mr. Wenkstern was chief executive and president of Tonka Toys from 1961 to 1977. He helped develop one of the nation's most popular toys, the Tonka dump truck, working closely with its designer, and he designed several other truck cabs.
        By itself, the big yellow Mighty Dump, the dream toy of many young boys, accounted for nearly $15 million in sales for the company.
        Mr. Wenkstern was born on Oct. 1, 1912, in Garber, Iowa. In 1936, he graduated from Teachers College at Ellendale, N.D., then taught classes in industrial arts, math and science and coached sports at schools in Oklahoma, North Dakota, Minnesota and Michigan.
        In 1944, Mr. Wenkstern gave up teaching and took a job with Streater Industries, a manufacturer of drugstore fixtures and wooden toys. After three years, he left to develop another toy manufacturer, Moulded Products.
        In 1952, he became secretary of the board and production manager for Mound Metal Craft, later Tonka Toys. Nine years thereafter, Mr. Wenkstern moved into the top position at Tonka.
        Under his direction, Tonka, based in Minnesota, became a worldwide company. It established marketing and production operations in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Belgium. The company's annual sales rose to $80 million from $400,000.
        In February 1998, Mr. Wenkstern was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame in New York.
        Survivors include his wife of 64 years, Lucille; a son, Grant; three daughters, Mary, Vonnie Garens and Janet; two brothers, Grant and Kermit; nine grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
