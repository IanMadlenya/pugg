        Stephen Borsody, a former Hungarian diplomat and scholar who wrote extensively on European history, died Friday in Wellfleet, Mass. He was 89.
        Dr. Borsody earned a doctorate in law at Charles University in Prague, and came to Washington in 1946 as counselor and press attache at the Hungarian Embassy, but he resigned in 1947 to protest the Communist takeover of his country. For 3O years he taught Russian and European history at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, becoming an American citizen in 1953.
        Dr. Borsody's best known book, ''The Tragedy of Central Europe,'' was published in London in 1960 and reissued in an expanded version in 1993 as ''The New Central Europe: Triumphs and Tragedies.'' After the book appeared in Hungarian in 1998, he was honored with a lifetime achievement medal by the president of Hungary.
        Dr. Borsody's principal academic interest was the analysis of the political implications of the dismemberment of Hungary.
        Dr. Borsody is survived by his wife, Charlotte Borsody; his daughters, Eva Borsody Das of Philadelphia, Johanna Borsody of Putney, Vt., and Katherine Borsody of Hull, Mass.; and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  November 23, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Saturday about Stephen Borsody, a former Hungarian diplomat and scholar, misstated the date of his death and referred incompletely to his academic interest. Dr. Borsody died on Oct. 17, not Nov. 17. His principal academic interest was analyzing, and proposing solutions for, the instability of central Europe, not just of Hungary.
