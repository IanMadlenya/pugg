        Terry Forrestal, a British stuntman who staged and performed action sequences for such Hollywood blockbusters as ''Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,'' ''Braveheart'' and ''Titanic,'' died on June 10 in a jumping accident in Norway. He was 52 and lived in Berkshire, England.
        Mr. Forrestal died while attempting what is known as a base jump from the 3,000-foot Kjerag cliff in Lysefjord, Norway, The Times of London reported. In base-jumping -- an acronym derived from Bridge, Antennae, Span, Earth -- jumpers leap from a fixed point, like the top of a building, bridge or mountain, for a relatively short drop, using a special parachute.
        After completing seven successful jumps in Norway on an expedition that was his own but was being documented by a television crew, Mr. Forrestal jumped from Kjerag and landed awkwardly on a ridge, possibly breaking his legs. Eleven hours later, while waiting to be rescued, he apparently attempted a second jump from the ridge using his reserve parachute, which failed to open.
        One of the leading stuntmen in the film industry since entering the field in the mid-1980's, Mr. Forrestal jumped, dived, crashed and fought his way through some of the major action films of the last 15 years, from the James Bond episodes -- ''A View to a Kill,'' ''Moonraker'' and ''Octopussy'' -- to ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'' and ''Titanic,'' in which he played the ship's doomed chief engineer.
        In 1992, he was pulled from the River Clyde during the filming of the a television show, when a motorcycle stunt went awry.
        Terrence Philip Julian Forrestal was born in Chesterfield and studied medicine for a year before joining the army, serving as a senior noncommissioned officer in Ireland.
        In the mid-1980's, he began to work for films, specializing in depicting urban guerrilla and jungle warfare. His last job was ''Rebel Heart,'' the BBC program about the 1916 uprising in Ireland.
