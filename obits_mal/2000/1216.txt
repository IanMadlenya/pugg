        Benjamin Karp, a portrait sculptor whose works have been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other major institutions throughout the world, died on Dec. 3 at his home in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. He was 94.
        Mr. Karp graduated summa cum laude in physics from Syracuse University and was on his way to Heidelberg, Germany, to continue his studies when he stopped off in Paris. A year later, still in Paris, he had dropped his interest in science and embarked on a career as an artist.
        He apprenticed himself to the American sculptor Jo Davidson and studied with the metalist Marec Szwarc. The art critic Leo Stein, brother of Gertrude Stein, praised Mr. Karp's work and compared his drawings with Picasso's.
        In the early 1930's Mr. Karp returned to the United States and pursued his interest in portraiture, working with stone, clay and bronze castings to create a number of powerful, sensitively rendered busts. One of his works in bronze was a much-admired portrait of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
        Mr. Karp was also fascinated by the wooden ornamentation, or gingerbread decoration, on old houses in upstate New York. He spent several years photographing this vanishing legacy of early America and published his work in a book, ''Wood Motifs in American Architecture.''
        Mr. Karp was born on May 8, 1906, in Syracuse. He earned a master's degree in art education from New York University and taught for more than 20 years in the New York State university system.
        Mr. Karp's wife, Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote modernist scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, died earlier this year. He is survived by two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of Manhattan; and two granddaughters.
