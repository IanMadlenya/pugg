        Joseph A. Rothschild, a longtime professor of history and political science at Columbia University and one of the nation's leading authorities on East Central Europe, died on Jan. 30 at his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
        He died of complications from a nonmalignant brain tumor, said his son, Gerson Rothschild of Manhattan.
        Mr. Rothschild began his career with Columbia in 1955 as an instructor and gradually rose to full professor. He was also chairman of the Department of Political Science, the Contemporary Civilization Program and the Department of Government.
        He was named Class of 1919 Professor of Political Science in 1978, a position he held until his death. He was also a Woodrow Wilson International fellow, a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow and a Guggenheim fellow.
        Mr. Rothschild was born on April 5, 1931, in Fulda, Germany, and moved to the United States in 1940. He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from Oxford University. Besides his son, Gerson, he is survived by a daughter, Nina Rothschild of Manhattan. His wife, Ruth, died last month.
