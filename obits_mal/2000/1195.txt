        Robert Buck, the lead guitarist for the popular alternative-rock band 10,000 Maniacs, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 42.
        The cause was liver failure, according to Blair Woods, the band's publicist, who said Mr. Buck died at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian.
        Mr. Buck was a co-founder of 10,000 Maniacs in 1981, and wrote several of the group's biggest hits with its original singer, Natalie Merchant. Although Ms. Merchant, who left the band in 1993, was its most famous face, Mr. Buck's chiming guitar style was arguably as integral to the group's success.
        He last appeared with the band on Nov. 6 at a rally for Hillary Rodham Clinton at Buffalo State College. The band has not decided what Mr. Buck's death means for the future of 10,000 Maniacs.
        Born in Jamestown, N.Y., Mr. Buck dedicated his life to the guitar at 16, after seeing a film about Jimi Hendrix's life. His marriage to Terri Newhouse ended in divorce. He is survived by his mother and stepfather, Carol and Ray Ciper, and his father, Kenneth Buck.
