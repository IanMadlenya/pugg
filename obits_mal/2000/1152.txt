        Clifford Day Mallory Jr., a former trustee, president and chairman of the Mystic Seaport outdoor museum in Mystic, Conn., died Thursday at his home in Stonington, Conn. He was 84.
        During his tenure the seaport became recognized as the nation's pre-eminent maritime museum. His father, Clifford Day Mallory Sr., a prominent yachtsman and ship owner, was the first chairman of the museum, which used to be called the Marine Historical Association.
        The younger Mr. Mallory helped build the collection and restore buildings and vessels that document maritime history, especially the golden age of sail in the 1850's.
        Clifford Day Mallory Jr. was born in Manhattan on Oct. 13, 1916. Instead of attending college he went to work for Mallory Transport Lines, which operates today as Marine Transport Lines.
        In World War II, he was a Navy lieutenant commander in the Pacific. He then worked as a ship broker, starting his own concern, C.D. Mallory & Company, in 1960.
        Mr. Mallory is survived by his wife, Pauline, of Stonington; a sister, Barbara Hathaway of Owings Mills, Md.; two daughters, Diana Gros-Louis of Bloomington, Ind., and Veronica Stubbs of New York City; a son, Charles, of Greenwich, Conn.; and seven grandchildren.
