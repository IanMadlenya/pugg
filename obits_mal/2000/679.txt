        Dr. Robert George Crowder, an experimental psychologist and an authority on memory, died Thursday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 60.
        Dr. Crowder gained wide recognition in 1976 with the graduate textbook ''Principles of Learning and Memory,'' which summarized the research done on the matter.
        The book remains in print and until recently he was working on an updated edition.
        He also was author, along with Richard K. Wagner, of ''The Psychology of Reading: An Introduction.'' A contributor of numerous articles and book chapters, he was an editor, along with Frank R. Schab, of ''Memory for Odors.''
        Dr. Crowder joined the faculty at Yale as a lecturer in 1965, was promoted to full professor of psychology in 1976 and retired from active teaching two years ago because of his failing health.
        He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Julie Butterfield Crowder; two sons, Edward and Bruce, both of New Haven; a daughter, Lorial Crowder of Boston; and a half-bother, David L. Crowder of Seattle.
