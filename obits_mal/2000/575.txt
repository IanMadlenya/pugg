        Pierre Pflimlin, a French politician who promoted Western Europe's postwar reconciliation and briefly, as prime minister, had to cope with the uprising in Algeria and the imperial temper of Charles de Gaulle, died Tuesday in Strasbourg. He was 93.
        Mr. Pflimlin had served as mayor of Strasbourg, the Alsatian capital and his political base, from 1959 to 1983.
        He earned his spurs in the Catholic Resistance in World War II, winning the Croix de Guerre. He held various ministerial posts from the mid-1940's until 1962. Until 1989 he served as a member of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, and was its president from 1984 to 1987.
        Pierre Eugene Jean Pflimlin was born to Alsatian parents in Roubaix, in French Flanders, and was educated at the Catholic Institute in Paris and Strasbourg University. He practiced law in Strasbourg from 1933 to 1964 and was elected a city councilman in 1945.
        Starting in 1946, he held cabinet portfolios on such diverse subjects as agriculture, finance, commerce and foreign affairs.
        He advocated negotiations with the nationalists in Algeria, so his appointment as prime minister in May 1958 brought on a violent reaction by French settlers there. In addition, the rebellious stance of the French officer corps raised the specter of civil war in France.
        With de Gaulle's attitude remaining a riddle, Mr. Pflimlin was unable to calm the chaotic situation, and he resigned after 21 days in office. After de Gaulle assumed the presidency, Mr. Pflimlin served him as minister of state until 1959, when he won the mayoralty in Strasbourg. His last national post was as Georges Pompidou's minister of state for cooperation in 1962.
        A strong believer in a European identity, he favored an elected European parliament and served as president of a preparatory assembly of the Council of Europe from 1963 to 1968.
        Mr. Pflimlin wrote the autobiographical ''Memoirs of a European'' (1991) and several other books.
        He was married in 1939 to Marie-Odile Heinrich, who has died, and they had a son and two daughters.
