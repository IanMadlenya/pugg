        Thomas J. Skutt, a retired chairman of the Mutual of Omaha Companies, died on Monday at Methodist Hospital in Omaha. He was 69 and lived in Omaha.
        He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, said Jim Nolan, a spokesman for Mutual of Omaha, the big insurance company.
        Mr. Skutt, who joined Mutual of Omaha in 1969 as secretary and tax counsel, was its chief executive from 1984 to 1986 and its chairman from 1986 until he retired in 1998. In both posts he succeeded his father, Vestor Joseph Skutt, known as V. J., who died in 1993.
        Under Thomas J. Skutt's leadership, Mutual of Omaha diversified its product offerings and entered additional markets.
        Mr. Skutt was born in Omaha, grew up there and received a bachelor's degree in 1952 from Yale. He was an Army lieutenant in Korea in the early 1950's and received a law degree in 1957 from Creighton University in Omaha.
        He was also a civic leader in Omaha.
        Survivors include his wife of 44 years, the former Jeanne Cecille Plunkett; two daughters, Kimberly Davis and Mary Elizabeth Sutton, known as Lissa, both of Omaha; a son, Thomas, Jr., also of Omaha; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Sally Skutt of Lincoln, Neb.
