Wolfson, who owned a contracting company, and several British investors. At one point, Grand Central City, as it was called, was to have had several theaters, an exhibition hall and an open-air restaurant.
        Among Mr. Scheftel's other real estate investments were the Beresford and San Remo apartment buildings in New York, and the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco. He also had ownership interests in three television stations and six cable television stations in Connecticut, Illinois and Mexico.
        In 1931, Mr. Scheftel graduated from Baillol College of Oxford University with a combined bachelor's and master's degree in politics, economics and history. During World War II, he rose to the rank of major in the 64th Fighter Wing of the United States Air Force.
        Mr. Scheftel and his first wife, Agnes Mary, who died in 1970, were active in several charitable organizations, including Greenwich House, a settlement house in New York. He has been a director of Greenwich House, where he concentrated on children's services, since 1938, and he was the president of the organization from 1954 to 1960.
        In addition to his wife, Yolande, Mr. Scheftel is survived by his daughters, Francoise Fielding of San Franciso and Cynthia Fielding-Singh of Tucson; his niece, Susan Scheftel of New York; four grandchildren and a great-niece and nephew.
