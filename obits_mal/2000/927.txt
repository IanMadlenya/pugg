        Eric Stiebel, chairman of Rosenberg & Stiebel, an internationally known art gallery that specialized in European old master paintings and decorative arts, died on Thursday, his family said. He was 89.
        Born in Germany, Mr. Stiebel moved to New York from Frankfurt-am-Main in 1939, after he was forced to drop his university studies as the Hitler regime's campaign against Jews gathered force. He represented the third generation of his family to work in the gallery, which was founded between 1860 and 1870.
        In the decade after World War II, Mr. Stiebel acted as an agent for some of Europe's great art-collecting families, including the Rothschilds, who were looking to sell artworks in the United States. Some of these works were sold directly to American museums, and others were sold first to private collectors who eventually donated them to public institutions.
        The most famous painting handled by the gallery was the Merode Altarpiece, a 15th-century work by the Flemish artist Robert Campin that is now in the Cloisters. All told, more than 300 works now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art passed through the Rosenberg & Stiebel gallery. More than 100 works were sold directly to the Cleveland Museum of Art. A painting of St. Catherine by Rubens, now in the Toledo Museum, was also handled by the gallery.
        The gallery this year moved out of its old location at 32 East 57th Street to a private house and changed its name to Stiebel Ltd., becoming a private dealership headed by Mr. Stiebel's son, Gerald, and his wife, Penelope, a former curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Stiebel is survived by his wife of 63 years, Irene; his son; and three grandchildren.
