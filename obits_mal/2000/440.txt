        Nicolaus Koni, a sculptor noted for his busts of prominent figures,  among them Marian Anderson, James V. Forrestal and David Ben-Gurion, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Riviera Beach, Fla. He was 89.
        Mr. Koni, a native of Hungary, immigrated in the late 1920's to Austria, where he lived in Vienna for a decade before moving to Britain. He left for the United States in 1941, where he joined the Army and served in World War 11. After the war, he set up a studio on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and in Palm Beach.
        He made busts of Gen. Omar N.  Bradley, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Jonas Salk. His bust of Anderson is in the Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, his bust of Forrestal, the nation's first secretary of defense, is in the Annapolis Naval Museum and in the Forrestal Building in Washington. His portrait of Ben-Gurion is at Ben-Gurion University in Israel.
        Mr. Koni left no immediate survivors.
