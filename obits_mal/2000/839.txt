        Kevin McAuliffe, a speechwriter for three New York City mayors and the editor of a collection of comments by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani  published this year, died Saturday. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. McAuliffe worked as a speechwriter and press aide for Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. He also worked for a few months for Mr. Giuliani before being dismissed in 1994 as a holdover from Democratic administrations.
        Mr. McAuliffe compiled ''Sayings of Generalissimo Giuliani,'' quotations on subjects including crime and sending garbage to Virginia, assembled for comic effect.
        At his death, Mr. McAuliffe ran a communications consulting firm.
        Mr. McAuliffe, born in the Bronx, graduated from Fairfield University in Connecticut and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University. He began his career as a journalist in New England. He also wrote ''The Great American Newspaper: The Rise and Fall of the Village Voice'' (1978).
        Mr. McAuliffe is survived by his wife, Paulette Theresa, whom he married in April; his mother, Ethel; a sister, Alice Callahan; two brothers, Daniel and Paul; and two nieces.
