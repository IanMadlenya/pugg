        T. Dennie Boardman, a retired businessman, died last Friday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 87 and lived in Chestnut Hill, Mass., and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Boardman retired from two family real estate firms, T. Dennie Boardman of Boston, and Munn, Hull & Boardman of Palm Beach. Both no longer exist.
        In 1941 he was a founder of the Newsreel Theater Corporation, which was formed and operated in partnership with Paramount Pictures. It survived into the 1950's, when television overtook the newsreels shown in theaters.
        Born in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass., Mr. Boardman graduated from St. Mark's School and, in 1936, from Harvard College, where he was a varsity athlete in golf, track and baseball. An accomplished amateur golfer, he competed in the 1936 British Open and won the South Florida State amateur championship four times.
        Mr. Boardman is survived by his wife, Cynthia Rosenthal Boardman; their children, Sarah R. Boardman and Samuel J. M., both of Chestnut Hill, Mass.; his children from two earlier marriages, D. Dixon of Manhattan, and Dorothy Dewart of Chestnut Hill., Pa.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
