        Ruddick C. Lawrence, a former vice president for public relations at the New York Stock Exchange and chairman of the board of Sarah Lawrence College, died Saturday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 88.

        Mr. Lawrence, a native of Aberdeen, Wash., who majored in journalism at the University of Washington, started his business career in the 1930's as western manager for American Boy magazine, then moved to Fortune magazine. He was also NBC's director of promotions during the early days of television.
        Mr. Lawrence was a member of Sarah Lawrence College's board from 1957 to 1969 and the chairman from 1965 to 1969. He was also a former president of the New York Board of Trade.
        He is survived by his wife, Cherry; three daughters and two sons from a previous marriage; two stepdaughters; and 14 grandchildren.
