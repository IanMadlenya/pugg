        Donald F. Lach, a historian who was an authority on Asia's influence on Europe from 1500 to 1800, died on Oct. 26 at a Chicago hospital. He was 83 and lived in Chicago.
        Mr. Lach (pronounced lock) became the university's Bernadotte E. Schmitt professor in history in 1969, after teaching there and at universities in Taiwan and India for two decades.
        He was the main author of a series of three widely praised volumes, with the joint title ''Asia in the Making of Europe,'' about European interchanges with Asia in the 1500's and 1600's. The series was hailed in the journal Commentary in 1994 as ''a masterwork of scholarship.''
        Mr. Lach was the sole author of the series's first volume, subtitled ''The Century of Discovery'' (1965, Chicago), and of the second volume, subtitled ''A Century of Wonder,'' which came out in three books, one in 1970 and two that appeared in 1977.
        The third volume, which also included three books, subtitled ''A Century of Advance'' (1993, Chicago), was written jointly by Mr. Lach and a colleague, Edwin J. Van Kley.
        Mr. Lach was born in Pittsburgh and received a bachelor's degree from West Virginia University and his doctorate from the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alma Satorius; a daughter, Sandra Arlinghaus of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a grandson; and a great-grandson.
