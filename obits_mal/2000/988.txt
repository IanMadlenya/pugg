        Frank J. Prial II, publisher of The Chief, a newspaper for government workers in New York City, died Sunday at Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. He was 80 and lived in Greenwich.
        The cause was pulmonary failure, his family said.
        Mr. Prial's grandfather, Frank J. Prial, bought the weekly in 1917, and Mr. Prial joined it in 1945 after Army service. He became publisher after his grandfather died in 1948.
        Mr. Prial, a lawyer, was also counsel to public employee unions for more than 30 years. In 1985, he retired from the law and stopped writing a column for The Chief, but remained its publisher until his death.
        Mr. Prial is survived by his wife, Marguerite; four daughters, Marguerite Petrie of Manhasset, N.Y.; Patricia Gillooly of Fanwood, N.J.; Pamela James of Framingham, Mass.; and Helen Snyder of Trumbull, Conn.; six sons, Frank, of Manchester, Vt.; Edward, of Stamford, Conn.; Gerard, of New Castle, N.H.; James, of Ridgefield, Conn.; Michael, of Greenwich; Joseph, of Simsbury, Conn.; and two sisters: Mildred Robinson of Hillsdale, N.J.; and Patricia Lowe of Greenwich; and 18 grandchildren.
