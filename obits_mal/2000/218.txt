        Goran Tunstrom, one of Scandinavia's most prolific contemporary authors, died on Feb. 5 at his home in Stockholm. He was 62.
        The apparent cause was heart failure, Swedish new reports said.
        Mr. Tunstrom published his first collection of poems in 1958. Since then he had produced a new volume of fiction, poetry, drama or travelogue almost every year.
        He was born in Karlstad in the Varmland region of western Sweden, a region famous for its storytelling tradition. The son of a clergyman, he spent his boyhood in a parsonage in Sunne, a small community there.
        His own writing was marked by his father's early death and the family's move from the parsonage. He frequently drew on the Varmland milieu to tell of people overcoming sorrow, of recovering a lost idyllic existence and of the complexity of relationships, particularly between men and women.
        His work, characterized by a vivid imagination and sensitivity, often appeared in foreign translations. His poetry was praised for its rhythmic language and for visionary qualities noted also in his novels, several of which adopted an approach to writing known as magic realism.
        Only one of his books, ''Juloratoriet'' (1983), appeared in the United States. Translated as ''The Christmas Oratorio,'' it was published in 1994 and remains in print at Verba Mundi/Godine, Boston.
        The book explored a family's efforts to come to terms with an accidental death. The narration swirls  through several generations and culminates in a performance of the Bach oratorio of the title. It was made into a motion picture in Sweden.
        Mr. Tunstrom won many Swedish and Scandinavian literary awards. Most recently, in 1998, his ''Famous Men Who Have Visited Sunne'' took Sweden's top prize, the August Award for Book of the Year.
        He is survived by his wife, Lena Cronquist, and a son.
