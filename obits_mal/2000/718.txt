        Peter M. Cicchino, a professor of constitutional law and jurisprudence at American University in Washington, died on Saturday at his home in the capital. He was 39.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his companion, Jonathan Springer.
        Mr. Cicchino was born in Kearny, N.J., and graduated magna cum laude in political science and philosophy from the University of Scranton in 1982. He received a master's degree in philosophy at Fordham University in 1986.
        From 1982 to 1988, as a lay member of the Jesuit order, he served in prisons, hospitals, homeless shelters and soup kitchens, working especially with young people. After earning his law degree at Harvard University in 1992, he was a staff counsel on the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union in New York City and the founding director of a similar program at the Urban Justice Center.
        A specialist in public-interest law and laws affecting the needy, he taught in the Program on Lawyering at New York University Law School before joining the faculty of American University's Washington College of Law in 1998. The college honored him at a conference in May and announced the establishment of an annual Peter M. Cicchino Award for Outstanding Service in the Public Interest.
        Besides Mr. Springer, Mr. Cicchino is survived by his parents, Peter A. and Mary Jane Cicchino of Kearny; three sisters, Sally Rooney, Jane Goretski and Jill Cicchino, also of Kearny; and a brother, William, of Cranford, N.J.
