        Euan Uglow, a British realist artist whose work received high praise in his homeland, died on Thursday in London. He was 68 and lived in London.
        The cause was cancer, The Times of London reported.
        Mr. Uglow won particular praise in Britain for his nudes and his still lifes. He was so painstaking as an artist that his output was sometimes only two paintings in a year. He asserted once that before he finally finished a painting of a model she might have gotten engaged, married and divorced.
        His works were shown in spaces including the Tate Gallery in London.
        Catherine Lambert, veteran of the London art world, wrote in The Guardian yesterday that if Mr. Uglow's legacy were ''imagined as a string of gems, the rarest would be his beautifully faceted paintings of silent nudes.''
        But Mr. Uglow's views of himself and others in his field could have a distinctly nonestablishment tone. He wrote in 1996 that the example of Cezanne ''helps me to dare to follow my most awkward, foolish passions and obsessions, to wave my own red flags in the dull faces of late-century salon hacks and killers.''
        Mr. Uglow was born in London and studied at the Camberwell and Slade art schools in Britain. He was almost unknown in the United States, where he had a mixed reception. John Russell, writing in The New York Times about the exhibition ''Eight Figurative Painters'' at the Yale Center for British Art in 1981, said that ''to live with the memory of paintings'' by Mr. Uglow, who was one of the eight, ''it is almost indispensable to have been reared in London.''
        Reviewing works by Mr. Uglow on display in 1994 at Salander-O'Reilly Gallery in Manhattan and at the New York Studio School, Reagan Upshaw wrote in Art in America, ''Uglow has a superb color sense, which I suspect derives ultimately from Matisse.''
