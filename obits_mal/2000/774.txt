        Fred Lawrence Guiles, a biographer of Hollywood movie stars, was found dead on June 24 at his home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 79.
        Among Mr. Guiles's best-selling books was his 1969 ''Norma Jean: The Life of Marilyn Monroe,'' which was translated into 14 languages. The book became the center of a dispute in 1973 when its publisher accused Norman Mailer of having plagiarized portions of it and of another Monroe biography in writing ''Marilyn,'' his own book about the actress. Mr. Mailer and Mr. Guiles jointly refuted the charge.
        Mr. Guiles's play, ''Song for a Certain Midnight,'' was produced off Broadway in 1959.
        He was also the author of ''Marion Davies'' and ''Tyrone Power, the Last Idol'' and published another version of his Monroe biography, ''Legend: The Life and Death of Marilyn Monroe,'' in 1985. Mr. Guiles is survived by a sister, Nadine G. Jackson of Quarryville, Pa.
