        G. Leon Netterville, a former president of Southern University and A&M College, the largest historically black college in the nation, died on Feb. 12 at his home in Baton Rouge, La. He was 93.
        Mr. Netterville was the third president of the college, which has 9,000 students and is in Baton Rouge; he served in that post from 1968 to 1972. He resigned shortly after the police shot and killed two students in a campus protest about administration policies.
        Notably, among the demands made by the protesting students was Mr. Netterville's resignation. They said he was thwarting ''black awakening'' and the development of ''black consciousness.''
        George Leon Netterville Jr. was born in rural Ascension Parish, La., on July 16, 1906. He received a bachelor's degree from Southern and a master's degree from Columbia University.
        He joined Southern as the dean of men and business manager in 1938. He became vice president for finance and business affairs in 1967.
        His wife, Rebecca, died in 1989, and his son, George Leon Netterville III, died in 1993. He is survived by a granddaughter.
