        Joseph Marshall Parriott, the chief designer for a wide range of objects including the stainless-steel Steam-O-Matic steam iron, the WaterPik and a roomy and comfortable taxicab (which never went into production), died last Sunday at the Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y. He was 79 and lived in Cooperstown.
        Mr. Parriott taught industrial design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. His boxy-looking taxicab, designed by a student-and-faculty team at the institute's School of Art and Design, was only two inches longer than a Volkswagen Beetle but provided more head and leg room for passengers than a Cadillac limousine.
        When a full-scale mock-up of the vehicle was shown in 1971, a spokesman for Pratt said that the project had been undertaken because ''the modern taxi satisfies neither the passenger, the driver nor the owner. It seems to satisfy only the manufacturers and the junk dealers, and it accomplishes that feat in the short space of two years.''
        Michael J. Lazar, then New York City's taxi commissioner, praised the car as ''the kind of innovative design we are looking for.'' But while greatly admired, ''Parriott's chariot'' never went into production.
        Mr. Parriott was born in Moundsville, W. Va., on March 14, 1920, and was raised in Colorado. He attended Colorado University and Pratt, and during World War II served as a lieutenant with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Europe.
        In 1966, after working for a number of commercial enterprises, Mr. Parriott became chairman of Pratt's industrial design department, a post he held for 24 years.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Buckley, of Cooperstown; a sister, Susan Parriott Grimm of La Jolla, Calif.; and two brothers, Foster, of Boulder, Colo., and James, of Oxnard, Calif.
