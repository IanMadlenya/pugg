        Gregory Christopher Reynolds, a dancer and choreographer, died on Sept. 21 at New York University Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Reynolds died after a long illness, his sister Jean said.
        Born in Washington, Mr. Reynolds graduated from Sarah Lawrence College and trained with teachers like Alvin Ailey, Martha Graham and Marcel Marceau. Known professionally as Greg Reynolds, he performed with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in the 1970's and 80's.
        Mr. Reynolds was also a proponent of liturgical dance. He performed with the Omega Liturgical Dance Group, for which he created ''The Passion According to Mary'' in 1976. He formed his own troupe, the Greg Reynolds Dance Quintet, in 1976.
        Reviewing the company in 1983 in The New York Times, Anna Kisselgoff noted that Mr. Reynolds's dances were either overtly liturgical or an expression of ethical values. She described him as ''a mainstream choreographer who is totally fluent and whose idiom, sharp perceptions and humor bear some relationship to the work of Paul Taylor.''
        In addition to his sister Jean, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Reynolds is survived by his mother, Marian; two brothers, Leroy and Lamont, and three other sisters, Ann, Lois and Debera, all of Washington.
