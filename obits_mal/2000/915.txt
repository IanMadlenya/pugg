        George Sands, whose association with golf in the metropolitan area encompassed more than seven decades of service and leadership, died in his sleep last Saturday night at his home in Manhattan. He was 99.
        When he was 97, Mr. Sands, who was born in New York City in 1901, was the oldest golf official in the country. He attended Metropolitan Golf Association events and made presentations to caddie scholarship recipients when he was in his late 90's.
        Mr. Sands served on every committee of the M.G.A. and was its president in 1975. He also served on several committees of the United States Golf Association and officiated several national events throughout the country.
        As a result of his experience, Mr. Sands was also considered by many the unofficial ''walking historian'' of golf in the metropolitan area, one of the roles he enjoyed thoroughly.
        Mr. Sands was the honorary chairman of the Ike, the stroke-play championship of the M.G.A. that he and Dana Mosly founded. The tournament was started in 1953 as a tribute to the country's most well-known amateur golfer at the time, President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        Along with the Ike, his pride and joy was the Long Island Caddie Scholarship, which he also founded. The week he turned 97, he presented each of the year's 23 recipients with $1,500.
        Mr. Sands was particularly proud of the fact that the first recipient of a caddie scholarship, John Buckley, later became president of the scholarship fund.
        ''We've put more than 450 players through college,'' Mr. Sands said in 1998.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjorie.
