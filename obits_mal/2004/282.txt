        Leland King, an architect who, as a State Department official, commissioned some of the most distinguished buildings representing the United States overseas, died here on April 20.
        His death was announced by his family. He was 96 and lived in Bodega Bay.
        In her 1998 book ''The Architecture of Diplomacy: Building America's Embassies,'' Jane C. Loeffler credits Mr. King with a bold decision to commission high-profile Modernist architects as America's international role expanded after World War II.
        For example, for the United States Embassy in Rio de Janeiro, built in 1949, and for the one in Havana, built in 1951, he chose Harrison & Abramovitz, best known for designing the United Nations tower in Manhattan. For the United States Consulate in Frankfurt, built in 1952, he commissioned Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, designer of Lever House in Manhattan.
        ''He tried to bring modern architecture and the image of this country abroad,'' Mr. King's oldest daughter, Sheryl King Neely, said. ''He worked with the finest architects of the time.''
        Mr. King was born on Dec. 17, 1907, in Battle Creek, Mich., the grandson of an architect.
        He started practicing architecture in the early 1930's in Tucson, where he met his wife of 67 years, the writer Hametia Fielder King. They married in 1934 in Washington, and Mr. King served as associate architect there for post offices and federal buildings from 1935 to 1938.
        In 1938 he became chief architect for foreign buildings operations, a division of the State Department. That position led to his oversight of a $200 million building program in 72 countries.
        In 1956 the American Institute of Architects honored Mr. King for distinguished achievement in public buildings for his 17 years with the State Department.
        In 1962, during the Kennedy administration, Mr. King collaborated with the architect John Carl Warnecke on the restoration of Lafayette Square opposite the White House.
        Later he designed several projects in California, including Memorex's corporate headquarters in Santa Clara (1968), a veterans' cemetery in Riverside (1978) and a NASA center in Sunnyvale (1982).
        Mr. King's wife died in 2001. In addition to Ms. Neely, of Alamo, Calif., he is survived by another daughter, Louisa King Fraser of Santa Rosa; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
