        Joseph Brouillard, founder of a corporate communications agency bearing his name, died on Sept. 24 at his home in Montpelier, Vt. He was 79.
        The cause was a stroke, said William C. Lyddan Jr., president and chief executive of Brouillard Communications, now part of the WPP Group.
        In 1968, Mr. Brouillard formed a unit at the J. Walter Thompson Company to offer corporate clients not only advertising and design but also research, direct marketing and public relations. That unit, originally known only as J. Walter Thompson's corporation communications division, was named for its founder in 1980.
        Mr. Brouillard was born in Holyoke, Mass., served in the Coast Guard in World War II and graduated from Columbia in 1951. Among the places at which he then worked was Lippincott & Margulies, a design firm, where he became a director and vice president for marketing.
        He joined J. Walter Thompson in 1965 as director of communications planning and soon became executive vice president and a board member. He retired from the company and from Brouillard Communications in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Virginia; a son, Jeffrey, of Nashua, N.H.; and two grandchildren. A daughter, Lisa, died in 1995.
