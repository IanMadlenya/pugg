        Gene Wood, a veteran announcer for television game shows like ''Family Feud'' and ''Password,'' died on May 21 at a hospital in Boston. He was 78 and had lived in Adamsville, R.I., after retiring in the late 1990's.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wood, a native of Quincy, Mass., was a speech and theater graduate of Emerson College. He started an acting career in New York, eking out a living as an NBC usher and doing stand-up comedy.
        He wrote for Bob Keeshan, television's ''Captain Kangaroo''; made commercials; and was a host on the game show ''Beat the Clock.'' After moving to California in the 1970's he worked for several popular Mark Goodson productions broadcast by the national networks. Before retiring, he announced programs seen on the cable Game Show Network.
        Mr. Wood is survived by his wife of 44 years, Carleen Anderson Wood; two daughters, Sasha and Mia Wood, both of Los Angeles; a son from a previous marriage, Timothy E. Wood of San Francisco; and two grandchildren.
