        David S. Sheridan, an inventor whose decision to give up the flooring business and turn his attention to designing a better catheter has been credited with helping save many lives, died on April 29 at his home in Argyle, N.Y., his family said. He was 95.
        Catheters help rid the body of unwanted material as well as being used to give patients medicine or nutrients. But in 1939, when Mr. Sheridan decided to try his hand at the catheter business, draining devices were crude, and not terribly effective. Mr. Sheridan's innovation was to develop ways to make inexpensive hollow plastic tubes that not only improved drainage but could also be thrown out after a single use, reducing the chance of infection.
        David S. Sheridan was born on July 10, 1908, in Brooklyn. The son of Adolf and Anna Sockolof, Russian immigrants, he changed his name in 1939. In the late 30's, according to The Times Union of Albany, he got the idea to make catheters when a friend predicted that the war brewing in Europe would cut off the supply of the devices from France, their main provider. Over the years, he started four catheter companies that created several thousand jobs in the Glens Falls and Argyle areas. He held or shared more than 50 patents, and was a major medical philanthropist.
        Mr. Sheridan is survived by his wife, the former Janet Stout, and four children: D. Ross Sheridan of Pilot Knob, N.Y.; Davene Brown of Hebron, N.Y.; Hollis Sheridan of Argyle; and Pamela Roberts of Argyle.
