        David Clarke, a veteran actor on Broadway and in the movies, died on Sunday at a hospice in Arlington, Va., his daughter K. C. Ligon said. He was 95 and lived in Fairfax, Va.
        Mr. Clarke was a familiar face in many film noir and action movies from the 1940's through the 60's, and appeared in more than a dozen Broadway shows over a career that spanned six decades, though he rarely played the lead.
        With rugged good looks and a mischievous smile, he played a variety of toughs, workmen and soldiers in films like ''The Narrow Margin,'' ''The Asphalt Jungle,'' ''The Set-Up,'' ''Adam's Rib'' and ''Raw Deal.'' He was often not credited for his parts.
        One of his biggest film roles was a starring part in ''The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery'' (1960) with Steve McQueen.
        Mr. Clarke was born in Chicago and played football at Butler University in Indianapolis. He turned to acting after receiving an injury in his junior year. He moved to New York in the late 1920's when he and a fellow actor, Will Geer, were stranded in Seattle while on tour; they hitchhiked to New York together.
        They both appeared on Broadway in ''200 Were Chosen'' in 1936; it was Mr. Clarke's debut. The two remained close friends and both acted again in the film ''Intruder in the Dust,'' the 1949 Faulkner adaptation, and in the 1970's Mr. Clarke made several appearances on ''The Waltons,'' where Mr. Geer played Grandpa Walton.
        On Broadway Mr. Clarke appeared in the original casts of ''Abe Lincoln in Illinois,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''The Visit'' and ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe.'' His last Broadway credit was the 1974-75 ''Of Mice and Men'' revival with James Earl Jones.
        His wife, the actress and vocal coach Nora Dunfee, died in 1994.
        Besides Ms. Ligon of Manhattan, he is survived by another daughter, Susan Bennett of Fairfax, and two grandchildren.
