        Stephen M. Peck, a Wall Street investment banker and philanthropist, died at Mount Sinai Medical Center on March 30. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications after a heart procedure, said his wife, Judith Stern Peck.
        Mr. Peck served on the boards of Mount Sinai Medical Center for more than 30 years, six of them as chairman. During his chairmanship, donations to Mount Sinai totaled more than $500 million and financing for its its research programs doubled, largely as a result of Mr. Peck's efforts, said Debra Kaplan, a Mount Sinai spokeswoman.
        Mr. Peck was also a lifelong supporter of UJA-Federation of New York. In 1985, he became chairman of the board of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, a position he held for seven years.
        Stephen Martin Peck was born in New York on Feb. 2, 1935. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1956, at age 21, he became one of the youngest members of the New York Stock Exchange when his father bought him a seat.
        He first worked for a New York Stock Exchange specialist firm that belonged to his father, and a year later folded that business into a firm of his own, S. M. Peck & Company, which controlled trading in a group of stocks.
        In 1970, he helped create a private investment firm, Weiss, Peck & Greer, which provided brokerage, money management and specialist services. A year later he became the vice chairman of the New York Stock Exchange's board of governors.
        Mr. Peck joined Reliance Group Holdings as the insurance company's chief investment officer in 1985.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Peck is survived by a son, Bradford Peck; two daughters, Jennifer Peck and Suzanne Peck; a stepdaughter, Andrea Stern, and two stepsons, Emanuel Stern and Edward Stern; and nine grandchildren.
