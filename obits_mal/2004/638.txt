        Charles Seaver, an outstanding amateur golfer in the 1930's, died yesterday at a hospice in Pebble Beach, Calif. He was 93 and lived in Pebble Beach.
        His death was announced by his son, Tom Seaver, the Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher and Mets broadcaster.

        He attended the Hun School in Princeton, N.J., and Stanford University.
        In addition to Tom Seaver, of Calistoga, Calif., he is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Ackly; two daughters, Carol, of San Diego, and Katie, of Menominee, Mich.; a brother, James of Lawrence, Kan.; and nine grandchildren. His first wife, the former Betty Cline, died in 1986.
