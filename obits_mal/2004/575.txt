        Dr. Raja Ramanna, an eminent physicist and developer of India's nuclear bomb program who played a major role in the country's first nuclear test in 1974, died on Friday morning at Bombay Hospital. He was 79.
        The cause was internal bleeding in the stomach, said Dr. B.K. Goyal, honorary dean of the hospital. Dr. Goyal said Dr. Ramanna, who was afflicted with heart problems for 15 years, had undergone bypass surgery and angioplasty.
        Handpicked by the founder of India's nuclear program, Dr. Homi Bhabha, Dr. Ramanna proved to be a pioneer in the growth of physics in India, especially with his research into nuclear fission from 1965 through 1968.
        Dr. Ramanna rose to become the director of the Bhabha Atomic Research Center, chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission and secretary in the Department of Atomic Energy. He also was a scientific adviser to the Defense Ministry and minister of state for defense in 1990.
        He founded the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bangalore.
        Born in 1925 in Tumkur, in Karnataka State, Raja Ramanna was a graduate of Madras University and completed his Ph.D. in London. He returned to India and joined Dr. Bhabha, who was then at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
        Dr. Ramanna was an accomplished piano and viola player and the author of ''The Structure of Music in Raga and Western Systems.''
        Dr. Ramanna is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.
