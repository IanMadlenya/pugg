        Dr. Cecil G. Sheps, former director of the Beth Israel hospitals in New York and Boston and founder of a health policy research center, died on Feb. 8 at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 90.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Dr. Samuel Sheps of Vancouver.
        Dr. Sheps was a professor of social medicine and epidemiology as well as a vice chancellor for heath affairs at the University of North Carolina. In 1968, he founded the Health Services Research Center, which examines issues in public health policy. The center was renamed in his honor in 1991.
        Dr. Sheps, a native of Winnipeg, received a medical degree from the University of Manitoba in 1936 and enlisted in the Royal Canadian Medical Corps in World War II; he was inspired by the scope and organization of the military health care system. After the war, he went to Yale University, from which he received a master's degree in public health.
        From 1953 to 1960, he was general director of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School. In 1965, he became director of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, and also taught at Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He moved to North Carolina three years later.
        Dr. Sheps was a founding member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and a member of the New York Academy of Medicine.
        In addition to his son, Dr. Sheps is survived by a brother, Dr. Sheldon Sheps of Rochester, Minn; a sister, Dr. Lucille Ellison of Vancouver; and two grandchildren.
