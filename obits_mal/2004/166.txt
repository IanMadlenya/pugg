        Dr. Ewald W. Busse, an early leader in the field of geriatric psychiatry and a founder of the Center for Aging and Human Development at Duke University, died on Sunday at his home in Durham, N.C., said his daughter Barbara Busse. He was 86.
        Dr. Busse was chairman of the psychiatry department at the Duke Medical School when he began a novel program in 1954 to study the physiological, psychological and social aspects of aging. Previous studies had focused on elderly people living in institutions; Dr. Busse, however, recruited healthy volunteers older than 60 to participate in a long-term program to see how they aged in familiar surroundings.
        With a grant from the National Institutes of Health in 1957, Dr. Busse established the Center for Aging and expanded his research. His program, known as the Duke Longitudinal Study, eventually involved 800 older adults who submitted to rigorous medical and psychological examinations over 25 years. His findings increased understanding of the physical, mental, social and economic aspects of aging.
        Known as Bud, Ewald William Busse was born in St. Louis and graduated from Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., and the Washington University School of Medicine.
        A former president of the American Psychiatric Association, the American Geriatrics Society and the Gerontological Society of America, he received the highest honor given by the American College of Physicians, the William C. Menninger Award, for his contributions to mental health. He retired from Duke in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Ortrude; three daughters, Ortrude White of Atlanta, Barbara Busse of Durham and Emily Bragg of Darien, Conn.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. His son, Richard, died in 2000.
