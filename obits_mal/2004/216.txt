        Alan Levy, an American journalist, author and editor in chief of The Prague Post, died in a Prague hospital on Friday. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, the paper, an English-language weekly, reported. Mr. Levy was co-founder of The Post in 1991 and had been editor in chief and a weekly columnist since then.
        A native New Yorker, he worked as a reporter and freelance writer in this country until 1967, when he received an assignment to Prague.
        He was on the scene in 1968 when the Prague Spring uprising led to the invasion by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces. The restored Communist authorities in Prague declared him persona non grata in 1971 and ordered him and his family out of the country. Banished to Vienna, he lived there for 20 years, writing for The International Herald Tribune, Cosmopolitan and other publications.
        Returning to Prague in 1990, he was asked to help start The Post, which first appeared in 1991 and became a staple for English-speaking visitors. His weekly column, ''Prague Profile,'' appeared 549 times and was among the paper's most popular features.
        Mr. Levy wrote about 20 books and contributed to others. He wrote biographies of Jan Peerce, the tenor (''The Bluebird of Happiness,'' 1976), and Sophia Loren, the actress (1979).
        Four of his more recent works are in print: ''Ezra Pound: The Voice of Silence'' (1983), ''W. H. Auden: In the Autumn of the Age of Anxiety'' (1983) and ''Vladimir Nabokov: The Velvet Butterfly'' (1984) (all published by Permanent Press) and ''The Wiesenthal File'' (Constable, London; 1993).
        A 1952 graduate of Brown University, Mr. Levy received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia in 1953. He reported for The Louisville Courier-Journal until 1960.
        He also contributed articles to national magazines and reviewed books for The New York Post and The Los Angeles Times.
        Mr. Levy is survived by his wife of 47 years, Valerie Vladaver Levy; two daughters, Monika Levy of Les Mureaux, France, and Erica Levy of Manhattan; and two granddaughters.
        Correction:  April 9, 2004, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Alan Levy, an American journalist and author who was editor in chief of The Prague Post, misstated the place of death in some copies. It was Prague, not New York.
