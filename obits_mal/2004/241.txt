        Ed Gregory Jr., an old-time carnival operator who befriended celebrities and staged shows at the White House but who had myriad legal troubles, including a federal bank-fraud conviction for which he and his wife were pardoned in 2000 by President Bill Clinton, died on Sunday at his home in Brentwood, Tenn. He was 66.
        No cause was announced, but his son Don told The Tennessean newspaper that his father suffered from pulmonary disease.
        Edgar Allen Gregory Jr. was born in California and raised in Florida and Mississippi. His father was a Navy seaman who died in World War II. Mr. Gregory left high school to join the Navy in 1954 and while in the service met the woman who would become wifein 1957.
        After Mr. Gregory got out of the Navy, he and his wife, Vonna Jo, bought and sold businesses, including car dealerships, motels, a gas company and several small Alabama banks.
        They ran a thriving carnival business, known as United Shows of America, which operated at the Florida State Fair and about 30 other venues. He staged carnivals on the White House lawn in 1998 and 2000.
        In 2002, Mr. Gregory and his businesses filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. That pending case lists more than 200 creditors.
        Mr. Gregory and his wife were convicted of bank fraud in 1986. They were contributors to both political parties. Their pardon came three years after Mr. Gregory had retained Mr. Clinton's brother-in-law, Tony Rodham, as a consultant. The Gregorys denied that the relationship was connected to the pardons.
        In addition to his wife and son Don, Mr. Gregory is survived by another son, Daniel; two daughters, Faith Gentry and Jodi Anderson; and six grandchildren.
