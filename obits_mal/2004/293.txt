        John J. Dios, who was regarded as New Jersey's first Hispanic judge, died on April 21 at his home in Bradley Beach, N.J. He was 80.
        The cause was stomach cancer, said his wife, Marcela.
        Judge Dios was appointed to the Municipal Court in Newark at a time of rising Hispanic activism in the mid-1970s. After disturbances in the city, a group of prominent Newark residents formed the Hispanic Emergency Council and asked Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson for greater Hispanic representation in the city's government.
        One of the group's recommendations was the choice of Mr. Dios, a member of the Newark Municipal Council, to fill a vacancy on the Municipal Court.
        After being nominated by Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, Mr. Dios became the first Hispanic state judge in New Jersey, serving in Essex County. He was a Superior Court judge from 1978 until 1991.
        Judge Dios, who graduated from Rutgers Law School in 1949, practiced general law in his own firm in Newark for 25 years.
        He received his bachelor's degree from the University of New Mexico after serving in the Navy during World War II.
        John Joseph Dios was born in Havana in 1923. He came to the United States with his family when he was 7, and grew up in Newark.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, John, of Southampton, N.Y.; daughters, Maria Dios of Somerville, Mass., and Dolores Dios of Bradley Beach; nine grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
