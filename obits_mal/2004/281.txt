        Dr. Ray W. Gifford Jr., an expert on hypertension who carried out some of the early research on treatments for the disease, died Tuesday at his home in Fountain Hill, Ariz. He was 80.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, where he spent most of his career.
        In the early 1950's, when many doctors doubted the dangers of high blood pressure and questioned the need to treat it, Dr. Gifford helped show that antihypertensive drugs could save lives. In one early study, at the Mayo Clinic, he found that survival rates surged when patients were given medications to lower blood pressure.
        ''We had no protocols, no signed informed consent, no statistical consultation,'' he said in an interview with the journal Postgraduate Medicine in 1997. ''We just gave the drugs in any combination we thought would reduce blood pressure and minimize side effects.''
        Born in 1923 in Westerville, Ohio, Ray Wallace Gifford earned his undergraduate degree from Otterbein College and his medical degree from the Ohio State University medical school. In the mid-50's, while with the United States Navy medical corps, he became the assistant attending physician to Congress. One of his patients was Lyndon B. Johnson, whom he treated after a heart attack in 1955.
        At the Cleveland Clinic, he was head of the department of hypertension and renal disease from 1967 to 1985. He helped found the National Hypertension Association in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances Moore Gifford; a son, George, of Las Vegas; three daughters, Peggy Gifford of New York and Briarcliffe Acres, S.C., Cynthia Somerese of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Susan Gifford-Lewis of Chagrin Falls, Ohio; and two grandchildren.
