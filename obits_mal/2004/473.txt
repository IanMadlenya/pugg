        Robert E. Herman, a former state rent administrator of New York, died on July 28 at Hartford Hospital. A former resident of Great Neck, N.Y., he was 85 and lived in Boynton Beach, Fla., and Lee, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A lawyer by training, Mr. Herman was installed as rent administrator in 1960 by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. The office, in the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, helps write rent-control legislation and administers it for dwellings outside New York City.
        Mr. Herman held the office through the Rockefeller and Carey administrations, retiring in 1983, when Mario M. Cuomo was governor. Since then, he has been a consultant to the Westchester Apartment Owners Advisory Council and special counsel to the Building and Realty Institute of Westchester.
        A Manhattan native, he graduated from New York University in 1938 and from Columbia Law School in 1941, when he enlisted in the Army Signal Corps. He later was attached to the Office of Strategic Services.
        After the war, he worked in the New York bureau of the federal Office of Price Administration and helped develop rent-control guidelines passed on to the state level when federal price controls ended. New York State, in turn, relinquished its responsibility for rent controls within New York City in 1962.
        Mr. Herman is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Doris Berkley; two daughters, Kathy Smiley of West Hartford, Conn., and Patricia McAnally of Glenmoore, Pa.; a son, Jeffrey, of Stockbridge, Mass.; and 11 grandchildren.
