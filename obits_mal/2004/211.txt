        Julius Dixon, a songwriter from the earliest days of rock 'n' roll whose enduring hit ''Lollipop'' was a model of bubble-gum pop, died on Jan. 30 in Manhattan, said his son, Julius Dixson Jr. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Dixon, who was born with the surname Dixson but used the more common spelling professionally, had his first hit when Bill Haley recorded ''Dim, Dim the Lights (I Want Some Atmosphere)'' in 1955. That song, Haley's follow-up to ''Shake, Rattle and Roll,'' reached No. 11 on the pop charts and was Haley's first crossover to the R&B audience.
        Like many black songwriters in New York of the 1950's, Mr. Dixon wrote for a variety of groups but had his greatest successes with white performers. ''Lollipop'' was written for Ronald and Ruby, a duo of a black man and a white woman. The writing credit for that song, as for ''Dim, Dim the Lights,'' is shared by Mr. Dixon and Beverly Ross, the ''Ruby'' of the group. It reached No. 20 in 1958. But when it was recorded later that year by the Chordettes, four white women, it went to No. 2 and became a bubble-gum standard.
        Among the other hit songs that Mr. Dixon wrote or co-wrote are ''It Hurts to Be in Love'' for Annie Laurie, ''Begging, Begging'' for James Brown, ''Three Ways (to Love You)'' for Kitty Wells, and ''The Clouds,'' an instrumental by the Spacemen.
        Born in Barnwell, S.C., Mr. Dixon served in the United States Army during World War II and was later assigned to Special Services in Germany, where he had a weekly radio show called ''Variety Jive.''
        Besides Julius Dixson Jr., of Manhattan, his survivors include three sons, William Dixson of France, Oliver Shock of Chicago and Alton Dixson of North Plainfield, N.J.; two daughters, Beryl Hearns of Chicago and Darlyne Creecy of Richmond, Va.; and two sisters, Jenny Lou Ross of Manhattan and Ada Marion Anderson of Long Island City.
