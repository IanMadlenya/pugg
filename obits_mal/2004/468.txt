        David Baker, a noted audio engineer favored by many jazz recording artists, died on July 14 in Rochester, where he had gone for a recording session. He was 58 and lived in Manhattan.
        His death was announced by Kirk Imamura, president of Avatar Studios in Manhattan, and his family, who said the apparent cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Baker was associated with many labels as a freelance engineer. In 1986 he started remastering the entire Vanguard catalog for compact disc.
        Mr. Baker's long working relationship with the singer and pianist Shirley Horn produced a Grammy Award for best jazz vocal performance of 1998 for her ''I Remember Miles,'' a tribute to Miles Davis.
        David Howard Baker was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., a son of Harry A. Baker, who founded a large hi-fi-systems business in Atlanta.
        He started making amateur recordings as a boy and in the 1960's recorded civil rights events like voter-registration drives and church hall meetings.
        He trained at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and the Institute of Audio Research in New York. Most recently he did archival recordings for Jazz at Lincoln Center's 2003-2004 season.
        Mr. Baker is survived by his wife, Kyoko Baker, and four sisters, Karen B. Hartrampf of Atlanta; Diane B. Harwell of Savannah, Ga.; Harriet B. Parker of Orlando, Fla.; and Robin B. Dickson of St. Simons Island, Ga.
