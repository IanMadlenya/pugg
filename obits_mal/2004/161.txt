        John Henry Williams, who sent the body of his father, Ted Williams, the Boston Red Sox Hall of Famer, to be frozen at an Arizona cryonics laboratory, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 35.
        The cause was leukemia, his lawyer, Peter Sutton, said.
        Mr. Williams based his decision to have his father's body and head preserved separately at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Scottsdale, in July 2002, on an oil-stained note that he, his father, and sister, Claudia, signed in late 2000 in a Florida hospital room.
        Alcor declined to say if Mr. Williams followed his father to Alcor, or if he paid the $111,000 outstanding on his father's bill.
        The freezing of Ted Williams led Barbara Joyce Ferrell, his eldest daughter, to wage a legal campaign to have her father thawed and cremated, as he stated in his will. John Henry Williams never responded to criticism of his action. ''He felt like he couldn't win,'' said Albert Cassidy, executor of Ted Williams's estate. ''He didn't want to take the lead on cryonics and be ridiculed.''
        Mr. Williams grew up in Putney, Vt., with his sister, Claudia, and mother, Dolores, and was not close to his father as a youngster. He eventually started several sports-related businesses and recently played for low-level minor league teams.
        As the gatekeeper to his ailing father, Mr. Williams alienated numerous people. ''Fringe people and those who wanted something for nothing -- John Henry cut them right out,'' Cassidy said.
        Mr. Williams is survived by his mother and his sister.
