        Carl Allen, who raised, raced and trained world champions in harness racing and whose horses earned almost $15 million, died Monday after a tractor accident at his Marion County farm. He was 74.
        A sheriff's office report said that Jason McInturf, a relative of Allen's, said that Allen died when a tractor he was using to dig an irrigation trench overturned and rolled over him.
        Allen died at Munroe Regional Medical Center.
        Allen raced competitively throughout the United States.
        He was recovering from a racing accident in New Jersey a few weeks ago and had hoped to return to racing.
        His career began shortly after a fire destroyed his vacuum cleaner distributorship plant in Detroit in 1967.
        As a driver, he won 649 races with total earnings of more than $9.8 million. As a trainer, he won 207 races with earnings of more than $5.1 million.
        Allen was considered one of the most versatile figures in his sport.
        ''He's one of the few who has bred, raised, raced, trained and remain competitive in harness racing,'' Ellen Harvey, a spokeswoman for the United States Trotting Association, said.
        Some of the world champion horses that Allen raised and raced included C R Kay Suzie, C R Commando, C R Renegade and Royal Troubadour.
        Allen is survived by his wife of 54 years, Mae Jean Allen; four sons, Chester, Michael, Rodney and Martin; a sister, Bernice; three brothers, Harold, F. D. and Jerome; nine grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
