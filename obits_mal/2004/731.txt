        Tom Haller, an All-Star catcher who played for the San Francisco Giants, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Detroit Tigers in a 12-year major league baseball career and was later the Giants' general manager, died Friday in Los Angeles. He was 67.
        His death was announced by the Giants, who said it came after a long illness.
        Haller was signed by the Giants' organization out of the University of Illinois and made his major league debut in 1961. He caught for the Giants in his first seven seasons, playing on the team that lost to the Yankees in the 1962 World Series. He caught for the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1968 to 1971, then ended his career with Detroit.
        Haller caught for the Tigers in a game in which his brother, Bill, was the home-plate umpire, the first time that two brothers had been behind the plate at the same time.
        A left-handed hitter, Haller had a career batting average of .257 with 134 home runs and 504 runs batted in. He was an All-Star from 1966 to 1968 and was named to the Giants' 25th anniversary team in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan; his sons, Tom Jr. and Tim; his brother, Bill; and a sister, Joyce Ganz.
