        James Williams, a pianist formerly in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and a leading jazz educator, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 53 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Jenise Grice, fianc√©e of the drummer Tony Reedus, Mr. Williams's nephew.
        Mr. Williams was born in Memphis, and he grew up surrounded by musicians like Harold Mabern, George Coleman and Jamil Nasser. Like them, he used elements of gospel and blues in his sunny, swinging improvisations. But as a teacher and producer of jazz, he was also a repository of standards in jazz, including the more modern ones; he was especially interested in the pianist Phineas Newborn Jr., who also came from Memphis.
        After attending Memphis State University, Mr. Williams moved to Boston, where he taught at Berklee College of Music from 1972 to 1977; at that time he worked with groups led by Joe Henderson, Woody Shaw and others. In 1977 he joined the Jazz Messengers, playing over four years and 10 albums and alongside Wynton Marsalis and Bobby Watson.
        In 1984, Mr. Williams moved to New York, where he became a bandleader and educator as well as a producer of albums and concerts. He formed the Contemporary Piano Ensemble, a four-pianist group; he also started a band called Intensive Care Unit, which used a revolving cast of singers and worked at reconciling gospel with jazz. He formed Finas Sound Productions, through which he produced many albums and concerts.
        He was named director of jazz studies at William Paterson University in Wayne, N.J., in 1999 and taught until he was hospitalized in April of this year.
        Mr. Williams is survived by two brothers, Hannibal Parkes and Ralph Parkes, both of Memphis; and a sister, Barbara Williams, also of Memphis.
