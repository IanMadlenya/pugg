        Maxwell McCrohon, a former Australian news correspondent who became editor of The Chicago Tribune, United Press International and then The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, died Wednesday in Washington, where he had made his home. He was 76.
        The cause was complications of lung cancer, said his son Craig.
        Mr. McCrohon, a former reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald, led The Tribune from 1979 to 1981 after serving as its managing editor for seven years. Despite an international background, he focused the paper on local news, devoting nearly half the front page to Chicago institutions and personalities. He also overhauled the arrangement of text and photographs, earning industry renown for his design flair.
        During his tenure as editor and managing editor, The Tribune won four Pulitzer Prizes and increased the circulation of its Sunday issue to nearly 1.2 million.
        Mr. McCrohon left the editorship of The Tribune in 1981 to become vice president for news at its parent company, the Tribune Company. He then became editor in chief of United Press International in 1983, at a time when the news agency was struggling to turn a profit under new ownership.
        He resigned from U.P.I. as president in 1986 and then was editor of The Los Angeles Herald Examiner until it ceased publication in 1989.
        Mr. McCrohon was born in a suburb of Sydney and raised in rural Walla Walla in New South Wales. Soon after high school, he began reporting for The Sydney Morning Herald. After assignments in New York and Washington for The Herald, he joined The Chicago American in 1960 and oversaw much of the paper's redesign into Chicago Today. In 1969, he became managing editor of that paper, which is no longer published.
        Mr. McCrohon is survived by his wife, Nancy; two sons, Sean, of Washington, and Craig, of Chicago; a daughter, Regan McCrohon-Hoff of Rye Brook, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
