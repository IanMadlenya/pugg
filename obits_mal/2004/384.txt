        Spencer Klaw, a journalist and author who helped expand the scope of The Columbia Journalism Review in the 1980's, died on June 3 at his home in West Cornwall, Conn., his family said. He was 84.
        Mr. Klaw, who had taught magazine writing at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism since 1970, became editor of the Review in 1980 and guided it beyond routine press criticism to include reports on topics like repetitive stress injury and labor relations in news organizations.
        At the same time, the Review, which had been published under Columbia's auspices since 1962, negotiated a letter of agreement that acknowledged for the first time that the magazine retained ''full editorial control.''
        Mr. Klaw was born in New York and graduated in 1941 from Harvard University, where he was the editor of The Crimson. He worked as a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle, United Press and The New Yorker and as an editor for The New York Herald Tribune and Fortune magazine. In 1968, he began his teaching career at the University of California at Berkeley, moving to the Columbia journalism school two years later.
        He was the author of three books, ''The New Brahmins: Scientific Life in America'' (1968), ''The Great American Medicine Show'' (1975) and ''Without Sin: The Life and Death of the Oneida Community'' (1993).
        After retiring from Columbia University in 1989, Mr. Klaw, with his wife, the former Barbara Van Doren, published The Cornwall Chronicle, a monthly newsletter in northwest Connecticut. Mrs. Klaw died in 2002.
        Mr. Klaw is survived by four daughters, Rebecca Klaw and Joanna Klaw Schultz, both of Pittsburgh, Margaret Klaw of Philadelphia and Susan Klaw of Boston; a sister, Margaret Tenney of Berkeley, Calif.; and nine grandchildren.
