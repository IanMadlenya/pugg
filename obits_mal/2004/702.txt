        Covington Hardee, a lawyer who led one of Brooklyn's oldest banks, died Nov. 1 in Kent, Conn. He was 85 and until recently lived in Washington, Conn. The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Diana.
        In 1975, after being a trustee for several years, Mr. Hardee became chairman and chief executive of the Lincoln Savings Bank, a Brooklyn institution that expanded to serve all of New York City during his tenure.
        Mr. Hardee had previously been general counsel for the Union Pacific Railroad and advised clients in London, Brazil, Paraguay and Puerto Rico.
        William Covington Hardee was born on March 2, 1919, in Florence, S.C., and graduated from Emory University. He received a law degree from Harvard in 1943 and was a communications officer during World War II. He then taught at Harvard Law School before entering private practice.
        He was a director of the Diners' Club, chairman of the Brooklyn Museum's governing committee and a trustee of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
        After retiring from Lincoln Savings Bank in 1984, he directed the fund raising efforts of the New Milford Hospital Foundation.
        In addition to his wife of 28 years, Mr. Hardee's survivors include five children, Pamela Jackson, of Boston, Felicity Barry, of Amherst, Mass., Meredith Templin, of Mohnton, Pa., Nell Nicholas, of Cornwall, Conn., and William Hardee, of Middlebury, Conn.; seven stepchildren, Thrae Dulchin, of Manhattan, Robin Swensen, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., John Lamont, of Plainfield, N.J., Scott Schereschewsky, of Gulf Stream, Fla., Brian Schereschewsky, of Nantucket, Mass., Laura Doty, of Corvallis, Mont., and Catherine Charles, of Washington, Conn.; 17 grandchildren; and 4 great-grandchildren.
