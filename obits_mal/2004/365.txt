        Harvey Brooks, a physicist and administrator at Harvard who studied and helped shape national science policies involving energy, the military and the environment, died May 28 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 88.
        The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, said a son-in-law, Dr. Robert C. Stowe, a political scientist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, where Dr. Brooks had taught.
        Dr. Brooks served on science advisory committees in the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
        He was president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in the 1970's and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the Council on Foreign Relations.
        He was the author of many articles in professional journals and wrote ''The Government of Science'' (1968), which explored the relationship of science and government.
        Harvey Brooks was born in Ohio on Aug. 5, 1915. He graduated from Yale and studied at Cambridge before receiving a doctorate in physics from Harvard in 1940.
        He helped to develop the acoustic homing torpedo during World War II, and later worked for General Electric on a project to use nuclear-powered reactors in submarines. In 1950, he joined Harvard's Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and was its dean from 1957 to 1975. He officially retired in 1986, but continued to teach and to advise.
        Dr. Brooks is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Helen Lathrop. Other survivors include three daughters, Rosalind B. Stowe of Cambridge, Katharine G. Brooks of Boone, N.C., and Alice B. Bourgoin of Ferrisburg, Vt.; a son, Kingsley C. of Fairfield, Iowa; and two grandchildren.
