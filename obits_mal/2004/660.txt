        Clark Battle Fitz-Gerald, a sculptor who produced public commissions for several American cities, churches and universities, died on Oct. 18 in Castine, Me. He was 87.
        His death was announced by his wife, Liddy.
        Mr. Fitz-Gerald, born in St. Louis, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Art in 1940 and was in the Ninth Armored Division for nearly all of World War II. After that he taught at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.; Washington University in St. Louis; and Beloit College in Wisconsin until 1956, when he gave up teaching and moved to Castine to be a sculptor.
        Working in wood, stone, metal and bronze, Mr. Fitz-Gerald took inspiration from the natural world, including the structures of seeds and spores, kelp fronds and whale vertebrae.
        He had large commissions for Uris Hall at Columbia University, Independence Hall in Philadelphia and Coventry Cathedral in England. He has large works on the campuses of several institutions in Maine: the Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, the George Stevens Academy in Blue Hill, Colby College in Waterville and the University of Maine in Orono. He also made the carved wood ballot box used for public elections in Castine.
        Mr. Fitz-Gerald is survived by his wife and by two sons from his first marriage, Timothy and Stephen.
