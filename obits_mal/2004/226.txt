        Carl Bakal, a writer, editor and public relations man who was author of an early warning about the proliferation of firearms in the United States, died on March 18 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 86 and lived on the Upper West Side and in East Chatham, N.Y.
        His death was announced by his daughter Stephanie Bakal.
        Mr. Bakal was the author of ''The Right To Bear Arms'' (McGraw-Hill, 1966). It examined the Second Amendment to the Constitution and the tradition of firearms ownership in the United States.
        The book argued that the easy availability of guns and weapons of any kind had increased the level of violence. Gun ownership, it held, bred criminals and criminality, a view that aroused debate then and since.
        Mr. Bakal also wrote ''Charity U.S.A.: An Investigation Into the Hidden World of the Multi-Billion Dollar Charity Industry'' (Times Books, 1979). It tracked the evolution of an American tradition of generosity, toting up some 700,000 unregulated nonprofit organizations whose activities, he argued, required stricter accountability, perhaps through federal oversight.
        Carl Bakal, a native New Yorker, graduated from City College in 1939. He spent the war and postwar period on photo assignment for the Army Signal Corps in the Far East and Germany.
        He worked for the military government in Germany and, heading a documentary film unit, produced film segments in Japan that were widely seen on television there and in this country.
        After the war he held editorial positions at The New York Mirror and at Coronet magazine, among others, before turning to freelance writing.
        Mr. Bakal is survived by his wife of 47 years, Shirley Sesser Bakal; four daughters, Stephanie, a Manhattan resident; Emilie Bakal of Brooklyn; Amy Bakal de Ugarte of Cuzco, Peru; and Wendy Jo Bakal of Brooklyn; a sister, Corinne Bakal Nusbaum of Manhattan; and eight grandchildren.
