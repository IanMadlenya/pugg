        Anthony J. McAllister Jr., who helped expand his family's fleet of tugboats and barges to serve ports from New York to Puerto Rico, died on Dec. 9 in Wynnewood, Pa. He was 75 and lived in Pottsville, Pa.
        The cause was complications of heart surgery, his family said.
        From 1979 to 1984, Mr. McAllister was president of the McAllister Towing and Transportation Company, whose boats, known for their red-and-white stacks, have tugged steamships and floating cargo into New York's harbor for almost 140 years.
        Mr. McAllister, who was born in Brooklyn and graduated from SUNY Maritime College, was, with three younger brothers, the fourth generation of family leadership at McAllister, which their great-grandfather founded in 1864 after immigrating from Ireland.
        In the 1970's, Mr. McAllister started the McAllister Feeder Service to transport goods that usually arrived from overseas. Though no longer running, the service once accounted for much of McAllister Towing's business.
        Mr. McAllister then directed the company's acquisition of the Baker-Whitely Towing Company, giving it a presence in the bustling port of Baltimore.
        Now led by one of his brothers, Brian A. McAllister, McAllister Towing is the East Coast's largest family-owned tugboat company, hauling as far north as Portland, Me., and as far south as San Juan, P.R. The company also operates the Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamboat Company, a ferry business.
        Mr. McAllister's first wife, Muriel, died. He is survived by his second wife, Merle; three sons, Anthony J. III, of Havertown, Pa.; Gregg, of Ashland, Mass.; and Reid, of Gaithersburg, Md.; a daughter, Michael Anne, of Springfield, Pa.; three sisters, Patrice Guiney of Radnor, Pa.; Marjorie Toner of Ridgefield, Conn.; and Eileen Donovan of Cresskill, N.J.; three brothers, Brian A., of Manhattan; Bruce, of Palm Beach, Fla.; and Michael Sr., of Bronxville, N.Y.; and six grandchildren.
