        Joseph Wasserman, an architect active in community planning and affordable housing, both urban and rural, died on June 25 at his home in Stockbridge, Mass. He was 73.
        His death was announced by the Finnerty & Stevens Funeral Home, which said the cause was a cancer diagnosed two year ago.
        Mr. Wasserman, who continued to work on a project in Stockbridge until last month, formerly worked in New York in partnership with Norman Hoberman and, later, Jerome Kretchmer. He moved to the Berkshires in 1991, after which he worked part time on projects in Great Barrington and Stockbridge.
        Born in Philadelphia, he graduated from Harvard College and the Harvard Graduate School of Design before joining Mr. Hoberman on projects in New York City, Albany and New England.
        Their firm worked on designs for the New York State Urban Development Corporation, some 2,000 units including buildings for the elderly in Coney Island and housing in Westchester and Rochester.
        In the 1980's, working with Mr. Kretchmer, he was a principal in designing and developing affordable housing in urban renewal zones. One of those initiatives on the Upper West Side in the 1980's produced the Columbus Townhouses, a row of condominiums on West 89th Street that won a citation from the City Club of New York in 1990.
        Mr. Wasserman was a former president of the New York City chapter of the American Institute of Architecture.
        He is survived by his second wife, Jane Ryan; three daughters, Lindsay Wasserman of La Honda, Calif., Andrea Wasserman of Vershire, Vt., and Marion Wasserman of Santa Fe., N.M.; six grandchildren; and his stepdaughters Nina and Laura Ryan. Also surviving are his former wife, Bay Wasserman of New York City; a sister, Marie Ridder of McLean, Va.; and a brother, William S. of Ipswich, Mass.
