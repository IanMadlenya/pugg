        Gary Stevens, a retired New York broadcast executive and celebrity publicist, died on May 17 at his home in Manhattan. He was 88.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his former wife, Naura Hayden.
        Mr. Stevens, who got his start at 16 while in high school as a scriptwriter for a radio farm program on NBC, was a founder and general manager of the television division of Warner Brothers in the 1950's.
        More recently he produced pilots for celebrity shows, ran a publicity firm and wrote syndicated columns for newspapers and magazines.
        A native of Lake Forest, Ill., he came to New York after high school and worked in the publicity section of CBS. He worked for the Morton Downey shows, then earned a degree in journalism and speech from the University of Chicago before returning to New York and CBS.
        He wrote radio scripts for WNEW and during World War II worked on broadcasts to the Armed Forces for NBC and the BBC.
        He later was a producer of the panel show ''Twenty Questions'' on both radio and television, and of celebrity interviews for the radio show ''Luncheon at Sardi's,'' among others.
        Mr. Stevens was married to Ms. Hayden from 1969 to 1974. He left no immediate survivors.
