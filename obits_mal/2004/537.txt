        Carl E. Morris, a former newspaper reporter and editor who then held several influential posts as an advocate for hiring black journalists, died Friday at his home in Reston, Va. He was 73.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery, his wife, Kelda, said.
        In 1984, he became the first minority affairs director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Before that, he was executive director of the National Association of Black Journalists, where he had helped establish its first national office.
        He next founded the National Association of Minority Media Executives, where he continued to track media companies' records in hiring minorities, a project he had begun while working with the black journalists' group. He continued this monitoring after his retirement in 1995.
        Carl Eugene Morris was born in Pittsburgh on April 11, 1931. He attended local public schools, then served in the Air Force. He graduated from West Virginia State College.
        Early in his career he worked in St. Louis for The St. Louis Argus newspaper before returning to Pittsburgh in 1967 to work for The New Pittsburgh Courier as general manager and executive editor. In 1978, he joined The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where he was city hall reporter and copy editor.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Morris is survived by two daughters, Karla Morris-Holmes and Ann Morris-Betts, both of St. Louis; two sons, James, of St. Louis, and Benjamin, of Los Angeles; his brother, Kenneth, of Pittsburgh; two stepsons, Donald Hickman of Ashburn, Va., and Brian Hickman of Pittsburgh; and seven grandchildren.
