        Stanley Harris Feldberg, a prominent discount retailer who helped build the Zayre chain, forerunner of the TJX Companies, which owns the T. J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, died on April 24 in Charleston, S.C. He was 79 and lived in Hilton Head, S.C., where he moved from Wellesley, Mass., about 20 years ago.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Feldberg was president of the Zayre Corporation from 1956 to 1978. A New England-based family business, it had its beginning when the brothers Max and Morris Feldberg opened their Bell Hosiery Shops in Hyannis in 1929.
        Stanley, Max's son, entered the business in 1949 and became president in 1956, when the next generation started the Zayre Corporation to run discount department stores. For some years, the chain's stores proliferated nationally.
        It suffered from competition in the mid-1970's but drew strength from two divisions, its 12 budding T. J. Maxx off-price family apparel stores and the larger Hit or Miss junior-wear off-price chain.
        The TJX Companies, with its flagship T. J. Maxx stores, Marshalls, HomeGoods, A. J. Wright and Bob's Stores, most recently listed nearly $12 billion in annual revenue and had 100,000 employees.
        Mr. Feldberg was president of Zayre until 1978 and was chairman of the executive board after that. He was vice chairman when the company restructured under its new identity of the TJX Companies and retired in 1996 as a director of TJX and another spinoff, BJ's Wholesale Club, formerly Waban Inc.
        Stanley Feldberg graduated from Dartmouth in 1946 after serving in the Army Air Forces in World War II. He remained a benefactor of Dartmouth, where a library is named for the family.
        Mr. Feldberg is survived by his wife of 56 years, Theodora Lehrer Feldberg; a son, Mark L., of Carmel, Calif.; a daughter, Margery Feldberg, of Manhattan; a sister, Barbara Stern, of Palm Beach, Fla.; and four grandchildren.
