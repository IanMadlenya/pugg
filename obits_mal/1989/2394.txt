        Mr. Barton, who became a vaudeville singer at age 13, auditioned a song for Frank Sinatra in 1943. With the singer and Hank Sanicola, he founded Barton Music, which published many Sinatra hits, including ''Learnin' the Blues,'' ''All The Way'' and ''Love and Marriage.'' In 1968 Mr. Barton moved to Los Angeles, where he supplied songs for Glen Campbell, Jerry Vale and others.
        He entered the nursing home in September.
        Mr. Barton's wife died in 1980. He is survived by a daughter, Eileen, a former pop singer; a son, Bill; two brothers, Roger and Sam, and two grandsons.
