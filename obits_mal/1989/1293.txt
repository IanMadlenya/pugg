        Mr. Harmon won the 1948 Masters at Augusta, Ga., and lost in the semifinals of the P.G.A. Championship that same year. He reached the semifinals of the P.G.A. Championship three times and the quarterfinals four times when that tournament was decided by match play. In 1959, he tied for third in the United States Open.

        For the last eight years, Mr. Harmon taught golf here at Lochinvar Golf Club, where he was pro emeritus.
