        Hoyt S. Haddock, a retired maritime union official who was a former president of the United Seamen's Service, died Tuesday at his home in Towson, Md., after a long illness. He was 81 years old.
        Mr Haddock, who was a radio operator aboard American merchant ships early in his career, retired last week from the Seamen's Service. He had served five terms as president of the nonprofit organization, which provides community and welfare services for American seamen at centers overseas.
        For more than 30 years, before he retired in 1972, he was executive secretary for the Maritime Committee of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Previously he was president of the American Radio Telegraphists Association, later known as the American Communications Association. For a short time he was executive secretary of the American Guild of Variety Artists.
        He is survived by a daughter, Ellen Dolores Keener, of Timonium, Md.; three granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.
