        Dr. Robert Rienow, a retired professor of political science at the State University of New York at Albany and an author and environmentalist who had warned about the depletion of natural resources, died on Sunday in a fire that destroyed his farmhouse in Selkirk, N.Y. He was 79 years old.
        Dr. Rienow was born in Grafton, Wis., and was a graduate of Carthage College. He had doctoral and master's degrees from Columbia University. He taught at Albany from 1936 until he retired in 1979.
        In World War II he served in the Army in New Guinea. He continued his military service in the New York National Guard, retiring as a brigadier general in 1979.
        Together with his wife, Leona Train Rienow, who died in 1983, Dr. Rienow wrote ''Moment in the Sun: a Report on the Deteriorating Quality of the American Environment,'' which was published by Dial Press in 1967. The couple argued that rapidly expanding population and ''thoughtless ravaging'' of natural resources would combine to produce ''a glut of people on an exhausted earth.''
        Dr. Rienow was a founder of the New York State Audubon Society, to which he willed his 138-acre farm, Hollyhock Hollow, in Selkirk.
        There are no immediate survivors.
