        Madagascar's former military head of state, Gen. Gilles Andriamahazo, has died of a heart attack, officials said today. He was 70 years old.
        General Andriamahazo was head of state from February to June 1975, when he served as chairman of the ruling military junta after Col. Richard Ratsimandrava, the head of state, was assassinated after six days in office.
        General Andriamahazo resigned to make way for Adm. Didier Ratsiraka, the naval commander, who has been President ever since.
        General Andriamahazo is widely credited with having prevented an outbreak of civil war during the tense weeks after Colonel Ratsimandrava's assassination.
        He was one of the leading figures of the military regimes that ruled this Indian Ocean island from the overthrow of a civilian President, Philibert Tsiranana, in 1972 until the emergence of Admiral Ratsiraka as a left-wing strongman in 1975.
        General Andriamahazo served in the French Army during World War II and took part in the French military campaign against Algerian nationalists in the 1950's.
        He retired from the Malagasy armed forces in 1976.
