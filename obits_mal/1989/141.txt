        Dr. Robert S. Coles, an internationally known ophthalmologist and educator, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan after a long illness. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Coles, a 1945 graduate of New York University College of Medicine, was director of the department of ophthalmology at Lenox Hill Hospital from 1974 to 1987, when poor health forced him to retire. He was an expert in the treatment of uveitis, an inflammation of the iris, and was a pioneer in the implantation of intraocular lenses, which replace natural lenses, usually in cataract patients.
        Previously, he was director of the uveitis unit at Mount Sinai Medical Center and held teaching positions at New York University College of Medicine and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, Roberta; two sons, Anthony and John; a daughter, Nancy C. Goldstein, and a sister, Nancy Lyons, all of Manhattan, and a grandson.

        An obituary on Friday about Dr. Robert S. Coles, a New York City ophthalmologist, included erroneous dates given by Lenox Hill Hospital for some events in his career. He retired in January 1988 as director of ophthalmology at the hospital and was a member of its medical staff until his death last Wednesday.
