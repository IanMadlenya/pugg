        Dr. Davis, a native New Yorker, treated many well-known figures. He testified that Sirhan Sirhan was competent to stand trial after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and he diagnosed Kitty Dukakis's spinal cord compression when she was campaigning in California last year.
        Dr. Davis was a chairman of the committee on practice of the American Academy of Neurology.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Winokoor; a sister, Ruth Bartfeld of Bethesda, Md.; three sons, Anthony of Los Angeles, Adam of Manhattan and Alexander of Victorville, Calif.; two stepsons, Alexander and Ted Alben, both of Los Angeles; and a granddaughter.
