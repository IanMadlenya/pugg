        Mr. Shakabpa, a native of Tibet, joined the Tibetan Government at the age of 23 and was Finance Minister from 1939 to 1951. When China occupied Tibet in 1951, he moved to India where, until 1966, he was the Dalai Lama's chief representative in New Delhi.
        Mr. Shakabpa was the author of several books, including ''Tibet, a Political History,'' published in 1967 by Yale University Press.
