        Emanuel R. Posnack, a patent lawyer, inventor and author, died of congestive heart failure last Saturday at his home in Great Neck. L.I. He was 92 years old.
        In addition to representing patent seekers, Mr. Posnack perfected the Posnack recuperator, a device for reusing exhaust heat from industrial furnaces, and the autoclench stapler, which made it possible to close staples on a box without inserting a metal plate inside.
        He practiced patent law in Manhattan from 1935 to 1975.
        Mr. Posnack wrote three books on economics and world affairs, including ''World Without Barriers,'' published in 1956 by William Morrow. In it he argued against political and legal impediments to the free international flow of people, goods, capital and ideas.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Bock; a son, Alan, of Candia, N.H., and two grandsons.
