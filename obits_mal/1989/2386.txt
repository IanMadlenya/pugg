        Rabbi Davin Schoenberger, who performed the marriage of Anne Frank's parents and later fled Nazi Germany, died Tuesday at University Hospital. He was 92 years old.
        It was while serving as chief rabbi of Aachen, Germany, from 1926 to 1938 that Rabbi Schoenberger married the parents of the Jewish teen-ager whose wartime diary was later read around the world.
        The Schoenbergers and their daughter fled Europe after their synagogue was burned to the ground on Kristallnacht, Nov, 9, 1938, when Government-incited mobs attacked Jews and Jewish institutions and properties. Rabbi Schoenberger's chief pulpit in the United States was in Chicago, but he later served a synagogue in Selma, Ala. He retired in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, Ilse; their daughter, Elaine Katz of Tuscaloosa, Ala., and three grandchildren.
