        William (Wild Bill) Davison, who played jazz cornet in the gangster-run clubs of Chicago in the 1920's and regularly toured Europe and Asia in the decades that followed, died Tuesday. He was 83 years old.
        A family spokeswoman said today that Mr. Davison, who was in the intensive care unit of Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, had undergone an operation two weeks ago for circulatory problems.
        Mr. Davison was to have played in Britain and Switzerland in January, and his Wild Bill Davison American Jazz Band will play the concerts there as a tribute to him, the spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Davison, who made about 800 recordings in the years since 1924, grew up in Defiance, Ohio, where he discovered he could produce notes from a piece of garden hose. A friend gave him an old cornet and he developed a driving style of playing that took him around the world.
        He played in Eddie Condon's nightclub in New York in the 1940's and 50's and went on to tour Europe and Asia in the 1970's and 80's. ''I'll go on playing until my teeth drop out,'' he said when he was 76. The trumpeter Louis Armstrong once told him, he said, ''If anything ever happens to me, I know you can keep on doing what I'm doing.'' The remark helped keep him playing despite his age, he said.
        A gum-chewing musician who made wisecracks out of the side of his mouth, Mr. Davison mostly led his own groups in later years. He had toured Japan a few weeks before his operation.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne.
