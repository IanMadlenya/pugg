        Dr. Milvy, a 1965 graduate of Cornell University with a Ph.D. in biophysics, was most recently a senior analyst with the Federal Environmental Protection Agency but left the post late last year to complete a book on the nuclear arms race.
        Previously, he had been an assistant professor of physics at the City University of New York and an assistant professor of pathology at New York University Medical Center. He had also been an assistant professor of community medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where he was associated with the Environmental Science Laboratory. Served on President's Council
        He moved to Washington from New York City in 1980 to join the President's Council on Environmental Quality but left the council the next year. He then became a consultant with the Environmental Law Institute and until 1984 was with the Center for Defense Information.
        Dr. Milvy, an avid runner, was a fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences and in 1977 edited a book on the physiological aspects of running, ''The Long Distance Runner: A Definitive Study,'' published by Urizen Books.
        In recent years, he was a member of the executive committee of the Washington chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility.
        Dr. Milvy, whose longtime companion was Laurel A. Cappa, is survived by two daughters, Laura and Erika, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Elizabeth Diaz of Narragansett, R.I.
