        Sir Lennox Berkeley, an eminent British composer perhaps best known for his Stabat Mater choral work, died on Tuesday. He was 86 years old.
        The composer, who suffered from a heart ailment and Alzheimer's disease, died of a respiratory infection in a London hospital, said his son, Michael.
        Sir Lennox attended Oxford University, where he studied French, Old French and philology before devoting himself to music. He studied under Nadia Boulanger in Paris for five years and returned to Britain in 1935, the year of his first major work, the oratorio ''Jonah.''
        Three years later he produced another choral work, ''Domini est terra,'' then music for string quartets, solo instruments and orchestra. The first of his four symphonies was completed in 1940.
        Stabat Mater, for 6 voices and 12 instruments, was written for Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group and was first performed in 1947. Among Sir Lennox's operatic works are ''Nelson,'' ''Ruth'' and ''A Dinner Engagement,'' all written between 1952 and 1956.
        Sir Lennox was knighted in 1974 by Queen Elizabeth II. The Composers' Guild of Great Britain named him Composer of the Year in 1973. Two years later he was elected president of the Composers' Guild and the Performing Rights Society.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Elizabeth Freda Bernstein, and three sons.
