        Monsignor Webby, a graduate of College of the Apostles in Juniye, Lebanon, was ordained a priest in 1953; was elevated to Chor-Bishop, which is equivalent to Monsignor, in 1972 and was appointed head of the 400,000 Maronite Christians in the United States in 1978. He was also rector of Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral in Brooklyn.
        Previously, he had served at St. Ann's Maronite Church in Scranton, Pa., at St. Maron Maronite Church in Detroit and at Our Lady of Lebanon Shrine in Jackson, Ohio.
        Maronite Christians are an Eastern Rite community of the Roman Catholic Church, and are the largest Christian group in Lebanon.
