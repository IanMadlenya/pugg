        Cyril Mathew, a former Sri Lankan Industries Minister and an ardent crusader for Sinhalese nationalism, died of a heart attack on Monday. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Mathew was expelled from the Cabinet and the governing United National Party by President J. R. Jayewardene in 1984 after criticizing a conference called by Mr. Jayewardene to redress grievances of the Tamil minority. Mr. Jayewardene's successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, reinstated Mr. Mathew's party membership six months ago.
