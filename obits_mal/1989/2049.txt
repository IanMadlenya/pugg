        Leonardo Sciascia, an Italian novelist and essayist whose work explored political corruption and crime in his native Sicily, died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Palermo. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Sciascia's recurring theme was a struggle by individuals to win justice amid venality and hypocrisy. His metaphysical suspense works, which repeatedly became award winners and best sellers throughout Italy, included ''Mafia Vendetta'' (later called ''The Day of the Owl''), ''A Man's Blessing,'' ''Equal Danger'' and ''One Way or Another.''
        Herbert Mitgang, in a 1985 review of ''The Wine-Dark Sea,'' a short-story collection, in The New York Times, hailed Mr. Sciascia as ''the most authentic voice writing in Sicily today,'' calling him a natural spinner of tales of villainy who ''manages to find flowers in the island's cactus.''
        Among Mr. Sciascia's other works were ''Salt in the Wound,'' ''Pirandello and Sicily,'' ''Sicilian Uncles'' and ''Candido.'' Asked in 1986 if he was fearful the Mafia would harm him because he had exposed and deplored them, Mr. Sciascia said, ''The Mafiosi aren't interested in literature.''
        Surviving are his wife, Maria, and two daughters, Laura and Anna Maria, all of Palermo.
