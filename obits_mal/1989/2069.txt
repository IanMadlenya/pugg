        Martin Broszat, a prominent West German historian and a specialist on Nazi crimes against the Jews, died on Oct. 14 at his home in Munich after a long illness, his daughter Katrin confirmed yesterday. He was 63 years old.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Broszat had for 17 years been the director of the influential Institute for Contemporary History in Munich.
        A major West German newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, called him ''one of the great historians of our time,'' and observed that although Dr. Broszat ''did not in any way disavow the responsibility of Hitler,'' he viewed the mass murder of Jews as an ''improvised crime'' in which the Nazi regime ''reacted to the deterioration of the war situation.'' Born in Leipzig
        Dr. Broszat was a young staff member of the institute in 1964, when he served as a court-appointed expert witness at a trial in Frankfurt of 22 former guards at the Auschwitz death camp, which served as a reminder to West Germans and others of the extent of the Nazi mass killings.
        In a deposition prepared for the trial, Dr. Broszat wrote that there was no initial master plan for the Nazi camp system, and that it grew gradually.
        He was born on Aug. 14, 1926, in Leipzig, which is now in East Germany, and attended the university there before moving to the University of Cologne, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on anti-Semitism in Germany. He was a co-author of the book ''Anatomy of the SS State,'' which was published in the United States in 1968 and also wrote other works.
        He married Alice Welter in 1953 and had three children.
