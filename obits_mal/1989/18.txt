        George R. Tweed, a World War II Navy radioman who eluded Japanese forces on the Pacific island of Guam for 31 months, died Monday in an automobile accident in Northern California. He was 86 years old.
        When Japanese forces overran Guam in 1941, Mr. Tweed, then a a chief radioman, and several others slipped into the jungle rather than surrender. He became the only survivor after the others were captured and killed.
        Mr. Tweed managed to elude Japanese soldiers for two years seven months, providing information to American forces that recaptured the island in 1944. He was awarded the Legion of Merit.
        His story was told in a 1945 book, ''Robinson Crusoe USN,'' and a 1962 movie, ''No Man is an Island,'' starring Jeffrey Hunter.
