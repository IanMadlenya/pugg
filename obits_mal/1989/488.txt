        Mr. Heider, a native of Portland, Ore., worked with bandleaders like Les Brown, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich at his studios in Hollywood and San Francisco. He founded and then sold the Hindsight record label, which specializes in previously unreleased big-band recordings. His most recent venture, Swingtime Video, transfers short films of band performances of the 1940's and 50's to videotape.
        He is survived by his daughter, a son and two grandsons.
