        Robert William McLaughlin, emeritus professor of architecture at Princeton University's School of Architecture, died Thursday at Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center after a brief illness. He was 89 years old and lived in Princeton.
        From 1930 to 1952 Mr. McLaughlin was a partner in Holden, McLaughlin & Associates, a New York company that specialized in the design of public housing, schools and hospitals.
        In 1932 he founded American Houses Inc., which was among the first companies to be involved in prefabricated homes. He was awarded more than 20 patents for techniques in building and was architect for several large public housing projects. He was also architectural adviser to the State Department for the design of the United States Embassy in London.
        In 1952, Prof. McLaughlin was appointed director of the School of Architecture at Princeton, a post he held until his retirement in 1965. He advised the New Jersey Capitol Commission and wrote several books on architecture.
        He graduated from Princeton in 1921 and received a master's degree in 1926, after serving with the Navy during World War I. He is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Thurber; a daughter, Meredith Knowlton, of Princeton; a son, Robert Thurber McLaughlin, of Potomac, Md., and four grandchildren.
