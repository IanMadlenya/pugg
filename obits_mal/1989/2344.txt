        A graduate of the University of Miami in Florida, Mr. Dixon taught briefly at Mississippi Southern College before becoming a manager at the Fort Worth division of Convair General Dynamics Corporation in 1956. He was deputy controller in the Department of Defense from 1961 to 1962 and then joined Ling Temco Vought Inc., as director of planning.
        In 1967 he was named a vice president of LTV Inc. and two years later assumed the presidency of E-Systems, a small, unprofitable subsidiary of LTV. He transformed the company into one with multimillion-dollar Government contracts to produce electronic components for military intelligence, electronic warfare, aircraft guidance, reconnaissance and navigations systems as well as communications and data systems.
        When he retired in 1987 as chief executive officer, the company had annual revenues exceeding a billion dollars and a backlog of $1.6 billion in orders. He continued to serve as a consultant and as chairman emeritus.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a daughter, Jacqueline Noonan of Dana Point, Calif.; two sons, Frederick of Dallas and Clinton of Tyler, Tex., and 10 grandchildren.
