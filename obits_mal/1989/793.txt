        Ernest E. Williams, former editor of The Fort Wayne News-Sentinel, the first person to encourage Vice President Dan Quayle to run for Congress, died Sunday of complications after cardiac bypass surgery. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Williams was active in local and state Republican politics. ''It was Ernie's idea first that I run for Congress in 1976,'' Mr. Quayle told The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette.
        Mr. Williams joined the News-Sentinel as a reporter in 1945 and was named editor in 1966. He retired in October 1982.
