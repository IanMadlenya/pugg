        Andrew P. Lee, an insurance executive and a member of a founding family of Manhattan's Chinatown, died of complications from pneumonia Wednesday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 70 years old and had lived for 30 years in Great Neck, L.I., before moving to Manhattan five years ago.
        Mr. Lee, a founder of the Harold L. Lee & Sons Insurance Agency, was a grandson of Lee Kee Do, a young merchant from Canton who in 1888 set up several businesses, including a grocery and a curio shop, at 31 Pell Street, the present site of the Lee agency.
        Mr. Lee's father, Harold, started a Chinese-language movie house, ran a noodle company and established a foreign-exchange service enabling immigrants to send money to China.
        Andrew Lee, born in Manhattan, attended schools here and in China, including St. John's University in Shanghai. He received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree from Columbia.
        Fluent in four Chinese dialects as well as English, he served as an Army lieutenant in counterintelligence in India and China during World War II and received the Bronze Star.
        After the war, he founded the Lee agency and for many years was an agent of Union Mutual Life Insurance and the Maryland Casualty Company.
        Mr. Lee is survived by his wife, the former Marie Chan; two daughters, Linda Hsiao of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Sandra Kawano of Great Neck; a son, Douglas, of Los Angeles; four sisters, Rose Boon and Eva Lo of Manhattan and Martha Sze and Katherine Young of Great Neck; a brother, Henry, of Great Neck, and six grandchildren.
