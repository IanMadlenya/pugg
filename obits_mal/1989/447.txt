        William F. Kerby, a former chairman of Dow Jones & Company and for six years the executive editor of The Wall Street Journal, died of lung cancer yesterday at his home in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Kerby spent 47 years with Dow Jones, which publishes the Journal. He started as a reporter in the Washington bureau, later becoming assistant managing editor and managing editor, and was the newspaper's executive editor from 1945 to 1951 before he switched to the business side of the company.
        As assistant managing editor, he wrote the lead story for the Journal on the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
        He was elected president of Dow Jones in 1966 and chairman of the board in 1972, a position he held until he retired in 1978. During his time in command, he oversaw the company's expansion and diversification into overseas publishing ventures, electronic information services, and community newspapers.
        He was married for 51 years to the former Frances Justina Douglass, who died in 1986.
        He is survived by two daughters, Jean Frances Warner of Bethlehem, Judith Ann Beckmann of Buck Hill Falls, Pa., and six grandchildren.
        A memorial service will be held during the week of March 26 at Grace Church in Brooklyn Heights.
