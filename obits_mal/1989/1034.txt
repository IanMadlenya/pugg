        Mr. Echandia died at Tolima Hospital in Ibague, the capital of Tolima State in central Colombia, the hospital announced. He had suffered from heart and lung problems for nearly two years, the hospital said.
        In 1938, Mr. Echandia was defeated in a presidential election by Eduardo Santos. He was never elected President by popular vote, but he served as Vice President and four times took over briefly as a caretaker President.
        His longest term as Acting President was from October 1943 to May 1944, while President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo traveled abroad in search of a cure for his ailing wife.
        During his career, Mr. Echandia served as president of the Congress and president of the Supreme Court, and as Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Interior, Justice, and Education. He was also president of the Liberal Party.
        Mr. Echandia was buried on Monday in Ibague. No information was available on his survivors.
