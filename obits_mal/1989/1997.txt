        Merab Kostava, a leading Georgian human rights campaigner and dissident for more than 30 years, was killed today in a car accident, an independent newspaper said. He was 50 years old.
        A journalist who works for the newspaper Express Khronika and who is friendly with the Kostava family said Mr. Kostava was killed in a two-car crash early this morning on the road between Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, and Kutaisi, about 100 miles to the west. Two other people were hospitalized with injuries, the journalist said.
        Mr. Kostava was active in protests for an independent Georgia. The protests were put down by Soviet troops in April, and 20 people were killed. He was one of seven dissidents arrested after the killings, but he was released under pressure of public opinion.
        Mr. Kostava was a campaigner for human rights for decades. Born in 1939, his first arrest for dissident activity was in 1956. He served several prison terms, including a 10-year stretch that began in 1977 for translating banned books by dissidents into Georgian and for his activities with the Georgian chapters of the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights and the Helsinki Watch Committee.
        He was released in an amnesty for political prisoners declared by Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President.
        The rights campiagner Andrei D. Sakharov once described Mr. Kostava as ''very tough, very dignified.''
