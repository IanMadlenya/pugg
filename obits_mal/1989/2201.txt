        He was stationed in Italy with the all-black 332nd Fighter Group, which provided air cover for ships entering the Naples harbor and escorted bombers into Germany. He was a prisoner of war for about 30 days after his plane was shot down in March 1945. He retired from the Air Force in 1964.
        Survivors include his wife, Faye; two children, and four stepchildren.
