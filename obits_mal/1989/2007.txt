        Mr. Kis was born in 1935 in Subotica, on Yugoslavia's border with Hungary. He studied comparative literature and began his career translating classical French works into his native Serbo-Croatian.
        He found a sympathetic and enthusiastic audience in France. His novels include ''Garden, Ashes'' (1971), ''A Tomb for Boris Davidovitch'' (1980), ''Hourglass'' (1982) and ''Early Sadness'' (1984). His best-known collection of short stories, ''Encyclopedia of the Dead,'' was published in 1985.
