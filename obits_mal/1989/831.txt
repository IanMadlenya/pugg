        Donald F. Hine, an investment counselor who was formerly a partner in the stockbrokerage concern of Neuberger & Berman, died of Alzheimer's disease on Monday at the Sierra Health Care Center in Davis, Calif. He was 90 years old and had lived in Garden City, L.I., and on Shelter Island, L.I., before moving to Davis three years ago.
        Mr. Hine, a graduate of Yale University who was trained as an engineer, was an investment adviser for the New York Trust Company before he joined Neuberger & Berman shortly after World War II. He managed the Guardian Fund, one of the early mutual funds, for the company. He retired in the late 1960's.
        He is survived by a daughter, Charlotte Sobeck of Davis; a son, Charles, of Chicago and New York; four grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.
