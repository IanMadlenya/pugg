        Lawrence Pope, a bank president who became a bank robber, collapsed and died Monday on a street in Austin. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Pope began as a bank office boy in the 1930's and became president of West National Bank in West, Tex., near Waco.
        After he was eased out of the job, he thought his banking partners had cheated him. In November 1960, after banks in two rural Texas towns were robbed at gunpoint, he was arrested and admitted the crimes. Sentenced to 50 years in prison, he was paroled in 1982.
