        Mr. Stone, a native of Chicago, opened the store in 1935. The shop, in the East 50's, specialized in sporting books, paintings and prints. Mr. Stone liquidated the business in 1964 when he moved to Maine.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Naomi Burton; two daughters from a former marriage, Nora Smith of Washington and Susanna Doyle of Manhattan; a brother, Herbert S. Jr., of Washington, and eight grandchildren.
