        Maurice C. Dreicer, a radio personality and program developer who engaged in such novel pursuits as recording a verbal cocktail-mixing manual and pursuing a 40-year search for the perfect steak, died of cancer last Wednesday at his home in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. He was 78 years old. In the late 1930's and early 40's Mr. Dreicer conducted several news and talk shows over New York City radio stations. He originated ''Where Are You From?'' for WOR. in which a linguist told studio guests where they were born by listening to them talk; ''Find the Phoney,'' the radio predecessor of ''To Tell the Truth,'' and ''What's It Worth?,'' which foreshadowed ''The Price Is Right.''
        A food and wine columnist, Mr. Dreicer began his worldwide quest for the perfect steak in 1945; 40 years and thousands of steaks later he had not found it, and he abandoned plans to publish a book on his research.
        His quest for perfection also led him to invent a device for testing caviar, to form Cigar Smokers United, and to record ''How to Mix Them,'' his best-selling manual on how to make drinks properly.
        Mr. Dreicer was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Deerfield Academy and Rollins College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Brigitte Kimmich.
