        In addition to New York University, Dr. Stunkard had a long association with two other scientific educational institutions. He was a research associate of the American Museum of Natural History from 1921 until his death, and spent most of his summers since 1914 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass.
        Dr. Stunkard, a native of Monmouth, Iowa, was a graduate of Coe College, where he starred in track and football. He received a doctorate in biology from the University of Illinois in 1916 and began teaching at N.Y.U. that year.
        In 1917, shortly after the United States entered World War I, he enlisted in the Army Signal Corps and was part of the first contingent of aviation cadets sent to France, where he served with the French Seventh Army.
        He returned to teaching at war's end, and in 1925 was named chairman of N.Y.U.'s Department of Biology, a post he held until his retirement in 1954.
        Dr. Stunkard headed a number of scientific societies. He was president of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1937, 1942 and 1943; of the American Microscopical Society in 1936, and of the American Society of Parasitologists in 1939.
        Dr. Stunkard's wife, Frances, died in 1968. He is survived by a daughter, Eunice Latham, of the Bronx, and a son, Dr. Albert, of Philadelphia.
