        Jacob R. Van Mater Lefferts, a retired New Jersey real-estate developer, died Tuesday at Indian River Memorial Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 76 years old and lived in Vero Beach.
        Mr. Lefferts, a graduate of Columbia University, built several thousand homes in the late 1950's and 1960's in Monmouth County, especially in Middletown. He was an avid gardener and planned developments that retained existing trees and placed houses on winding streets, a departure from the grid patterns that were then the vogue. He also developed a booklet called ''The Prudent Man's Guide to Home Buying,'' which gave prospective homeowners ways to determine whether a house would be suitable for their families.
        He is survived by two sons, Jacob 3d, of Rumson, N.J., and Leffert, of Middleburg, Va.; a stepson, Ronald Debee of Fair Haven, N.J.; a brother, Douglas, of Port Chester, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
