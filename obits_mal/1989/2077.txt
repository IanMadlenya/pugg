        Frank A. Southard Jr., a former senior official of the International Monetary Fund, died of cancer today at a hospital near his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Southard served as the fund's deputy managing director, its second highest position, from 1962 until his retirement in 1974. He had worked as an executive for the fund's board and also as special assistant to the Secretary of the Treasury.
        Mr. Southard was born in Cleveland, the son of Frank A. Southard and May L. Bowsher. He received a bachelor's degree from Pomona College in California and a doctorate from the University of California, where he subsequently became an economics instructor. He later taught at Cornell University's economics department, where he also served as chairman, and conducted research with support from the Carnegie Endowment, the Guggenheim Foundation and the Social Science Research Council.
        In 1941, Mr. Southard joined the Treasury Department as assistant director of the division of monetary research. He was involved in the earliest planning for the International Monetary Fund, which later emerged from the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference.
        His work at the Treasury Department was interrupted in 1942, when he served as a Naval officer with the Allied Force Headquarters staff in the Mediterranean. From 1942 to 1946, he was engaged in the design and operation of the financial aspects of European liberation, most notably in Italy.
        Mr. Southard is survived by his wife, the former Mary I. Hay, and a sister, Elizabeth Marshall, of Sewanee, Tenn.
