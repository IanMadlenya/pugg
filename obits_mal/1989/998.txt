        Professor Baltzly joined the faculty of N.Y.U.'s Washington Square College in 1922, after having taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At N.Y.U., he was an adviser to freshman classes, chairman of the history department and an assistant dean before retiring in 1957.
        He then taught part time in the history department of Pace University from 1959 to 1980. He co-wrote two undergraduate texts, ''Readings in European History Since 1814'' and ''Readings in Twentieth Century European History.''
        He is survived by his daughter, Deborah Aliber of Chicago, and three grandchildren.
