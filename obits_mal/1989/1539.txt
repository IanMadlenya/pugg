        Gerhard de Kock, who as governor of the South African central bank was credited with bringing a market-oriented approach to the Government's monetary policy, died today of colon cancer. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. de Kock joined the central bank, known in South Africa as the Reserve Bank, in 1956, becoming head of its economics department in 1963.
        From 1968 to 1971, he was an alternate director of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, representing South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Lesotho and Swaziland. He returned to South Africa when he was appointed one of three deputy governors of the Reserve Bank.
        He headed a commission of inquiry into the monetary system from 1977 to 1982. The inquiry resulted in major changes, but not elimination, of the practice of government intervention in the monetary system.
        In June, Mr. de Kock announced his intention to retire in October after eight years as governor. No mention was made of his cancer. He is to be succeeded by Chris Stals, special economics adviser to the Minister of Finance.
