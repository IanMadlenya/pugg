        John Palanchian, vice president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians and a leading figure in classical-music labor relations, died of kidney failure yesterday afternoon at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey after a long bout with cancer. He was 56 years old and lived in Englewood.
        Mr. Palanchian was active in the New York City Opera orchestra's recent strike, which ended Nov. 18 after 66 days. He spent 22 years in the orchestra's first-violin section before taking the post with Local 802 in early 1983.
        Born in New York City in 1933, Mr. Palanchian earned bachelor and master's degrees in music from the Manhattan School of Music; his principal violin teacher was Raphael Bronstein.
        After service in the Seventh Army Symphony and as concertmaster of the Fred Waring Orchestra, Mr. Palanchian began a free-lance career in the City Opera's off-seasons. He played in the Radio City Music Hall, Tulsa Philharmonic, Santa Fe Opera, American Ballet Theater and Metropolitan Opera orchestras.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, Mark, of East Granby, Conn., and Derek, of Plainsboro, N.J., and his mother, Enid Bell Palanchian, of Englewood.
