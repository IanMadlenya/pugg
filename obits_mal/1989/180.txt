        Former president Jose Luis Bustamante y Rivero, who was ousted in a 1948 military coup and later became president of the International Court of Justice, died Wednesday, a hospital spokesman said. He was 94.
        Mr. Bustamante died at the central military hospital in Lima, where he was admitted last year with heart problems.
        He was elected President of Peru in 1945 but deposed three years later in a military coup led by Manuel Odria, who was War Minister in his Cabinet.
        After the coup, Mr. Bustamante taught law and in 1961 became a judge at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. He was elected its president in 1967 and held that office for three years. He is the only Peruvian to be president of the Court.
        In 1977, Mr. Bustamante began serving as mediator in a war between El Salvador and Honduras. The two countries signed a peace accord two years later.
        Mr. Bustamante was born in the southern city of Arequipa in 1894.
        He served as dean of the law college in Lima.
