        Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who was Indonesia's Prime Minister in 1948-49 and later rebelled against Sukarno, the nation's first President, has died. He was 76 years old.
        Dr. Sjafruddin died of heart failure Wednesday.
        He was Economics Minister when he took over as Prime Minister in 1948 after the former Dutch colonial rulers captured Mr. Sukarno at Jogjakarta in central Java.
        Indonesian nationalists had proclaimed independence for the country in 1945, but the Netherlands did not recognize the new republic until Dec. 27, 1949. Mr. Sukarno, one of the leaders of the nationalist struggle, was President from 1949 until 1967. He died in 1970.
        A leader of the struggle for independence from the Dutch, Dr. Sjafruddin found himself increasingly at odds with President Sukarno. He ultimately split with him over the President's ''guided democracy'' plan and its provision to include Communists in the Government.
        In 1958, Dr. Sjafruddin was named Prime Minister of a revolutionary government in opposition to Sukarno , beginning a three-year revolt against the Jakarta authorities. Dr. Sjafruddin eventually surrendered to the army.
        Dr. Sjafruddin became an Islamic preacher after leaving government.
        Dr. Sjafruddin, who was buried today, is survived by his wife and eight children.
