        Martin J. Knorr, a Republican-Conservative who served in the New York State Senate for 23 years, died of congestive heart failure yesterday at his daughter's home in Long Beach, L.I. He was 83 years old and lived in Little Neck, L.I.
        Mr. Knorr represented the 15th Senate district in Queens, which includes Woodside and South Ozone Park, from 1966 to 1989, when he retired. He served in the Assembly for one term in 1953 and 1954. During his legislative career, he lived in Ridgewood, Queens.
        In addition to the Republican and Conservative Parties, the Right to Life Party backed Mr. Knorr. He supported the death penalty and opposed abortion. In the 1970's, he was a determined foe of busing to achieve racial balance in the New York City school system.
        A popular politician in his district, Mr. Knorr represented an extremely conservative constituency that included a high proportion of Democrats, many of whom said that Mr. Knorr best exemplified their ideals.
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from Dartmouth College and the Brooklyn Law School. He practiced law in Queens and was an assistant United States Attorney.
        Mr. Knorr was also a former president of the Allied Civic Associations, a former member of the board of Christ the King Regional High School in Queens, and an active member of the Bushwick Senior Citizens Council.
        He is survived by two daughters, Prudence Jackson of Long Beach, and Constance McCormack of Ridgewood, Queens; a son, Clement, of Seattle; a sister, Helen Johnson of Forest Hills, Queens, and three grandchildren.
