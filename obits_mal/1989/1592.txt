        The Rev. Eugene F. O'Malley, considered the inspiration for the character of the same name portrayed by Bing Crosby in the movies ''Going My Way'' and ''The Bells of St. Mary's,'' died Monday of cardiac arrest at the St. Joseph Hospital and Health Care Center. He was 87 years old.
        Father O'Malley had been director of the all-male Paulist Choir at Old St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church for four decades until it was disbanded in 1967.
        Born in Chicago, he began his lifetime commitment with the choir in 1912 as a singer. He became director in 1928. Under his leadership the choir traveled across the country and performed at the White House. It disbanded because of Father O'Malley's advancing age and retirement, a decline in applicants and church reform.
        He is survived by a sister, Genevieve V. Rudd.
