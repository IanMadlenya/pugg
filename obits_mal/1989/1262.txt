        Alva Sole, a United States Airmail Service pioneer, died in his sleep Thursday. He was 99 years old.
        A highlight of his career was flying mail to President Franklin D. Roosevelt at Warm Springs, Ga.
        Mr. Sole was born in Wheeling, W.Va., in 1889. He began work as a mail clerk on a train and worked his way up to become head of the postal service's Atlanta office in 1933. In the meantime, he obtained his pilot's license, and volunteered for some of the first airmail flights in the late 1920's and early 1930's.
