        Yusaku Matsuda, an award-winning actor who played a murderer in the film ''Black Rain,'' died of bladder cancer on Monday at a hospital in Tokyo. He was 39 years old and had been hospitalized since Oct. 7.
        Mr. Matsuda won the Japan Academy Award and the Kinema Junpo award for best actor for his role in the 1983 satire ''Kazoku Geimu'' (''Family Game''), directed by Yoshimitsu Morita. The film was a critical hit in the United States as well as in Japan.
        In ''Black Rain,'' his last film, Mr. Matsuda played a gangster who commits a murder in New York. Michael Douglas played the American detective who takes him back to Japan and then pursues him through the streets of Osaka after he escapes custody.
        Mr. Matsuda also co-starred with Florence Griffith-Joyner, the Olympic gold medalist, in a television drama, ''Karei-naru Tsuiseki'' (''The Great Pursuit''), shown in Japan last month.
        Mr. Matsuda was known for his frequent real-life brawls as well as his cool, cynical style. He made the first of his many movie appearances in 1973 and appeared frequently on television.
