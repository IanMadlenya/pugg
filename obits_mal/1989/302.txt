        Dr. Dvorine, who practiced optometry in the Baltimore area for more than 40 years, never finished high school. After working in an optical laboratory he earned a doctor of optometry degree at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry in the late 1920's.
        He is survived by two sons, Shura and William, both of Baltimore; a sister, Eva Lavenstein of Baltimore, and four grandchildren.
