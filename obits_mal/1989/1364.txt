        Chief Edison P. Mt. Pleasant Jr., widely recognized as the leader of the Tuscarora Nation, died Friday in Mount St. Mary's Hospital here after a brief illness. He was 70 years old.
        Chief Mt. Pleasant was the Tuscarora Nation's treasurer and oversaw the governing of the Tuscarora Reservation in Lewiston, just outside Niagara Falls.
        He was also a well-known lecturer on the American Indian, particularly the Iroquois Confederacy, a powerful league of Indian nations that stretched throughout much of upstate New York in the 17th and 18th centuries. The Tuscarora joined the confederacy - which also consisted of the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga and Seneca nations - in 1722.
        Chief Mt. Pleasant often dealt with the state and Federal governments, and in 1984 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named him New York State's Indian of the Year.
        He lived on the Tuscarora Reservation most of his life, except while serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
        After the war, he worked for Bell Aerospace, now called Bell Aerospace Textron, in Wheatfield. He retired from Bell in 1978 after a 29-year career.
        Chief Mt. Pleasant had in recent years led a fight against bingo games on the reservation.
        He is survived by his wife, Eliza Ruth; two daughters, Clara Patterson and Delma Printup, and a son, Edison P. Mt. Pleasant 3d.
