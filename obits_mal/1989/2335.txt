        Tien Lui, who helped develop the synthetic molding clay Play-Doh, died Thursday in Cincinnati. He was believed to be in his 80's, but there were no records of his birth in China.
        Mr. Lui came to the United States from China in 1924 to attend Cornell University. He earned a doctorate in agricultural biology, then taught pharmaceutical science and conducted research.
        In 1957, he was hired by Rainbow Crafts Inc., to develop a soft sculpting substance that would be easy for children to use. Working with Joseph McVicker, whose father owned the company, Mr. Lui formulated Play-Doh.
        Mr. Lui, who lived in the Cincinnati suburb of Reading, continued to work for Kenner Products, which acquired Rainbow Crafts in 1971, as a part-time consultant until his death.
        He left no survivors.
