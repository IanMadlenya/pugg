        Frederick J. Ludwig, a law professor who had been a police officer and an acting district attorney in Queens, died Monday at his home in the Bronx. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Ludwig was a professor of law at John Jay College at his death. He taught earlier in his career at the University of Nebraska and St. John's Law School.
        In 1965, he was named special counsel to the New York State Senate Committee on the Affairs of the City of New York. The committee, led by Senator Thomas J. Mackell, investigated problems of metropolitan mass transportation.
        In 1969, after Mr. Mackell became Queens district attorney, Mr. Ludwig was named first assistant district attorney. In 1974, after Mr. Mackell was indicted on charges of conspiracy, Mr. Ludwig became acting Queens district attorney. Mr. Mackell was convicted, but in 1975 the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court reversed the conviction on the grounds that insufficient evidence had been presented. The State Court of Appeals upheld the reversal. A Return to Teaching
        After a new district attorney was named for Queens, Mr. Ludwig returned to teaching.
        His first job, at the age of 11, was as a caddy, to support his widowed mother. At 22, after graduating from City College of New York, he quit his job as a high school teacher to earn more money as a policeman.
        Attending classes at Columbia Law School while walking a beat as a patrolman in the Bronx, he graduated first in his class. A few months later he became the youngest sergeant on the force. He later rose to captain.
        He is survived by a brother, Donald, of Berkeley Heights, N.J., and three sisters, Helen Flynn of Manhasset, L.I., Marcella Borzon of Hartsdale, N.Y., and Marion Brown of Somers, N.Y.
