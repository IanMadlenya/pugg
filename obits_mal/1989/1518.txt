        Kenneth N. Sherwood, a former Harlem businessman and member of the New York State Athletic Commission who moved to the island of Jamaica in 1976, died last Friday of injuries received during a robbery of his home in Kingston. He was 58 years old.
        He held the Burger King franchise for the island, where he operated two restaurants and was building a third. In 1986, he was elected president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Jamaica.
        Mr. Sherwood, a graduate of St. John's University, became one of the first black owners of a major business on 125th Street in Manhattan, Harlem's main shopping street, when he acquired Reter Furniture in 1965 and renamed it Kenwood. He had earlier been a manager for the Busch Jewelry Corporation.
        In subsequent years, he branched out into other enterprises, including supermarkets, life insurance and real estate.
        In the early 1970's Mr. Sherwood was appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the athletic commission, which regulates boxing.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lois Lake; his father, Charles, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Michelle and Kendra, both of the Bronx; a brother, Charles, of Hempstead, L.I., and a sister, Irma Moran of Valley Cottage, N.Y.
