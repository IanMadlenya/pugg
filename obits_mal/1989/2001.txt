        Walter O'Meara, a former New York advertising executive and author of 16 books, died of heart disease Friday at his home in Cohassett, Mass. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. O'Meara began his advertising career with J. Walter Thompson in Chicago. In 1930, he moved to Manhattan, where, from 1932 to 1940, he was chairman of the planning board for Benton & Bowles. From 1945 to 1952, he worked for J. Walter Thompson in Manhattan. He retired in 1952 to write novels and historical nonfiction.
        His most recent book was ''We Made It Through the Winter,'' a memoir of his Minnesota boyhood (Minnesota Historical Society, 1974). His book ''The Grand Portage'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1951) was a best seller and received an award from the American Association for State and Local History. ''The Spanish Bride'' (Putnam, 1954), reflected his deep interest in Spanish culture and is soon to be republished by the New Mexico Historical Society.
        Mr. O'Meara was born in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1920.
        He served as an artillery sergeant in the Army in World War I and as chief of the planning staff for the Office of Strategic Services from 1942 to 1943 in World War II. From 1943 to 1944, he was deputy price administrator of the Federal Office of Price Administration.
        His wife, the former Esther Molly Arnold, to whom he was married for more than 60 years, died in 1983.
        He is survived by four children: Donn, of Caracas, Venezuela; Wolfe, of Bisbee, Ariz.; Ellen Woolf of Cohasset; Deirdre Humphrey of Westport, Conn; 14 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.
