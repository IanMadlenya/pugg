        Michael Lland, a dancer and ballet master at the American Ballet Theater, died last Friday at Tuomey Hospital in Sumter, S.C. He was 64 years old.
        He died of complications from kidney failure, said Charles France, a spokesman for Ballet Theater.
        Mr. Lland, whose name was originally Holland Stoudenmire, was born in Bishopville, S. C. He trained in dance with Igor Schwezoff and Margaret Craske and was a student at the School of American Ballet. He made his professional debut in 1944 on Broadway in ''The Song of Norway,'' choreographed by George Balanchine.
        He was a principal dancer of the Teatro Municipal de Rio de Janeiro before joining Ballet Theater in 1949 as a soloist. He was made a principal dancer in 1956. Mr. Lland also danced with the New York City Ballet, appearing prominently in the original version of Balanchine's ''Square Dance'' and a 1962 revival of ''La Valse,'' also by Balanchine. He became a ballet master at Ballet Theater in 1971, remaining with the company until 1987, when he became ill.
        Mr. Lland is survived by a brother, Joseph Stoudenmire.
