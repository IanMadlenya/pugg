        Richard Pfizenmaier, a developer of international operations of the pharmaceutical house of Smith Kline and French Laboratories, died of blood cancer Thursday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Pfizenmaier helped expand international operations of the Philadelphia-based company, which is now called SmithKline Beckman, to Britain and Canada over more than 20 years. He resigned as chief of the international division in 1968 and joined IMS America Limited, pharmaceutical marketing researchers, and was president of that company until he retired in 1983.
        Mr. Pfizenmaier was a native of Philadelphia and a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and its Wharton School. In World War II, he was a Marine pilot in the South Pacific.
        In 1953, when Smith Kline and French bought Menley and James, a British pharmaceutical company, Mr. Pfizenmaier moved to London and helped transform a rundown factory into a thriving business.
        Mr. Pfizenmaier's first wife, the former Chris Tannous, cared for him in his final illness. He is survived by their two children, Richard Pfizenmaier Jr. of Springfield, Ill., and Carol Campbell of Philadelphia; his second wife, the former Angela Swaine, and their two sons, Bart and Sam, all of Hampshire, England, and two grandchildren.
