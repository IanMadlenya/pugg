        John Matuszak, who played on two Super Bowl teams for the Oakland Raiders before turning to an acting career, died Saturday night after suffering heart failure. He was 38 years old.
        An autopsy held today failed to determine the exact cause of death and more tests will be conducted. A preliminary investigation found no signs of foul play, the police said.
        The 6-foot-9-inch, 280-pounder played with the Raiders from 1976 to 1981 as a defensive lineman. His aggressive play and tough attitude embodied the spirit of the Raiders and helped earn the team Super Bowl victories in the 1976 and 1980 seasons.
        ''I'm just overwhelmed, shocked,'' said Al Davis, the Raiders' managing general partner. ''We really loved the guy. He was our friend.''
        After sitting out the 1982 season in Los Angeles, where the Raiders had moved, with an injury, Mr. Matuszak retired to pursue an acting career. He had dabbled in acting while a player.
        Born in Oak Creek, Wis., Mr. Matuszak was drafted as the first pick in the 1973 draft by the Houston Oilers. A year later, he signed with the Houston Texans of the World Football League, where he played one series before he was served an injunction obtained by the Oilers.
        He was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for Curley Culp and a No. 1 draft choice. Before the 1976 season, the Chiefs traded him to the Washington Redskins, who cut him two weeks later. He joined the Raiders as a free agent just before the second game of the 1976 season.
        Mr. Matuszak is survived by his parents, Marvin and Audrey Matuszak of Oak Creek, Wis.; and three sisters, Karen Bohlman of Orlando, Fla., Christine Evancy of Franklin, Wis., and Dawn Baley of West Allis, Wis.
