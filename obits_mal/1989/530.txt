        Bernard Blier, a popular French film actor, died on Wednesday in Paris. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Blier appeared in more than 150 movies during the last half-century. The plump, balding actor was equally at home in comic and dramatic roles, portraying vicious gangsters, bumbling bourgeois, jilted lovers and lascivious innkeepers. Born in Buenos Aires
        His many films included Henri-Georges Clouzot's ''Quai des Orfevres'' (1947), Yves Allegret's ''Dedee d'Anvers'' (1947) and ''Germinal'' (1962), Robert Thomas's ''Bonne Soupe'' (1963), Luchino Visconti's ''Etranger'' (1967), Yves Robert's ''Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe'' (1972) and ''Buffet Froid'' (1979), directed by his son Bertrand.
        Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, called Mr. Blier one of France's ''greatest and most popular artists.''
        Mr. Blier, who was born in Buenos Aires, began acting on the Paris stage in the mid-1930's. He made his movie debut in Raymond Rouleau's ''Trois, Six, Neuf'' in 1937, and had many small film and stage roles in the late 1930's and during the Nazi Occupation. Won Many Awards
        After World War II, Mr. Blier became much in demand as a leading actor in both France and Italy, making as many as eight movies a year in the 1950's. He worked with such directors as Georges Lautner, Bertrand Tavernier, Ettore Scola and Michel Audiard during the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, and his last film was Moshe Mizrahi's 'Mangeclous'' (1988). Mr. Blier's many awards included a Golden Bear at the 1950 Berlin Film Festival and an honorary Cesar, the French equivalent of the Oscar, which he received earlier this year.
