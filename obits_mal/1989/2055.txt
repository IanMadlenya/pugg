        Mr. Haines's first two books, ''Slim'' and ''High Tension,'' were based on his work as a telephone lineman during the Depression. Films he wrote or co-wrote include ''Man of Iron'' (1935), ''The Eternal Sea'' (1955), ''The Wings of Eagles'' (1957) and ''Torpedo Run'' (1958).
        Mr. Haines's play ''Command Decision,'' about the agonizing decisions of an Army Air Corps general in World War II, opened on Broadway in 1947 with Paul Kelly in the lead role. The film version starred Clark Gable.
        Mr. Haines served in the Army Air Corps during World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. His work with an intelligence team that broke German codes led to a nonfiction book on the subject titled ''Ultra.''
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a daughter, Laura Belman of Washington, and a son, William Wister Haines Jr. of San Diego.
