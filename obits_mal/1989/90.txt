        Sir Christopher Andrewes, a virologist who helped discover the influenza virus, died Saturday. He was 92 years old.
        Sir Christopher began his career as a pathologist, starting as an assistant resident physician at the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institution in New York City, where he stayed for two years.
        He decided to concentrate on virology, a field in which he spent nearly 40 years. In 1927, Sir Christopher joined the scientific staff of the Medical Research Council at Hampstead in North London. He worked with colleagues on the role of viruses in transmittable tumors in animals.
        In 1933, in collaboration with Wilson Smith and Sir Patrick Laidlaw, he carried out the successful transmission of influenza to ferrets. From 1946 to 1960 the virologists strove to isolate the virus in the laboratory.
        Shortly before Sir Christopher's retirement in 1961, a team he was part of isolated several viruses from patients with colds. From 1952 to 1961 he was deputy director of the National Institute for Medical Research.
        He was the author or co-author of several books on virology and in 1964 became a foreign associate of the National Academy of Science.
