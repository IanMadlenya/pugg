        Mr. Dell'Isola, who was born in Italy and emigrated to New York in the 1910's, began his musical career in vaudeville. He conducted the RKO orchestra in the 1920's and was a violinist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra for a decade.
        Mr. Dell'Isola's 20-year collaboration with Rodgers and Hammerstein began with a touring production of ''Oklahoma!'' in the mid-1940's. He was musical director of the long-running Broadway production of ''South Pacific,'' which opened in 1949, and he won a belated Grammy Award in 1987 for the show's cast album. His subsequent Broadway credits included ''Me and Juliet'' (1953) and ''Pipe Dream'' (1955), and he won a 1959 Tony Award for ''Flower Drum Song.'' Mr. Dell'Isola also worked with many musical productions at the Westbury Music Fair.
        He is survived by a son, Alfonso, of Babylon, L.I.; 11 grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.
