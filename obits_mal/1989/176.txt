        Daniel Curley, a novelist and short story writer, died Friday night of injuries suffered when he was struck by a car while vacationing in Tallahassee, Fla. He was 70 years old and lived in Urbana, Ill.
        Lieut. Duane West of the Tallahassee police said yesterday that Mr. Curley and his wife, Audrey, were trying to cross a thoroughfares when a car struck them.
        Mr. Curley suffered a broken neck and Mrs. Curley a broken ankle, the lieutenant said. The driver had the green light at the time of the accident, he added.
        Mr. Curley, a longtime professor of English at the University of Illinois in Urbana, won the Flannery O'Connor Award for Short Fiction with his 1985 collection ''Living With Snakes.'' One of his earlier books was ''That Marriage Bed of Procrustes'' (1957), and a New York Times reviewer greeted the sequel as proof that Mr. Curley was still ''making good stories out of bad marriages.''
        His novel ''Mummy,'' a tale of the mummies of Guanajauto, one of the great oddities of Mexico, appeared in 1987. His other novels included ''How Many Angels,'' published in 1958, and ''A Stone Man,'' published in 1964.
        Mr. Curley was a native of Massachusetts and held a degree from the University of Alabama. He taught English at a number of other universities before joining the faculty at Urbana.
        In addition to his wife, his survivors include four daughters, Sean Curley of Greensboro, N.C., Deirdre and Katrine Curley of Washington, D.C., and Aillinn Dannave of Urbana, and a stepdaughter, Kirsten Wasson of Madison, Wis.
