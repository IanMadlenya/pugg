        Aleksander W. Rudzinski, who in 1950 resigned as a high-ranking member of the Polish delegation at the United Nations to protest Soviet domination of his country, died Thursday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 89 years old.
        Dr. Rudzinski, who was counselor to the delegation, was granted asylum in the United States soon after stepping down. In resigning, he charged that Soviet pressure was stripping his homeland of liberty and diplomatic independence.
        ''Freedom has disappeared'' in Poland, he declared at the time, protesting in particular over what he said was Soviet control over of the United Nations delegation from Poland. Teacher at Columbia
        Dr. Rudzinski, who held Polish doctorates in law and philosophy, went on to teach and do research at Columbia University and to write on international affairs.
        He was a research associate at the university's School of International Affairs in 1958 and 1959 and a lecturer in government in its School of General Studies from 1956 to 1958.
        In addition, he was an associate in the University Seminar on the Problem of Peace from 1951 until his death and a research associate in what is now the Research Institute on International Change from 1962 to 1978.
        He also wrote articles and reviews for the American Journal of International Law and other publications. From 1950 to 1957 he was a research associate with the Free Europe Committee, Inc.
        Dr. Rudzinski was born in Cracow on March 4, 1900, and earned his doctorates at Jagiellonian University there in the 1920's. He practiced law in Cracow in the 1930's and went on to teach law there and in Lodz.
        In 1944 he was wounded while taking part in the Warsaw uprising against Nazi forces.
        He joined the Polish delegation in 1946 as an adviser, became counselor in 1948, and was sometimes its acting chief. After quitting he said he had never been a Communist.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Maria Rudzinski, who was also granted asylum in 1950.
