        Harold W. Zancanata, a scientist who developed some of the first rockets for testing the atmosphere, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Florida Medical Center. He was 70 years old.
        For more than 30 years, Mr. Zancanata developed rockets and launched them from sites that included Cape Canaveral in Florida and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
        ''He was the project officer responsible for instrumenting rockets used to study the physics and chemistry of the upper atmosphere,'' said William Dean, a retired Army mathematician who worked closely with Mr. Zancanata.
        In 1941 Mr. Zancanata joined the Army as a research scientist. In 1952 he combined a German V-2 rocket captured in World War II with a United States Corporal rocket and launched the missile 250 miles, a record at the time, said a son, Rodney Zancanata of Oakland Park, Fla.
        Mr. Zancanata and a team of scientists fired rockets in the early 1960's from Christmas and Johnson islands in the Pacific to study the effects of nuclear explosions on the atmosphere.
        Mr. Zancanata is survived by his wife, two sons, two daughters, a sister and four grandchildren.
