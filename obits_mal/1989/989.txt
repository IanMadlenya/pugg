        Dr. Lord, who received his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1936, was known for his research in applying spectroscopy to the solution of chemical and biological problems.
        He taught at Johns Hopkins and at the University of Michigan before joining the staff at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946. He held joint positions of professor of chemistry and director of the spectroscopy laboratory there until he retired in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Wilhelmina; four daughters, Diana Adam, of North Hollywood, Calif.; Susan Fowlkes, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; Margaret Adamwicz, of Holden, Mass., and Catherine, of Dallas, and three grandchildren.
