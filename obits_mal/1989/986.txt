        Mr. Loveless, a businessman, became the first Democratic Governor in Iowa in 18 years when he succeeded Leo Hoegh, a Republican. In 1960 he left office after losing a Senate race to Jack Miller, a Republican.
        In 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the Federal Renegotiation Board, which handled revisions of military contracts. He resigned in 1969, becoming a vice president for government affairs for the Chromalloy Corporation, an Iowa soft drink manufacturer. He retired in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, Amelia; two children and six grandchildren.
