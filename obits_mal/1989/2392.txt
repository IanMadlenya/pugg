        Huang Zhen, a former envoy to the United States who helped plan the 1972 visit of President Nixon, has died in Beijing, the official New China News Agency said today. He was 80 years old.  The agency did not give the cause of death.
        A native of eastern Anhui province who joined the Red Army in 1931 and the Communist Party in 1932, Mr. Huang was also a former Minister of Culture and Ambassador to France, Hungary and Indonesia.
        At the time of his death he was a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Commission, a prestigious body of retired party elders.
        His official biography said Mr. Huang met with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to prepare Mr. Nixon's visit, which began the process of warmer American-Chinese ties that led to the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1979.
        From 1973 to 1977, he headed China's liaison office in the United States.
        He also served as president of the China-U.S. People's Friendship Association.
        He was Ambassador to France from 1964 to 1973, although he was suspended from his post from 1967 to 1969 while being criticized by leftist radicals during the Cultural Revolution.
        The agency's report did not mention survivors or funeral arrangements.
