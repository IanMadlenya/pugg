        C. S. Harding Mott, who teamed with his father to develop and sustain what is now the nation's 12th largest charitable foundation, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 82 years old and had residences in Delray Beach, Fla., and Flint.
        Mr. Mott was chairman emeritus of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, based in Flint. The foundation was begun in 1926 by his father, Charles Stewart Mott, who served 60 years on the board of the General Motors Corporation and was once the company's largest individual shareholder.
        The foundation grew in 1963 when Harding Mott, an original trustee, persuaded his father to donate G.M. shares worth $129 million.
        When the elder Mr. Mott died in 1973 at the age of 97, the foundation received all but $1.3 million of his $43.3 million estate.
        Last year the foundation awarded grants totaling $34 million to projects mainly for community and individual improvement.
        Harding Mott graduated in 1931 from Yale University and served as a Mott Foundation vice president from 1944 to 1965, when he was named president. He became chairman in 1976 and chairman emeritus last year.
        Survivors include his wife, Isabel; a son, C. S. Harding Mott 2d, of Holly, Mich; a daughter, Claire M. White of Grand Blanc, Mich., a sister, Amee Mott Butler of St. Paul, and four grandchildren.
