        Charles T. Coiner, a painter and former art director of the N. W. Ayer Inc., advertising agency, died, apparently of natural causes, Sunday at home in Mechanicsville, Pa. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Coiner, who headed the Philadelphia-based agency's art operations for 30 years, was a vice president when he retired in 1964. He designed war and civilian defense posters in World War II, the red feather symbol for the charity drive that preceeded United Way and the Blue Eagle symbol of the National Recovery Act, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was one of the first art directors to seek out and commission fine modern artists and bring their work into the advertising market.
        Mr. Coiner's paintings, largely of landscapes, have been exhibited at the Whitney Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the Chicago Art Institute before joining Ayer in 1924.
        He was the first American to receive the Art Director's Award of Distinction. He was inducted into the Art Director's Hall of Fame in 1973 and the Philadelphia Advertising Hall of Fame in 1988.
        A native of Philadelphia, he was a former trustee of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and a former chairman of the Philadelphia College of Art.
        Mr. Coiner is survived by his wife, the former E. Mae Howe.
