        Arthur Rubine, a motion picture press agent who specialized in independently produced films, died of cancer Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Rubine worked on publicity, and in some cases marketing, for Federico Fellini's ''Amarcord,'' Louis Malle's ''Murmur of the Heart,'' Francois Truffaut's ''Small Change,'' Joseph Strick's ''Ulysses'' and ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man'' and Melvin Van Peebles's ''Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.''
        He organized the first festivals in the United States of Soviet and post-1949 Chinese films, and worked with Third World Cinema, which trained black, Latin and Asian film makers, and with the Henry Street Settlement House.
        He is survived by his wife, Merle; his sons, William and John, his mother, Rose, and two brothers, Stuart, of San Diego and George, of Suva, Fiji.
        A memorial service will be held tomorrow at the Riverside Chapel on Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street.
