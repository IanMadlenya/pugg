        Peter W. Hill, a tour guide who was among the 39 people held hostage in Lebanon after their Trans World Airways jumbo jet was hijacked by Shiite Moslem terrorists in 1985, died Monday in Plantation, Fla. He was 61 years old and suffered from cancer.
        Mr. Hill, a native of Bermuda, was a sales executive and tour guide for the Good News Travel Agency in Schaumburg, Ill. He was leading a group of Roman Catholic pilgrims on a trip to Israel when the T.W.A. flight was hijacked and forced to fly between Beirut and Algiers.
        Mr. Hill, held captive for 17 days, told interviewers after his release that his captors ''broke every rule in the Koran.'' He was kept in an unfinished basement without modern plumbing. During his ordeal, he used his 35-millimeter camera to take three dozen color photographs of his fellow hostages and their surroundings, which he later gave to the American authorities.
        Mr. Hill testified last year in Rome at the trial of the hijackers. He and the others were freed in exchange for 700 Lebanese prisoners held by Israel.
        His testimony included graphic descriptions of the murder of Robert Dean Stethem, a 23-year-old United States Navy diver.
        Mr. Hill is survived a son, Paul, of Boca Raton; two daughters, Roxanne Fliegenstan, of Cooper City, Fla., and Dr. Nina Hill, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
