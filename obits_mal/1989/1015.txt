        Eric Nord, a nightclub owner who provided a platform for counter-cultural performers, died of heart and kidney disease Wednesday at the Skyline Convalescent Home in San Jose, Calif. He was 69 years old and had lived for several years in nearby Los Gatos.
        In 1950 Mr. Nord, who was known as Big Daddy because of his height (6 feet 8 inches) and his weight (up to 400 pounds), opened the Hungry I nightclub in San Francisco. The club quickly became a showplace for comedians like Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl.
        Mr. Nord's given name was Harry Pastor. He was born in Krofeld, Germany. His father was a German industrialist and his mother a United States citizen. He and his family moved to California in his youth, and he later took the name Nord.
        He is survived by a son, Carl Pastor, of Kyoto, Japan; two daughters, Eve Brekenridge, of Calistoga, Calif., and Lynelle Pastor, of Oregon, three brothers and a sister.
