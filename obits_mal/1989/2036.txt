        Irvin Kovens, a Baltimore businessman and political fund-raiser who was convicted of mail fraud and racketeering with former Gov. Marvin Mandel and four others in 1977, died of congestive heart failure Tuesday at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Kovens, convicted of 15 counts of mail fraud and one count of racketeering, served six months of a three-year prison term. He was granted early release after undergoing five heart bypass operations while in custody.
        He and his co-defendants were convicted of conspiring to have Governor Mandell influence race track legislation in return for $380,000 in bribes. Mr. Mandell was accused of helping the five men get extra racing days for the Marlboro Race Track, which Mr. Kovens and four others secretly owned.
        The convictions were overturned in 1987 by a Federal judge.
        Mr. Kovens, a discount-furniture dealer, was a major sponsor of Mr. Mandel's political career. He helped to raise millions of dollars for Mr. Mandel's campaigns for governor in 1970 and 1974.
        Mr. Kovens, who lived in Baltimore and Bal Harbour, Fla., is survived by his wife, the former Jacqueline Hoffberger; two daughters, Louise Goodman of Owings Mills, Md., and Marjorie Pylant of Baltimore, and four grandchildren. A sister, Faye Adler of Baltimore, and a brother, Cal Kovens of Bal Harbour, also survive.
