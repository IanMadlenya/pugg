        During a long career as a practicing surgeon and teacher, Dr. Milgram emphasized the importance of early detection of orthopedic problems and preventive measures to avoid the need for surgery. He formally retired in 1966 but continued to treat patients, conduct research and teach at the institute.
        Dr. Milgram was a graduate of Columbia College and of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. During World War II he served as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps.
        In 1953 he assumed the newly created post of director of orthopedics at the Hospital for Joint Diseases. A research chair was named in his honor last December.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Altabelle Willard; two sons, Dr. James, of Chicago, and Dr. Robert, of Binghamton, N.Y.; a sister, Dr. Lillian Schapiro of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
