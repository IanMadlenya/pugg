He was president of the company until he moved to Florida in 1943 and remained vice president for research and development until 1951.
        He also founded Florida Chemical Research Inc. and developed food flavorings, insect repellents and a granular meat tenderizer. He also worked on inventions in other fields, including a three-dimensional chess game and an electronic piano.
        He was a member of the New York Academy of Science, the Humane Society of Sarasota County, Save Our Bays and the Sarasota Community Action Council.
