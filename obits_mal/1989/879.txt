        George (Specs) Toporcer, the first major league baseball player other than a pitcher to wear eyeglasses on the playing field, died Wednesday after a fall in his home in Huntington Station, L.I. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Toporcer, born and reared in the Yorkville section of Manhattan, went directly from sandlot baseball to major league competition. He played for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1921 through 1928. As a utility infielder whose career batting average was .279, he played 249 games at shortstop, 105 at second base, 95 at third base and 3 at first base.
        After his major league career, he played for Rochester of the International League on four straight pennant-winning teams from 1929 through 1932. He then managed teams in Rochester, Jersey City, Syracuse, Buffalo, Little Rock, Ark., and Albany. During the 1940's he was the director of minor league operations for the Boston Red Sox and also worked for the Chicago White Sox.
        In 1951, while managing Buffalo, he became blind after a fifth operation to save his failing eyesight was unsuccessful. He then turned to writing and lecturing on baseball and wrote an autobiography, ''Baseball - From Backlots to Big Leagues.''
        Mr. Toporcer is survived by his wife, Madeline; a brother, William, of Colden, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
