He also wrote the score for ''Love Me Tender,'' in which Elvis Presley made his film debut, and conducted the scores for ''Cleopatra,'' ''Planet of the Apes'' and ''The Omen.'' He shared the Academy Award with Lennie Hayton for the musical adaptation of Jerry Herman's score for ''Hello, Dolly!,'' the 1969 movie that starred Barbra Streisand. Played Piano for Mae West
        Mr. Newman was born Jan. 4, 1916, in New Haven and moved to Hollywood when he was a teen-ager. His first job was conducting for the Earl Carroll Vanities, where he met his wife, Beverly Carroll.
        He then worked as Mae West's piano player until he joined 20th Century-Fox in 1943 as a rehearsal pianist. He remained with Fox for more than 40 years. His first major hit was the song ''Again'' from the movie ''Roadhouse.''
        Mr. Newman, who in his later years at Fox oversaw the musical segments for motion pictures and television, resigned in 1985. Two years later he joined MGM-UA with similar responsibilities.
        Mr. Newman is survived by his wife, a brother, three sisters and three daughters.
