        Joseph Cardinal Malula, a leading Roman Catholic prelate in Africa who fought for church rights in Zaire, died today in Louvain, Belgium, after a long illness. He was 71 years old. Cardinal Malula, born in what was then the Belgian Congo, was appointed Archbishop of Kinshasa, the capital, in 1964. Five years later, Pope Paul VI elevated him to cardinal.
        In the early 1970's, President Mobutu Sese Seko began an Africanization program that tried to sharply curtail the power of the church. Baptismal names were banned, teaching of religion was abolished in all schools, and Catholic bishops were barred from holding meetings or traveling in the country.
        Joseph Malula protested, was denounced by President Mobutu, and went into exile in Rome after the Government closed his official residence.
        The restrictions imposed by the President proved unpopular and were gradually lifted. The Cardinal returned to the country, and the church and state began a reconciliation.
        Pope John Paul II, who has twice visited Zaire, sent a condolence message to the church in Zaire, praising the Cardinal's long service to the church.
