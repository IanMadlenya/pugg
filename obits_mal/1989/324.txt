        John L. O'Grady, the former managing director of sales and trading for Salomon Brothers Inc., died of a heart attack on Saturday while skiing with his family. He was 46 years old and lived in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., and Delray Beach, Fla.
        Mr. O'Grady was one of three Salomon executives who resigned together last October, capping a difficult year for the Wall Street securities firm that included the departure of a number of senior officers.
        Mr. O'Grady, along with E. Graig Coats Jr., who had led Salomon's government-bond department, and Ronald M. Stuart, the former head of mortgage-securities trading for the firm, continued working with investments from an office in Greenwich, Conn.
        Mr. O'Grady was born in Indianapolis in 1942 and graduated from the University of Dayton. He spent his entire investment career with Salomon Brothers until last year, spending 10 years in the company's Chicago office before being transferred to New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Leeda; a daughter, Christine, and a son, Michael, both of Mt. Kisco; a brother, Jeremiah, of New York and Philadelphia, and a sister, Mary Nicodemas of Indianapolis.
