        Mr. Livingston's wife, Rosalie, said she found her husband after he collapsed near the doorway of their farmhouse in Pipersville, 35 miles north of Philadelphia. Mr. Livingston was taken to at Doylestown Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A hospital spokeswoman today declined to give any details of his death.

        Mr. Livingston started his column in 1945 and used The Inquirer as his base from 1972 until his death. He had been financial editor of The Philadelphia Bulletin and of The Philadelphia Record, both now defunct.
        He won his Pulitzer in 1964 for a series of articles, ''The Power Pull of the Dollar,'' in which he described how Communist countries were being pulled toward the West by a variety of economic forces.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a a daughter, Patricia Herban, and a grandson.
