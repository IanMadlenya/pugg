        Paul Jasperson, who sued a nail salon two years ago, contending that he was refused a pedicure there because he suffered from AIDS, died of the disease on May 15. He was 37 years old.
        Mr. Jasperson filed suit against Jessica's Nail Salon in January 1987, contending that the business violated a West Hollywood ordinance that prohibited discrimination against people with AIDS. A court found the salon did refuse the pedicure, but refused to issue an injunction barring such action.
        Mr. Jasperson is survived by his parents and two brothers.
