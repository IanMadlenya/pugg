        Mr. Nielsen, a native of Cleveland, was a precious metals researcher who helped to develop several alloys for dental work. In 1947, he left Phillips Laboratory to become professor and chairman of the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Sciences at New York University. In 1973, the engineering faculty of N.Y.U. merged with that of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York. In 1975, Mr. Nielsen was named adjunct professor of Dental Materials Science and in 1976, he became professor emeritus.
        A widower, he has no immediate survivors.
