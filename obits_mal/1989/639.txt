        Charles Vanel, a craggy-faced actor with a piercing gaze who appeared in more than 200 movies, died today in a Cannes hospital. He was 96 years old.
        Mr. Vanel was hospitalized in Cannes on Friday night after complaining of weakness, friends said. He died at 12:45 A.M. ''of his advanced age,'' the hospital said.
        During his 76-year film career, which began in 1912, he worked with some of the industry's finest directors, including Alfred Hitchcock, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Feyder and Henri-Georges Clouzot.
        Mr. Hitchcock cast Mr. Vanel in 1954 as a policeman on the trail of Cary Grant in ''To Catch a Thief.''
        The year before, Mr. Vanel won the best actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival for Mr. Clouzot's 1953 classic ''The Wages of Fear.''
        Mr. Vanel was born to a seafaring family in Rennes, France, on Aug. 21, 1892. He wanted to be a naval officer, but problems with his eyes forced him to give up the idea of going to sea.
        Moving to Paris with his family in 1904, he discovered the theater and at 16 made his first appearance on stage in ''Hamlet.''
        His career included silent movies and television roles in the 1960's and 1970's. His last film was Jean-Pierre Mocky's ''The Seasons of Pleasure'' in 1988.
        In an interview with a Swiss newspaper in 1986, Mr. Vanel said: ''You know, in our profession, there is no end. As long as one has the strength to do it, you can act.''
        For the last 20 years, he lived in the south of France near Cannes with his wife, Arlette.
