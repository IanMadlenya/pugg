        A 1924 graduate of St. Lawrence University's Brooklyn Law School, Judge Horn was in private practice until 1939 when he was appointed a city magistrate in Queens by Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. He served as a judge of the traffic court before being named to the New York State Family Court bench in 1962 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner. Judge Horn retired in 1969. In the 1950's he was the first New York City magistrate to allow the use of skid marks to determine the speed of a car, to sentence first offenders convicted of drunk driving to jail time and to allow the use of Drunkometer test results as evidence of intoxication.
        He was a founder and president of the Jamaica Estates Association and president of the Central Queens Allied Civic Council. He also helped organize the 1939 World's Fair.
        His wife, the former Margaret Boyle, died in 1981. He is survived by two daughters, Patricia M. Brown, of Pittsfield, Mass., and Nancy P. Kaelin, of Fairfield, Conn.; a son, Donald, of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I.; 12 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
