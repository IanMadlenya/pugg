        Marc Daniels, who directed the first 38 episodes of the ''I Love Lucy'' television series, died Sunday of congestive heart failure at St. John's Medical Center. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Daniels and the cinematographer Karl Freund pioneered the use of three cameras rather than one in filming ''I Love Lucy.'' The system allows a show to be filmed continuously and in sequence in front of an audience as though it were a stage play. The three-camera setup is still widely used.
        Mr. Daniels also worked on ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Bonanza,'' ''Star Trek'' and ''Hogan's Heroes.''
        He recalled in a 1977 interview that he left ''I Love Lucy'' in 1952 after only one season to take another job that paid more. ''Maybe it was a stupid thing to do,'' he said. ''But then we didn't know we were creating history. We were just doing a show.''
        Mr. Daniels began his television career in 1948 as director of ''The Ford Theater'' on CBS. During his career he was nominated for three Emmys and three Directors Guild of America awards.
        His stage credits included the musicals ''Phoenix 55'' and ''Copper and Brass'' (1957) and the comedy ''36'' in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Emily, three children, a brother and a sister.
