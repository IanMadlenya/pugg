        Nathan Messner, a former president of the United Hatters, Cap and Millinery Workers, died of a heart attack Wednesday at Beekman-Downtown Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Messner, who began work in hat factories in the 20's as a teen-ager newly arrived from Europe, became a shop steward in the union and, shortly after World War II, became the union's president.
        He was forced to resign after a few years because he refused to sign a loyalty oath required under Federal legislation. He opened a store offering handmade hats in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, which he maintained until his retirement in 1973.
        Mr. Messner is survived by two daughters, Hattie Wiener of Manhattan and Michele Kaufman of Las Vegas, Nev.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
