        Floyd Dreyer, who developed the first magnesium wheels for race cars and built miniature race cars for children, died Saturday in his home. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Dreyer, a native of Chillicothe, Ohio, came to Indianapolis in the 1920's to work for August Duesenberg, a carmaker, as a welder after racing motorcycles for the Indian Motorcycle Company of Springfield, Mass.
        In the early 1920's he developed a sidecar linking mechanism that allowed the car to lean with the motorcycle. Later that decade, he helped build a car that set a land speed record at Daytona, Fla.
