        Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder, chairman of the giant West German conglomerate Veba A.G. and one of his country's most prominent executives, died of pneumonia Oct. 28 in Dusseldorf, West Germany.
        Mr. von Bennigsen's death was announced by Huls America, a chemicals unit of Veba, from its headquarters in Piscataway, N.J. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. von Bennigsen was chairman of the board of Veba, which has its headquarters in Dusseldorf, for 18 years. Formerly Government-owned, it has sales of more than $20 billion a year, making it one of the largest companies in West Germany. It has 84,000 employees and operations in the oil, electrical-power and chemicals industries and in other fields.
        A strong-willed figure, Mr. von Bennigsen was sometimes known as the Bismarck of West German industry.
        He was particularly active in acquisitions recently and had come to leave much decision-making in the hands of executives of Veba subsidiaries.
        Early this year the Bush Administration gave its approval to the acquisition, by a subsidiary of Veba, of the Monsanto Company's semiconductor subsidiary.
        Mr. von Bennigsen was born July 2, 1926, in Berlin, the son of Rudolf von Bennigsen-Foerder, a lawyer and corporate director, and the former Margarethe Welt.
        Mr. von Bennigsen studied law at the universities of Erlangen and Bonn in West Germany and in Geneva and was an official of the West German Finance Ministry before joining Veba in 1959. He joined the Veba board in 1968.  He married Johanna Wirmer in 1955.
