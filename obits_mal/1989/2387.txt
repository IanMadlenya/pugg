        Doug Scovil, the coach credited with developing Randall Cunningham into the starting quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles, died of a heart attack today at Veterans Stadium. He was 62 years old.
        He had apparently just finished his daily workout on a stationary bike and had taken a few steps when he fell to the floor in the team's training room, the Eagles said.
        In 1986, his first season with the Eagles, he was credited with playing a vital role in the development of Cunningham, then a second-year player, correcting a hitch in the player's delivery and overseeing his progression from to a starter.
        Mr. Scovil served as the football coach from 1981 to 1985 at San Diego State University, where he compiled an overall record of 24-32-3. In four of the previous five years, he was offensive coordinator at Brigham Young University.
        He is survived by his wife, Enid, and three children.
