        The Rev. Dr. John Wesley Lord, a retired bishop of the United Methodist Church who was active in the civil rights movement and in the racial integration of his church, died Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, at Huggins Hospital in Wolfeboro, N.H. He was 87 years old and lived in Wolfeboro and Lakeland, Fla.
        Dr. Lord took part in many civil rights protests, including a Selma-to-Montgomery, Ala., march in 1965 with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He also pressed for reform in the penal system and opposed American involvement in Vietnam, the bombing of Hanoi and nuclear weapons tests.
        He presided over the church's Boston area from 1948 to 1960 and over its Washington area from 1960 until 1972. He was a native of Paterson, N.J., and studied at Montclair (N.J.) State College, Dickinson College, Drew Theological Seminary, the University of Edinburgh and Rutgers.
        His early New Jersey assignments included Emory Methodist Church in Jersey City, the Union Community Church in Union and the First Methodist Churches in Arlington and Westfield.
        Surviving are Dr. Lord's wife, Margaret; a daughter, Jean Cooper of West Lafayette, Ind., and two grandchildren.
        His son-in-law, Arnold Cooper, said that shortly before he died, he wrote that he had ''lived 87 years, died briefly and lives on.'' Earlier, Dr. Lord wrote, ''In a long and arduous career, I was sustained by the thought that the work was not mine to finish, nor was I free to take no part in it.''
