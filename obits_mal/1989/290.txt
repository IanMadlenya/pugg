        Sandor Weores, Hungary's leading poet, who had been nominated several times for the Nobel Prize for Literature, died in Budapest on Jan. 22. He was 75 years old.
        Word of Mr. Weores's death was received here by William Jay Smith, one of his American translators.
        For seven years, beginning in 1949, Mr. Weores's work was banned in Hungary, except for his translations and children's stories. His return to literary life was marked by ''The Well of Fire,'' published in 1964.
        A selection of his poetry, ''Eternal Movement,'' was recently published in the United States by New Rivers Press. When he visited this country in 1977, he gave readings at the Guggenheim Museum in New York and at the Library of Congress.
