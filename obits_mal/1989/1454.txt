        Dr. Joseph C. Addonizio, a urologist who was chairman of the department of urology at the New York Medical College and president of the New York Academy of Medicine, died of heart failure Sunday at the Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 59 years old and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.
        Dr. Addonizio was elected president of the academy in January after having served as chairman of its section on urology and as a trustee. He presided over a major restructuring of the academy, to which he was elected as a fellow in 1979.

He joined the New York Medical College staff in 1960 after two years in the Army Medical Corps and became chairman of the urology department in 1981. He was also director of the division of urology at the Westchester County Medical Center.
        Dr. Addonizio is survived by his wife, the former Annabelle Briglia; two sons, Joseph Jr., of Southbury, Conn., and Gregory, of Half Moon Bay, Calif.; four daughters, Kathleen Halek of Brookfield, Conn., Susan Diskin of Carmel, N.Y., Maria Seisdedos of Hawthorne, N.Y., and Dawn, of San Jose, Calif.; a sister, Carmella, of Mount Vernon, and four grandchildren.
