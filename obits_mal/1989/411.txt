        Claude E. ZoBell, a marine microbiologist who discovered living organisms at extreme ocean depths, died Monday at Scripps Memorial Hospital. He was 84 years old.
        Dr. ZoBell is credited with discovering 65 species of ocean bacteria.
        Since 1972 Dr. ZoBell had been a professor emeritus at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. He was the first researcher to recover and cultivate living organisms from ocean depths greater than 20,000 feet, said George Somero, chairman of the marine biology research division of Scripps.
        Dr. ZoBell, who joined Scripps in 1932, published nearly 300 scientific papers and one textbook. He founded the international Geomicrobiology Journal in 1976 and served as its editor until 1981.
        Survivors include his wife, Jean, also a microbiologist; 2 sons, 11 grandchildren and 12 greatgrandchildren.
