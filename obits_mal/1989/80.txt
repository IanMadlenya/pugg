        Mr. Ridder led The Mercury News from 1952 to 1977, a time in which San Jose's population and affluence exploded a result of the rise of the computer industry in the San Jose area. Under him the paper aggressively promoted expansion and business development, which, coupled with Mr. Ridder's own political influence, made him a powerful force in the San Francisco Bay area.
        Born in Manhattan, into one of the nation's prominent publishing families, Mr. Ridder entered the business on the Aberdeen (S. Dak.) American News. In 1974 Ridder Publications merged with Knight Newspapers Inc., creating the Knight-Ridder group.
        Mr. Ridder retired as publisher in 1977 and as president of The Mercury News until 1979. He was a graduate of the College of William and Mary.
        He was a former member of the board of regents of Santa Clara University, a former executive vice president of the San Jose Music and Arts Foundation and a former board member of a number of other civic organizations in San Jose.
        Mr. Ridder, who was divorced, is survived by two brothers, Daniel, of LongBeach, Calif., and Bernard, a former chairman of Knight-Ridder Inc., of St. Paul.
