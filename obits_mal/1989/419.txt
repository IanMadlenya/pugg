        Mr. Barthe was once a familiar figure in the art world in New York, where he did several public works, among them a bust of Booker T. Washington, the black educator, for the Hall of Fame on the campus of what is now Bronx Community College. In 1937, he made sculptures and bas-reliefs for the Harlem River Housing Project at 151st Street and Harlem River Drive. A Native of Mississippi
        Mr. Barthe, who was born in Bay St. Louis, Miss., on Jan. 28, 1901, studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. He turned to sculpture early in his career, and his varied subjects included workmen, farmers, children, African warriors and Hindu temple dancers. He did a sculpture of the American eagle that stands in front of the Social Security Building in Washington, and he also made portrait busts of such stage personalities as Katherine Cornell, Sir John Gielgud, Maurice Evans and Gypsy Rose Lee.
        In 1953, Mr. Barthe completed - for the city of Port-au-Prince in Haiti - a 40-foot equestrian statue of Jean Jacques Dessalines, leader of the 1804 revolt that wrested control of the former French colony from Napoleon's armies. He also designed several Haitian coins that are still in use. In the last decade, much of his work was donated to Tustin University in Mississippi by a friend, the actor James Garner.
