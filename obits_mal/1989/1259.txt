        Ronald Bishop, who designed Britain's wooden Mosquito bomber in World War II and the Comet jetliner shortly after the war, died Sunday, his family announced. He was 86 years old. No cause of death was given.
        Mr. Bishop joined the De Havilland company when he was 18 and worked his way through the metal, fitting and engine workshops before entering the drawing office in 1923.
        The Air Ministry rejected his idea for a fast bomber built of wood a year before the war began. But Mr. Bishop and the company built it anyway and the DH-98 Mosquito, the ''Wooden Wonder,'' became one of the most versatile military planes ever built for day and night fighting, bombing and photographic reconnaissance.
