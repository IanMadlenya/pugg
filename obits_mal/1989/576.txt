        Edward Powers, the F.B.I. agent who helped solve the $2.2 million Brinks armored car robbery in 1950, died Tuesday. Mr. Powers, who was later chosen for his law-enforcement background to manage the first modern American lottery, was 75 years old.
        Mr. Powers died in Fort Myers, Fla., where he moved in 1978 after retiring as director of the New Hampshire lottery. He had undergone bypass surgery in 1979 and last year.
        The ''Handbook of U.S. Lottery Fundamentals,'' a reference manual, recognizes Mr. Powers as the ''father of U.S. lotteries.''
        As head of the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Powers spent six years trying to solve the Brinks case. The break came when one of the holdup men informed on the others because he felt he had not received his fair share of the loot.
        In 1963, after 22 years with the bureau, he was hired to manage the New Hampshire lottery because its sponsors wanted to prove it could be run without the influence of organized crime.
        Survivors include his wife, Melva, two daughters and a son.
