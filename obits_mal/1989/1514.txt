        The Rev. Kenneth R. May, retired bishop of the Western Pennsylvania-West Virginia Synod of the former Lutheran Church in America, died of complications from an aortic aneurysm Friday. He was 65 years old and lived in McCandless, Pa.
        In the mid-1980's Bishop May and his church were challenged by the Denominational Ministry Strategy, an advocacy group for the unemployed in the region. He ordered two pastors who were active in the movement to give up their pulpits after they charged that the bishop was the tool of moneyed intersts.
        He headed the 151,000-member synod from 1974 to 1987, retiring when the Lutheran Church in America and the American Evangelical Lutheran Church merged to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Donald, of Ann Arbor, Mich; two daughters, Barbara Collins of North Huntingdon, Pa., and Catharine May of Erie, Pa., a sister and a grandchild.
