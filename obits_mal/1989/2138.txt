        Benigno Zaccagnini, who headed Italy's dominant Christian Democratic Party during its brief ''historic compromise'' with the Communists in the 1970's, died today. He was 77 years old.
        Dr. Zaccagnini, a physician whose political career spanned five decades and peaked during one of the country's most volatile postwar periods, died in a Ravenna hospital after suffering a heart attack.
        Born in Ravenna on April 7, 1912, he was elected to Parliament for the first time in 1948. He was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies nine consecutive times and elected to the Senate in 1983.
        He served as secretary of the Christian Democrats from 1975 to 1980, replacing Amintore Fanfani as party chief after the Communists made strong gains in regional and municipal elections.
        In 1976, the Communists drew almost even with the Christian Democrats in national elections, opening the way for the arrangement in which the Communists were given a voice in policy-making but no Cabinet posts.
        Dr. Zaccagnini continued to be an influential member of the Christian Democrats until his death, leading a leftist faction of the party.
        His medical specialty was pediatrics. He served as a medical officer on the Balkan front for two years in World War II.
