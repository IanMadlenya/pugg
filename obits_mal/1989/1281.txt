        Harry Worth, a comedian who had his own popular BBC television series in the 1960's, died of cancer on Thursday. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Worth was born near the coal mining town of Barnsley in northern England, the youngest of 11 children. He began work in the mines at age 14, but decided it was not for him. He broke into show business as a ventriloquist, but soon switched to a one-man comedy routine.
        In television, he made 104 situation comedy shows, starting with a series called ''Here's Harry.''
        Mr. Worth is survived by his wife, Kay.
