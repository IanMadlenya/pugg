        Stephen Sell, executive director of the Philadelphia Orchestra since 1982, died of lung cancer Friday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 47 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        A native of Newark, Mr. Sell received a degree in piano and composition at Rutgers University and started his career as an orchestra executive in 1964 as an intern with the Cleveland Orchestra. He was executive vice president of the Atlanta Symphony from 1978 until Seymour Rosen, his predecessor in Philadelphia, left that post.
        Riccardo Muti, the Philadelphia Orchestra's music director, called Mr. Sell's death a ''tremendous loss.''
        ''He always worked with enthusiasm, intensity and skill,'' Mr. Muti said. ''His presence was of great help in the innovation and modernization of the entire organization.''
        Mr. Sell held administrative positions at Carnegie Hall and with the Pittsburgh Symphony before he became general manager of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in 1969. He became director of the special-projects program at the National Endowment for the Arts in 1973. From 1975 until his move to Atlanta, he was executive director of the Minnesota State Arts Board in Minneapolis.
        Mr. Sell is survived by his wife, Gianne P. Conard; two children, Lisa Sell and Jesse Sell of St. Paul; his mother, Rose Sell of Long Branch, N.J., and a sister, Nancy Sell Byron of Monmouth Beach, N.J.
