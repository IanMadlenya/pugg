        Thomas Anthony Nochese, president of District Council 9 of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades, died Wednesday, apparently of heart failure, at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, a union spokesman said. An autopsy is being performed.
        The 76-year-old painter was brought up in an orphanage and lived most of his life in Brooklyn. He went to sea at the age of 14 and became involved with members of the International Workers of the World, a radical labor organization. Influenced by the ''Wobblies,'' he returned to Brooklyn and joined the painter's union in 1933. A rank-and-file worker, he was elected council president in 1977 at age 65 and held the post until his death.
        Mr. Nochese is survived by his wife, the former Yolanda Ramos, and a daughter, Christine Nochese of Manhattan.
        Correction:  June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary on Saturday about the president of District Council 9 of the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades misidentified him and a daughter. He was Thomas Anthony Noschese; his daughter is Christine Noschese.
