        Leonard Horowitz, an industrial designer who helped transform Miami Beach's Art Deco District into a pastel of rainbow colors and renovated beachfront hotels, died of complications of AIDS on Friday. He was 43 years old.
        He had a design firm in Manhattan in the 1970's when he moved to Miami Beach. In 1976, with Barbara Capitman, he founded the Miami Design Preservation League.
        As many as 150 Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach sparkle in hues of peach and periwinkle, purple and pink; about half of those are of Mr. Horowitz's design.
