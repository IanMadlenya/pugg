        Mr. Gethers wrote made-for-television films and mini-series, including ''Golda'' in 1982, which starred Ingrid Bergman as Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel, and last year's ''Mercy or Murder'' starring Robert Young in a drama about mercy killing. In 1977, Mr. Gethers's script for ''Circle of Children'' was voted outstanding teleplay by the Writers Guild of America.
        Mr. Gethers also contributed to weekly situation-comedy programs, including ''The Farmer's Daughter'' and ''The Bing Crosby Show.'' One of his plays, ''A Cook for Mr. General,'' was produced on Broadway in 1961; two others were performed in summer stock.
        Mr. Gethers is survived by his wife, Judy; two sons, Eric, of Hollywood, and Peter, of New York, and a brother, George, of Swampscott, Mass.
