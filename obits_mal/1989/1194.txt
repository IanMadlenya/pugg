        Mr. Sweetser, a native of St. Louis and a graduate of Yale University, won the United States Amateur championship in 1922 at the age of 20. Four years later, at Muirfield, Scotland, he won the British Amateur even though he was weakened by influenza.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia Lee; a daughter, Betty Sweetser Dodds of Encinitas, Calif., and two sons, Jesse W. Sweetser Jr. of La Brea, Calif., and Charles R. Sweetser of Escondido, Calif.
