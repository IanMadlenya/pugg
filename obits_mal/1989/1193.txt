        Erno Balogh, a pianist, composer and author, died Friday at a retirement home in Mitchellville, Md., where he lived. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Balogh, who was born in Budapest on April 4, 1897, studied piano and composition with Bela Bartok and Zoltan Kodaly, and retained his contacts with the two Hungarian composers after he moved to New York in 1924. He helped arrange Bartok's first American tour, in 1927.
        During his early years in New York, Mr. Balogh worked as an accompanist for the violinist Fritz Kreisler and the soprano Lotte Lehmann, and performed frequently as a recitalist and in radio concerts. His interpretations of Baroque and Classic composers -particularly Scarlatti, Haydn and Mozart - were highly regarded, but he also built a strong reputation as an advocate of contemporary composers.
        In addition to performing and composing, Mr. Balogh wrote a play, ''$25 an Hour,'' that was produced on Broadway in 1933.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Malvina Schweitzer.
