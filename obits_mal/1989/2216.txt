        James Franklin Beard, a professor of English and a leading authority on the American author James Fenimore Cooper, died of congestive heart failure Thursday at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Mass. He was 70 years old and lived in Worcester.
        Mr. Beard joined the faculty at Clark University in Worcester in 1955, after having taught English at Princeton University, where he received his doctorate, and at Dartmouth College. He was named a professor at Clark in 1962 and was chairman of the English department from 1980 to 1985.
        He spent more than 35 years researching and writing about Cooper, including a six-volume work ''The Letters and Journals of James Fenimore Cooper.'' At his death, he was editor in chief of the first authoritative edition of Cooper's writings, an undertaking involving more than 20 scholars and the publication, by the State University of New York Press, of the initial 14 volumes of the ''Cooper Edition.''
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor, and two daughters, Anne S. Greene, of Boylston, Mass., and Mary W. Beard, of West Hartford, Conn.
