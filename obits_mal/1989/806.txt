       Louis Soriano, the originator and leader of the Brooklyn Dodger Sym-Phony, a light-hearted band of nonunion musicians who serenaded the Dodgers and musically harassed their opponents at Ebbets Field from 1938 until 1957, died Saturday at his home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. He was 84 years old.
        Louis Soriano, the originator and leader of the Brooklyn Dodger Sym-Phony, a light-hearted band of nonunion musicians who serenaded the Dodgers and musically harassed their opponents at Ebbets Field from 1938 until 1957, died Saturday at his home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Soriano, a civilian driver for the First Army on Governors Island until illness forced his retirement, banged at a snare drum and led a half dozen self-taught music makers up and down aisles between innings. The group was a vital part of the ''Dem Bums'' tradition, augmented by Hilda Chester's cowbell and Eddie Bottan's police whistle.
        Mr. Soriano's most cherished possession was a plaque presented to him by the Brooklyn Dodgers organization before it became the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1958. He was offered as much as $7,000 for the keepsake, but turned it down. Asked if he held on to it for sentimental reasons, he explained,''Nah, I'm holding out for $10,000.''
        Survivors include three sons: Armand and Philip of Floral Park, L.I., and Frank of Toms River, N.J.; three daughters: Florence Palmisano of Richmond Hill, Queens, Mary Korceniewski of Brooklyn, and Theresa Coraci of Albertson, L.I.; and 13 grandchildren.
