        Dr. Whitridge, a 1913 graduate of Yale who received a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1925, was an assistant professor of English at Columbia from 1921 to 1932. He was professor of history at Yale and master of Calhoun College there from 1932 to 1942. From 1949 to 1951 he was Fulbright Professor of American Civilization at the University of Athens.
        Dr. Whitridge, who was a grandson of the poet Matthew Arnold, wrote a number of articles and books, among them '''Critical Ventures in Modern French Literature,'' published by Charles Scribner & Sons in 1924; ''Dr. Arnold of Rugby,'' Henry Holt & Company, 1926; ''Alfred de Vigny,'' Oxford University Press, 1933; ''Men in Crisis,'' Charles Scribner & Sons, 1949; ''Simon Bolivar'' and ''No Compromise,'' Farrar, Straus & Cudahy, 1960, and ''Rochambeau,'' Macmillan Company, 1965.
        At the outbreak of World War I, Dr. Whitridge, a student at Oxford University, joined the British Royal Field Artillery. He was awarded the British Military Cross for gallantry. He returned to New York and in 1917 joined the Army when the United States entered the war.
        In 1942, after the United States entered World War II, he resigned from Yale and served as a colonel with the Army Air Corps in Europe, Africa and India.
        He was a trustee for many years of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Society Library and St. Luke's Hospital. He was also president of the Municipal Art Commission from 1955 to 1967.
