        Charles S. Scott Sr., an attorney who helped integrate public schools nationwide by bringing suit in the landmark Brown versus Topeka Board of Education case, died Friday. He was 67.
        In 1951, Mr. Scott, his brother John and Charles Bledsoe sued the Topeka Board of Education in Federal District Court on behalf of Linda Brown, a black elementary school student.
        The case was later appealed to the Supreme Court, which declared on May 17, 1954, that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
        Mr. Scott also filed suit to integrate South Park High School in Merriam, Kan., and he and his brother pressed several public-accommodation suits that gained black residents of Topeka and other cities in Kansas access to swimming pools, theaters and restaurants.
        The Scotts' law firm represented the Congress of Racial Equality during the civil rights movement in the 1960's. John Scott has since died, as has Mr. Bledsoe.
        Mr. Scott was born April 15, 1921, in Topeka. He received a law degree from Washburn University in 1948. From 1972 to 1975, Mr. Scott served as general counsel for the Kansas Commission on Civil Rights. He had been a hearing examiner for the commission since 1975.
        Survivors include his wife, Louise Crawford; a son, and a daughter.
