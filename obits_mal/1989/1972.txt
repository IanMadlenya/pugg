        Mr. Smith, who joined Time in 1946, was assistant managing editor of Fortune in 1955, when he conceived the ''500'' listing, which became an annual feature of the magazine.
        He went on to become managing editor of Architectural Forum, another Time publication, and in 1962 he was named vice president of Time-Life Broadcasting. After the broadcasting stations were sold, he laid the groundwork for Time's entry into cable television. He retired in 1975 but remained a consultant to the company until 1987.
        Mr. Smith was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Princeton. In World War II, he was a field artillery captain in the Army and was awarded a Croix de Guerre by France. In the Korean War, he was recalled to serve with the Army's Counterintelligence Corps.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Love; four daughters, Suzanne Talbott, of Marietta, Ga., Marthe Morris, of Manhattan, and Deborah Corrigan and Elizabeth Gianis, both of Morristown, and nine grandchildren.
