        Mr. Barzman began writing for the movies in 1943. Among the films he wrote or co-wrote are ''The Boy With Green Hair'' (1948), ''He Who Must Die'' (1956), ''The Visit'' (1964), ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (1964) and ''The Heroes of Telemark'' (1965).
        He did not receive screen credit for some of his films because of the blacklist aimed at writers accused of being communists, according to his wife, Norma.
        Mr. Barzman moved in 1949 to London, where his movie ''Christ in Concrete'' was being filmed. The film won awards at several European festivals.
        The Canadian-born writer's United States citizenship was revoked in 1954. Although it was restored nine years later, Mr. Barzman and his wife and seven children remained abroad until 1976. During that time he wrote novels and French and Italian films.
        The Cinematheque in Paris presented a retrospective of his films in 1982, and he was named an officer in the Order of Arts and Letters in 1985.
        In addition to his wife and children, he is survived by five grandchildren.
