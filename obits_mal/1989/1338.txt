After three years as a cantor in Reading, Pa., he joined the congregation in Newark in 1943. A founder of the Cantors Assembly of America, he made several recordings of sacred music. He retired from his cantoral post in 1978 and from the Seton Hall faculty in 1979.
        Mr. Mills is survived by his wife, the former Gerda Kreitler; a son, David, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Miriam, of Lawrenceville, N.J.; a sister, Nellie Lilienthal of Haifa, Israel, and one grandchild.
