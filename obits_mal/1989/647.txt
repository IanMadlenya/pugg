        Dominic Olejniczak, who served as the Green Bay Packers' president for 24 years, died of complications from a series of strokes Saturday at his home here. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Olejniczak was president of the National Football League team from 1958 to 1982. He was Mayor of Green Bay from 1945 to 1955.
        When he took over the Packer presidency the team had not had a winning record in 10 years.
        Mr. Olejniczak headed the search committee that brought Vince Lombardi to Green Bay as coach and general manager. The decision led to the most successful era in the team's history as Mr. Lombardi led the Packers to five championships.
        Mr. Olejniczak is survived by two sons, Thomas and Mark, of Green Bay.
