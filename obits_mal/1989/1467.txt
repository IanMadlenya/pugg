        Mr. Constable, who was distantly related to the British artist, was the son of a country parson in Australia. He studied painting in London, but returned to Australia and turned to set and costume designing. His original design for the Australian ballet ''Terra Australis'' is in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1959 he designed the sets for Noel Coward's only ballet, ''London Morning.'' He also designed the original production of Eugene Goossens's opera ''Judith,'' which starred a then-unknown young Australian soprano, Joan Sutherland.
        Mr. Constable also worked as art director on some 20 films, both in Australia and Britain. In the 1970's he once again returned to painting and devoted his last years to art.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Sophy Lambert; two sons by an earlier marriage, Barry of Sydney, and William Jr. of Perth; a daughter, Mrs. Paul Winter of Newbury, England and nine grandchildren.
