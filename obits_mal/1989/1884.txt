        Dr. Richard Sterba, a psychoanalyst who was a disciple of Sigmund Freud and practiced for nearly 50 years in Detroit, died Tuesday at his home in Grosse Pointe, Mich. He was 91 years old.
        Dr. Sterba, a native of Vienna, was a member of the first graduating class at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute in 1924. In 1936 he was invited to present a paper at the Berlin Institute of Psychotherapy, which had become Nazi-dominated after the rise of Hitler. As one of the few non-Jewish graduates of Vienna Psychoanalytic, he refused unless a Jewish colleague was invited first.
        After the Nazis took over Austria in 1938, Dr. Sterba escaped with his family and reached the United States, where he resumed his practice in Detroit in 1939.
        An accomplished violinist and an art collector, Dr. Sterba specialized in the psychoanalytic study of artists, publishing biographies of Beethoven and Michelangelo. He continued to write for the International Journal of Psychoanalysis until his death.
        Surviving are two daughters, Monica Schneider of Penzance, England, and Verena Michels of Scarsdale, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
