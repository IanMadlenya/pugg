        Father Oddo, returning from a trustees meeting at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind., was killed on his way home from the airport when his car collided with a trailer.
        Father Otto, born in New York City, had been president of the University of Portland since June 1982. He came to the school from Stonehill College in North Easton, Mass., where he was an assistant professor of religious studies.
        He was active in organizations studying the ordination of women and had been a national officer of Dignity, an organization promoting acceptance of homosexuals in the Catholic Church.
        In addition to Notre Dame, he served as a trustee at Stonehill College and St. Edward's University in Austin, Tex. He was ordained in April 1970.
        Father Oddo received bachelor's and master's degrees at Notre Dame and a doctorate in theology at Harvard University.
        He is survived by his mother, Catherine Oddo of Pompano Beach, Fla., and a sister, Mary Lynne Gonzales, of Margate, Fla.
