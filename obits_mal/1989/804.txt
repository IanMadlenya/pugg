        Joseph L. Muscarelle, the founder and chairman of one of New Jersey's largest construction concerns, the Joseph Muscarelle Construction Company of Maywood, died Sunday at Hackensack (N.J.) Medical Center after surgery for an aneurysm. He was 85 years old and lived in Hackensack.
        Mr. Muscarelle began the company in 1926, doing alterations with the help of another carpenter. Today the company employs about 1,000 people and builds about $50 million in malls and office buildings each year. Its clients include the Prudential Life Insurance Company, the Sony Corporation, The Rouse Company, I.B.M., the Ford Motor Company and American Cyanamid. Its projects included the Woodbridge and Paramus Park malls and Essex County College.
        Mr. Muscarelle was also a philanthropist, who donated the money for a center for building-construction studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University and for a museum building at the College of William and Mary.
        He had served as president of the Master Builders Association of Bergen County and as a trustee of the Building Contractors Association of New Jersey, of Bergen Community College, Hackensack Hospital and Columbus Hospital in Newark. He was president of a family foundation that has awarded more than 200 scholarships since its creation in 1958.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a son, Joseph Jr., of Saddle River, N.J.; two daughters, Carole Infante of Ridgewood, N.J., and Marlene Flanagan of Winnetka, Ill.; a brother, Charles, of Saddle River; two sisters, Concetta Corso of Wyckoff, N.J., and Grace Calendrillo of Garfield, N.J.; 15 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
