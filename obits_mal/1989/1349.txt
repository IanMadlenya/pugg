        Okey L. Patteson, a Democrat who served from 1949 to 1953 as Governor of West Virginia, died of pneumonia Monday at Raleigh General Hospital in Beckley, W.Va. He was 90 years old and lived in Mount Hope, W.Va.
        Mr. Patteson, who lost both legs in a hunting accident in 1932 at the age of 34, grew up in Mount Hope, where he held several local elective posts. He became involved in statewide politics in 1944, when he managed the successful gubernatorial campaign of Clarence W. Meadows. Mr. Patteson then served as Governor Meadows's executive secretary, resigning in 1948 to run for the governorship himself.
        West Virginia governors could not succeed themselves at that time, and Governor Patteson left office in 1953.
        He was general manager of the West Virginia Turnpike Commission from 1954 to 1956 and was a member of the Board of Regents of the state's universities and colleges. He also was chairman of the board of the Raleigh County National Bank from 1967 to 1972, when he retired.
        Mr. Patteson was a graduate of West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon and earned a Ph.D. from the West Virginia Institute of Technology in Montgomery.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Reuter Warden; two daughters, F. Lee McGraw of Lawton, Okla., and Anna-Hughes Carone of Indiana, Pa.; a stepson, Stephen Warden of Bradley, W.Va.; a sister, Ruby Shultz of Macon, Ga., and three grandchildren.
