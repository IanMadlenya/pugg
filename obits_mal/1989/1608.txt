        Charles J. Wurmfeld, an engineer and inventor, died Thursday at New York Hospital after a brief illness. He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Wurmfeld began his career with designing a ventilation system for the New York City subways in 1930. In 1948 he founded an independent consulting concern that bore his name. He specialized in mechanical and electrical engineering design for high-rise residential buildings. In 1975 he became a founding partner in Wurmfeld Associates, an architectural and engineering company specializing in institutional, corporate and residential building design.
        His first patent, in the 1930's, was for a room humidification device to be used with steam heating systems. Until shortly before his death, he was working on perfecting the prototype for a device patented in 1982 to harness solar energy stored in ambient air.
        Mr. Wurmfeld was a graduate of the City College of New York, from which he received advanced degrees in mechanical and electrical engineering.
        He is survived by his wife, Esther; two sons, Michael and Sanford, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
