        Dr. Fox, a graduate of Harvard University and the Long Island College of Medicine, was professor emeritus of microbiology and surgery at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, which he joined in 1960 after teaching at several other universities.
        He held many medical patents, including one for a fluid used in kidney dialysis and others for ointments used to treat severe skin burns. One of the ointments, Silvadene, is in wide use.
        He is survived by a daughter, Susan Ziff of Mullins, S.C.; two sons, Dr. Paul Fox of Fairfield, Conn., and Andrew, of Pittsburgh, and a brother, Fred, of Englewood, N.J.
