        Dr. Karre K. Nygaard, a retired surgeon and a sculptor, died of prostate cancer at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 85 years old. Dr. Nygaard, who was a sculptor before he studied medicine at the Royal Frederiks University in Oslo, did his surgical residency at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. In 1940, he opened a private practice in White Plains and began a 40-year affiliation with the White Plains Hospital Center. In 1948, he was made a member of the Special Order of St. Olaf by King Haakon VII of Norway for his humanitarian efforts on behalf of Norwegian merchant seamen.
        Dr. Nygaard was known primarily for his work as a doctor, but he achieved international recognition as a sculptor in 1971, when his work, ''Refugees,'' was chosen by the United Nations to be pictured on a commemorative stamp. He created more than 100 sculptures, many of which are in private collections or museums. He retired in 1979 and was a master artist at the State University of New York at Purchase for three semesters.
        He is survived by his wife, Gail, and by a brother, Finn Simmensen of Stockton, Calif., and by three brothers and two sisters in Norway.

        An obituary and its headline yesterday about a retired surgeon and sculptor from Scarsdale, N.Y., gave his first name incorrectly. He was Dr. Kaare K. Nygaard.
