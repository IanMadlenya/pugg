        Judge Maris, a graduate of Temple University Law School, was appointed a Federal district judge in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1938 he ruled that requiring school children to salute the flag was unconstitutional. In the same year he was elevated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which handles appeals of Federal cases from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and the Virgin Islands.
        In the 1950's Judge Maris helped to putting together the internal laws of the Virgin Islands and to revise the codes of Guam and American Samoa.
        He stepped aside as an active judge in 1958, but continued handling appeals as a senior judge until his final illness. He also served occasionally as a special master to the Supreme Court to decide such matters as land and water disputes between states and the Federal Government. He also helped to recodify Federal codes and procedural rules.
        He is survived by two sons, William and Robert, and a granddaughter,
