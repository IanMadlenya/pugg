        Harold Rhoden, a Los Angeles lawyer involved in several sensational lawsuits including the AIDS liability verdict against the estate of Rock Hudson, died Thursday when a light plane he was piloting crashed near Santa Clarita, Calif. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Rhoden, who lived in Los Angeles, was returning from Sacramento when his plane developed engine trouble over Santa Clarita, struck a utility cable and crashed.
        The Santa Clarita coroner's office said Mr. Rhoden's wife, Sheila, who was 45, and her mother, Ceil Rauch, 61, of Lake Worth, Fla., were also killed. The couple's daughter, Lorraine, 13, was taken to Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where she was in critical condiion with head injuries.
        Mr. Rhoden was the lawyer for Noah Dietrich, the aide to Howard Hughes who was named executor of the eccentric industrialist's will, which was ruled invalid after a long court battle.
        Mr. Rhoden also represented Bianca Jagger, the wife of Mick Jagger, and Soraya Khashoggi, the wife of the Saudi Arabian billionaire Adnan Khashoggi, in their divorce trials.
        In the Rock Hudson case, Mr. Rhoden won a jury verdict of $21.75 million in damages for Marc Christian, the actor's lover, on the ground that Mr. Hudson had not told Mr. Christian that he had AIDS. The judge reduced the award to $5.5 million last April.
        In addition to his daughter, Mr. Rhoden is survived by three sons, Eric, Fletcher and Paul, all of Los Angeles.
