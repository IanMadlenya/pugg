        Dr. George F. Andreasen, an orthodontist who introduced an alloy of nickel and titanium for use in arch wires to straighten teeth, died of multiple myeloma Friday at Mercy Hospital in Iowa City. He was 55 years old and lived in Iowa City.
        Dr. Andreasen, who was professor of orthodontics at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry, devised the alloy nitinol, which became known as the ''memory wire'' because it returns to its original shape after being bent. The device shortens the time needed to straighten teeth by exerting continuous force and eliminates adjustments required with stainless steel wires.
        A native of Fremont, Neb., he held degrees in mechanical engineering and in dentistry from the University of Nebraska.
        Dr Andreasen joined the Iowa dentistry faculty in 1963 and was chairman of the orthodontics department from 1965 to 1975. He was a diplomate of the American Board of Orthodontics.
        He leaves two daughters, Susan, of Los Angeles, and Robin, of San Diego, and a brother, Merritt, of Fremont.
