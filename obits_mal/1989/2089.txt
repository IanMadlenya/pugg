        F.G. Walton Smith, an oceanographer who founded the Marine Labora tory at the University of Miami, died of heart failure Sunday at Mercy Hospital in Miami. He was 80 years old and lived in Key Biscayne, Fla.
        Dr. Smith founded the laboratory, forerunner of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, in 1943 and became the first dean of the school in 1969. He was also started the International Oceanographic Foundation in 1953 to encourage scientific study and exploration of the oceans. Two decades later the foundation opened the marine science exhibition Planet Ocean on the Rickenbacker Causeway over Biscayne Bay.
        A native of Bristol, England, who received his doctoral degree from the University of London, Dr. Smith was a biologist in the Bahamas before joining the University of Miami faculty in 1940. He started the marine laboratory in an abandoned boathouse with a small motorboat and a staff consisting of a secretary and two student assistants.
        Later he acquired an engineless Navy landing barge that he docked at a Miami Beach marina. In 1951 Dade County donated six acres of land on Virginia Key and the laboratory became permanently established.
        For a decade beginning in 1948 Dr. Smith was chairman of the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute. He was the co-author with Henry Chapin of ''The Ocean River,'' published in 1952, which dealt with the influence of the Gulf Stream, and ''The Sun, the Sea and Tomorrow'' (1954), outlining the prospects for farming of the seas.
        He leaves his wife, the former May Walker; a daughter, Alexandra Hofgren of Washington and a grandson.
