        George O'Hanlon, who became the voice of the cartoon world's man of the future, George Jetson, after unsuccessfully auditioning for the role of the cartoon caveman Fred Flintstone, died of a stroke on Saturday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. O'Hanlon had just finished recording his role as George in ''Jetsons: The Movie,'' a full-length cartoon from Universal Pictures and Hanna-Barbera Productions scheduled for release in the fall.
        ''George loved doing 'The Jetsons,' '' said Joe Barbera, the president of Hanna-Barbera. ''He just sounded great in our latest sessions.''
        The film is based on ''The Jetsons,'' the popular 1960's cartoon situation comedy about a futuristic family.
        Mr. O'Hanlon's other credits include the roles of the television commentator in the film ''Rocky'' and William Bendix's next-door neighbor on the television show ''The Life of Riley.'' He also wrote for the Jackie Gleason show for two years.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy, a son, George Jr., a daughter, Laurie, and a granddaughter.
