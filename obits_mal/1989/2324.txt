        Presiding Bishop J. O. Patterson Sr. of the Church of God in Christ, who retired this year in failing health, died at William F. Bowld Hospital here today. He was 77 years old.
        Bishop Patterson's illness was diagnosed last April as pancreatic cancer, but he refused to be treated because, he said, ''the treatment of prayer is better than chemotherapy.''
        He had served for two decades as Presiding Bishop, the church's top official.
        The Church of God in Christ, whose headquarters are in Memphis, is a largely black Pentecostal denomination that lists 3.7 million members and nearly 10,000 local churches. Most of its members are Americans, although it does have some members in 44 other nations.
        Bishop Patterson is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, J. O. Jr., who is also a bishop in the church; a daughter, Janet Patterson Wheeler, and a brother, Bishop W.A. Patterson. All the survivors live in Memphis.
