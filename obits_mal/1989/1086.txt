        Dr. Stephenson was Distinguised Research Professor of Advertising at the University of Missouri's School of Journalism. He had previously taught at the University of Chicago and the University of Washington and was a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley.
        Born in Durham, England, he held doctoral degrees in physics and psychology from London University and a master of arts from Corpus Christi College, Oxford. During World War II he was a brigadier general in the British Army.
        Dr. Stephenson came to the United States in 1948 and served as a research director and consultant in market research to several industrial concerns and advertising agencies. He was the author of ''The Study of Behavior: Q-Technique and its Methology,'' published in 1953, which outlined his theory differentiating the attentiveness of various audiences of newspapers and other periodicals.
        Dr. Stephenson is survived by his wife, Maimie, and four children.
