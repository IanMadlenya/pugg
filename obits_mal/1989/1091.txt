        Jacques Garnier, the artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet's contemporary dance troupe and a choreographer who played a key role in promoting modern dance in France, died on June 10 in Paris. He was 48 years old.
        No cause of death was given, although friends of Mr. Garnier in Paris said he had been ill for some time.
        A former ballet dancer, Mr. Garnier became interested in modern dance in the late 1960's when it was not generally accepted by French audiences or in the French ballet world.
        After his appointment as director in 1980, Mr. Garnier commissioned numerous American experimental choreographers to create premieres for the G.R.C.O.P. (Groupe de Recherche Choregraphique de l'Opera de Paris), the modern-dance company attached to the Paris Opera. Among them were David Gordon, William Forsythe, Karole Armitage, Ulysses Dove, Andy DeGroat and Lucinda Childs. The company was well-received in its United States debut in 1985 at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and in its New York debut last year at Florence Gould Hall.
        Mr. Garnier was born in St. Gilles, in the Vendee province. After studying ballet at National Conservatory in Paris, he joined the corps de ballet at the Paris Opera Ballet in 1963.
        Mr. Garnier said the ''shock'' of seeing Merce Cunningham's and Paul Taylor's works in 1967 changed the course of his career. He left to study in the United States and began choreographing in 1969. In 1971, he and Brigitte Lefevre, a former Paris Opera Ballet dancer who now heads the dance section of the Ministry of Culture, co-founded the Theatre du Silence.
        Mr. Garnier is survived by his parents and two brothers.
