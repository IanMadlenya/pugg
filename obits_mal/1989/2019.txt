        William Thomas Harris, who built a grocery store chain, died here Tuesday after collapsing at a state meeting of Southern Baptists. . He was 81 years old and lived in Charlotte.
        Mr. Harris collapsed after a speech in which he urged that the name of the Baptist-affiliated Wingate College in Wingate be changed to Cannon-Wingate University to honor Charles Cannon, a textile manufacturer, who has given millions to the school. Mr. Harris had been involved in a yearlong dispute over the proposed name change. His motion was defeated after he collapsed and was taken away.
        Mr. Harris grew up on a farm in Cordele, Ga., quitting school in the 10th grade and working his way up to become an A.&P. grocery store manager before starting his own store in Charlotte in 1936.
        His Harris-Teeter supermarket chain, part of the IRT Property Company, has 128 stores in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, with annual sales of more than $1 billion last year.
        Survivors include his wife, LaVerne; a son, two daughters, four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
