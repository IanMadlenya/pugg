        Gary Hendler, a tax lawyer for entertainers who became head of Tri-Star Pictures and then an independent film producer, died of cancer Thursday. He was 50 years old.
        Mr. Hendler, a specialist in entertainment and tax law, had clients who included Robert Redford, Sally Field, Barbra Streisand, Sean Connery, Goldie Hawn, Michael Caine, Nick Nolte, Elton John and Ella Fitzgerald.
        He joined Tri-Star as president and chief operating officer in 1983, and under his leadership the fledgling studio turned out such box office hits as ''The Natural,'' starring Mr. Redford, and ''Places in the Heart,'' with Miss Field.
        He resigned two years later to become an independent producer and also worked with Tri-Star.
        Survivors include his daughters, Susan and Nanette Hendler; his mother, Yetta Hendler, and his brothers, Harold and Kenneth Hendler.
