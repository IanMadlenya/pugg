        Sheik Abbas Ben Sheik el-Hocine, rector of the Great Mosque of Paris and considered the top Muslim religious authority in France, died tonight after suffering a heart attack, officials said. He was 77.
        Sheik Abbas was stricken at the Hotel Crillon, where the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, was staying on an official visit to France.
        It was not immediately known whether Sheik Abbas had met with Mr. Arafat at the Crillon. The P.L.O. chairman was attending a dinner given by Prime Minister Michel Rocard.
        A statement issued by the mosque said Sheik Abbas died shortly after arrival at the Val de Grace military hospital. It said the rector's body would be returned to his homeland, Algeria, on Friday.
        Sheik Abbas was made rector of the Paris Mosque, the largest center of Muslim worship in Western Europe, in 1982. He often acted as a spokesman for French Muslims, a role disputed by some, and as a liaison between the French Government and the country's Muslim residents. As many as three million Muslims live in France.
