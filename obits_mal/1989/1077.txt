        Antoin (Tonda) Petras, the fashion designer believed responsible for introducing the colored tennis shirt, died of kidney and liver complications yesterday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan and Newtown, Conn.
        After working in several haute couture houses in Paris, including Christian Dior and Jack Fath, Mr. Petras joined IZOD/Lacoste in Manhattan shortly after World War II. At the time, the company's tennis and golf shirts, famous for their tiny crocodile logo, came in only white.
        In 1949, Mr. Petras suggested that the company add red and blue shirts and, later, pastels. Mr. Petras also suggested that the company sell its shirts in department stores as well as sports pro shops.
        Mr. Petras, who remained with the company until his recent retirement, was born in Klatovy, Czechoslovakia.
        He is survived by his sister, Victoria Strakova of Chomutov, Czechoslovakia, and many nieces and nephews.
