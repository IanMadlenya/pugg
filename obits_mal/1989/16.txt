        Mr. Jackson worked for the American Friends Service Committee from 1936 to 1961, when he joined the State Department.
        In 1955, while Mr. Jackson was the Quakers' observer at the United Nations, he was asked by an envoy of Gamal Abdel Nasser, then the Egyptian Prime Minister, to set up a meeting between Egyptian and Israeli officials. Mr. Jackson made three trips to Egypt and Israel, where David Ben-Gurion, then the Defense Minister, also welcomed his efforts. Mr. Jackson had the backing of the United States, the State Department said.
        The mission failed when fighting between Israelis and Arabs broke out in the Gaza Strip.
