        An economist, Mr. Dahlberg turned to inventing as a hobby. His most notable creation was the internal mechanism for the Parker fountain pen and the design of its arrow clip, which he sold to the Parker Company in 1929.
        He was the author of nine books on economics, including ''Jobs, Machines and Capitalism'' published by McMillan in 1932 and ''When Capital Goes on Strike'' published by Harper in 1938. In 1944 Mr. Dahlberg founded the U.S. Economics Corporation, a Manhattan economics consulting firm of which he was the owner and president until his retirement in 1965.
        He was an economics consultant to the Hoover Administration and worked on the National Economic Recovery Plan for the Roosevelt Administration in 1939 and 1940. He also founded the Visual Economics Library at Columbia University in 1951.
        Mr. Dahlberg was born in Escanaba, Mich. He earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Wisconsin. He also held degrees in economics from Harvard University and The London School of Economics.
        His wife, the former Agnes Eleanor Schilt, died in 1978. He is survived by a daughter, Carol Lucas of Greenwich, Conn., a son, Eric of Philadelphia, a sister, Victoria Morrow of Lake Worth, Fla., and four grandchildren.
