        Philip D. Tobin, a labor lawyer who was twice elected mayor of the village of Tuckahoe in Westchester County, died of pneumonia Tuesday night at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after a long battle with cancer. He was 46 years old and lived in Tuckahoe.
        Elected mayor in 1983, he resigned during his second term in 1987 because of failing health, but later ran for town justice in the same year, when his health seemed to rebound. He was narrowly defeated.
        Active in a wide range of civic affairs, Mr. Tobin served as chairman of the board of the Eastchester Community Action Program, which develops programs for young people. As mayor, he maintained a strong interest in the history of his village and pushed successfully for the installation of a marker in Quarry Park to honor Tuckahoe's quarry workers, whose marble at one time was widely prized.
        A graduate of Fordham University and the New York University Law School, Mr. Tobin was for many years a partner in the Manhattan firm Cohn Glickstein & Lurie. He recently opened his own officer in Tuckahoe.
        Mr. Tobin is survived by his wife, Elena; a daughter, Kathleen, and two sons, Sean and Eamonn, all of Tuckahoe.
