        Mr. Blount joined the business, a silk-dyeing operation owned by his family, in 1919 after graduating from Harvard. He became a vice president in 1937 and expanded the company to deal with synthetics and double-knit fabrics. He became president in 1944 and helped build the company into one of the largest independent dye works in the world. He also invented a process for dyeing double-knit fabrics. He retired as president in 1967 but remained as chairman until 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Mercedes; two daughters, Lorna Christophersen of Westport, Conn., and Elena Dreiske of Winnetka, Ill.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
