        Valentin P. Glushko, who in the 1930's pioneered the development of Soviet liquid-fueled rockets, then played a prominent but secret role in Russia's postwar space program, has died at the age of 80, the Soviet press agency Tass announced yesterday.
        No details were given, and accounts of his early life are meager. In the late 1920's, according to the 1971 edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, he began working on rocket propulsion in Leningrad. In 1929, he founded the Gas Dynamics Laboratory there.
        Then in the 1930's he and Sergei P. Korolev began developing rockets at the Jet Research Institute in Moscow. Mr. Korolev, who died in 1966, was later credited with heading the Soviet space program, including design of the Vostok and Voskhod manned spacecraft and vehicles sent to the moon.
        Propulsion by burning a combination of liquid oxygen and a fuel, like nitric acid, developed by Mr. Glushko in the Soviet Union and by others in the United States and Germany, became a primary method for space missions. The key roles of Mr. Glushko and Mr. Korolev in the Soviet space effort were kept secret until 1963.
        Mr. Glushko wrote several books on rocketry, including one in 1935 with Georgi Langemak, who developed the use of gunpowder to propel the Katusha rockets of World War II. Mr. Langemak fell victim to the Stalin purges in 1937.
        Mr. Glushko and Mr. Korolev were made full members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, a year after the launching of Sputnik inaugurated the space age.
