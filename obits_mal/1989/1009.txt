        Professor Owen, a native of Richmond, was a member of the Yale faculty from 1930 to 1965. He specialized in thermodynamics, electrochemistry and piezochemistry, which is the study of the effects of high pressure on chemical reactions.
        Professor Owen graduated from the University of Virginia in 1922. After graduate work at the Sorbonne, he enrolled in Yale in 1925.
        After retiring from Yale, he became a research chemist and lecturer at the University of California at San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography until 1969, when he became a research associate at Scripps, a post he held until 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Mae Kelly; two daughters, Virginia Torrance of Boulder, Colo., and Sarah Ford of Nyack, N.Y.; a brother, Dr. Joseph, of the Bronx; three grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
