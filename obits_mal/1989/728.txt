        Mr. Neumiller, born and raised in Peoria, began his career in 1915 as a stenographer and clerk at the Holt Manufacturing Company, Caterpillar's predecessor.
        He was promoted to parts manager in 1921. When Holt and the C. L. Best Tractor Company merged in 1925 to form Caterpillar, Mr. Neumiller was designated general parts manager.
        In 1941 he became president of the company, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment.
        He held that position until 1954, when he was elected chairman of the board and chief executive. After World War II Mr. Neumiller guided Caterpillar into a global expansion.
        He retired as chairman and chief executive in 1962 but remained a director until 1968.
        Mr. Neumiller is survived by his wife, Selma, and three daughters.
