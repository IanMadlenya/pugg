        Sol Mogal, an importing executive who won seven national bridge championships in the 1940's and 50's, died of cancer Wednesday night at his home in Manhattan. He was 77 years old and also had a home in Croton-on Hudson, N.Y.
        For about 50 years until his death, Mr. Mogal was president of Mitchell Mogal Inc., a Manhattan importing business. As a tournament bridge player he was a member of the men's national championship team in 1947, 1948 and 1954 and of the men's national pairs champions in 1947.
        He won the Spingold championship in 1946 and 1949 and the Reisinger championship in 1949. He ended tournament play about 30 years ago, but was an active participant at the Cavendish Club in Manhattan until recently.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Doris Pick; a son, Joshua, of San Jose, Calif.; a stepson, David Rubin of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Sara Wigutow of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
