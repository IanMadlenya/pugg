        Mr. Heminway, who held a seat on the New York Stock Exchange, began his career in 1938 with Dillon Read & Company Inc. During World War II he joined the United States Intelligence Corps, then returned to Dillon Read after the war.
        He became a member of the New York Stock Exchange in 1946, representing Riter & Company, a St. Louis-based concern that later became Simon & Company and has since gone out of business. He retired in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Boyd Semenenko; three children from a former marriage, Jay, of St. Helena, Calif., John Jr., of Manhattan, and Hilary, of Stonington, Conn., and 3 grandchildren.
