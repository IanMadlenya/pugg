        The founder and former chairman of Japan's opposition Democratic Socialist Party, Ikko Kasuga, died of pneumonia today at Nagoya City University Hospital, hospital officials said. He was 79 years old.
        In 1960, Mr. Kasuga left the Japan Socialist Party over an ideological difference and formed the Democratic Socialist Party - now Japan's third largest opposition party - with the late Suehiro Nishio. Mr. Kasuga became the party's secretary general in 1967 and was elected chairman in 1971.
        As chairman, Mr. Kasuga proposed forming a coalition government with other opposition party members or some members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
        He was not successful, and he resigned in 1977. He had been an adviser to the party since his resignation.
        Mr. Kasuga was born into a farm family in the central Gifu region in 1910 and was first elected to Japan's lower house of Parliament on the Japan Socialist Party ticket in 1952.
        With the death of Mr. Kasuga, the number of seats held by the Democratic Socialist Party in the House of Representatives falls to 28. The largest opposition party is the Japan Socialist Party, with 85 seats, followed by the Clean Government Party, with 56. The Liberal Democrats have 296 seats in the House, and the Japan Communist Party has 27.
