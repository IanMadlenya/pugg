        Robert E. Kaske, a medieval scholar who taught at Cornell University for 25 years, died of a brain tumor Tuesday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 68 years old.
        Dr. Kaske, who was the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities in the English Department, was born in Cincinnati and was a graduate of Xavier University. After serving in the Army in World War II, he received his doctoral degree from the University of North Carolina.
        He taught at Washington University in St. Louis, North Carolina and the University of Illinois before joining Cornell in 1964. He was the author of ''Medieval Christian Literary Imagery: A Guide to Interpretation,'' published last year by the University of Toronto Press.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carol Vonckx; two sons, Richard, of Ithaca, and David, of Cincinnati, and three grandchildren.
