        Clyde (Gerry) Geronimi, an Academy Award-winning animator who worked on such classic Walt Disney films as ''Cinderella'' and ''Sleeping Beauty,'' died at his home Monday. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Geronimi brought to life Mickey Mouse, Pluto and other Disney characters in a 28-year career at the studio. Before he joined Disney in 1931, he worked at the Hearst studios.
        He became a director in 1938 and won his first Academy Award the following year for the cartoon short ''The Ugly Duckling.'' He received a second Oscar in 1942 for another short, ''Lend a Paw.''
        Mr. Geronimi worked as a segment director on such Disney films as ''The Three Caballeros'' and ''Peter Pan,'' and was supervising director on ''101 Dalmatians.''
        His onetime Hearst colleague, Walter Lantz, the creator of Woody Woodpecker, presented him with an Annie award in 1977 on behalf of the Hollywood chapter of the International Animation Society.
        Mr. Geronimi is survived by two sons, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
