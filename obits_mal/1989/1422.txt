He worked for CBS Radio with such band leaders as Freddy Rich and Ray Noble before starting his own 16-piece band in 1939. He also worked for NBC and did freelance work for television and radio commercials.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan; a son, William, of Hawthorne, Calif.; a daughter, Shannah Matranga of Redondo Beach, Calif., and a grandson.
