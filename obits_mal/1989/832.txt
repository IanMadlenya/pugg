        Dr. Henry Hope, a retired professor of fine arts at Indiana University and the first director of its art museum, died Thursday morning at Bloomington (Ind.) Hospital. He was 83 years old and lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        He had collapsed earlier that morning while speaking at the dedication of a Tony Rosenthal sculpture that the university had commissioned to honor him and his wife, Dr. Sarahanne Hope. Dr. Hope's death was apparently caused by a heart attack.
        Dr. Hope, who received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, was chairman of the fine-arts department at Indiana University from 1941 to 1968. He founded the art museum there, and was its director from 1961 to 1971, when he retired. He also served as an adviser to Unesco on cultural affairs.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Hope is survived by two sons, Roy, of Minneapolis, and Ray, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Sarahanne Chelminski of Bridgewater, Conn.; two stepsons, Peter McClennen of Fort Lauderdale and James McClennen of Philadelphia; a stepdaughter, Helen Miller of Fort Lauderdale; two brothers, Quentin, of Bloomington, Ind., and Harvey, of Pemaquid, Me.; two sisters, Helen Dibbel of Manhattan and Florence Messing of Ithaca, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and four step-grandchildren.
