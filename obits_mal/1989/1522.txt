        Mr. Adams, a native of Macon, Ga., held editorial posts with several black-owned newspapers. He became a police reporter for The Chicago Defender in 1925 and was named its managing editor four years later.
        In 1938, he came to New York to assume his post at The Amsterdam News. From 1950 to 1953, he directed the Global News Syndicate, which supplied articles to more than 100 black newspapers across the country. He later became the general manager of The New York Age, a black weekly newspaper.
        From 1959 until retiring in 1972, he served on the staff of the state's Division of Human Rights, first as assistant director of education and later as executive assistant to the chairman.
        Mr. Adams wrote widely on business and politics. He was the author of ''The Challenge: A Study in Negro Leadership,'' published in 1949.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Olive Arnold; two daughters, Julie Strandberg of Providence, R.I., and Carolyn Kahn of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.
