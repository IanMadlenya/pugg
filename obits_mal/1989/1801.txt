        Seamus Twomey, a leader of the Irish Republican Army, died Tuesday in a Dublin hospital. He was 70 years old and had been suffering from a heart ailment.
        Mr. Twomey, former manager of a bookmaker's shop, was a founding member of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, which was established after the resumption of sectarian strife in Northern Ireland in 1969. The Provisional, or ''green,'' I.R.A. split at that time from the Marxist Official, or ''red,'' I.R.A.
        As the Provisionals' chief of staff, he flew to London in 1972 for cease-fire talks with the British Government. But the lull was short-lived. On July 7, 1972, the I.R.A. set off 22 bombs across Belfast, killing nine people. It became known as ''Bloody Friday,'' one of the deadliest episodes in the 20-year campaign by the I.R.A. to oust Britain from the north.
        Mr. Twomey was arrested in the Irish Republic in 1973 but escaped by helicopter from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. He was arrested again in December 1977 and was given a five-year prison term.
        After his release in January 1982 he remained active in the republican movement and made political appearances in the United States, apparently avoiding a ban on entry to the United States by using an anglicized version of his first name, calling himself James Twomey.
        Gerry Adams, president of the I.R.A.'s legal political arm, Sinn Fein, paid tribute Tuesday to Mr. Twomey's ''lifelong commitment to the cause of Irish freedom.''
