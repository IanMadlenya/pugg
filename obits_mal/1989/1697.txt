        Arnold Johnson, a member of the national leadership of the Communist Party for many years, died Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital after a long illness. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Johnson was born in a lumber camp in Seattle and began working at the age of 12 in a lumber mill. He worked his way through college and later received a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University and a bachelor of divinity degree from the Union Theological Seminary.
        Mr. Johnson joined the Socialist Party in New York in 1929 while he was still a student. In 1931 he was arrested in Harlan, Ky., at a miners' strike. He later became a leader of the National Unemployed Leagues and the Workers Alliance. Ran for the Senate
        After joining the Communist Party Mr. Johnson moved to Ohio, where he was the party's state leader from 1940 to 1947. In the late 1940's he came to Manhattan, where he served as national legislative director, public-relations director and filled other posts in the party's national and New York State organizations. He also ran for the United States Senate on the Communist line.
        In 1953, Mr. Johnson and a group of other party leaders were convicted in Manhattan of violating the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the violent overthrow of the Government. Sentenced to a three-year term, he was released after two years and four months.
        In 1970 he refused to testify before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Internal Security, which had subpoenaed him in an investigation of the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. He was cited for contempt of Congress, but the charge was later dismissed.
        There are no immediate survivors.
