        Monsignor Del Vecchio was ordained a priest in 1933 after graduating from St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. He then served at the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ozone Park, Our Lady of the Assumption in Copiague, L.I., and five parishes in Brooklyn before becoming pastor of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary and St. Stephen in 1950.
        The following year, a fire destroyed the church, in the Carroll Gardens section, but he raised more than $200,000 to rebuild it. He was also the founder of St. Stephen High School, which has since been closed.
        He was named a monsignor by Pope John Paul II in 1981 and retired in 1986.
        He is survived by two sisters, Emma Valente and Velia, both of Arpino, Italy.
