        Thomas F. Murphy, former president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, died of pneumonia Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 79 years old and lived in Potomac, Md.
        Mr. Murphy was president of the union from 1966 to 1979, when he became chairman of the union's Masonry Industry Committee, representing manufacturers, contractors and union members in lobbying and research. He retired in 1985.
        In 1976 he was named by President Jimmy Carter to the board of the Pennsylvania Avenue Redevelopment Corporation, serving until 1983. The organization was established by Congress in 1972 to redevelop Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol.
        Mr. Murphy, a native New Yorker, joined the bricklayers' union as a teen-age apprentice and moved to the Washington area in 1940. He became treasurer of the union in 1948 and secretary in 1960. He had also served on the board of the International Federation of Building and Wood Workers.
        He is survived by a son, Thomas F. Murphy Jr., and a daughter, Denise Folliard, both of Potomac, and seven grandchildren.
