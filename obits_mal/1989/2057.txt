        Charles Shipman, a financial analyst and journalist who was active in the Communist Party until he became disillusioned with Stalinism in the 1930's, died of congestive heart failure on Monday at his home in Austin, Tex. He was 94 years old and had lived for many years in Redding, Conn.
        Mr. Shipman began his career in finance in the 1920's when he wrote for The Chicago Economist and The Chicago Financial News. From 1930 to 1934 he was investment editor of The Wall Street Journal, after which he became a securities analyst and railroad editor for Standard & Poor's financial information service.
        He was named assistant to the vice chairman of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad and the Alleghany Corporation in 1948. Four years later he formed his own company, Coordinated Financial Services, which built shopping centers in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta. He retired in the mid-1960's after operating companies in the metals and industrial-supply fields in upstate New York.
        Mr. Shipman was born in Manhattan and attended Columbia University, where he was expelled in his senior year for leading demonstrations as a World War I draft resister. He fled the country and helped organize Communist Parties in Mexico, Guatemala and Spain.
        On his return to the United States he resumed his activity in the United States Communist Party, of which he remained a member until 1938. His memoirs will be published next spring by Cornell University Press.
        Mr. Shipman is survived by his daughter, Carlota Smith of Austin, and two grandchildren.
