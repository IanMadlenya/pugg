        Ermal Cleon Fraze, an engineer who invented the pull-tab opener that is used on aluminum beer and soda cans, died of a brain tumor Thursday at Kettering Memorial Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. He was 76 years old and lived in Dayton.
        Mr. Fraze's simple device revolutionized the way people open beer and soft drink cans. His company says such tabs were used last year on about 150 billion cans.
        ''I personally did not invent the easy-open can end,'' Mr. Fraze said in a 1963 interview after he received a patent for the pull tab. ''People have been working on that since 1800. What I did was develop a method of attaching a tab on the can top.''
        Mr. Fraze founded the Dayton Reliable Tool and Manufacturing Company in 1950 and was its chief executive at the time of his death.
        In 1959, while on a family picnic, Mr. Fraze had forgotten to bring a can opener and was forced to use a car bumper to open a can of beer. Thinking there must be an easier way, he later stayed up all night until he came up with the pull tab.
        He obtained the first patent for a pull-tab can in 1963 and later invented a new version with a ring and a prepuncturing tab. The Aluminum Company of America was given exclusive rights to the inventions, and Mr. Fraze, whose company does not make cans, received royalties from Alcoa for each one produced.
        Born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., Mr. Fraze moved to Dayton in the early 1930's. He later studied engineering at General Motors Institute.
        Survivors include his wife, Martha; two sons, Mark and Terry, and three grandchildren, all of Dayton.
