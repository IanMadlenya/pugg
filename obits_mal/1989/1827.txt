        Mr. Hardin created many wood and bronze sculptures and commemorative medals and sculptural murals. His works are represented in many private collections and are displayed in such public buildings as St. Patrick's Cathedral and the Interchurch Center in New York and the University Store at his alma mater, Princeton.
        Mr. Hardin was president of the National Sculpture Society from 1957 to 1959, a member of the National Academy of Design, and a recipient of many art and numismatic awards. He retired as vice president of the William Esty advertising agency in 1959 to devote himself full time to sculpture.
        He is survived by his daughter, Carol H. Kimball, of Lyme, Conn.; his son, Adlai S. Hardin Jr., of New York, and six grandchildren.
