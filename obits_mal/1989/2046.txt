        Dr. Israel Sarov, an Israeli virologist who developed a test to detect the sexually transmited disease chlamydia that was approved last month by the United States Food and Drug Administration, died of a heart attack on Thursday while attending a medical conference in Honolulu. He was 55 years old and lived in Omer, Israel.
        Dr. Sarov, head of the virology division of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Beersheba, also developed tests for Epstein-Barr syndrome and for mononucleosis. At the time of his death he was working on a safe vaccine for cytomegalovirus, an infection that has been linked to mental retardation in babies and poses a serious problem in organ transplanting.
        The new test for chlamydia, the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States, affecting four million men, women and children a year, is expected to be on sale by the end of the year for administration in physicians' offices. The test kit, said to be capable of confirming the presence of chlamydia within three hours, is already being used in 11 countries.
        Dr. Sarov was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, and emigrated to Israel, where he received a degree from the Hadassah Medical School of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He joined the Ben-Gurion faculty in 1974.
        Before his trip to Hawaii, he visited Bulgaria for the first time in 40 years to establish an exchange between Ben-Gurion University and the University of Sofia.
        Surviving are his wife, Batya; his mother, Lisa, of Ramlah, Israel; a son, Aviram, of Omer, and a daughter, Leah, of Tel Aviv.
