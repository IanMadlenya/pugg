        Abraham Worcel, a professor of biology at the University of Rochester, died on Wednesday at Genesee Hospital in Rochester. He was 51 years old and lived in Penfield, a suburb of Rochester.
        A spokeswoman for the university, Jan Fitzpatrick, said Professor Worcel was injured in a fall. The Monroe County Medical Examiner's office has ruled the death a suicide.
        Professor Worcel, who studied how genes work, was the Rush Rhees professor of biology at the university and had held that post since joining the faculty in 1981.
        He was born in Argentina and attended medical school there. He taught at Princeton before coming to the University of Rochester.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Linda Durkin; a daughter, Sonia, of Rochester; his mother, Esther, and a brother, Mario, both of Israel, and a sister, Gloria, of Buenos Aires.
