        Party officials declared a 48-hour halt to campaigning for elections to the European Parliament in a gesture of respect for Mr. Macedo.
        Later, leading candidates from other major parties also stopped their campaigns.
        A vigorous opponent of the rightist dictatorship that ruled Portugal from 1926 to 1974, Mr. Macedo was arrested eight times on political charges.
        He was a founding member of the then-clandestine Socialist Party in the early 1970's, and represented northern Oporto as a deputy after Portugal gained democracy in 1974.
        President Mario Soares of Portugal praised Mr. Macedo as ''a good and generous man who fought for liberty and democracy.''
