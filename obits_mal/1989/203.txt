        Alexander Hahn, who headed a mission after World War II that sought to locate and return Hungarian property taken by the Nazis, died of arterial sclerosis on Dec. 29 at the Forest Hills Nursing Home in Queens. He was 92 years old.
        As head of the postwar Hungarian Restitution Mission, he worked with American occupation authorities in Germany to recover such valuables as a trainload of gold, another of silver, paintings from the Museum of Fine Art in Budapest, and several ships, fire engines and ambulances.
        Mr. Hahn, a native of Budapest, had been the city's Health Commissioner before the war. He came to the United States in 1950. He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Gerber, and a sister, Blanka Guttmann, who lives in Israel.
