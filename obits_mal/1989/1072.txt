        Ching Ho Cheng, an artist, died May 25 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 42 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Gert Schiff, an art historian and Mr. Cheng's longtime companion, said the cause of death was chronic lung disease caused by working with iron and copper dust and toxic paint materials.
        Mr. Cheng's work dealt with process and transformation and the similarities and differences between cultures. He was attracted to light, water and chance. A Cheng installation last year at the Facchetti Gallery in SoHo presented a demonstration of oxidation.
        In another show, Mr. Cheng took the poem of a friend, tore it up and installed the pieces of paper across a gallery wall. ''Grotto,'' a window installation at the Grey Art Gallery in 1987, reflected his interest in geology.
        Mr. Cheng was born in Havana, where his father held a diplomatic post. When the family moved to New York, Mr. Cheng studied painting and sculpture and showed his work regularly beginning in 1977.
        He is survived by his parents, Pai-Fong Cheng and Yu-Fan Cheng, of Queens, and a sister, Sybao Cheng-Wilson, of Los Angeles.
