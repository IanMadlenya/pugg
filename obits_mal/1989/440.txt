        Jesus Maria de Leizaola, who headed the Basque government in exile for nearly two decades during the Franco dictatorship, died Thursday after a heart attack, doctors in this Basque provincial capital said. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Leizaola was a member of Parliament in the democratic republic that existed from 1931 to 1939. The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936 and Franco's troops were victorious in 1939.
        Mr. Leizaola was Basque justice and culture commissioner during the war and went into exile in France in 1937.
        He became head of the Basque autonomous government-in-exile in 1960. Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a parliamentary monarchy. Mr. Leizaola returned to Spain in 1979 and symbolically handed over power of the regional government for the northern Basque region.
        Mr. Leizaola was born Sept. 7, 1896, in San Sebastian, the Basque capital.
        He had predicted before returning to Spain that the re-establishment of a Basque autonomous government, which occurred in 1979, would eliminate E.T.A., the Basque separatist group that has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people since it took up arms in 1968.
        ''When full autonomy takes effect, E.T.A. will disappear like a tumor that cures itself spontaneously,'' he said in an interview in Paris.
        He died as the Government and E.T.A., which stands for Homeland and Freedom in the Basque language, were holding negotiations in Algeria.
