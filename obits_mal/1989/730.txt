        W. Ware Lynch, an author and retired public-relations executive, died of cancer Tuesday at the Charles W. Gerstenberg Hospice Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 75 years old and lived in Palm Beach.
        Mr. Lynch, a graduate of Yale University, was general manager of Russell Birdwell & Associates, a Manhattan public-relations concern with theatrical and corporate accounts, before he bought the company. He sold his interest in it in the 1950's and later founded W. Ware Lynch and Associates, which closed when Mr. Lynch retired to Florida about 10 years ago. He also served as president of the Public Relations Board Inc.
        Mr. Lynch wrote nine books, including ''She's a Cop Isn't She,'' published by Dial Press in 1975.
        He is survived by a son, Ware Terry, and a daughter, Sharon Gates, both of Sarasota, Fla.; three sisters, Nancy Sidenberg and Barbara Ross, both of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Teddy Gaston of Toluca Lake, Calif.; a brother, Henry, of Florence, and three grandchildren.
