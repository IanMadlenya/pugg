        Rudy Mikeska, a restaurateur who served barbecue to Presidents, governors and millions of others for more than three decades, died of cancer Wednesday at his home here. He was 68 years old.
        The Mikeska family was cited by Texas Monthly magazine in 1986 as ''The First Family of Texas Barbecue.'' Mikeska's restaurant served Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Gerald R. Ford, Govs. Preston Smith and Dolph Briscoe, and catered both of the inaugural dinners of the current Governor, William P. Clements Jr. Mr. Mikeska is survived by his wife, two daughters and a son.
