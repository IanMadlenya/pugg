        Woody Herman Shaw, a leading jazz trumpeter, died of a heart attack Tuesday at Bellevue Hospital. He was 44 years old.
        Mr. Shaw had been hospitalized since Feb. 27, when he fell onto subway tracks in front of a moving train. He was legally blind because of retinitis pigmentosa. The accident severed most of his left arm.
        Mr. Shaw's playing was grounded in the hard-bop of Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan, the modal jazz of John Coltrane and the freer jazz of Eric Dolphy and Archie Shepp. His warm tone and his sure-footed, articulate, dramatically paced solos made him a favorite among musicians. In 1976, he placed first in Downbeat magazine's Best Trumpeter poll.
        Mr. Shaw was born in Laurinburg, N.C., in 1944 and grew up in Newark. He picked up the bugle during elementary school and started playing trumpet when he was 12; by his early teens, he was sitting in at jazz clubs around Newark.
        In the early 1960's, he worked with Mr. Dolphy, a groundbreaking modern saxophonist, and with the pianist Horace Silver. During the late 1960's, he moved to San Francisco and worked with the pianist Herbie Hancock and the saxophonist Joe Henderson. He also toured Europe as a member of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and worked with the pianist McCoy Tyner and the drummer Max Roach.
        At the turn of the 1970's, Mr. Shaw began recording as a leader. From the West Coast and then in New York, he made albums for Contemporary, Muse, Columbia and Blue Note, where he made well-received collaborative albums with Mr. Hubbard.
        He is survived by his parents, Woody and Rose Shaw, a sister, Toni, and a brother, Pete, all of Newark; another brother, Cedric, who lives in Connecticut, and a son, Woody Louis Armstrong Shaw, of Newark.
