        Eugene Frank Robel a labor advocate who won a Supreme Court ruling against a law that barred Communists from working in military plants, was killed when he was struck by a train last Sunday. He was 78 years old.
        The police said Mr. Robel, who was believed to be suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was standing on the track and did not respond when the engineer blew the train whistle. The police said Mr. Robel's relatives reported that he had wandered away from home.
        Mr. Robel, a life member of the American Communist Party, was a machinist for the Todd Shipyard Corporation here when he was indicted in 1962 on charges of being a party member while he was working at a military facility.
        The law making that a crime was the Internal Security Act of 1950, which Mr. Robel challenged with help from the American Civil Liberties Union. The Supreme Court overturned that provision in 1967.
