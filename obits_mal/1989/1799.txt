        Reubin Clein, the scrappy publisher of the weekly tabloid Miami Life, died of pancreatic cancer on Saturday at Desert Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 83 years old and lived in Las Vegas, where he had moved after his retirement in 1965.
        Mr. Clein won Miami Life in a blackjack game in 1931 and published it for 34 years. He delighted in using it to taunt established institutions, including The Miami Herald and its publisher, John S. Knight, The Miami Daily News, the Florida Power & Light Company and the Florida East Coast Railway.
        A former boxer, he once broke the nose of the Mayor of Miami Beach at a political rally. He was cited four times for contempt of court. He closed the paper when he retired.
        Mr. Clein is survived by four sons, Stephen of San Francisco, Joseph and Adam, both of Miami Beach, and Michael of Las Vegas; a daughter, Marilyn Shaktman of Las Vegas; a brother, Ben of Miami; two sisters, Lena Goldstein of Miami Beach and Mildred Rosenthal of Chicago; 12 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
