        Francis M. Shea, a former Government official and partner in the Washington law firm of Shea & Gardner, died of lung cancer Tuesday at the Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. He was 74 years old and lived in Alexandria.
        Mr. Shea founded Shea & Gardner in 1947. In the next four decades he was actively engaged in litigation, including a 10-month antitrust trial that led to the exoneration of his clients, three Southern railways, and a long series of cases in which he represented railroads under the Railway Labor Act.
        In 1939, he became Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Claims Division, a post he held for six years. He argued over 50 cases in the Federal appellate courts, including the Supreme Court and the intermediate courts. Among the cases were Hope v. Natural Gas, which established the principles that govern utility rate-setting, and United States v. Marconi, in which the Marconi patents, crucial to radio broadcasting, were invalidated by the Supreme Court because they added too little to prior discoveries.
        In 1945, Mr. Shea became associate counsel for the prosecution of Axis war criminals in Nuremburg.
        He leaves his wife, the former Hilda Droshnicopp; a son, Richard, of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Kathleen McFarlane, of Manchester, and a brother, Father Paschal of the Saint Benedict Priory, Still River, Mass.
