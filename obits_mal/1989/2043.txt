        Mr. Berard was again posted in Germany in 1940-41. He worked briefly in an underground group for the Foreign Ministry before escaping across Spain to Algiers to join the Free French.
        He returned to Washington in 1945, serving as first counselor, then counselor, of the French Embassy. From 1949 to 1955, he was the Deputy High Commissioner in the French occupation zone of West Germany.
        Mr. Berard served two tours as the French delegate to the United Nations, from 1959 to 1962 and from 1967 to 1970.
