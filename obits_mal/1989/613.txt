        Joseph Ferriola, the reputed boss of organized crime in Chicago, died Saturday after his second heart transplant in recent weeks. He was 61 years old and lived in Oak Brook, Ill.
        Mr. Ferriola died at 2:50 A.M. in Methodist Hospital, where he was a patient of the heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey, according to a hospital spokeswoman. She said she had no further information.
        In the early 1970's, Mr. Ferriola served a Federal prison term for taking part in a multimillion-dollar nationwide gambling syndicate. Federal officials said he emerged as the head of organized crime in Chicago in 1986, after Joseph Aiuppa and his second in command, John Cerone, went to prison.
