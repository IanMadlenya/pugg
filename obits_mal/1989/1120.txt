        Mr. Doktor, an active chamber music player, was one of the few violists to establish a career as a soloist. He gave the premieres of several significant compositions for viola, including concertos by Quincy Porter, Walter Piston and Wilfred Josephs.
        Mr. Doktor was born in Vienna and began his musical studies as a violinist with his father, Karl, the violinist of the Busch String Quartet. He completed his studies at the Vienna Academy of Music in 1938 and moved to Switzerland the next year. In 1942 he became the first violist to win the Geneva International Music Competition.
        He moved to New York in 1947 and became an American citizen in 1952. He was a founding member of several ensembles, including the New York String Sextet, the Rococo Ensemble and the Paul Doktor String Trio. He was also on the faculty of the Juilliard School of Music, Mannes College of Music, New York University, Fairleigh Dickinson University and the State University College at Purchase.
        He is survived by his wife, Caryn, and a daughter, Alexis, both of Manhattan.
