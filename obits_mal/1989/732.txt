        Donald S. Rugoff, who ran a chain of art-movie theaters in New York City for many years, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Edgartown, Mass., on Martha's Vineyard. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Rugoff's father, Edward, founded the Rugoff Theaters in 1919. Donald Rugoff established the distribution company Cinema 5 in 1963, and Rugoff Theaters became a part of Cinema 5 in 1968.
        As president of Cinema 5, Mr. Rugoff controlled the Cinema I, Cinema II, Cinema III, Paris, Plaza, Sutton, Beekman, Paramount, Murray Hill, Gramercy and Art theaters. He was known for booking distinguished foreign and independent films.
        Among the film makers Mr. Rugoff introduced to New York audiences were Costa-Gavras, with the film ''Z''; Werner Herzog, with ''Kaspar Hauser,'' and Nicholas Roeg, with ''The Man Who Fell to Earth.'' In 1971, Mr. Rugoff presented 10 major films starring Mary Pickford that had not been seen for 40 years.
        Mr. Rugoff lost control of Cinema 5 in February 1979 when the shares of his company, which were traded on the American Stock Exchange, were purchased in a shareholders' battle by William R. Forman, head of a West Coast conglomerate.
        After retiring to Edgartown three years ago, Mr. Rugoff opened Cinema Cafe, a small theater that showed new art films and classics once a week.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan, of Edgartown, and by two sons, Edward and Ralph, both of Los Angeles.
