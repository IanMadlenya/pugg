        Robert S. Pace, president of Pace University from 1942 to 1960, died of respiratory failure Sunday at King's Row Adult Residence in Middletown, N.J. He was 85 years old and had lived in Monmouth County since 1968.
        Mr. Pace, a native of Hollis, Queens, was the son of Homer St. Clair Pace, who, with his brother, Charles Ashford Pace, founded the college as a night school for accounting in 1906. Robert Pace was elected the second president of what was then called Pace Institute at the age of 38, after the death of his father in 1942. Three months later, he enlisted in the Army as a combat photographer, serving with the Signal Corps in London.
        During his administration, Pace Institute became Pace College in 1948 and a school of arts and sciences was established. In 1953, the college was granted the authority to give bachelor of arts degrees, in addition to bachelor of business adminstration degrees.
        In 1953, the school, which was orginally at Park Row and Spruce Street in Manhattan, moved to a large office building at 41 Park Row. Mr. Pace converted the building into a modern college complex with classrooms and lecture halls. A graduate school of business was founded in 1958. Mr. Pace retired in 1960, when he became a member of the board of trustees.
        He is survived by a sister, Helen Bowen of Blue Bell, Pa.
