        Lord Hill, a former chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation and a household name in World War II as the Radio Doctor, died today. He was 85 years old.
        Lord Hill had a distinguished career in the medical world and as a Conservative cabinet minister before being appointed head of the Government's commercial television watchdog, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, in 1963 and taking over the chairmanship of the BBC four years later.
        The BBC chairman, Marmaduke Hussey, paid tribute to Lord Hill as a staunch defender of the independence of the corporation.
        ''He was one of the most active chairman the BBC had known, outspoken and energetic in support of its activities,'' Mr. Hussey said.
        Lord Hill became popular for his wartime broadcasts as the BBC's Radio Doctor, in which he discussed health problems in lay language.
        Born Charles Hill in London's East End, he won scholarships to school and college that enabled him to become a doctor.
        He was given a life peerage in 1963, a year after he resigned from 13 years as a Member of Parliament.
