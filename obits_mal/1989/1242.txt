        Jack Dash, a Communist famous for his role in London dock strikes, died Thursday. He was 82 years old. No cause of death was given.
        Mr. Dash, who joined the British Communist Party in 1936, prided himself on having been involved in every London dock strike from 1945 to 1969, when he retired.
        Then he painted, sculpted, wrote an autobiography and became a guide for tourists.
