        Mr. Eichel, who was born in Lvov, Poland, emigrated with his family in 1899. He ran Argo Products Company, which manufactured chemicals for fur processing, for 40 years until he retired in 1969.
        In 1917, Mr. Eichel, a member of the Socialist Party, was senenced to two years in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kan., for refusing to register for the draft. In 1942, at the age of 46, he was indicted on the same charge. The indictment was dropped on instructions from the director of the Selective Service System, Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey.  Until the 1960's, Mr. Eichel was a member of the board of the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors, a counseling organization.
        Surviving are his son, Seymour, of Jersey City; a sister, Rose Dorsch, and a brother, Albert, both of Brooklyn.

        An obituary last Sunday about Julius Eichel, a conscientious objector in World Wars I and II, misstated the record of his imprisonment in World War I. He received a 20-year sentence in 1917 that was commuted after he spent 26 months in jail.
