        Dr. Marcel J. E. Golay, a researcher in information theory, optics and instrumentation, died Thursday at his home in La Conversion, Switzerland. He was 86 years old. Dr. Golay was at the time of his death the senior research scientist for the Perkin-Elmer Corporation in Norwalk, Conn., a manufacturer of scientific instruments.
        He developed a sensitive heat detector that measures infra-red radiation, and he invented a scientific method for measuring the structure of molecules. In chemistry, Dr. Golay invented the capillary column, which advanced the capability of gas chromatographers to measure the components of substances.
        In information theory, Dr. Golay published a code system still used in radio navigation. He won several awards in engineering and chemistry.
        Born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, Dr. Golay graduated from the Swiss Federal Technical University and earned a doctorate in physics from the University of Chicago.
        He is a former chief scientist for the United States Army Signal Corps Engineering Laboratories, a former consultant to the Philco Corporation and a former head of the Geneva Observatory.
        Surviving are his wife, Petronella; a son, Marcel Jr., of La Conversion; three daughters, Michelle, of La Conversion, Helene, of Manhattan, and Leonor Bloomer of Guilford, Conn., and two grandchildren.
