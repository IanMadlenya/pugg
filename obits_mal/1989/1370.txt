        Isaia Rankin, a New York designer known professionally as Isaia, died on June 28th at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 35 years old.
        The designer died of respiratory failure, said Noelle Nieva, a vice president of his company, Isaia NYC.
        The designer's death had at first been kept secret and then denied by employees at his company.  [ Patterns column, page B6. ]  Isaia was known for sexy dresses, miniskirts and wrap tops, which he made by combining Lycra with other fabrics like cashmere and cotton to form body-clinging styles. His styles were sleek, modern and sensual but also very basic and affordable.
        Isaia was born in Bruton, Ala., in 1954, and came to New York from Cincinnati in 1979. He got his start at the Merchant of Venice, a SoHo boutique, where he cut sweat clothes into unusual sportswear shapes. In recent years, his clothes have been best-sellers in fashion specialty stores like Barneys New York and Charivari.
        He is survived by his parents, Efrit and Phyllis Rankin, one sister and five brothers, all of whom live in the Cincinnati area.
