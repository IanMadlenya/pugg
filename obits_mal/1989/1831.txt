        Mr. Friedman worked for the New York State Mediation Board from 1950 to 1967 before returning to private practice. For many years he was the arbitrator for the National Railway Labor Conference and five railroad unions. He was a special arbitrator for seven years in disputes between United States Steel and the United Steelworkers of America.
        He also arbitrated disputes involving newspapers, television networks, hospitals, colleges and airlines.
        Mr. Friedman, who was born in Manhattan, became an auditor for the retirement fund of the coat-and-suit industry in New York during World War II after his return from Italy, where he was seriously wounded.
        He received a bachelor's degree at New York University in 1945. He also taught personnel and labor relations at Hofstra University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Clara Handelman; two sons, Edward and Gary, both of Manhattan; a sister, Louise Barth, of Harrison, N.Y.; a brother, Marvin, of Washington, and four grandchildren.
