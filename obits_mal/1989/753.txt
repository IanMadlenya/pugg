        Richard H. Parke, a former reporter and editor for The New York Times, died of liver cancer yesterday at the hospice of Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        Mr. Parke, who was known by the nickname Peter, was a native of Boston. After graduating from Trinity preparatory school in Pawling, N.Y., and working as stage manager for a summer-stock company in Pennsylvania, he joined The Times in 1930 as a reporter for the Brooklyn section then published by the newspaper.
        During World War II, he served in the United States Navy. Returning to The Times, he reported locally, and in 1952 was appointed assistant city editor. Three years later he became the correspondent for The Times in Fairfield County, Conn.
        After his retirement in 1965, Mr. Parke wrote editorials for Greenwich Time and was a freelance writer for other publications.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Andrea McKinnon, an actress whom he married in 1928.
