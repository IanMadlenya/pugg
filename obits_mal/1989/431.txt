        Monsignor Oroshi, who was educated in Albania and Rome, was ordained a priest in 1940 and had a parish in Mirdita, Albania. In 1952, he fled to Italy and then the United States.
        In 1961, he founded a haven for Albanians at Our Lady of Good Counsel Church at Tremont and Park Avenues in the Belmont area. He ministered to thousands of Albanians, not just Roman Catholics, but also Moslem and Eastern Orthodox believers. He retired in 1986.
