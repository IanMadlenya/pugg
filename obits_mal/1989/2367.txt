        Mr. Vidalin, a member of the Comedie Francaise, gave up his acting career to join the underground after the Nazis invaded France in 1939.
        Later he joined de Gaulle in London and became one of the best-known radio announcers on the BBC news program ''Les Francais Parlent aux Francais'' (''The French Speak to the French'').
