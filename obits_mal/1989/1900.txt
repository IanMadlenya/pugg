        Mr. Burnell was director of New York City's Office of Labor Relations from 1974 to 1977, in charge of negotiating contracts with municipal unions. In 1977, he was named director of the Office of Labor-Management Relations, which was created that year to foster harmony between labor and management in the private sector.
        Before his city positions, Mr. Burnell directed the job-placement program of the New York City Central Labor Council and was a close associate of Harry Van Arsdale, the council's longtime head. He also served from 1972 to 1974 as mid-Atlantic regional director of the Human Resources Development Institute of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        Mr. Burnell, a native of Brooklyn, was a bus mechanic for the New York City Transit Authority in his younger years and held organizing posts in Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union. He also served as an organizer for Local 144 of the Service Employees International Union.
        He received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Empire State College.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mabel Tyrill, and by a brother, Marsden, of Manhattan.
