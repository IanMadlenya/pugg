        Stewart Perowne, a diplomat, archeologist and historian who wrote books on the history and antiquities of the Mediterranean, died Wednesday at Charing Cross Hospital here. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Perowne was the son of an Anglican bishop. He was educated at Harvard and Cambridge, and went to Palestine in 1927 under the British mandate to serve in the educational service. He later served in Malta, Aden, Iraq, Barbados, Libya and Israel, where he designed and organized West Bank communities for refugees.
        His 18 books include guides to Athens, Jerusalem, Rome and Malta. His histories of Roman rulers and the early Christians include ''The Life and Times of Herod the Great'' and ''The End of the Roman World.''
        He is survived by his wife, Dame Freya Stark, a writer of travel books about the Middle East.
