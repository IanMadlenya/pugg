        William N. Deramus 3d, the chairman of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and once the youngest man to head a railroad company, died Wednesday, apparently of a heart attack, at the Truman Medical Center. He was 73 years old and lived in Prairie Village, Kan.
        Mr. Deramus began his railroad career in 1939 with the Wabash Railroad after graduating from the University of Michigan and receiving a law degree from Harvard University. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was named president of the Chicago, Great Western Railway.
        He was credited with building up the railroad, and Chicago, Great Western reported a record profit of $3.4 million in 1956. The next year, Mr. Deramus took over the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, better known as the Katy.
        In 1961 Mr. Deramus was elected president of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company and its subsidiary, the Louisiana & Arkansas Railway Company. He succeeded his father.
        He established Kansas City Southern Industries as a holding company in the early 1960's, one of the first of its kind in the railroad industry. It later expanded into life insurance, real estate, broadcasting and data processing.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a son, William 4th, of Overland Park, Kan.; three daughters, Jean Wagner, Jill Dean and Patricia Ann Fogel, all of Kansas City, Mo.; his mother, Lucile, of Kansas City, Mo., and 10 grandchildren.
