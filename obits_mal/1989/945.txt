        For nearly three decades, until 1960, Mr. Rosen worked as director of safety at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where he also created an art department that designed posters and place cards for visiting convention delegates.
        Mr. Rosen later was an assistant to William Zeckendorf Jr. and the community relations director for Webb & Knapp Inc. Later still, as community relations director for the Battery Park City Authority, he created the annual Battery Park City Governor's Cup sailing race.
        A member of the National Cartoonists Society, Mr. Rosen received an award from the Brooklyn Veterans of Foreign Wars for having done more than 25,000 caricatures of servicemen and women during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He also drew more than 1,000 caricatures of celebrities that were autographed by their subjects; the collection has been donated to the Mugar Memorial Library of Boston University.
        Mr. Rosen is survived by his wife, Lee; two sons, Harris, of Orlando, Fla., and Ronald, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; a brother, Herman, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
