        The National Gallery of Zimbabwe, where many of Mr. Takawira's carvings were displayed, said he would be buried this week.
        The Vukutu Art Foundation, where Mr. Takawira often worked, said he was born in the rural town of Chegutu (formerly Hartley) near Harare in 1938 and learned his craft from other artists in the 1960's.
        His subjects were drawn mainly from traditional folklore and legends surrounding animals and birds.
