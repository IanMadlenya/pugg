        Charles A. Schoeneck Jr., a stalwart in New York State Republican politics, died Saturday at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital in Syracuse after a short illness. He was 77 years old and lived in Syracuse.
        Mr. Schoeneck, a native of Syracuse, was a senior partner in the law firm of Bond, Schoeneck & King, which he joined in 1936 after graduating from Harvard University Law School. He was elected to the Republican State Committee in 1952 and was Republican state chairman from 1967 to 1969, when he resigned to return to his law practice.
        Mr. Schoeneck, a graduate of Syracuse University, was elected to the State Assembly in 1951 and was appointed majority leader in 1959. He was defeated for re-election in 1960 after supporting Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's plan for a state income tax increase.
        Former Gov. Malcolm Wilson said of Mr. Schoeneck: ''He was my good friend, a superb legislator, a superb lawyer and a superb gentleman. I will miss him greatly.''
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Brandt; a daughter, Elisabeth Fisher of Erie, Colo.; a son, Charles 3d, of Rockford, Ill., and a sister, Louise Root of Syracuse.
