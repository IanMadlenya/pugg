        Mr. Dalton, known as Ted, was appointed to the United States District Court in 1959 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later served as chief judge for Western Virginia. He wrote the legal opinion that brought about the integration of public schools in Roanoke.
        He served four terms as a Virginia state Senator but failed in 1953 and 1957 in bids for the governorship. But his campaigns demonstrated that Republicans could offer a viable alternative to Democratic control of the state. In 1977 John N. Dalton, a nephew whom Mr. Dalton had adopted as a son, was elected Governor.
        Mr. Dalton is survived by a brother, T. S. Dalton, of Pulaski, Va.; four grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
