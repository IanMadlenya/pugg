        Eddie LeVeque, the last of the original Keystone Kops, the troupe of slapstick gendarmes whose comic antics endeared them to a generation of silent film fans, died Saturday. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. LeVeque, who was born in Mexico, played his first role in a major film in 1914, in D. W. Griffith's ''Intolerance.''
        He later joined the Keystone production company and appeared as one of the Keystone Kops, which were usually featured in a series of misadventures that involved split-second sight gags and an inevitable chase scene.
        Mr. LeVeque left the company in 1917 to serve in World War I. That same year the producer Mack Sennett formed a second troupe of Keystone Kops that continued to perform into the 1920's.
        After the war, Mr. LeVeque appeared in such silent films as ''The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'' with Rudolph Valentino and ''The Black Pirate'' with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. He is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.
