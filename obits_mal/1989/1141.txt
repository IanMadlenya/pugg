        Harry Breuer, a percussionist and xylophonist in vaudeville and television who performed with Paul Whiteman and Benny Goodman, died of cancer Thursday at his home in Brightwaters, L.I. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Breuer began his career during World War I as the Boy Wonder of the xylophone. When George Gershwin was composing ''An American in Paris,'' he consulted Mr. Breuer, who performed the piece with the Whiteman orchestra at Carnegie Hall. As staff percussionist at NBC studios for more than 30 years, Mr. Breuer played for the ''Tonight'' show and other NBC productions. Last year, he recorded the album ''Mallets in Wonderland.''
        He is survived by his wife, Marian; his sons, Harry Jr., Robert and Anthony, and his brother, William, of Garden City, L.I.
