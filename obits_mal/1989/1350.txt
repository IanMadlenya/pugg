        Wilfrid Stalker Sellars, professor of philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh, died Sunday at his home in Pittsburgh after a long illness. He was 77 years old.
        He joined the university in 1963, after teaching at the University of Minnesota and Yale University. He graduated from the University of Michigan and earned master's degrees at the University of Buffalo and at Oxford University.
        He wrote several textbooks, including ''Philosophical Perspectives'' and ''Naturalism and Ontology,'' both published by the Ridgeview Publishing Company.

        An obituary on July 6 of Wilfrid Sellars, a professor of philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh who died July 2, incorrectly characterized several books that he wrote. As his colleagues noted in a recent letter, they were philosophical works, not textbooks.
