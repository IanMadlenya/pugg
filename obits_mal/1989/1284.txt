        Donald F. Carrick, a landscape artist and author and illustrator of children's books, died Monday at his home in Edgartown, Mass., after a brief illness. He was 60 years old.
        Beginning in 1966, Mr. Carrick illustrated more than 80 books, 35 of them written by his wife, Carol Carrick. The seven books he wrote included ''Harald and the Giant Knight,'' ''Harald and The Great Stag,'' ''Milk,'' ''Morgan and the Artist,'' ''The Deer in the Pasture'' and ''The Tree.''
        The Carricks received the 1988-89 California Younger Readers Medal for ''What Happened To Patrick's Dinosaurs?'' and in 1985, he shared The Christopher Award with Richard Margolis for ''Secrets Of A Small Brother.''
        Two other collaborations, ''Bear Mouse,'' by Bernice Freschet, and ''Doctor Change,'' by Joanna Cole received the Irma Simonton Black Award of the Bank Street College of Education.
        His earliest paintings in the mid-1950's were of Mediterranean landscapes, but many were done in Greensboro, Vt., where he and his wife spent their summers.
        Born in Dearborn, Mich, he studied at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, the Art Students League in New York and the Academy of Fine Art in Vienna.
        He is survived by his wife; two sons, Christopher, a student at Sarah Lawrence College, and Paul of Edgartown; a brother, Richard of Wayne, Mich., and a sister, Barbara Carrick of Canton, Mich.
