        Mr. Guillen's work celebrated Cuba's multiracial and ethnic mix as well as the Communist revolution in 1959 that brought Fidel Castro to power. For more than 25 years he was director of Cuba's Union of Writers and Artists.
        Mr. Guillen was born in the city of Camaguey on July 10, 1902, and studied law there. He covered the Spanish Civil War as a magazine reporter. He spent five years in exile after the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista refused to let him return after a visit to Chile in 1953.
        Among his works are ''Themes of the Son'' and ''The Dove of the Popular Flight.''
