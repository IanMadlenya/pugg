        Sol Fishko, president of the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union from 1974 to 1983, died of cancer early yesterday in his Manhattan apartment, his daughter said. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Fishko was born in Brooklyn. After high school there, he went to work as a paper handler in Manhattan.
        He became active as a union organizer there and rose in the New York union movement to become the president of Local 447 of the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants Union of North America.
        In 1964, Mr. Fishko was elected to serve as a vice president of the parent union. He continued to serve for several years as president of the local.
        The parent union merged in 1973 with the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union and became the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union.
        After being elected president of the combined union in 1974, Mr. Fishko held the post until it merged in 1983 with the Graphic Arts International Union. He remained active in union affairs until 1988.
        Mr. Fishko served in the Army in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Bella Gold; two sisters, Eve Schwartzman and Freda Cantor of Queens; a daughter, Sara Fishko Gill of Manhattan; a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
        Funeral services will be held at noon today at the Riverside, 76th Street at Amsterdam Avenue.
