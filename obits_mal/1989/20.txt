        Irving M. Boroff, a retired New York school principal who devised innovative programs to deal with disruptive and other problem pupils, died of a heart attack Tuesday at Coney Island Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        In 1958, Mr. Boroff, who had begun his teaching career two decades earlier working with retarded children, was named principal of Public School 701, a school designated for emotionally maladjusted boys.
        At P.S. 701, housed in an unused school building in Greenwich Village, Mr. Boroff welcomed 22 boys who had been suspended from other schools for incorrigible behavior.
        Four years later, he was named principal of the Manhattan High School for Boys on the West Side, a similar school.
        Mr. Boroff earned a doctoral degree in 1982 from New York University, seven years after retiring.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Blanche Bernstein, and two sisters, Rose Lipoff of Manhattan and Harriet Karnowsky of Dix Hills, L.I.
