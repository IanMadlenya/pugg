        Dr. Jack Burton Weissman, an associate professor of medicine at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons who specialized in infectious diseases, died Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Weissman died after a brief illness, said his longtime companion, Martin Dragone, who declined to give the cause of death.
        Dr. Weissman, a native New Yorker, was a graduate of City College and Harvard Medical School. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1974. In recent years, he treated AIDS patients, who made up about half his practice, Mr. Dragone said.
        He is survived by a sister, Bonnie Resta-Flarer of Brooklyn.
