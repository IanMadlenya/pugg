        Lester Baum, a former State Senator, City Councilman and Alderman in the La Guardia administration, died of a heart attack April 26 at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Baum, a Republican district leader on the West Side for more than 30 years, was elected to the Board of Aldermen in 1935 on the Fusion Party ticket, a coalition of Democrats and Republicans who supported Mr. La Guardia. In 1940, after the City Council succeeded the board, Mr. Baum was elected to the Council as a Republican.
        Mr. Baum ended 24 years of Democratic domination of the 15th Senatorial District in 1942 when he won the seat with the Republican and American Labor Party endorsements. He resigned when reapportionment left the district heavily Democratic. Mr. Baum ran unsuccessfully in other state races. In 1965, he was elected Councilman at Large as a Republican.
        A graduate of the New York Law School, Mr Baum practiced law for more than 40 years. He was an accomplished amateur violinist and, as a legislator, advocated government support for the arts. As an Alderman, he introduced legislation to create the New York City Opera and as a State Senator he proposed creating a state arts commission.
        Surviving are his wife, Jeanette, and a sister, Evelyn Cahn of Manhattan.
