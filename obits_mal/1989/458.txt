        Charles Suppon, a fashion designer and co-author of the musical ''Legs Diamond,'' died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40 years old. Mr. Suppon died of brain lesions, his assistant, Bruce Cudd, said.
        Mr. Suppon was the co-author with Harvey Fierstein of the book for ''Legs Diamond,'' which closed last month on Broadway after 64 performances. The $4.25 million production, which starred Peter Allen and was unfavorably reviewed by many critics, was Mr. Suppon's only musical, Mr. Cudd said.
        Mr. Suppon had been Mr. Allen's manager for the last three years and had designed costumes for his stage and cabaret shows since 1979. They collaborated in 1984 on the inception of ''Legs Diamond,'' which was bogged down by production delays until it opened last year.
        Mr. Suppon, who designed men's and women's clothes, began his fashion career as an assistant to Calvin Klein. In 1978, two years after leaving to design for Intre Sport, he won a Coty American Fashion Critics Award for women's clothing.
        Mr. Suppon produced sporty clothing like Bermuda shorts and roomy dresses. He also designed more unusual clothes, like a mohair blazer and a mohair sweatsuit for men, both in 1977.
        In his first spring collection for women, also in 1977, he booked more than $1 million worth of business, and he booked more than $5 million for his fall collection in 1977.
        ''I want to do clothes for everybody in the country,'' Mr. Suppon once said, ''not just a small group that appreciates special things.''
        Surviving is his mother, Louise, of Collinsville, Ill. A funeral will be held there Friday.
