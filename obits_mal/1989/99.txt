        D. William Violi, a dealer in historical opera and vocal recordings, died of heart disease on Thursday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 74 years old.
        The proprietor of a small record label called Oasi, Mr. Violi issued a series of rare and otherwise unavailable long-playing recordings by Enrico Caruso, Giovanni Martinelli, Luisa Tetrazzini, Rosa Ponselle and many other great singers who made records in the early decades of this century.
        His concern for sonic purity was well known among collectors, and his recordings, which he sold through mail-order and from a small store in Brooklyn, were sought after by vocal enthusiasts.
        Mr. Violi was born in Brooklyn, and began his record business as a hobby in the early 1960's, while working for a construction company.
        He is survived by five brothers - John, Ernest and Frank, of Brooklyn; Joseph, of Ridge, N. Y., and Antonio, of Yonkers - and two sisters, Helen, of Brooklyn, and Stella Salice, of West New York, N. J.
