        Robert D. Blue, a champion of the elderly who served two terms as Iowa's Governor in the 1940's, has died of complications from a stroke. He was 91 years old.
        Governor Blue died Thursday at Trinity Regional Hospital in Fort Dodge, 70 miles northwest of Des Moines.
        The son of a locomotive engineer and a teacher, Mr. Blue, a Republican, held the posts of County Attorney, City Attorney, State Representative, Speaker of the House and Lieutenant Governor. He served as Governor from 1944 to 1948 before losing a primary in his bid for a third two-year term.
        Mr. Blue made enemies in organized labor in his second term when he supported and signed a law prohibiting companies from barring non-union employees.
        Other than the four years he served as Governor in Des Moines, Mr. Blue spent his entire life in his hometown of Eagle Grove, 100 miles north of Des Moines, where he practiced law.
        He is survived by his wife, Cathlene, a daughter, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
