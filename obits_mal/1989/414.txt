        Mr. Avedissian, an Armenian, left the Soviet Union in 1931 and went to Iran, where he established a meat-packing business that became one of the largest in the country. He opened a health clinic in Teheran that serves the needy under the auspices of the Armenian Diocese.
        When he settled in the United States in 1978, Mr. Avedissian, now retired, made substantial contributions to educational and religious efforts, including Armenian studies at Columbia University. For his contributions to the Armenian Church, the Armenian Prelate, Catolicos Khoren I, bestowed on him the honororary ancient title of Prince of Cilicia.
        Mr. Avedissian is survived by his wife, Isabella, and a son, Vahan, both of Manhattan.
