        Dr. Lewis, a physicist who held degrees from Harvard University and Oxford University, joined American Telephone and Telegraph's Bell Laboratories in 1941. Two decades later, he belonged to the group that began Bellcomm Inc., an A.T.&T. subsidiary devoted chiefly to systems engineering for the Apollo moon project. He was executive director of Bell Labs when he was named Lehigh president.
        Dr. Lewis held 33 United States patents on such devices as microwave antennas and filters and digital systems for error detection.
        In 1964, he was appointed to the Naval Research Advisory Committee, which he led for two years. He also was a consultant to a Presidential advisory committee on technological issues.
        In his tenure at Lehigh the university first admitted women.
        He is survived by his wife, Emmeline; five daughters, two stepchildren and eight grandchildren.
