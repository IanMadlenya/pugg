        Edwin Letsholo Makoti, a founding member of the Pan Africanist Congress, died Friday in Harare after a long illness. He was 68.
        Mr. Makoti, who was head of publicity and information before he fell ill some months ago, is to be buried in the Zimbabwean capital on Saturday, the congress announced. He spent most of the movement's 30 years in exile.
        The congress is a guerrilla-backed movement, outlawed in South Africa, formed in 1959 to fight the South Africa's system of racial segregation.
