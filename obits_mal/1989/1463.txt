        Justice Becker, a 1953 graduate of New York Law School, was first appointed a Criminal Court judge by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1971 and was twice reappointed to that bench by Mayor Edward I. Koch, most recently last December. He had become an acting Supreme Court justice in Manhattan in September 1979 and was scheduled to retire at the end of this year.
        Before becoming a judge, Mr. Becker was an organizer of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and an unsuccessful Liberal Party candidate for judgeships and state offices.
        He was a former treasurer of the Lower East Side Neighborhoods Association and on the board of directors of the Workers Defense League, the Workmen's Circle, the American Veterans Committee and the League for Industrial Development.
        He is survived by his wife, Lola; a son, Jonathan, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Susan Ortiz of Manhattan, and a brother, Victor, of Dallas.
