        Mr. McQuillen's career as a right-handed hitting outfielder with the Browns was interrupted by three years (1943-45) of military service during World War II. He played a total of 210 games over five seasons and had a career batting average of .274. After his release by the Browns in 1947, he spent 10 years playing and managing in the minor leagues.
