        Gentry Crowell, Tennessee's Secretary of State, whose office has been at the center of a bingo and political corruption scandal, died at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center on Wednesday, eight days after shooting himself in the head in a suicide attempt at his home. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Crowell, a longtime Democrat, was elected to the Legislature in 1968 and Secretary of State in 1977. In that office, he was in charge of regulating bingo operators and spending by lobbyists and political campaigns. All three activities are a focus of Federal and state investigations that have resulted in the conviction or indictment of 22 people since January.
        Mr. Crowell testified in September and November before Federal grand juries investigating bingo corruption, in which officials are said to have been paid by the game's operators in exchange for laxity in enforcing state regulations of the industry. At the time, Mr. Crowell said he had been told by Federal agents that he was not personally a target of the investigation.
        Mr. Crowell is survived by his wife, Terrijean, and three children.
