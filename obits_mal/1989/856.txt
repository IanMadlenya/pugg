        Sir John Boyd, a miner's son who fought off leftists to lead the powerful British union of engineering workers, died Sunday at his home in Eastbourne, south of London, the BBC said today. He was 71.
        Sir John, a chairman of the Labor Party in 1967, was knighted in 1979. The cause of death was not announced.
        Sir John started his career as an engineering worker and began work as a trade union organizer in 1946. He gained the presidency of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions in 1964. He spent years fighting Communists and leftists for control of the 1.5 million-member Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers.
        From 1975 to 1982, he served as general secretary of the union, one of the largest in Britain. It includes jobs ranging from electrical engineers to manual workers like mechanics. He believed that the well-being of workers was tied to the health of the economy.
        From 1967 to 1975, he sat on the general council of the Trades Union Congress, the national organization of unions. Sir John was a director of the British Steel Corporation from 1981-86.
