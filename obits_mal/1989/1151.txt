        Dr. Isaac Starr, a pioneering researcher and teacher in the field of cardiovascular disease, died Thursday at the Cathedral Village retirement community in Roxborough, Pa. He was 94 years old.
        Dr. Starr was a 1920 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and was on the faculty there for 44 years. He was noted for his use of physics to measure the efficiency of the heart and for his research on the physiology of congestive heart failure.
        In 1939 he developed the first practical ballistocardiograph, an instrument that measures the blood output of the heart and is used to predict and measure the course of heart disease. He retired in 1961 but continued his research until 1986.
        He received the Albert Lasker Award of the American Heart Association in 1957, the Kober Medal of the Association of American Physicians in 1967 and the Burger Medal of the Free University of Amsterdam in 1977.
        He is survived by a daughter, Vidal S. Clay, of Westport, Conn.; three sons, Isaac Jr. and Harold, both of Philadelphia, and Lynford, of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; 12 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
