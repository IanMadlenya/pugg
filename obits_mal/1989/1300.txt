        Valentine Bargmann, a mathematical physicist who was an assistant to Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., died of heart failure Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. He was 81 years old and lived in Princeton.
        At his death Dr. Bargmann was professor emeritus of mathematical physics at Princeton University, where he taught for many years until his retirement in 1976.
        A native of Berlin, he left Germany when Hitler came to power and went to Zurich, where he completed studies begun at the University of Berlin, receiving his doctorate in 1936 from the University of Zurich.
        He came to the United States in 1937 and joined the Institute for Advanced Study, a research center in mathematics and the natural and social sciences that offers no curriculum or degrees, becoming Einstein's assistant in 1940. Three years later he began collaborating with the mathematician John von Neumann on work that was to help lead to the development of computers.
        Beginning in 1941 Dr. Bargmann taught graduate courses at Princeton. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he received its Wagner Medal in 1979 and Max Planck Medal in 1988, both for contributions to group theory in quantum physics.
        Dr. Bargmann's wife, Sonja, died last October. There are no immediate survivors.
