        Konrad Wolff, a pianist and the author of several books about the piano, died of heart failure Monday in Cologne, West Germany, where he was performing and lecturing. He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Wolff was born in Berlin on March 11, 1907, and studied the piano with Josef Lomba, a student of Franz Liszt. In the mid-1930's he moved to Paris, and in 1936 he began studying with the Austrian pianist Artur Schnabel.
        Mr. Wolff and his teacher remained close until Schnabel's death in 1951, and in 1972 Mr. Wolff published ''Schnabel's Interpretation of Piano Music.''
        In Paris, Mr. Wolff met the photographer Ilse Bing, whom he married in 1937. They moved to New York in 1941. In the 1950's, Mr. Wolff studied musicology at Columbia University. He made his New York concert debut in 1957, but then rarely performed as a soloist, devoting himself to chamber music and teaching.
        He was on the faculty of Peabody Institute in Baltimore through the 1950's, and at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and Montclair State College, in New Jersey, more recently.
        In 1987, he returned to the concert stage to play an 80th-birthday recital at Merkin Concert Hall. His second book, ''Masters of the Keyboard,'' was published in 1983, and he recently completed revisions for a new edition.
        He is survived by his wife.
