        A university spokesman said the cause of death had not been determined, but Dr. Twyman received a diagnosis of lung cancer 18 months ago.
        Mr. Twyman had been president of the university, a private institution, for 21 years. He came to Tulsa from the University of Missouri at St. Louis, where he had been assistant to the chancellor, director of research and a professor of education.
        Survivors include his wife, Joanne, who was with him when he died.
