        Mr. Knudsen worked on the White House photography staff in five administrations: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon. Among his most celebrated photographs were the first pictures of John F. Kennedy's son, John Jr., walking in the Oval Office at the age of 18 months in May 1962.
        He photographed the 1948 and 1952 elections of Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, the historic 1959 meeting between Eisenhower and Nikita Khrushchev, the autopsy of the slain President Kennedy in 1963, President Nixon's 1972 trips to China and the Soviet Union, Mr. Nixon's 1974 farewell in the wake of the Watergate scandal and the White House weddings of three daughters of Presidents, Lynda and Luci Johnson and Tricia Nixon.
        Mr. Knudsen was a native of Storm Lake, Iowa, and a graduate of North High School in Omaha. He was first in his graduating class at the Naval Photographic School in Pensacola, Fla. He had headed a private photography concern since 1974 and was a former commander of the Washington area flotilla of the Coast Guard Auxiliary.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Gloria Fioramonti; two daughters, Theresa Mawson of Herndon, Va., and Yvonne Becker, of Manassas, Va.; two sons, Robert, of Fairfax Station, Va., and William, of Manassas; two sisters, Geraldine West and Donna Johnson, both of Omaha, and four grandchildren.
