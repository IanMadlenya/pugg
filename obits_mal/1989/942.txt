        Mr. Jeffers joined Baker & Botts in 1969 and specialized in business litigation dealing with mergers and acquisitions. He became a partner in 1975 and senior partner in 1987.
        He was a leader in the team of lawyers who won a $10.5 billion jury award for Pennzoil because of Texaco's interference with a merger agreement that Pennzoil had negotiated with the Getty Oil Company. The parties later settled for $3 billion.
        He was a graduate of Yale College and the law school of the University of Texas.
        Mr. Jeffers, who lived in Houston, is survived by his wife, Susan; a son, John; his mother, Nell, and a sister, Mary Nell Lovett, all of Houston.
