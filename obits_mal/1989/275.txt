        Mr. Leeds also served as a member of the New York City Transit Authority Advisory Council.
        As an official of CORE, Mr. Leeds was instrumental in obtaining jobs for black workers at businesses along 125th Street in Harlem in the 1960's and 1970's and in pressuring the Sanitation Department to collect garbage in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. In 1964 he organized a student boycott of New York City public schools to press for more community control of the schools.
        At his death, Mr. Leeds worked as a proofreader at the Columbia Broadcasting System.
        Surviving are his wife, Marjorie; two daughters, Beverly Floyd of Los Angeles, and Maxine Snow of Berkeley, Calif.; three sisters, Althea Buckner and Ivy Hicks, both of Brooklyn, and Lucille Donovan of Manhattan.
