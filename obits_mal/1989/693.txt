        Tommy Thompson, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback who led the team to National Football League championships in 1948 and 1949, died today. He was 72 years old and had been suffering from brain cancer.
        After leading the Eagles to the 1947 championship game, which they lost to the Chicago Cardinals, Thompson took Philadelphia to its first title a year later as the Eagles beat the Cardinals, 7-0. He threw a league-leading 25 touchdown passes that year.
        The following year, Thompson led the team to a 12-1 record, which included a 14-0 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in the championship game.
        After retiring from the Eagles, Thompson coached in the Canadian Football League, and later held coaching positions with the Cardinals and the University of Arkansas.
        Thompson attended the University of Tulsa and played with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1940 before joining the Eagles.
        He is survived by his wife, Dodie.
