        Justice Ascione was born in New York City and educated at City College. He earned his law degree at St. John's University.
        He was admitted to the bar in 1941 and from 1954 to 1958 he was the New York City Tax Commissioner. He served as a judge in the Municipal and Civil Courts and in 1966 was elected to the State Supreme Court, where he served until illness forced him to retire in December.
        Justice Ascione drew worldwide attention in August 1977 by ruling that Dr. Renee Richards, a 42-year-old Manhattan opthalmologist who had had a sex-change operation, did not have to take a sex-chromosome test to qualify for the women's open tennis championships in Forest Hills.
        Justice Ascione is survived by his wife, Joan; a son, Joseph, of Manhattan; a daughter, Diane Horowitz of Bloomfield, N.J.; two brothers, Dr. Joseph, of Flushing, Queens, and Hector, of Fishkill, N.Y.; a sister, Helen Fioretti of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
