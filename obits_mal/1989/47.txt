        Max Laemmle, whose chain of art theaters exposed Los Angeles moviegoers to such international film-makers as Ingmar Bergman, Costa-Gavras and Francois Truffaut, died of pulmonary congestion Friday night at his home. He was 82 years old and lived Beverly Hills, Calif.
        A native of Laupheim, Germany, Mr. Laemmle came to Los Angeles in 1938 from Paris. Before World War II, he had headed the French branch of Universal Pictures, of which his uncle, Carl Laemmle, was president.
        In California, Max Laemmle founded Laemmle Theaters and for many years held something of a monopoly on foreign language and art films in the Los Angeles area. The chain now has 14 screens and also features popular series of classics and films of intellectual appeal.
        His theaters often showed movies unlikely to turn a profit when Mr. Laemmle wanted to introduce viewers to a young foreign film-maker. Two such directors were Claude Lelouch and Jean-Luc Godard, and for his effort, Mr. Laemmle was decorated by the French Government.
        Other directors promoted by Mr. Laemmle included Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Bernardo Bertolucci and, most recently, Pedro Almodovar. Los Angeles's premier art threater, Los Feliz, belonged to the Laemmle chain until 1987, when he lost its lease.
        Mr. Laemmle is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Bobby Schulman; his son and partner, Robert, of Santa Monica; a daughter, Mimi Reisbaum, of Los Angeles; a brother, Kurt, of Hermosa Beach, Calif., and four grandchildren.
