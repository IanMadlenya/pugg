        In the 1920's, Mr. Dellums worked with A. Philip Randolph to organize the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first international union to be founded and led by blacks. He was elected vice president of the union in 1929 and became president in 1966.
        In 1959, Mr. Dellums was appointed to California's first Fair Employment Practice Commission, on which he served for 26 years. It was later named the Fair Employment and Housing Commission.
        He was also the first regional chairman for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People when 18 states formed an N.A.A.C.P. region in 1948.
        Mr. Dellums was a native of Corsicana, Tex. He was the uncle of Representative Ronald V. Dellums of California and is also survived by a daughter, Marva Dellums of Oakland.
