        Mr. Lattin, a 1938 graduate of the University of Delaware, was a mechanical engineer with several concerns before joining Kellogg in 1965. He was elected president in 1971 and under his leadership the international firm, now a subsidiary of Dresser Industries, expanded to about 3,000 engineers at its Houston headquarters. In 1978 he was elected president of Kellogg's parent company, Pullman Inc., a position he held until his retirement in 1980.
