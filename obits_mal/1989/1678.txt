        Stanley W. Vogel, a retired businessman and co-founder of a chain of 800 Casual Corner clothing stores, died Saturday at the Wintonbury Continuing Care center in Bloomfield, Conn. He was 71 years old and suffered a stroke in June.
        In the late 1940's, Mr. Vogel, a graduate of the Wharton School, capitalized on a growing trend toward casual attire as families moved to the suburbs, and founded the first Casual Corner store in West Hartford. The chain was sold to the U.S. Shoe Corporation in 1970 and he became president of its specialty retailing division. He retired in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; three sons, Robert, of Boca Raton, Fla., James, of Windsor, Conn., and Philip, of Bloomfield; two sisters, Lucille Barwell, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Esther Oelbaum, of Naples, Fla.; a brother, Walter, of West Hartford, and a granddaughter.
