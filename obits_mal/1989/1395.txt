        Robert C. Hoag, a leader of the Seneca Nation of Indians in western New York State, died after a long illness yesterday in Salamanca, N.Y., where he lived. He was 53 years old. Mr. Hoag was a lifelong resident of Salamanca, which lies largely within the Senecas' 22,000-acre Allegany Reservation, the state's largest. He was president of the Seneca Nation for three terms, the most recent in 1986.
        He served in the United States Army in the Panama Canal Zone from 1955 to 1957. A decade later he went into the construction business. In the 1970's he negotiated the transfer of Seneca land to the state for highway construction in exchange for benefits to the nation and to individual members of the tribe.
        Mr. Hoag is survived by his wife, Rosalyn; two sons, Lance and Lane, and a daughter, Jade, all of Salamanca.
