        Dr. Ernest W. Saward, who was instrumental in establishing prepaid health insurance plans in Portland, Ore., Denver, Cleveland and Rochester, died Tuesday at his home in San Jose, Calif. He was 74 years old.
        In the 1940's Dr. Saward was medical director of the Kaiser-Permanente Health Plan in Portland, one of the country's first health maintenance organizations, which offer medical care on a prepaid basis.
        After establishing similar plans in several other cities, he moved in 1969 to Rochester, where he had earlier graduated from the University of Rochester Medical School. While setting up the first of three health maintenance organizations in that city, he joined the faculty of the medical school as associate dean for extramural affairs and professor of social medicine.
        Dr. Saward, who received his undergraduate degree from Colgate University, served 10 years on the New York State Hospital Review and Planning Council. In 1987 he received the Gustav O. Lienhard Award of the National Institute of Medicine for improving personal health care services in the United States.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, Thomas of Portland and Lawrence of San Diego, and two daughters, Susan Filson of New Orleans and Christianne Saward of Greenbrae, Calif.
