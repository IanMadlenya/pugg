        Mr. Gluskin was born in New York City and played in his first band with a boyhood friend, the comedian Jimmy Durante. Later, Mr. Gluskin toured Europe with the Whiteman orchestra and then settled in France. In 1927, he became leader of the Playboys, a Detroit jazz band stranded in Paris. The Playboys made more than 700 recordings in Paris and Berlin.
        Mr. Gluskin returned to New York and was hired by CBS in 1935. He was named director of music for CBS Radio in 1937.
        He directed the music for the 1938 Orson Welles broadcast of ''War of the Worlds,'' about a Martian invasion.
        In 1948, he became music director for CBS-TV and presided over the network's shows for 10 years.
