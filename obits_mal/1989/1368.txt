        Mr. Eberson was the son of John Eberson, one of the country's most influential theater architects who earned the nickname ''Opera House John'' at the beginning of the century by designing numerous small-town auditoriums.
        The two Ebersons practiced in partnership from 1926 until the father's death in 1954. In later years Mr. Eberson renovated many of the playhouses originally designed by his father. He was also the architect of many other structures, including the Canadian Film Board studios in Montreal.
        Mr. Eberson was a native of Hamilton, Ohio. He received his architectural degree from the University of Pennsylvania. In World War II as a colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers he was chief of operations in construction in the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations. He also supervised the design and construction of several military projects in upstate New York, including Camp Shanks and Stewart Air Force Base and airfields in Newark, Glens Falls and Plattsburg.
        Mr. Eberson is survived by his wife, the former Peggy Latta; a stepdaughter, Suzanne Callahan of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a sister, Elsa Kyle of Marco Island, Fla., and a step-grandson.
