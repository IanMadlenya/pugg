        Alphonse (Allie Boy) Persico, an organized-crime leader who was serving a 25-year Federal sentence, died of cancer of the larynx yesterday at the medical center for Federal prisoners in Springfield, Mo. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Persico was identified by the authorities as an underboss of the Joseph Colombo crime family, one of the largest in the Mafia. He was convicted of extortion in 1980 but went into hiding before sentencing and was not apprehended for seven years. He began serving his term in November 1987 at the Federal Correctional Facility in Lompoc, Calif.
        Mr. Persico was born in New York. He was in trouble with the law from an early age but it was not until he was in his 40's that he came to prominence in the Colombo family. When his brother, Carmine, who is called Junior by his associates and sometimes referred to as the Snake, went to prison in the 1970's, Alphonse Persico became acting head of the Colombo family. Disappeared Before Sentencing
        In June 1980, shortly before he was to appear before Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn for a pre-sentencing hearing on his extortion conviction, Mr. Persico disappeared. It was not until Nov. 9, 1987 that Federal marshals, following a trail of false identities and aliases, traced Mr. Persico to an apartment in West Hartford, Conn., where he was taken into custody without a struggle.
        When he was returned to Brooklyn, he was given a 25-year sentence by Judge Thomas C. Platt of Federal District Court.
        Mr. Persico is survived by his wife, Dora, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Suzanne Farese, also of Fort Lauderdale, and two brothers, Theodore, of Brooklyn, and Carmine.
