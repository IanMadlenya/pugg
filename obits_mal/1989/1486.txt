        Mr. Krause conducted secret research on the development of radar for the Naval Research Laboratory and was sent to Germany to interrogate V-2 rocket scientists at the end of World War II.
        From 1947 to 1951 he was involved in the first atomic testing at Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific.
        Mr. Krause moved to Southern California in 1954 to be director of the Lockheed Missile and Space Corporation. He left in 1955 to start the Systems Research Corporation in Newport Beach.
        Systems Research was acquired by the Ford Motor Company in 1956 and eventually became Ford Aerospace. At Ford, Mr. Krause served as vice president for research and development. He retired in 1978.
        He received a doctorate in nuclear physics from the University of Wisconsin in 1938.
        Mr. Krause is survived by his wife, Betsy, four daughters, two stepchildren and eight grandchildren.
