        He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Southern Methodist. After teaching and serving as a school principal in San Antonio, Mr. Tate returned to the university in 1945 as assistant dean of students.
        He was a former chairman of the Independent College Funds of America and former president of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the Methodist Church.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marian Cleary; two children from a previous marriage, Willis Sr. and JoAnn Withers, both of Dallas, and three grandchildren.
