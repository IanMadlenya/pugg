        Damaso Perez Prado, the band leader who helped start a North American mambo craze in the 1950's, died Thursday at his home in Mexico City after a stroke. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Perez Prado was born in Cuba and studied classical piano. He performed in the early 40's with a well-known Cuban group, Casino de la Playa, and in 1948 he moved to Mexico and began recording mambos.
        After Sonny Burke, the American band leader, released a version of Mr. Perez Prado's ''Que Rico el Mambo'' as ''More Mambo,'' RCA Records began releasing Mr. Perez Prado's own recordings to the pop market. With such recordings as ''Mambo No. 8'' and ''Patricia,'' he became the first big-band mambo player to reach non-Latin audiences in the United States. In his first West Coast tour, in 1951, he played for mixed audiences in the thousands.
        According to John Storm Roberts's ''Latin Tinge,'' a history of Latin American music, Mr. Perez Prado ''developed a bright octave sound with an ingenious and fairly simple use of contrasts between brass and reeds, and punchy rhythm sections based on such fine percussionists as Mongo Santamaria.'' Some of his most popular songs, like ''Moliendo Cafe,'' greatly simplified and diluted Cuban rhythms, but Mr. Perez Prado also experimented with jazz and released a few extended compositions like ''Concierto Para Bongo.'' His popularity reached a peak in the mid-1950's with mambos and the cha-cha ''Cherry Pink and Apple-Blossom White,'' a No. 1 pop hit in 1955.
