       David H. Geiger, an engineer who invented an air-supported fabric roof system used for almost half the domed stadiums in the world, died, apparently of cardiac arrest, Sunday at the Lotte Hotel in Seoul, South Korea, where he was traveling on business. He was 54 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        David H. Geiger, an engineer who invented an air-supported fabric roof system used for almost half the domed stadiums in the world, died, apparently of cardiac arrest, Sunday at the Lotte Hotel in Seoul, South Korea, where he was traveling on business. He was 54 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        Dr. Geiger received more than a dozen patents for long-span roof systems. His air-supported system covers the Metrodome in Minneapolis, the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich., the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis, the Tokyo Giants baseball stadium and arenas built at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul for weight lifting, gymnastics and fencing.
        He also invented a cabledome roof being completed for the Florida Seacoast Dome in St. Petersburg.
        Dr. Geiger was honored for his lifetime work by the American Institute of Architects in 1986, and he received an award for innovation from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1983. He was a former president of the New York Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that builds housing for the poor.
        Dr. Geiger, a native of Philadelphia, received a bachelor's degree from Drexel, a master's from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in civil engineering from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gloria Bohm; three daughters, Linda, Kristina and Karma; his mother, Elaine, of Sarasota, Fla., and two brothers, Linwood, of Philadelphia, and Joseph, of Marion, Ohio.
