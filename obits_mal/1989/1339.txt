        Jean Leguay, a former French police official during the Nazi occupation who was charged with committing crimes against humanity, has died in a Paris hospital after a year-long battle with liver cancer, his lawyer said today. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Leguay was a senior police official in the Vichy government, which collaborated with the Nazis during their World War II occupation of France. He faced two charges for aiding in the deportation of French Jews, but neither had come to trial. Under French law, there is no time limit on prosecutions for crimes against humanity.
        In 1979, he was charged for his role in the July 1942 roundup of 12,884 Jews -including 4,051 children - who were gathered in a Paris cycling stadium, the Velodrome d'Hiver, and deported to Nazi death camps.
        The second set of charges, filed in 1986, involved the deportation of 444 Jews from Paris in August 1942.
        When he was charged in 1979, Mr. Leguay issued a statement saying he ''never had any concern from 1940 to 1944 other than protecting the French from their occupants.'' He was detained briefly in that year then released pending trial.
        Serge Klarsfeld, the French lawyer who led the effort to bring criminal charges against Mr. Leguay, accused him of persuading the Germans to include Jewish children as well as adults in the roundups.
        Mr. Leguay's lawyer said Mr. Leguay ''did nothing but obey the orders of the Interior Secretary at the time.'' That the investigation ''dragged on for 10 years clearly proved there was nothing in the dossier,'' he said.
