        Irving (Ash) Resnick, a gambling figure credited with bringing high rollers to the Las Vegas Strip, died Wednesday after a long bout with cancer. He was 72 years old.
        His Las Vegas career spanned four decades and included stints at a number of casinos. He organized the first junkets for high-stakes gamblers that are now a fixture in the trade.
        Allegations that he had organized crime associates persisted. In 1974, eight sticks of dynamite were found under his car. Two years later he was shot at while leaving Caesars Palace.
