        John E. Hunt, a Republican who lost his seat in the House of Representatives to James J. Florio in 1974, died Friday at Underwood-Memorial Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Pitman, N.J. He was hospitalized two weeks ago for treatment of a heart condition.
        Mr. Hunt was elected to the House in 1967, representing the First Congressional District, which covers parts of Camden and Gloucester Counties.
        Mr. Hunt, a conservative, was a strong supporter of President Richard M. Nixon. Some said that loyalty, in the wake of the Watergate scandal that cost three other New Jersey Republicans their House seats in 1974, gave the election to Mr. Florio. Mr. Florio still holds the seat and is now the Democratic gubernatorial candidate.
        In 1930 Mr. Hunt joined the State Police, rising to lieutenant before retiring in 1959. He was the Gloucester County sheriff from 1959 through 1963, when he won election to the first of two terms in the State Senate.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a daughter, Deborah Hunt Warren of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.
