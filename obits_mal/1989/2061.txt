        James Karr, a former leading dancer with the Paul Taylor Dance Company, died of AIDS on Nov. 11 at his home in San Diego. He was 32 years old.
        Born in Rockville Centre, L.I., Mr. Karr became involved in dance as an acting student at the State University College at Brockport, N.Y. He received a scholarship to the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and subsequently performed with the companies of Pearl Lang and Joyce Trisler.
        Mr. Karr performed with the Taylor company from 1982 to 1987, dancing lead roles choreographed for him by Mr. Taylor in ''A Musical Offering,'' ''Syzygy,'' ''Roses'' and ''Last Look.'' He was known for the delicacy, fine detail and mercurial lightness of his dancing, and for the special dignity of his stage presence.
        Mr. Karr taught at the Taylor studio after he left the company, then moved to San Diego with his longtime companion, Bill Cratty, with whom he founded the Bill Cratty Dance Theater.
        Mr. Karr is survived by his mother, Patricia, of Wantagh, L.I.; two sisters, Kathleen Burton of North Babylon, L.I., and Donna Siegenthaler of Wantagh, and two brothers, Stephen, of Freeport, L.I., and Richard, of Levittown, L.I.
        Mr. Karr will be commemorated in a program at St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue and 10th Street, on Dec. 9 at 2 P.M.
