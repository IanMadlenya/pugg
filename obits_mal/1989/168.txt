        Robert Watson Pomeroy, a former New York State legislator, died of heart failure on Jan. 4 at his home in Millbrook, N.Y. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Pomeroy, a 1924 graduate of Yale University, was a Republican member of the State Legislature for almost 20 years, representing residents of Dutchess County. He served as an Assemblyman from 1948 to 1964 and as a State Senator from 1964 to 1967.
        He was active in efforts to protect the environment. As chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Natural Resources in the mid-1960's, Mr. Pomeroy led an effort to prevent construction of a pump-storage generating plant at Storm King Mountain along the Hudson River. Plans for the plant were eventually dropped in 1980.
        He is survived by a daughter, Marnie, of Ottawa, and a son, Robert 3d, of Limington, Me.
