        Ali Hafid, a Moroccan drummer whose onstage performances in the Broadway musical ''Zorba'' enhanced his popularity, died of lung cancer Friday in St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hafid came to the New York World's Fair in 1964 to direct and play the drum for Morocco's national musical ensemble. He stayed on after the fair closed, playing his hand drum, called a dumbek, with jazz, classical and Near Eastern groups in clubs and concert halls.
        His work with the Feenjon Group, an ensemble based in the Feenjon Cafe in Greenwich Village, led to his portrayal of the drummer, Kanakis, in 1968 in ''Zorba.''
        Mr. Hafid is survived by his wife, Joyce Baldwin, and a brother, Abdullah Hafid.
