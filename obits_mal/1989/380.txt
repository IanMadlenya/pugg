        Richard Dyer Sanborn Jr., who became chairman and chief executive officer of Conrail on Jan. 1, died yesterday at Greater Baltimore Medical Center after suddenly becoming ill at his Baltimore home. He was 52 years old.
        A Conrail statement said last night that he died of an apparent heart attack.
        The board of directors of the large freight rail line went outside the company last March to name Mr. Sanborn the chief operating officer. He later was elected chairman to succeed L. Stanley Crane upon his retirement last month.
        Mr. Sanborn, who had 27 years of experience in the railroad industry, came from the CSX Corporation, a diversified railroad company. There, he was president of Distribution Services Inc., the company's transportation sales and marketing unit based in Baltimore.
        He had previously worked at the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Seaboard Coast Line and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad.
        A native of Sanbornville, N.H., he graduated magna cum laude from the University of New Hampshire in 1957 and received a law degree from Harvard in 1960.
        Mr. Crane brought him to Conrail after another potential successor to the top post, Stuart M. Reed, was passed over and resigned as president and chief operating officer at the end of 1987.
        People familiar with the situation said at the time that Mr. Crane had wanted Mr. Reed to leave so the the person chosen for the chairman's position would have some time to prepare for it.
        Mr. Sanborn's survivors include his second wife, Hilda Joan Penner; his father, Richard D. Sr. of Sanbornville, N.H., and two children, Cynthia and Darren.
