        Ralph Black, a widely known arts manager and advocate, died of cardiac arrest Monday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 69 years old and lived in Bethesda.
        Mr. Black's managerial career took him from the Chattanooga (Tenn.) Symphony to the Buffalo Philharmonic, the Baltimore Symphony, the National Symphony and the National Ballet in Washington.
        From 1973 to 1981 he was the executive director of the American Symphony Orchestra League, the Washington-based national association of American orchestras. In 1978, Harold C. Schonberg described him in The New York Times as a ''super musical salesman, filled with a sense of mission, a natural propagandist.''
        Since 1981 he had been vice president for consulting for the league, traveling widely around the country. He was also the founding chairman of the Association of American Dance Companies.
        He is survived by his wife, Eva; three sons: Eric, of Bethesda; Ralph, of New York City, and Dean, of Laurel, Md.; a daughter, Johana Masters of Denver, and a grandson.
