       Toni Matt, a pioneer in competitive and recreational skiing in the United States, died, apparently of a heart attack, on Wednesday in Pawling, N.Y. He was 69 years old.  Mr. Matt, who was born in St. Anton, Austria, came to the United States in 1938 with a group of Austrian skiers. On April 16, 1939, he skied down Tuckerman's Ravine on Mount Washington in New Hampshire in 6 minutes 29.4 seconds, reaching a speed of 85 miles an hour.
        Toni Matt, a pioneer in competitive and recreational skiing in the United States, died, apparently of a heart attack, on Wednesday in Pawling, N.Y. He was 69 years old.  Mr. Matt, who was born in St. Anton, Austria, came to the United States in 1938 with a group of Austrian skiers. On April 16, 1939, he skied down Tuckerman's Ravine on Mount Washington in New Hampshire in 6 minutes 29.4 seconds, reaching a speed of 85 miles an hour. His time for the eight-mile run down slopes with, in some places, 65-degree drops has never been bettered.
        Mr. Matt, the United States national downhill champion in 1939 and 1941, returned to Mount Washington last month for the 50th anniversary of his run, regarded as one of skiing's greatest feats.
        In World War II, Mr. Matt was a second lieutenant with the Army's 10th Mountain Division, a unit that used ski troops, and saw action in the Aleutian Islands.
        He suffered a severely broken leg in 1951 at Sun Valley, Idaho, which ended his racing career. The leg was in a cast three years before a surgeon operated successfully. He then resumed skiing, teaching and coaching until his retirement from the sport in 1980 after serving as an official at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid. He was inducted into the Ski Hall of Fame in 1967. Since 1955, Mr. Matt was also the superintendent of the Quaker Hill Country Club in Pawling.
        He is survived by his wife, Stella Lopresti Matt, three daughters and two sons.
