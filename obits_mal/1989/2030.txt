        Nicholas G. Kuhn, a retired business executive, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Kuhn emigrated from Hungary to Manhattan in 1908. He graduated from City College in 1919 and joined the Miles Shoe Company in 1924. He was named vice president in 1935 and retired in 1961. In the 1940's, with silk stockings no longer available, he drew large crowds to Miles outlets by selling nylon stockings.
        He is survived by his son, Robert, of Manhattan; a sister, Elizabeth Manton, and a brother, George, both of Miami, and two grandsons.
