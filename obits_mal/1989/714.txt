        H. Bolton Seed, a civil engineer who was an expert in earthquake engineering, died of cancer Sunday at his home in Orinda, Calif. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Seed, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, conducted major research in structural engineering design, highway engineering, geotechnical engineering and earthquake engineering. He was most noted for his work on soil behavior during earthquakes.
        In 1981 he was part of an international team called in to study the Aswan Dam in Egypt after earthquakes there raised questions about its strength. He also served as a consultant to dams in Pakistan and California and the Alaska pipeline project.
        In 1987 Mr. Seed received the National Medal of Science from President Reagan for his ''pioneering contributions to the art and science of civil engineering.'' He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences.
        Survivors include his wife, Muriel, a son and a daughter.
