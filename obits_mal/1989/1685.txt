        Mr. Patterson, a lifetime director of the American Petroleum Institute, was part of the effort in the early 1960's that laid pipeline from Linden, N.J., under the Verrazano Narrows to Kennedy International Airport, providing the airport with jet fuel.
        In the 1950's, he took over Buckeye Pipe Line, an independent company then in precarious financial condition, and turned it into a profitable venture, later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad. He retired in 1972 and moved to Florida in 1983.
        Mr. Patterson, who was born in Philadelphia, graduated from Yale University. He was president of the Meadow Club in Southampton, L.I., one of the country's oldest lawn tennis clubs, for 22 years. He was a former director of the Interlake Steel Company, Howmet-Pechiney and Northwest Energy.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Cochran; three sons, G. Stuart, of Denver, Robert G., of Madison, N.J., and Lee W., of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a daughter, Patrica L., of Los Angeles; a brother, A. Willing, of Rosemont, Pa., and eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
