        Mr. Grimes, who played an electric four-string guitar, was born in Newport News, Va. and began appearing in amateur shows in Washington, where he performed on drums and piano and also danced. In 1940 he joined the group Cats and the Fiddle, an early rhythm-and-blues group. During the 40's, Mr. Grimes and his band, the Rocking Highlanders, recorded behind a myriad of blues singers. His solos contributed to early rock-and-roll guitar playing. Influenced by Charlie Christian
        But it is as a jazz musician that Mr. Grimes will be remembered. Deeply influenced by the guitarist Charlie Christian, his playing had a tough refinement that always swung, even though his execution was occasionally sloppy. An association with the pianist Art Tatum, which began in 1943 and lasted a year, placed him firmly in the public spotlight; while Mr. Tatum was a virtuoso, Mr. Grimes acted as his alter ego, keeping the group's rhythm rock hard. During that period, he collaborated with some of the best jazz musicans of the time, including Coleman Hawkins, Buck Clayton, Johnny Hodges, Lips Page and Ike Quebec.
        In 1944, Mr. Grimes recorded four sides for Savoy Records, all of which featured the saxophonist Charlie Parker in some of his earliest efforts. In recent years, Mr. Grimes performed at clubs around Manhattan.
        There are no survivors. A funeral service is to be held tonight at 8 P.M. at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue and 54th Street.
