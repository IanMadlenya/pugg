        Msgr. Arthur Francis Bukowski, president of Aquinas College here for 32 years, died Tuesday of heart disease. He was 83 years old.
        Monsignor Bukowski, a graduate of Catholic University of America in Washington, was ordained in 1933.
        He was president of Aquinas from 1937, when the school was called Catholic Junior College, until 1969, when he resigned to do missionary work in Berea, Ky. In 1940 the college expanded to a four-year curriculum and changed its name to Aquinas.
