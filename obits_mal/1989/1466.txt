        Mr. Steele gained national attention in April 1963 when Wheeling, then the country's 11th largest steel maker, raised its prices in defiance of President John F. Kennedy's price stabilization program. Mr. Kennedy did not pursue any action against Wheeling.
        Mr. Steele, born Jan. 1, 1900, in Union, W. Va., was a radio operator in the Navy's Atlantic Fleet in World War I. He received a degree in metallurgical engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 1923 and got a job as a laborer at the mouth of a blast furnace of the Crucible Steel Company. By 1930 he was a superintendent there.
        In 1943 he joined Wheeling as head of a pipe-making plant. He rose to become superintendent of the company's largest unit, the 6,000-employee steel plant at Steubenville, Ohio, in 1950. He was chosen president of Wheeling in 1958 and chairman in 1960. He retired in 1965.
        Mr. Steele is survived by a son, William Jr., of San Antonio; two daughters, Virginia Abdou, of Pittsburgh, and Marion Kelly, of Bloomfield Hills., Mich., three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
