        Lord Harding, a commander of Britain's forces in North Africa during World War II, died today at his home in Nether Compton in southwestern England after a long illness, his family said. He was 92 years old.
        Lord Harding was also British Governor and commander in chief in Cyprus, where in the mid-1950's he received death threats from the National Organization of Cypriot Combatants, the guerrilla group known by the initials E.O.K.A., which sought union with Greece.
        As a brigadier general, he commanded Britain's Seventh Armored Division in the battle of El Alamein, in which the British Eighth Army turned the tide against the German forces of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in North Africa.
        General Harding was badly wounded in the battle when a shell exploded beside the tank on which he was standing.
        He was appointed commander in chief of the British Army of the Rhine in 1951 and became chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1952 before being promoted to the rank of field marshal a year later. He was elevated to the peerage in 1958. Orders Banishment of Archbishop
        During his two-year tour in Cyprus, one of his most famous actions was to order the banishment of Archbishop Makarios to the Seychelles. Archbishop Makarios was later President of Cyprus, which became independent in 1960.
        He was born Allan Francis Harding in 1896, and in adulthood dropped his two Christian names in favor of John.
        In World War I he served in Egypt, took part in the Gallipoli and Palestine campaigns, was wounded twice and won the Military Cross.
