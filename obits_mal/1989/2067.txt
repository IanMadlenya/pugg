        Mr. Beck was born in Zumbrota, Minn. He started his career as an artist in Chicago and went to New York when his publisher, Fawcett, moved there from the Midwest in 1939.
        The strip created by Mr. Beck was a whimsical serial about Billy Batson, a 15-year-old newsboy who transformed himself into the superhero Captain Marvel when he spoke the magic word ''Shazam.'' In the 1940's, Captain Marvel Comics sold more than one million copies a month, the most successful comic book in history.
        Mr. Beck moved to the Miami area in the early 1940's. He stopped drawing Captain Marvel in the early 1950's when Fawcett shut down its comics operation.
        Surviving are a daughter, Gladys McGuire, of Gainesville; a son, Charles, of Bartow, Fla.; a brother, Willis, of Minneapolis; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
