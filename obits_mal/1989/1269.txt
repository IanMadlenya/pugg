        Benjamin Tammuz, a Russian-born Israeli author, sculptor and advocate of Jewish-Arab coexistence, died of cancer Wednesday. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Tammuz's written work - dozens of books, short stories and satirical newspaper columns - included humorous and introspective portrayals of Israel's pioneer generation. He was also among the leaders of the Canaanite Movement, which sought to build a new Hebrew nation, as opposed to a Jewish one, to circumvent conflict with the Arabs. The movement never gained support in Israel and is now mostly credited for its important role in transforming biblical Hebrew into a modern language.
        Mr. Tammuz studied history at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1950-51 and later edited ''Art in Israel,'' a survey of Israeli art trends in the 1960's. He was also a sculptor and participated in many group shows. One of his works, a monument to Israeli pilots, is at Independence Park in Tel Aviv.
