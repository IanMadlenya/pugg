        Max Grundig, a radio and television pioneer who founded a major producer of top-quality high fidelity systems and radios, died in a hospital on Friday. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Grundig built his company up after World War II to become a market leader in home entertainment products and a symbol of West Germany's economic miracle.
        But Grundig A.G.'s market share came under increasing pressure in the late 1970's from cheaper Japanese products, and in 1980 the company suffered its first losses.
        Grundig's answer to the threat from the Far East was to form Euro, a common front of European manufacturers against the Japanese.
        It did not stave off the challenge, and the company was forced to close 11 plants and cut its workforce from 35,000 to 29,000. In 1984, the Dutch Philips group bought out nearly a one-third share and took over the management.
        Colleagues described Mr. Grundig, the son of a warehouse manager, as a hard worker who made decisions alone and interested himself in the minutest detail of his business.
        ''Order is holy to him,'' an official company description of him said. ''It means as much as half his life.''
        Mr. Grundig's father died when he was 12, and his mother had to support her five children on a factory wage. Young Max started his working life as a plumber's apprentice but by the age of 22 had become independent, setting up his own radio shop with a friend.
        Later he started producing electronic parts and transformers, and he formed his company in 1947.
        Mr. Grundig is survived by his wife, Chantal.
