        Robert Pirosh, who won a 1949 Academy Award for his World War II screenplay ''Battleground'' and who helped write the Marx Brothers classic ''A Day at the Races,'' died of heart failure last Monday. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Pirosh's award-winning drama was based on the Battle of the Bulge, in which United States troops were surrounded by the German Army for eight days at Bastogne, Belgium, until Allied reinforcements broke the hold. He was a veteran of that battle, having served then with the 35th Division.
        In a three-decade Hollywood career, Mr. Pirosh was a writer, producer or director on a dozen well-known films and a similar number of television series.
        He was writer or co-writer of ''A Day at the Races'' for the Marx Brothers; ''I Married a Witch''; ''Up in Arms,'' the 1944 Danny Kaye comedy; ''Hell Is for Heroes''; ''A Gathering of Eagles''; ''What's So Bad About Feeling Good?''; ''Go for Broke,'' the 1951 recounting of Japanese-American soldiers who fought in Europe during World War II; ''Valley of the Kings'' and ''Spring Reunion.''
        On some of those films, including ''Go for Broke'' and ''Valley of the Kings,'' he also served as director.
        As a television writer, he wrote the pilot programs for ''Laramie'' and ''Combat.'' He also wrote several segments of ''Hawaii Five-O,'' ''Ellery Queen,'' ''Mannix,'' ''Bonanza,'' ''Ironside,'' ''The Waltons'' and ''Barnaby Jones.''
        Mr. Pirosh remained active through his later years, most recently by teaching writing classes at the University of Southern California, said Nancy Pirosh, his former wife.
        Survivors include two sons, a daughter and his sister.
