        Hassan Fathy, an Egyptian architect who championed the use of indigenous construction techniques to build housing for the world's poor, died Thursday in Cairo, the Associated Press reported. He was 89 years old.
        In 1969 Mr. Fathy wrote ''Architecture for the Poor,'' which became a standard classroom text and inspired a generation of builders trying to solve the problems of housing for the poor in the third world.
        In 1980, Mr. Fathy won a special Aga Khan Award for Architecture and $100,000.
