        Mr. Bassett, who lived in Mitchellville, Md., was returning to his home from Denmark, where he was serving as a delegate to the International Metalworkers' Federation of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.
        Born in Alabama, Mr. Bassett joined the union in 1951 as a journeyman sheet metal worker in Birmingham. In 1961, after heading his local in Baton Rouge, La., he joined the Washington-based international office of the union, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        In 1970 he became director of the union's organizing, where he served until 1985. That same year he was appointed secretary-treasurer.
        Mr. Bassett is survived by his wife, Marie; two sons, two daughters, three brothers, two sisters and nine grandchildren.
