        John M. Cotter, who began working in a Minnesota hardware store as a clerk and later founded the True Value hardware chain, died of cancer on Monday. He was 85 years old and lived in Evanston.
        Mr. Cotter, a native of St. Paul, worked as a hardware store clerk while in grade school and as a department manager and buyer after high school. He moved to Chicago in the early 1940's.
        In 1948 he started his first store and distribution center, Cotter & Co. That year his company had sales of $385,000 and 25 dealers.
        Today nearly one-fourth of the hardware stores in the United States belong to the Cotter organization, which he served as chairman. True Value sales exceed $2 billion and membership includes more than 6,000 True Value stores and 2,000 V&S variety stores.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, Michael and Daniel; two daughters, Mary Fee and Patti Kiggins, and eight grandchildren.
