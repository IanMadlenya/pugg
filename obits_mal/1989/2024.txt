        Mr. Drazen, a native New Yorker, started his career as a warehouse auctioneer and received his first license in 1930 at the age of 17. He spent nearly 50 years as an appraiser, auctioneer and antiques dealer in Manhattan and the Bronx. He joined the Tepper Galleries as a partner in 1960, remaining until his retirement in 1986.
        He was a former president of the Appraisers Association of America. He was also a former treasurer and a board member of the Hebrew Hospital for the Chronic Sick in the Bronx, of which his father, Samuel, was a founder.
        During World War II, Mr. Drazen was a sergeant in the Army and served in combat with Gen. George S. Patton's Second Armored Division, for which he received the Bronze Star.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Regina Mahar; a son from a former marriage, Max, of Manhattan, and two brothers, Irving, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Martin, of White Plains.
