Leningrad television said he died in a car accident. Mr. Tovstonogov was chief producer at the Maxim Gorky Bolshoi Drama Theater in Leningrad.
        ''Many believe that Soviet culture has suffered an irretrievable loss,'' Tass said. Mr. Tovstonogov, a native of Tbilisi, Georgia, was named chief producer at the theater in 1956. The Tass statement credited him with having ''created a golden age of theater.''
        Mr. Tovstonogov was for many years a member of the Supreme Soviet and secretary of the governing board of the theater workers' union, Tass said.
