        Mr. Rosenfeld, who came here in 1922, became an American citizen five years later. In 1938, he returned to Austria to bring his mother to America, only to discover that she had been jailed by the Nazis. He freed her and then helped other families immigrate to the United States.
        In the early 40's, Mr. Rosenfeld became president of one of the first interracial summer camps in New York State, Camp Woodlea.
        Mr. Rosenfeld retired as director of the eastern division of the Chicago Printed String Company in 1958.
        Surviving are his wife, Sonya; two sons, Peter and Jon; a daughter, Erika; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
