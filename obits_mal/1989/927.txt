        Virgil Geddes, a playwright turned postmaster, died of cancer yesterday at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Togus, Me. He was 92 years old and had homes in Brookfield, Conn., and Swan's Island, Me.
        The Provincetown Playhouse produced his drama ''The Earth Between'' in 1929 with a cast that included Bette Davis.
        In the 1930's Mr. Geddes founded a playhouse in Brookfield, Conn. He also co-directed the Federal Theater Project's experimental section, which produced his play ''Native Ground'' in New York City in 1937.
        Mr. Geddes wrote about his later experiences in Brookfield in the book ''Country Postmaster,'' published in 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, Minna, and a sister, Ruth Calmer, of St. Louis.
