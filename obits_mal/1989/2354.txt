        George Selden Thompson, the author of ''The Cricket in Times Square'' and other children's books, died of complications from a gastrointestinal hemorrhage yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 60 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.
        Mr. Thompson, who wrote under the name George Selden, was best known for ''The Cricket in Times Square'' (1960), which won a John Newbery Medal in 1961 and was made into an animated film in 1973. Its title character, Chester, who finds himself transported from the country on a subway train and then befriends a little boy, also appeared in six subsequent stories, including ''Tucker's Countryside'' (1969) and ''The Old Meadow'' (1987). All seven were illustrated by Garth Williams and published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.
        ''There is a remarkable innocence and whimsy about his characters, and an extraordinary gentleness,'' Stephen Roxburgh, Mr. Thompson's editor at Farrar, Straus, said yesterday. ''More often than not they're caught up in trying circumstances, and there's a camaraderie which enables them to triumph over adversity.''
        Mr. Thompson, whose tales were intended mainly for 7- to 10-year-olds, wrote more than 15 books and 2 plays. Some of his stories have been dramatized and are on cassettes produced by Newbery Award Records.
        He was born in Hartford, graduated from Yale University in 1951 and studied in Rome for a year on a Fulbright Scholarship.
        Survivors include his brother, Dr. Hartwell Greene Thompson Jr. of West Hartford.
