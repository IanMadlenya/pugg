        Peter Scott, a champion of gay rights who canceled a campaign for the California Assembly after learning that he had AIDS, died of complications from the disease at his home here on Saturday. He was 50 years old. A lawyer who gave up his practice to advocate gay rights, Mr. Scott worked to defeat measures requiring the dismissal of homosexual teachers and requiring that people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome be registered with the state. He also led the fight in California to hasten testing of experimental AIDS drugs, a result of which was a drug-testing bill passed into law in 1987.
        Mr. Scott founded the Municipal Election Committee of Los Angeles, the city's most powerful gay political group. He was active in fund-raising until his illness worsened last month. He was the former chairman of the Los Angeles AIDS Project.
        Mr. Scott was diagnosed as having AIDS in 1986, just as he was planning to challenge the Assembly majority leader, Mike Roos, for his 46th District seat. Instead of running, Mr. Scott worked to raise money to find a cure for AIDS.
        He was the longtime companion of David Quarles. Survivors are his mother, Camille Scott, and a sister, Mary Jamison.
