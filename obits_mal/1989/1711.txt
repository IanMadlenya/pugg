        Mr. Brozen, who was born in London, first came to the United States in 1938. A graduate of the University of Illinois, he was always self-employed.
        He designed a wide array of small and functional household objects like wood racks for wine and ties before experimenting with Lucite and Plexiglas, two of the modern plastic materials that were to be forever linked with contemporary design in the 1960's.
        Many companies in the housewares field sought his marketing and design advice. In the late 60's, Mr. Brozen was a design director for Bonniers and Georg Jensen, two New York stores at the center of the contemporary design field.
        As a freelance consultant to companies like Copco and Beylerian, Mr. Brozen retained lifelong associations with many of his clients, designing their booths at trade shows as well as advising them on product lines. He also worked as a consultant to the Formica Corporation.
        In his own designs, Mr. Brozen often chose geometric shapes and gave what might have been rather banal objects an extra twist, using Lucite or brightly colored plastics to give a playful yet elegant quality to everyday items.
        Two of his plastic serving pieces, designed in 1963 and manufactured in 1966, were accepted into the Permanent Design Collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1967.
        Mr. Brozen was the New York editor of the London-based Arts Review magazine and a contributing editor of Interiors magazine.
        He is survived by his sister, Beryl Bennett of Eastbourne, East Sussex, England.
