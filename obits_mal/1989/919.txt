        Dr. George P. Schmidt, professor emeritus of history at Douglass College of Rutgers University and a writer, died of cancer Monday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. He was 95 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Dr. Schmidt headed a faculty committee in the 1930's that devised off-campus learning experiences for students, in a departure from traditional modes of higher education for women. Douglass at that time was the New Jersey College for Women.
        Among Dr. Schmidt's books was ''The Liberal Arts College,'' a 1957 study of the evolution of the old-fashioned college, which typically had close ties to a religious body, into the modern university.
        After retiring in 1960, Dr. Schmidt taught for seven years at Cape Cod Community College in Massachusetts.
        Dr. Schmidt was born in St. Louis. He received his bachelor's and master's from Washington University and his doctorate from Columbia University.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Irma Gotsch; a son, George Jr., of Brooklyn; a daughter, Marianne Simonoff of Tolland, Conn.; two grandchlidren, and a great-granddaughter.
