        Mr. Grossman was among the first developers to specialize in developing the strip shopping centers that are now familiar in cities and suburbs. He obtained his broker's license in 1932 and founded Gibraltar Management, which he headed at his death. His most recent project, Centerock, which is under construction in Nyack, N.Y., will be Rockland County's largest office center when it is completed this spring.
        Mr. Grossman, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of New York University. He was a founder of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine at Yeshiva University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betti Sterzelbach; a daughter, Betty Lou Baker of Greenwich, Conn.; two sons, Loomis Jr., of Manhattan, and Richard, of Greenwich; a sister, Harriet Galton of the Riverdale section of the Bronx; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
