        In the early 1980's Mr. McLinn donned a bushy white mustache and wig to preach Twain's gospel of politics and social satire in a show entitled ''Mark Twain Himself.'' He performed in theaters in the United States and abroad.
        Born in La Canada, Calif., Mr. McLinn graduated from California State University at Los Angeles and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. He earned master's degrees from the Pacific School of Religion and the University of San Diego. He also worked in politics and government before he was ordained in 1987.
        Surviving are his wife, Akemi of Washington; his mother, the Rev. Gloryanna Hees of Beaverton, Ore., and a brother, Robert of La Canada.
