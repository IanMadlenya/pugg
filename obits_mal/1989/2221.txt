        Mr. Lerner composed ''I'm Popeye the Sailor Man'' in less than two hours for the cartoonist Dave Fleischer. The lyrics included the line, ''I'm strong to the finich 'cause I eats me spinach.''
        Mr. Lerner's work in the 1930's and 40's included ''Is It True What They Say About Dixie'' and English lyrics to ''Falling in Love Again,'' Marlene Dietrich's song in the film ''The Blue Angel.'' He also wrote the theme for Betty Boop.
        Born in Rumania in 1903, Mr. Lerner immigrated with his family to Detroit, where he attended Wayne State University.
        He began his career writing songs for vaudeville acts and lyrics for the Ziegfeld Follies. He later collaborated with popular composers, including Hoagy Carmichael, Richard Whiting, Gerald Marks, Irving Caesar and Burton Lane.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy.
