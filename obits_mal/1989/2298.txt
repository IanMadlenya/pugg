        Doug Harvey, who won the Norris Trophy as the National Hockey League's top defenseman seven times from 1955-62, died today in a Montreal hospital after a long illness. He was 65 years old.
        Claude Mouton, a spokesman for the Montreal Canadiens, said in a statement that Mr. Harvey had worked as a scout for the Canadiens before going into the hospital more than a year ago for treatment of cirrhosis of the liver.
        Harvey, who was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1973, spent 19 seasons in the N.H.L., 14 with the Canadiens. He was the league's foremost defensive player from 1956-60, when the Canadiens won a record five consecutive Stanley Cup championships. Counting the 1953 champions, Harvey was with six Stanley Cup winners under Coach Toe Blake.
        A 5-foot-11-inch, 180-pound defenseman who often triggered the attack by carrying the puck out of his team's zone, Harvey, in his years with Montreal, played with a list of Hall of Famers: Maurice (Rocket) Richard, Henri Richard, Jean Beliveau, Dickie Moore, Bernie (Boom Boom) Geoffrion, Tom Johnson and the goaltender Jacques Plante, perhaps the chief beneficiary of Harvey's brilliance as a defenseman.
        Johnson, who was Harvey's defensive partner on those dominating Canadien teams once said that Harvey was unrivaled in his era and could control the tempo of a game at will.
        Harvey was sold to the Rangers in 1961, where he played for two seasons and coached for one. His record as coach in the 1961-62 season was 26-32-12, good for fourth place and a playoff berth. But the Rangers were eliminated in the first round by the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.
        Harvey later played with the Detroit Red Wings and the St. Louis Blues before retiring in 1969 with a career total of 88 goals and 452 assists for 540 points and countless checks in 1,113 games.
        He was named to the N.H.L. all-star team 11 times.
        A funeral has been scheduled for Friday in Montreal.
