        Otto E. Dohrenwend, a retired New York investment broker, died Thursday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., after a long illness. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Dohrenwend was a senior partner in the brokerage firm of Baker, Weeks & Harden from 1936 until his retirement in 1972. He also served on the employee relations committee of the New York Stock Exchange for several years.
        In the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Dohrenwend was chairman of the Scarsdale Citizens Committee, a group of 10 people who fought what the group called Communist influences in the Scarsdale school system. A report issued later by a special committee of the Town Club, which studies community issues, said that the committee had failed to substantiate its charges.
        Mr. Dohrenwend, a native New Yorker, was a member of the national American Legion's Americanism Committee and a member of the board of trustees of Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Constance Wilckes; five children, Renata Gallagher of Manhattan, James, of Denville, N.J., Robert, of Bronxville, N.Y., Claire, of Haddonfield, N.J., and Paul, of Newtown, Conn.; 16 granchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
