        Edward Ochab, the former Polish Communist Party leader and president, has died in Warsaw, the official Polish press agency said today. He was 83 years old, the agency said.
        Mr. Ochab was Communist Party leader for seven months in 1956.
        The agency did not say when he died or give the cause of death, but described him as a ''distinguished activist of the international workers' movement, a builder of people's Poland.''
        In 1968, Mr. Ochab resigned after four years as chairman of the Council of State, the collective presidency, to protest a Communist anti-Semitic campaign that forced, according to estimates, 20,000 Jews to emigrate.
        Mr. Ochab was born in 1906 in Cracow.
        He joined the Communist Party in 1929 and spent a total of more than six years in jail for party activities.
        He rose to prominence when Stalin installed the Communists in power in 1944, becoming first secretary of the Communist Party in March 1956.
        Mr. Ochab presided over a difficult period in Poland. Dozens of workers shouting ''Bread and Freedom!'' and ''Russians go home!'' were killed by the army in riots in Poznan, the western Polish city, the following June.
        He was replaced as party leader by Wladyslaw Gomulka in October, but remained in the upper echelons of power.
