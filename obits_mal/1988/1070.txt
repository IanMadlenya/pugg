        Mr. Basil, a native of Atlanta, graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1934. For the next 19 years he helped to plan and design United States military installations in Spain and was chief civil engineer for military installations in France and Morocco.
        In 1958, he established his own engineering and consulting firm. The concern has since been involved in a number of development projects, many of them military installations, in the Middle East.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sophie Chotas; two daughters Ileana Basil of Washington and Karen Mavrides of Athens; three grandchildren; and four brothers, Andrew and George, both of Athens, Mario of Washington and Tito of Pireaus, Greece.
