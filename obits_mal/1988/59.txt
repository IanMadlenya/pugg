        Dr. Zacharias Dische, professor emeritus of biochemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, died Sunday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Dische, a native of Austria, joined the Columbia faculty in 1943 and retired in 1963 but continued his research in ophthalmology. He was known for his work on the nature of DNA and the human metabolism, particularly for the ''Dische reaction,'' a method of using color reactions to determine the amount of sugars present in tissues.
        He is survived by a son, Charles, of Fort Lee, N.J.; a daughter, Irene, of West Berlin, and two grandchildren.
