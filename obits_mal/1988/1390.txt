        Gordon H. Scherer, a former member of Congress who became the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 1950's and who later served on the executive board of Unesco, died Saturday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati after suffering a heart attack. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Scherer was a Representative from 1953 until 1962, and he served for four years on the committee that investigated Americans with ties to organizations deemed subversive.
        He had been an assistant prosecuting attorney in Cincinnati and had held municipal offices that included a seat on the City Council from 1946 to 1949.
        After leaving Congress he returned to Cincinnati to practice law. In the 1970's he was appointed to represent the United States in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
        As a member of Unesco's executive board in Paris, he created a stir in 1975 when, after the organization adopted a resolution equating Zionism with racism, he resigned abruptly in protest against what he called ''the overwhelming domination of the United Nations by the Communist, Arab and third-world bloc.''
        Mr. Scherer is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Mottern; a son, Gordon M. Scherer; a daughter, Suzanne Kitei, and a sister, Elizabeth Henderson, all of Cincinnati, and three grandchildren.
