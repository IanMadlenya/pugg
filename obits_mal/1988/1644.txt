        James V. Mangano, a longtime Democratic leader in the 52d Assembly District of Brooklyn and the last person to hold the office of Kings County Sheriff, died of cancer yesterday at Long Island College Hospital. He was 83 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Mangano was a leading politician for more than 35 years. From 1954 to 1975, when he retired, he was administrative director and general clerk of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. From 1942 to 1954, he was secretary to several State Supreme Court justices. Mr. Mangano was Kings County Sheriff from 1938 to 1942, and from 1935 to 1937, he was an Assemblyman.
        As Sheriff of Brooklyn, Mr. Mangano commanded a staff of several dozen deputies who were responsible for, among other things, serving eviction notices and handling prisoners and witnesses in civil cases.
        In 1942, the offices of the five borough sheriffs were eliminated, and replaced by a single, city-wide sheriff. Many of the local sheriffs' duties are now performed by city marshals, who are appointed by the Mayor.
        In 1970, the Italian-American Business and Professional Men's Association named him Italian-American Man of the Year. Mr. Mangano was the son of Italian immigrants and grew up in South Brooklyn.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Rose Mancaruso; a son, Guy, of Long Beach, L.I., a State Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn; a brother, Gaetano, of Deer Park, L.I.; a sister, Antonia, of Brooklyn, and two grandsons.
