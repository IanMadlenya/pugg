        Samuel Leroy Mendel, who was turned away from the Army in 1898 because he was too young to enlist but lived to become the nation's oldest veteran, died here Wednesday at the age of 104.
        He was past commander-in-chief of the Spanish-American War Veteran's Association, although he never served in the war.
        Mr. Mendel, a native of Fort Worth, Tex., was 14 when the battleship Maine exploded Feb. 15, 1898, in Havana harbor, Cuba, then a Spanish port. But he was unable to enlist in the Army until 1901, after the Spanish-American war officially ended.
        He spent most of his three-year military career carrying a football on the athletic fields at Fort Sam Houston. In 1902 he was cited as the best athlete in the Army.
        According to a spokesman for the Veterans Administration, with Mr. Mendel's death the last known veteran of the Spanish-American war era is Nathan E. Cook, 102, of Tempe, Ariz., a Navy veteran.
        Mr. Mendel is survived by a son, Robert L. Mendel of Brookfield, Ill., a daughter, Fern Varley of San Francisco, two grandsons and a great-granddaughter.
