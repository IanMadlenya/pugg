        George D. Clahr, a New York City ophthalmologist and expert in the use of soft contact lenses, died of cancer of the colon yesterday at his home in New Milford, Conn. He was 53 years old.
        A private practitioner in Manhattan for 25 years, Dr. Clahr conducted the first clinical trials in New York City of soft contact lenses for Bausch & Lomb Laboratories in the early 1970's. Before his retirement in 1986, his practice included such prominent figures as Walter Cronkite, former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and Arthur Ashe, the tennis player.
        Dr. Clahr was born in New York City, attended the Horace Mann School and received his undergraduate education at Columbia College. He received his medical degree from New York University Medical School and his resident training in ophthalmology at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, where he became an attending surgeon and chief of the contact lens clinic.
        Dr. Clahr was a diplomate of the American Board of Ophthalmologists and a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.
        He is survived by his wife, Sandy, and a brother, Allan, of Manhattan.
        A memorial service will be held Jan. 29 at 4 P.M. at the Society for Ethical Culture, 64th Street at Central Park West.
