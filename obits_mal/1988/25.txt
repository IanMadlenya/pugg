        Brendan Sexton, a former director of the education department of the United Auto Workers union, died of lung disease Sunday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Sexton, who retired in 1970, was the first director of the union's Walter and May Reuther Family Education Center, a resort and training center at Black Lake, Mich.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Sexton attended Manhattan Preparatory School and Manhattan College.
        He became active in the U.A.W. in 1941 and served as president of Local 50, representing 35,000 workers at a Ford bomber plant in Willow Run, Mich. He also was an early supporter of Walter Reuther, who, as U.A.W. president, made Mr. Sexton his assistant at union headquarters and put him in charge of the education department in 1949.
        Mr. Sexton was co-author, with his second wife, Dr. Patricia Cayo Sexton, of a book, ''Blue College and Hard Hats,'' published by Random House in 1971. Dr. Sexton is a professor of sociology at New York University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son and namesake, the New York City Commissioner of Sanitation; a daughter, Patricia Rebecca Hersh of Austin, Tex.; a brother, Vincent, of Queens; a sister, May Reilly of Delray Beach, Fla.; his first wife, Hilda Rogin of Washington; and six grandchildren.
        A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at the headquarters of U.A.W. District 65, at 13 Astor Place in Manhattan.
