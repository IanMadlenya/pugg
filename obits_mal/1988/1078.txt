        John Peet, a reporter who defected to East Germany in 1950 while working for Reuters, died early Wednesday in his sleep after a long illness, relatives and friends said today.
        Mr. Peet, who was in his 70's, fought in the Spanish Civil War with the International Brigade, worked for Reuters in Palestine and covered the Nuremberg trials after World War II.
        After three years as a reporter in Berlin, Mr. Peet surfaced in East Germany in 1950, saying he had left the West because of West German rearmament.
        For many years, Mr. Peet produced an East Berlin newsletter called the Democratic German Report. He spent the last 10 years translating Marx and Engels into English.
        A tall, thin man, Mr. Peet was seen by many Germans as having the style of a typical Englishman, and he played this role in some East German films.
        He is survived by his third wife, Edelgard, and two children.
