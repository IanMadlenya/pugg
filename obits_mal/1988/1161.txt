        Mr. Barbuti, a fullback for the Syracuse football team and a track star at the school from 1925 to 1927, finished first in the 400-meter run at the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam and anchored the American 1,600-meter relay team to victory. He was voted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1967.
        From 1929 to 1963, he worked as an official at college football games and track meets in the East. He also worked for New York State for 30 years, retiring in 1972 as director of the state's Civil Defense Commission.
        Mr. Barbuti is survived by a son, Edmund Driscoll of Simsbury, Conn.; four daughters, Barbara Patti of Wantagh, L.I., Marie Meyer of Lubbock, Tex., Elizabeth Kyle of Albuquerque, N.M., and Kathleen Reinhardt of Nassau, N.Y., and 11 grandchildren.
