        Jesse L. Lasky Jr., an author and screenwriter, died of cancer on Monday at his home in London. He was 79 years old and had been dividing his time for more than 25 years between residences in London and Salta de Agua, Spain.
        He and his wife, the former Barbara Carleton, who writes under the name of Pat Silver, collaborated over the years on film and television scripts and more recently on a play, ''Vivien,'' based on the marriage of Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier. ''Vivien'' was performed in workshop in Los Angeles. They also collaborated on a novel, ''The Author,'' which was published in the United States by Doubleday.
        Mr. Lasky was the son of Jesse L. Lasky, who formed a film company with his brother-in-law, Samuel Goldwyn, and scored an immediate triumph with their first film, ''The Squaw Man,'' in 1914.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a stepson, Richard Niles of London; a stepdaughter, Lisa Romano of Salta de Agua; and a sister, Betty Lasky of Los Angeles.
