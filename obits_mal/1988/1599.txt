        Rabbi David Aronson, former president of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, has died after a short illness. He was 96 years old. ''He was one of the leading rabbis, nationally, in the last 60 years,'' said Rabbi Kassel Abelson, Rabbi Aronson's successor at Beth El Synagogue in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park.
        ''His work was very important, especially where it concerned Jewish annulments and divorces,'' Rabbi Abelson said. ''His book, 'The Jewish Way of Life,' published in 1945, has become a classic and has been reprinted many times.''
        Born in Russia in 1892, Mr. Aronson attended New York University, Columbia University and the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York.
        After ordination in 1919, Rabbi Aronson served congregations in Salt Lake City and Duluth, Minn., before joining Beth El in 1924. From 1948 to 1950, he was president of the Rabbinical Assembly of America, an assembly of 1,200 Conservative rabbis.
        Rabbi Aronson, who died Thursday, is survived by his wife, Bertha, of Los Angeles, and two sons.
