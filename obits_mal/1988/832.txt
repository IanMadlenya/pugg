        Aron Alperin, a writer and the editor of the Yiddish-language newspapers The Jewish Day and The Morning Journal for a quarter-century, died of a heart attack Wednesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 87 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        Mr. Alperin was born in Lodz, Poland, and during the 1920's he edited Warsaw Today, a Yiddish-language journal. In 1928 he went to Paris to edit La Journee Parisien, which was said to have had the largest circulation of any Yiddish-language newspaper in the world.
        He escaped with his family when France was occupied by the Germans, and came to the United States. He joined The Jewish Day, which later merged with The Morning Journal, and edited the merged newspaper until it discontinued publication in 1970. A prominent member of the Zionist movement, he lectured widely in this country and abroad.
        Mr. Alperin is survived by his wife, the former Rose Radzyner; a daughter, Lucy M. Corin, and two grandchildren.
