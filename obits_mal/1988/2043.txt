        James H. Meredith, a senior judge on the Federal District Court who supervised desegregation of the St. Louis public schools for nine years, died of complications of kidney disease Thursday at his home in St. Louis. He was 74 years old.
        Judge Meredith was appointed to the Federal bench in 1962 by President Kennedy. In 1979, at the age of 65, the judge took senior status.
        His most important ruling in the desegregation case was in April 1979, when he decided that the St. Louis Board of Education was not responsible for racial imbalance in city classrooms.
        But in March 1980 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed that ruling and ordered Judge Meredith to oversee immediate desegregation. That summer the judge approved a citywide plan, which the appeals court upheld.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Susan A. Fitzgibbon; a son, James; five stepchildren, Tonie, Richard, Arthur and Peggy Fitzgibbon and Mary F. Reed, all of St. Louis; two sisters, Helen M. Dickson, of St. Louis, and Margaret M. Houghton, of Del Ray Beach, Fla., and three grandchildren.
