        Mamdouh Salem, a former Prime Minister of Egypt, died in London on Wednesday while undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness, a Foreign Ministry official said today. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Salem was Prime Minister from 1975 to 1978. When Ibrahim Kamel resigned as Foreign Minister in 1978 to protest the signing of the American-sponsored Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel, President Anwar el-Sadat appointed a new Government. The peace treaty was signed a year later.
        Mr. Salem was a personal aide to Mr. Sadat and to Hosni Mubarak, who became President after Mr. Sadat was assassinated in 1981.
        Born in 1918 in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria, Mr. Salem was Governor of Asyut, Gharbiya and Alexandria from 1967 to 1971, when he was appointed Interior Minister.
