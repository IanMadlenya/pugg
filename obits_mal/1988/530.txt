        John Holmes, who made hundreds of sexually explicit films during a career spanning two decades, died Saturday night at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Sepulveda, according to his manager, William Amerson. He was 43 years old and was reported to have had AIDS.
        The cause of death was not immediately known, Mr. Amerson said Sunday. The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported this month that Mr. Holmes was gravely ill with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
        In 1982, Mr. Holmes, a leading sex-film actor of the 1970's and early 80's, was acquitted of the slayings of four people in a house in Laurel Canyon, but he never told the authorities what he knew about the crime. Two weeks ago detectives questioned him again at his hospital bedside about the unsolved 1981 slayings.
        Mr. Holmes was best known for his portrayal of the character Johnny Wadd, a detective, in his films.
