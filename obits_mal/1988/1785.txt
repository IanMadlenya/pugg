        Dr. Carl C. Pfeiffer, a pharmacologist who specialized in research on the causes of schizophrenia, allergies and other diseases, died Friday at Princeton Medical Center in New Jersey. He had suffered a heart attack at the Bio Center, a research and treatment center that he directed. He was 80 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Dr. Pfeiffer had directed the Bio Center, which studied and treated imbalances in the body's chemistry, since its formation in 1971.
        In 1977, it was revealed that Dr. Pfeiffer was one of several researchers who had performed experiments in behavior control for the Central Intelligence Agency. Between 1955 and 1964, he administered the drug LSD to prisoners in Atlanta and Bordentown, N.J., under a program financed indirectly by the C.I.A. Dr. Pfeiffer said the experiments had been conducted with the ''full, informed consent'' of the subjects.
        Dr, Pfeiffer, a native of Peoria, Ill., received a bachelor's degree and a doctorate in pharmacology from the University of Wisconsin and a medical degree from the University of Chicago. Before directing the Bio Center, he taught at the University of Illinois and at Emory University Medical School. From 1960 to 1971, he was director of research in neuropharmacology for the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lillian Twenhofel; a daughter, Helen Newton of Los Alamos, N.M.; a son, Edward, of Trenton, N.J., and three grandchildren.
