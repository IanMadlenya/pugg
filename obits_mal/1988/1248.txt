        A 1927 graduate of Princeton University, Mr. Hubball started his career with the Hun School of Princeton before coming to the Buckley Country Day School a few years later. One of a group of day schools founded by B. Lord Buckley, it was then in Great Neck, L.I., but has since moved to Roslyn, L.I.
        In 1939, Mr. Hubball moved to the Buckley School, the group's original nucleus on East 73d Street, as assistant headmaster. He formally became headmaster of the exclusive boys' school in 1947, although he had been largely running the school before then.
        At the end of his long tenure, Mr. Hubball was credited with having markedly strengthened the school's traditional, conservative curriculum, which is offered to boys through age 14.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ora Otis Worden; a daughter, Ora Otis Weir, of Manhattan; a son, Jeremy J. M. Hubball, of Wellesley, Mass.; a sister, Wallace Schwarzwalder, of Arlington, Va., and six grandchildren.
