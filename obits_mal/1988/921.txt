Hutt, an economist who was an early critic of the racial separation policy of South Africa while teaching there for nearly 40 years, died of complications from a stroke on Sunday at the Irving (Tex.) Community Hospital. He was 89 years old and lived in Irving. Mr. Hutt was born in London and served in the Royal Flying Corps in World War I, after which he graduated from the London School of Economics. From 1926 to 1965, he taught at the University of Cape Town. His book ''Economics of the Color Bar'' argued that apartheid was mainly an attempt by white labor unions to prevent black workers from competing for jobs.
        He was also a leader of the anti-Keynesian school of economics, advocating free-market government policies. He was a founder of the Mont-Pelerin Society, an international organization of scholars promoting free enterprise that was named for the town in Switzerland where it was formed.
        Mr. Hutt came to the United States in 1965 and taught at several universities until 1971, when he joined the faculty of the University of Dallas. He retired from teaching in 1981 and held the rank of professor emeritus at his death. In 1982, he helped found the National Center for Policy Analysis, an economic research organization in Dallas.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Grethe Hutt-Schonken.
