        Robert O. Fishel, a major league baseball executive for more than 40 years and a Yankee official for 20 years, died yesterday afternoon, after collapsing outside his apartment in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and had been suffering from a respiratory ailment.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Fishel was American League executive vice president. Bobby Brown, the president of the American League, said last night: ''People like Bob Fishel are just never replaced.''
        Mr. Fishel, a native of Cleveland, was an advertising executive before he joined the Cleveland Indians in 1946, when Bill Veeck owned the team. He followed Mr. Veeck to the St. Louis Browns in 1951 and signed Eddie Gaedel, the only midget to play in a major league game. After the Browns moved to Baltimore in 1954, he joined the Yankees as public-relations director and rose to a vice presidency.
        In 1974, Mr. Fishel became a special assistant to American League President Lee MacPhail and later an executive vice president. The Robert O. Fishel Award was initiated in 1981 and is given annually to the outstanding major league publicist.
        George Steinbrenner, the Yankee owner, called him ''a great part of the braintrust of the American League office, and they're going to feel the loss.''
        Mr. Fishel is survived by a brother, Al of Avon Lake, Ohio, and a sister, Sue Fisher of Shaker Heights, Ohio.
