        George Templar, a retired Federal district judge and former member of the Kansas Legislature, died Friday. He was 83 years old.
        Among his cases while on the Federal bench from 1962 to 1974 were the appeals of Perry Smith and Richard Hickock, who were executed for the 1959 murders of four members of the Clutter family. The case was chronicled in Truman Capote's book ''In Cold Blood.''
        Mr. Templar, a former United States Attorney for Kansas, unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor in 1954.
