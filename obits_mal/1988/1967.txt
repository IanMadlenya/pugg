        Wally Berger, the Boston Braves outfielder who hit 38 home runs as a rookie in 1930 to establish a major league record that stood for 57 years, died of a stroke Wednesday in Redondo Beach, Calif. He was 83 years old.
        The rookie mark was matched by Frank Robinson of the Cincinnati Reds in 1956 and surpassed by Mark McGwire, who hit 49 home runs for the Oakland Athletics in 1987.
        Mr. Berger, a right-handed batter, also drove in 119 runs and posted a .310 batting average in 1930. For his 11-year career with Boston, the New York Giants, Cincinnati and the Philadelphia Phillies, he had a .300 batting average with 242 homers and 898 runs batted in.
        In 1935 he led the National League with 34 homers and 130 runs batted in.
        ''I never thought of records, I just liked to hit,'' he once said.
        Mr. Berger was born in Chicago and raised in San Francisco.
        After retiring as a player, he was a scout for the Yankees and managed their Manchester, N.H., minor league team in 1949. He left baseball in 1950.
