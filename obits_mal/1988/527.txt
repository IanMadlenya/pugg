        Federico Sisneros, the National Park Service's oldest ranger, died of heart failure Saturday. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Sisneros' family owned the land on which the 17th-century San Gregorio de Abo Mission mission stands and donated the property to the state in the late 1930's. It was a state monument for many years and became part of the Salinas National Monument in 1981.
        Mr. Sisneros was the mission's caretaker while Abo was a state monument and was named a ranger when it became part of the national park system.
        ''It'll always be Abo on paper, but to the ones who worked with him, it'll always be 'Fred's Place,' '' said Glenn Fulfer, the chief ranger at Salinas. ''His father had told him to take care of the mission. It was more or less a legacy given down to Fred to take care of Abo.''
        Mr. Sisneros was born in 1894 in a house near the Indian ruins at the Abo mission. He and his wife, Guadalupe, lived in a house a few yards from the ruins.
        He was honored by the National Park Service in 1981 with the Superior Service Award for making a significant contribution during most of the 20th century.
        He received an Honor Award in 1986 from the National Trust for Historic Preservation at the group's 40th annual meeting.
        Mr. Fulfer said Mr. Sisneros had asked to be buried at the mission. The National Park Service has authorized his grave to be located there. z
