        Thorkil Host, a major figure in the Danish shipping industry in World War II, died of heart failure Monday at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 92 years old.
        After German troops invaded Denmark, Mr. Host was appointed in 1941 by a Danish shipowner, A. P. Moller, to direct the Maersk Line fleet to Allied or neutral ports. After the war, Mr. Host was decorated for his work by the Danish Government.
        He had come to the United States in 1940 and during World War II served as president of the Danish Ship Operating Corporation, which operated a number of Danish and other vessels.
        In 1947, he became president of the Moller Steamship Company, a post he retained until 1967, retiring in 1980 as chairman of the board. As president he led the growth of the Maersk Line's liner services between United States ports and the Far East and later on worldwide routes.
        He is survived by a son, Stig, of Old Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Mette Host of Copenhagen and Marianne Harrison of Greenwich, Conn.; seven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
