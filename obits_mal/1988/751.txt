        Bill Cox, a newspaper editor in Kentucky and Hawaii who wrote an editorial column that disclosed he had AIDS, died yesterday in Manhattan Beach, Calif., of complications from that disease. He was 39 years old.
        In 1986 Mr. Cox, then managing editor of The Honolulu Star-Bulletin, made known his illness of acquired immunity defiency syndrome in a Labor Day column.
        ''As a journalist, I have spent my career trying to shed light in dark corners,'' he wrote, ''AIDS is surely one of our darkest corners. It can use some light.''
        Mr. Cox resigned from The Star-Bulletin shortly after his column ran, saying he did not feel well enough to continue supervising the staff, and later moved to California. Afterward, he lectured to professional journalism groups on coverage of the AIDS epidemic.
        Mr. Cox was born in Owensboro, Ky., and was graduated from the University of Missouri in 1971. Later that year he joined The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky. He left in 1978 to work for The Miami Herald, but returned less than a year later to become city editor of The Courier-Journal. He held that post for five years, until he moved to Hawaii in January 1984.
        His companion was Mark Meyer. His survivors include his parents, Homer and Ann Cox of Owensboro, and an aunt, Myrtle Castlen of Louisville.
