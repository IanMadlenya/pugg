        Charles Hawtrey, an actor who became a mainstay of the long-running ''Carry On'' series of film comedies, died Thursday in a nursing home in Walmer, in southeast England. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Hawtrey, whose outrageously camp screen persona was once described by a movie critic as ''a thin wet hen in granny specs,'' appeared in 23 of the 28 ''Carry On'' films.
        The series began in 1958 with ''Carry On Sergeant'' and continued for nearly two decades at a production rate of roughly two movies a year. The films included ''Carry On Nurse,'' ''Carry On Teacher'' and ''Carry On England.''
        Named George Frederick Joffre Hartree at birth, the actor borrowed the name Charles Hawtrey from the celebrated actor-manager Sir Charles Hawtrey, who died in 1923. He made his debut on the London stage in 1927, and in 1929 began a long career in radio comedy roles.
        He is survived by a brother, Jack, who lives in Australia.
