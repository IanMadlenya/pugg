        Frank V. Schwinn, who developed the independent dealership network for his family's bicycle company, died unexpectedly at home last Tuesday. He was 67 years old.
        The death of Mr. Schwinn, who was chairman and chief executive officer of the Schwinn Company, was announced in a statement by the company, which said the family would not disclose the cause of death. The police said it was of natural causes.
        A lifetime Chicago resident, Mr. Schwinn was the third generation of a family devoted to the bicycle business founded by his grandfather in 1895. Mr. Schwinn began his career working in the company's factory and later worked his way up to administration.
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Schwinn fostered the philosophy of selective distribution that gave the neighborhood bicycle dealer the means to make selling bicycles a lucrative endeavor, pioneering the idea of the authorized Schwinn dealership, the statement said.
        Mr. Schwinn became president and chief executive of the company in 1963, after the death of his father, Frank. He managed the day-to-day aspects of the company until 1978, then remained active as chairman until his death.
        His family requested that survivors not be listed, the company said.
