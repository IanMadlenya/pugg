        Mr. Albany performed or recorded with Charlie Parker, Lester Young, Roy Haynes, Howard McGhee, Boyd Raeburn, Benny Carter, Georgie Auld and Charles Mingus, among others. He worked in England, Italy, Denmark and France in the 1970's.
        John S. Wilson, writing in The New York Times, termed him ''a great jazz pianist.'' His career was the subject of a documentary, ''Joe Albany: A Jazz Life,'' which he narrated and in which he performed.
        Mr. Albany's struggles with drug addiction interrupted his career and sent him in and out of hospitals and jails for 25 years. But on his return to public performing, he played ''better than the legends that pursue such self-destructive musicians,'' according to Mr. Wilson.
        His best-known recordings were his 1946 sessions with Lester Young; ''Right Combination'' made under his leadership in 1957 with Wayne Marsh, and his final album, ''Portrait of an Artist,'' with George Duvivier, Al Gaffer and Charli Persip.
        Mr. Albany is survived by his daughters, Amy Baer of Los Angeles and Sybil Hartwell of Houston, and his son, Joe Albany Jr. of Phoenix.
