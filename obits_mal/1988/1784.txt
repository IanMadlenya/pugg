        William Schack, author of two books on art and a reviewer of Yiddish theater during the 1930's, died Saturday at his home in Jerusalem. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Schack, who moved to Israel from his native New York 15 years ago, died after a heart attack, according to his brother-in-law, Morris Kaplan of Roslyn Estates, L.I.
        As a journalist with an interest in art, Mr. Schack wrote two books that were deemed significant by reviewers. His biography of the American artist Louis M. Eilshemius, ''And He Sat Among the Ashes'' (American Artists group), was published in 1939. ''Art and Argyrol: The Life and Career of Dr. Albert C. Barnes'' (Thomas Yoseloff), a book about the noted art collector and creator of a popular antiseptic, was published in 1960.
        Mr. Schack's newspaper writings concentrated on Yiddish theater, and his perceptive pieces about life on Second Avenue dealt with the stars, the art theaters and the problems besetting the institution in the early 1930's.
        There are no immediate surviviors.
