        Robertson Ward, an architect who designed many Caribbean resorts, died Wednesday of heart failure at the Nuffield Hospital in London. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Ward, the founding partner of the architectural firm of Robertson Ward Associates, designed the Mill Reef Club on Antigua and the Sandy Lane resort on Barbados, as well as resort hotels and communities on St. Martin's, Nassau, Eleuthera, Jamaica and other Caribbean islands.
        Mr. Ward, the son of the American sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, opened his architecture practice in Boston in 1921. His early work included homes in New England and New York, as well as resort hotels in Mexico and Bermuda. In the 1940's, he turned his attention to the Caribbean, where he became one of the first to plan resorts in the region. His projects were designed to harmonize with their settings and were known for their use of coral stone and other natural materials.
        Mr. Ward is survived by his wife, Dolores, of London; a daughter, Sylvia Ward Sawyer, of Chestertown, Md.; a son, Robertson Ward Jr., of Boston; three stepchildren; four grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
