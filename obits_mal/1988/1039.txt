        Lucien Cardin, whose statements on the handling of Canadian security cases touched off a political storm in 1966 while he was Justice Minister in the Government of Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, died of cancer Monday. He was 69 years old and had been a tax court judge since 1983.
        First elected to Parliament as a Liberal Party member from Quebec in 1952, Mr. Cardin was appointed Associate Defense Minister in 1963, then Public Works Minister and finally Justice Minister.
        In 1965, members of the opposition Progressive Conservative Party criticized his handling of the case of George Victor Spencer, a Vancouver postal clerk, who was said to have been a Soviet spy and who was dismissed from his job, but not prosecuted because he was dying of cancer.
        Mr. Cardin, under attack in the case, responded in March 1966 by making an issue of a sex-and-security case that involved a previous Conservative Government. That case involved Gerda Munsinger, an East German woman who was suspected of having a background in espionage and who, Mr. Cardin said, had had an affair with an official in the predecessor Conservative Government of Prime Minister John G. Diefenbaker.
        Mr. Cardin resigned as Justice Minister in 1967.
        He was born on March 1, 1919, in Providence, R.I. His parents moved back to Sorel, Quebec, when he was 11. He studied classics at Loyola College in Montreal and received his law degree at the University of Montreal.
        Mr. Cardin is survived by his wife, Marcelle, and four children.
