        Representative Bill Nichols, Democrat of Alabama, who led a Congressional investigation into prices paid by the Pentagon for spare parts, was pronounced dead at Capitol Hill Hospital today after suffering a heart attack in his office. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Nichols was first elected to the House in 1966 to represent the Third District of eastern Alabama. Last month he won a 12th term.
        Mr. Nichols, who lost a leg in World War II, was a strong supporter of the military and President Reagan's Pentagon build-up.
        After he took over the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee in 1983, however, he presided over a series of investigations into high-priced spare parts, such as $400 Navy hammers and $5,000 coffee pots for the Air Force. The hearings helped lead to Pentagon reform legislation.
        The Congressman, who grew up and lived in Sylacauga, Ala., earned an undergraduate degree in agriculture from Auburn University in 1939 and a master's degree in 1941. He was captain of the football team in 1940.
        In World War II, fighting with the Army in Europe, he lost a leg in a land mine explosion. He was awarded a Bronze Star.
        After the war he was president of the Parker Fertilizer Company and the Parker Gin Company in Sylacauga. He served in the Alabama House from 1959 to 1963 and in the Alabama Senate from 1963 until he was elected to the House.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Carolyn Funderburk; two daughters, Margaret Vlachou of Athens, Greece, and Memorie Mitchell of Birmingham, Ala.; a son, Flynt Nichols of Dallas; and three grandchildren.
