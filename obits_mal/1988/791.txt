        David B. Eisendrath, a photographer, writer and lecturer known for his understanding of photographic principles and techniques, died of a heart attack Monday. He was 73 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Eisendrath was born in Chicago in 1914. He began photographing while a student at the University of Chicago and after graduating in 1937 worked as a staff photographer for The Chicago Times. In 1940 he moved to New York to join the picture staff of the newspaper P.M. During World War II he worked in the Office of War Information as a photojournalist for America magazine.
        After the war he became a freelance photographer, specializing in industrial subjects. At the same time, he began to write and lecture about his craft. His columns, which appeared in the magazines Popular Photography, Industrial Photography and Photo Methods for Industry, were admired for conveying often abstruse subject matter understandably. At the time of his death he was a contributing editor of Modern Photography.
        Mr. Eisendrath was a member of the American Society of Magazine Photographers and the Society of Photographic Scientists and Engineers, and he was a fellow of the Photographic Society of America.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; a half-sister, Ellen James, of Pebble Beach, Calif., and a half-brother, Edward, of Milwaukee.
