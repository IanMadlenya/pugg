        Mr. Skaff, who suffered a heart attack in a parking lot at Towson State University, played in six games for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1935 and in 32 games with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1943.
        He later became a coach for Detroit, and in 1966 he took over as manager. He managed the team to a 40-39 record.
