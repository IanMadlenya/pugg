        Henry H. Foster, an authority on family law and a professor at New York University Law School from 1962 until 1977, died of heart failure yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76 years old.
        Professor Foster was the primary architect of the New York State law that, since 1980, has provided for equitable distribution of property in divorces, on the assumption that marriage is an economic partnership. He also wrote extensively on matrimonial and family law and at his death was working on a five-volume revision of ''Law and the Family - New York,'' with co-authors Doris Jonas Freed and Joel Brandes. He was a former chairman of the family law section of the American Bar Association.
        Mr. Foster was born in Norman, Okla., and received his bachelor of law degree from the University of Nebraska and held master's degrees from Harvard Law School and the University of Chicago Law School. In the 1930's he was with the antitrust division of the United States Justice Department and on the staff of the National Labor Relations Board in Washington.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Marjorie Campbell; a son, Robert, of Queens, and a daughter, Ann Pape of Federal Way, Wash.
