        Siena, with an enrollment of about 2,600, was founded by the Franciscan Order as a men's college and began admitting women in 1969. Father Kuhn was the only one of the seven friars who spent his entire career at Siena.
        He taught many subjects there, including theology, chemistry, astronomy and mathematics.
        He was born in Olean, N.Y., and received undergraduate and master's degrees from St. Bonaventure University. He joined the Franciscan Order in 1928 at the St. Bonaventure Friary in Paterson, N.J., and was ordained a priest in 1932.
        He received a bachelor's degree in sacred theology from Catholic University of America in 1933.
        Father Kuhn was named professor emeritus in mathematics when he retired from Siena in 1967 and received an honorary doctor of sacred theology degree from Siena in 1977.
