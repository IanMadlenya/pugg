        Herbert J. Simins, a former Commissioner of Public Works for New York City, died of cancer yesterday at Queens Hospital Center. He was 59 years old and lived in Fresh Meadows, Queens.
        Mr. Simins was named to the Commissioner's post in February 1973 by Mayor John V. Lindsay. He took charge of the design and construction of city buildings ranging from courts to libraries to firehouses. He also oversaw a citywide program to install new street lights.
        Among the major projects of his tenure were the new Bellevue Hospital Center, the new Police Headquarters and the renovation of Yankee Stadium. Mayor Abraham D. Beame accepted his resignation ''with sincere regret'' in March 1977, when Mr. Simins said he could not stretch a Commissioner's salary far enough to cover the costs of sending three sons to college.
        Mr. Simins received a degree in civil engineering in 1950 from the Polytechnic Institute of New York in Brooklyn and was a 1958 cum laude graduate of Brooklyn Law School. After serving in the Army Corps of Engineers and working for a number of engineering companies, he joined the Nassau County Department of Public Works and became its Commissioner in 1966. He resigned in 1970 to return to private industry.
        Since he left the New York City post, he had been a partner in the John J. Kassner Company of Lake Success, L.I., a consulting engineering firm.
        Mr. Simins is survived by his second wife, Susan; their son, Brian; his three sons by a previous marriage, Richard, of Philadelphia; Robert, of Brooklyn, and Russell, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
