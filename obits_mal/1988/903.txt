        Mr. Long, the president of D. F. King & Company, specialized in such matters as pricing of tender offers and strategy during proxy fights and corporate takeover situations. He joined the consulting firm in 1958, rose to executive vice president and in 1967 he acquired the company and became its president.
        In the 1950's Mr. Long was a pioneer in devising strategies in merger situations - either to advance efforts by outsiders to take over a company or by management to resist those efforts. As the rules governing such ventures became relaxed over the years, his advice was increasingly sought by both targets of takeover attempts and the raiders seeking to prey upon worthwhile targets.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Long was a graduate of Columbia College and served in the Navy in Okinawa.
        Mr. Long was also the owner of thoroughbred horses. He was a member of the Jockey Club and in January was elected to the board of the New York Racing Association.
        He is survived by his wife, the former JoAnn Britton; three sons, Thomas A., James E. and Arthur F. Jr.; a daughter, Dana E. Long, and five grandchildren, all of Garden City.
