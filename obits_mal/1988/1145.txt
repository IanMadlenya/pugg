        Richard D. Burritt, for more than 40 years a reporter, editor and news administrator with The New York Times, died of Alzheimer's disease Friday at St. Mary's Hospital in Waterbury, Conn. He was 84 years old and lived in Southbury, Conn.
        Mr. Burritt retired in 1969 as assistant to the executive editor in charge of staff coordination and development. He had joined The Times in 1928 as a police reporter and later was assistant city editor.
        In 1952, Turner Catledge, then The Times's managing editor, created an assignment new at The Times, making Mr. Burritt his assistant on personnel matters, including staff recruiting, promotions and retirements. Many senior writers and editors now at The Times were recruited by Mr. Burritt. When Mr. Catledge became executive editor in 1964, Mr. Burritt continued as his assistant.
        A native of Waterbury, Mr. Burritt began work in the brass mills of the city at the age of 12, the same year that he entered high school. He attended Wesleyan University for two years and worked as a journeyman carpenter in Westchester County before realizing a long-held ambition by becoming a reporter on The Bronx Home News in 1926. From there he went to The Times.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Gertrude C. Roth; a sister, Elizabeth, of Bradford, N.H.; a daughter, Marian Kirby of Oklahoma City, and two grandchildren.
