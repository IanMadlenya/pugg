        Born in Pula, Yugoslavia, of Austrian parents, Mr. Von Fritsch came to the United States in 1930 after graduating from The Government Film School in Paris. He started his American film career as an editor of foreign films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.
        He directed ''The March of Time'' -a newsreel series shown in movie theaters before the feature attraction. The series, started in 1935 by Time Inc., was considered revolutionary at its introduction.

        Mr. Von Fritsch directed several television series in the 1950's and 1960's, including ''Flash Gordon,'' ''77 Sunset Strip'' and ''The Lawman.'' He also directed a Disney feature film called ''Snowbear.''
