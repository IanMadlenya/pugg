        ''The Wiz,'' a black musical version of L. Frank Baum's 1900 story ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,'' won seven Tony awards in 1975, including the one for best musical. The show ran for more than 1,600 performances and was later turned into a film. In the late 1960's and early 70's, Mr. Harper worked as a disk jockey at radio station WPIX-FM.
        He is survived by his parents, Mildred and Alfred Harper, of the Bronx. The funeral will be at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.
