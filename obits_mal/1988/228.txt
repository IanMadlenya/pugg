        Mr. Hayes, who spent 27 years with NAS.A, directed the recovery efforts that plucked astronauts from the ocean after their space capsules had returned to earth. In 1972, he was named director of the Manned Space Technology Office at NASA headquarters in Washington.
        Survivors include his wife, Mildred McWilliams Hayes, a son and a daughter. Services were scheduled for Monday in Purcellville, Va.
