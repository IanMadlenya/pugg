        Richard Lincoln Frey, one of the great figures in contract bridge, died of cancer Monday night at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He gained fame in 1930, winning the Goldman Pairs at the Eastern tournament when contract bridge was in its infancy. He was a member of the Bid-Rite team from 1930 to 1932, and was the fifth man in the Four Aces squad from 1933 to 1935. In 1936, he was one of the original group of 10 nominated as life masters when that rank was introduced.
        His great years were 1934 and 1942, in each of which he achieved the rare double distinction of winning both major knockout events, the Vanderbilt and the Spingold. In a relatively short playing career, he won four other national events and was runner-up in seven. Worked With Culbertson
        In 1935, Mr. Frey, a native of Manhattan, became part of the organization of Ely Culbertson, the noted authority on bridge, and served as writer, editor and business manager of Kem Cards, the leading early maker of plastic playing cards.
        From 1937 to 1970, he collaborated with Howard Schenken on a syndicated daily bridge column. In the 1940's and 50's, he contributed nonfiction articles to major magazines.
        From 1958 to 1970, he was the director of public relations for the American Contract Bridge League and editor of its monthly bulletin. In that capacity he was the official commentator at many world championships and edited the annual record of deals played. His books included ''According to Hoyle'' and ''How to Win at Bridge in 10 Easy Lessons,'' as well as a book on canasta.
        After his retirement in 1970, he became president of the International Bridge Press Association, serving in the post for 11 years, and then was appointed president emeritus.
        He is survived by his wife, Mabel; a daughter, Stephanie Frey-Secor of Teaneck, N.J., and a grandchild.
        A memorial service is to be held on Sunday at 6 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, at 1076 Madison Avenue at 81st Street.
