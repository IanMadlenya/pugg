        George Lehr, a former State Auditor in Missouri who was credited with helping to clean up the scandal-plagued Teamsters Union Central States pension fund, died at his home here Monday.
        Mr. Lehr, who was 51 years old and had been executive director of the pension fund for the last 6 1/2 years, had had inoperable brain tumors for more than a year.
        A Democrat, Mr. Lehr defeated John Ashcroft, a Republican who is now Missouri's Governor, for State Auditor in 1974. Mr. Lehr was mentioned as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1976, but surprised many by annoucning that he was resigning as Auditor and leaving politics.
        He became president of the Empire Bank and Trust Company in Kansas City and later was chairman and chief executive officer of the Traders Bank there.
        Mr. Lehr accepted the pension fund job in 1981 and worked with the Federal Labor Department to clean it up. The fund had been linked to organized crime. Two years ago, the General Accounting Office of Congress said the fund was being run properly for the first time in its 30 years.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and two daughters.
