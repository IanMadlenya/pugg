        Toshiwo Doko, a former president of the Toshiba Corporation, who helped to revitalize Japanese manufacturing after World War II and promote recent administrative and fiscal changes in Japan, died today. He was 91 years old. No cause of death was given.  Mr. Doko was born in the southwestern city of Okayama in 1896. He joined the Tokyo Ishikawajima Shipyard, later renamed Ishikawajima Heavy Industries, after graduation from the Tokyo Higher Technical School.
        He became president of Ishikawajima Heavy Industries in 1950 and helped rescue the company from a recession.
        In 1964, he became chairman of Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, a major maker of heavy machinery, and was named president of Toshiba the following year. He became Toshiba's chairman in 1972 and held that post until his resignation in 1976, after which he remained as a consultant to the company.
        From 1974 to 1980, Mr. Doko was chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations, the so-called Keidanren, a grouping of about 1,000 major Japanese companies. While at Keidanren, Mr. Doko led delegations to the Soviet Union and China.
        He was appointed chairman of the Prime Minister's advisory council on administrative reform in 1981. His group submitted a recommendation two years later that led to the division of the state-run Japan National Railways into several private companies in 1987.
