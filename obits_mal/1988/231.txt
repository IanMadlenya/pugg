        Dr. John Allegro, who was renowned for his work in deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories that Western religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, died Wednesday. He was 65 years old.
        Dr. Allegro died at his home on his birthday, according to death notices and obituaries published today. No cause of death was given.
        Dr. Allegro, a brilliant student of Semitic languages at Manchester University, went on to study Hebrew dialects at Oxford University.
        In 1953, he was named to an international team formed to decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves above the Dead Sea six years earlier.
        The scrolls, which spanned the period from about 100 B.C. to A.D. 70, included the oldest known manuscripts of books from the Old Testament. Dr. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was crucial. His book, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956 and became a best seller.
        Dr. Allegro's later notoriety brought him derision in the scientific world, but he developed a cult following in the early 1970's. In his 1970 book ''The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,'' Dr. Allegro contended that Judaism and Christianity were products of an ancient cult based on sex and mushrooms. He theorized that Jesus's last words on the cross were not a lament to God but ''a paean of praise to the god of the mushroom.''
        Although trained for the Methodist ministry, he became a fervent anti-Christian devoted to debunking the story of Jesus.
        Dr. Allegro also published a 1966 book, ''Search in the Desert,'' about an unsuccessful search for lost scrolls in the Judean Desert.
        He is survived by a son and a daughter.
