       Sylvester, the gay entertainer whose falsetto voice and drag costumes propelled him to international fame, at the height of the disco dance popularity, died Friday of complications of AIDS. He was 42 years old. Known as ''the Queen of Disco'' here in the late 1970's, Sylvester delighted audiences of every race and sexual persuasion with his funky, spiritual style singing in his nightclub routine in which he wore exotic costumes.

        ''Sylvester gives a show that makes most performers look positively dowdy,'' wrote John Rockwell of The New York Times, in a Pop Life column. ''All of this might be of mostly sociological or psychological interest, except tht Sylvester also sings extremely well in a high tenor or in falsetto.''
        Five of his songs became gold record hits, selling more than 500,000 copies, and one went platinum, selling more than one million records. His soulful, glittery performance style influenced future stars like the Manhattan Transfer, Bette Midler and the Pointer Sisters.
        Among Sylvester's hits were ''Dance (Disco Heat)'' in 1978, which sold more than a million records; ''You Make Me Feel Mighty Real'' in 1979; ''Do You Wanna Funk?'' in 1982, and ''Someone Like You'' in 1987.
