        Austin Briggs-Hall, an actor who was a founder of the American Negro Theater and an authority on African history, died of heart failure Jan. 13 in Kings County Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Briggs-Hall, Frederick O'Neal, Abram Hill and others founded the American Negro Theater in the 1930's on West 135th Street, in what is now an annex of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
        Mr. Briggs-Hall began his career with the Rose McLendon Players, a Harlem company whose featured performers included Ossie Davis.
        In the 1950's, he was a member of Margaret Webster's Shakespeare Company, the first professional interracial Shakespearean touring company in the United States.
        An interest in African affairs led Mr. Briggs-Hall to help organize the African Academy of Arts and Research in the 1940's. The membership consisted mainly of African scholars and students studying in the United States.
        He is survived by his wife, Theresa Louise, and two sons, Austin Jr. and Martin.
        A memorial service is to be held Feb. 28 at 1 P.M. at the Schomburg Center, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street.
