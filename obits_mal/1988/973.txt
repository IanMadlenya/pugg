        Peter Hurkos, a professional psychic who sought clues in the murders for which followers of Charles M. Manson were convicted and in the Boston Strangler murders, died of a heart attack Wednesday, his publicist said. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Hurkos, born Pieter Van Der Hurk in the Netherlands, gained widespread attention in 1964 when Attorney General Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts said he had come ''uncannily close'' to describing the person suspected of strangling 11 women in Boston. Mr. Hurkos also helped the authorities in the 1969 Manson case.
        He had run-ins with the law as well and was convicted in Milwaukee in 1964 of impersonating an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
        Mr. Hurkos said he became psychic in 1941, when, while working as a painter, he fell from a ladder and suffered a brain injury.
        He came to the United States in 1956 for psychic experiments, and lived in the Los Angeles area about 25 years.
        He is survived by his wife, Stephany Courtney, their daughter, and six children from a previous marriage.
