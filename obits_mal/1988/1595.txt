        Dr. Regan, an early specialist in the teaching and research of retinal diseases and diagnostic ultrasonography, practiced ophthalmology in New Rochelle for 30 years.

A graduate of Harvard College and the Tufts University Medical School, he trained in ophthalmology at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Stanford University and the Wilmer Institute at Johns Hopkins University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Meda Kaesmeier; his mother, Winifred H., of Osterville, Mass.; a son, William F. 3d, of Manhattan; a daughter, Meda Ann Hieber Regan of Pelham Manor, and two sisters, Jean Quigley of Osterville, Mass., and Barbara Regan of Weston, Mass.
