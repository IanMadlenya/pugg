        Max Delson, a lawyer and Socialist Party leader, died of kidney failure Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Delson was a member of the Socialist Party's executive committee. He was among a group of party members in the mid-1930's who, under Norman Thomas, broke with party leaders who were accused of sabotaging the party and unconstitutionally excluding younger members from party work. Mr. Delson was elected chairman of a new state party committee.
        He was a founding member of the New York law firm of Delson & Gordon, which was dissolved late last year. He represented a number of labor unions, including the Pullman porters, and was closely associated with A. Philip Randolph, the leader of the Pullman railroad workers.
        He founded the Mutual Real Estate Investment Trust, now called the Intergroup Corporation, which fosters integrated housing throughout the country.
        Mr. Delson was born in Manhattan and graduated from Columbia College in 1924 and Columbia Law School in 1926.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Haupt; two brothers, Robert and Harry, both of Manhattan; two daughters, Mary Silverman, also of Manhattan, and Amy Kaplan of Atherton, Calif., and three grandchildren.
