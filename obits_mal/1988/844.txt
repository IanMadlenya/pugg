        Michael J. Shaara Jr., whose book on the Civil War, ''The Killer Angels,'' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1975, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home in Tallahassee, Fla. He was 58 years old.
        A native of Jersey City, N.J. and a graduate of Rutgers University, Mr. Shaara was an associate professor of English at Florida State University when he wrote his award-winning second novel. The book sought to re-create the battle of Gettysburg from the viewpoint of historical personages.
        After finishing it, Mr. Shaara came close to death in a motorcycle accident in Italy. He went on medical leave from Florida State University and eventually recovered physically, but his later writings never recaptured the attention of ''The Killer Angels'' and were only politely received.
        He is survived by a son, Jeffrey, of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Lila, of Pittsburgh; a brother, Richard B., of Gainesville, Fla., and a sister, Gloria Marek of Houston.
