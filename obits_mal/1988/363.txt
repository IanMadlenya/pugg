        Mr. Dubin's early work was influenced by Ben Shahn, whom he met while attending the Brooklyn Museum Art School. He was represented by the Kraushaar Galleries in New York from 1952 to 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen, and by his mother, Ida, and his sister, Gail Henley, both of Sherman Oaks, Calif.
