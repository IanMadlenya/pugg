        Louis D. Gualandi, an interior designer and a co-founder of Waterloo Village, a restoration in northwestern New Jersey, died of lung cancer yesterday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. He was 63 years old and lived in Waterloo.
        For the past 35 years, Mr. Gualandi bought and restored properties in Waterloo, along with his longtime companion, Percival H. E. Leach.
        Mr. Gualandi and Mr. Leach were partners, with the State of New Jersey, in administering the town, a restoration that recreates life in the early 19th century. Waterloo is part of Allamuchy Mountain State Park, a nature preserve.
        In 1968, the two men founded a music festival that has grown to include a summer music school for 85 students who study with the area's prominent musicians.
        Born in Staten Island, Mr. Gualandi attended the Whitman School of Design.
        Surviving is a sister, Edna Dell Aquila of Princeton, N.J.
