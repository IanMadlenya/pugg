        Ernest L. Cuneo, lawyer, writer and former owner of the North American Newspaper Alliance, died Tuesday at the National Hospital for Orthopedics and Rehabilitation in Washington after a heart attack. He was 82 years old and lived in Arlington, Va.
        He acquired the Newspaper Alliance in the mid-1950's and was its president until 1963, when he sold it. The news service discontinued operations in 1980.
        Mr. Cuneo worked as a law assistant to Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1931 and 1932, when the future New York City Mayor was a Republican Representative. Mr. Cuneo was the author of ''Life with Fiorello,'' published in 1955, which served in considerable part as the basis for the Broadway musical ''Fiorello.'' Mr. Cuneo was admitted to the New York Bar in 1932.
        From 1936 to 1940, Mr. Cuneo was associate counsel to the Democratic National Committee.
        During World War II, he served in the Office of Strategic Services under Gen. William J. Donovan as liaison officer for the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and British intelligence. He worked with the Italian underground and handled special operations in the Western Hemisphere and North Africa.
        After the war, he returned to the practice of law.
        From 1963 to 1980, he was a syndicated columnist and military analyst with the North American Newspaper Alliance.
        He is survived by a son, Jonathan, of Arlington, and a daughter, Sandra C. de Pury of Manhattan, and a grandchild.
