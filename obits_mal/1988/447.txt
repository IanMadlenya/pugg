        Neil Williams, an artist who pioneered in the use of the shaped canvas, died of a heart attack while visiting a friend in New York last Friday. He was 53 years old, and had recently been living in Brazil.
        An ''artist's artist,'' who was admired by his peers but not well known to the general public, Mr. Williams showed at the Green Gallery in the early 1960's, and later that decade at the Andre Emmerich Gallery. Beginning as hard-edge abstraction in the early 1960's, his imagery in recent years had recapitulated forms and themes from earlier work in an increasingly painterly way. In 1986, a retrospective of his work was mounted at the Clocktower, the alternative space in TriBeCa.
        Mr. Williams was born in Bluff, Utah, in 1934, and attended the San Francisco Art Institute. For a time in the 1970's, he lived and worked in a studio in East Hampton, L.I., that he shared with the artist Frank Stella. At his death, he was planning to take up permanent residence in Sao Paulo, where he had a successful gallery show in 1982. Another show will open there in the next few weeks.
        Mr. Williams is survived by a sister, Jeanne Anderson of Tooele, Utah. A memorial service is to be held Friday at 3 P.M. at the Socrates Sculpture Park, 30-40 Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City, Queens.
