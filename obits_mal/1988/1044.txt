        Mr. Farrell, who won the United States Open in 1928 when he beat Bobby Jones by 1 shot in a 36-hole playoff, played in the first Masters tournament and was on the pro tour from 1919 until the mid-1930's. At one point he won nine professional tournaments in a row, a record that Byron Nelson broke in 1941. He finished second in the United States Open twice, second in the PGA Tournament twice and second in the British Open once.
