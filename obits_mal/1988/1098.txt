        Charles S. Krakauer, an engineer who was instrumental in the introduction of the first hand-held calculator in 1971, died of lung cancer on July 15 at the Newton-Wellesley (Mass.) Hospital. He was 58 years old and lived in Weston, Mass.
        Mr. Krakauer was vice chairman of the Bowmar Instruments Corporation, a maker of electronic and electromechanical products, formerly of Acton, Mass., and now in Phoenix.
        The calculator, introduced in 1971, cost $249 and soon became known as ''the Bowmar Brain.'' Sales boomed and Bowmar was turning out 100,000 a month at two plants. But Texas Instruments entered the field and fierce competition ensued, with Bowmar going into bankruptcy in 1975. Bowmar sued on antitrust grounds and won a $5 million out-of-court settlement, which put the company back in business.
        Mr. Krakauer, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served in the Army at the White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico from 1953 to 1955.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Molly Bondareff; four sons, Lawrence, of Wellesley; Bruce, of Evanston, Ill.; John, of Colorado Springs, and David, of Weston; two daughters, Kathryn Abend of Westford, Mass., and Joanne, of Brighton, Mass., and two grandchildren.
