        Louis W. Gates, a chemical researcher who played an important role in the modern development of the liquid disinfectant known as Lysol, died Monday at the Waterview Nursing Home in Cedar Grove, N.J., where he lived. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Gates spent 35 years, from 1930 to 1965, working for Lehn & Fink Inc., the 114-year-old laboratory and manufacturer of household chemical products in New Jersey. The concern became a division of Sterling Drug Inc. in 1966.
        In his early years with Lehn & Fink, Mr. Gates and a fellow chemist, Emil Klarmann, invented a phenol compound that became the base for today's Lysol liquid disinfectant. They received a patent for their work on July 24, 1934.
        Mr. Gates, who was a native New Yorker, earned a bachelor of science degree in chemistry from the old Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1926. The school is now known as the Polytechnic University.
        He is survived by a son, James, of Essex Fells, N.J.; a daughter, Gail Taylor of Wycoff, N.J.; two sisters, Lillian Riszak of Wayne, N.J., and Margaret Merkle of Plainfield, N.J.; 11 grandchildren, and 6 great-grandchildren.
