        Dr. Bern Dibner, a science historian and founder of the Burndy Corporation, manufacturer of electrical and electronic equipment, died in his sleep Tuesday night at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 90 years old.
        Dr. Dibner, who was born in the Ukraine and came to the United States with his family in 1904, grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and graduated with honors in electrical engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
        In 1924, while working as an engineer designing the electrification of Cuba, he foresaw the need for improved methods of connecting electrical conductors and founded the Burndy Engineering Company in Norwalk, Conn.
        Dr. Dibner, who held 24 patents for connector design, built his company into a worldwide supplier of connectors for the utility, construction, computer and aerospace industries. He retired in 1972.
        In the 1930's Dr. Dibner's interest in the history of science led him to begin assembling two major collections of source material, which are now the Dibner Library on the History of Science and Technology at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Burndy Library in Norwalk. Last year a consortium of five academic institutions established the Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology.
        His wife, the former Barbara Druss, died last year.
        He is survived by his son, David, chairman of the Burndy Corporation; three grandsons, and five great-grandchildren.
