        Woody Kling, a television comedy writer, died of lung and brain cancer at U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles Sunday. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Kling's career began in the 1940's, when he wrote sketches, jokes and the theme song for Milton Berle's ''Texaco Star Theater'' with Buddy Arnold. ''Woody was a multiple talent who could write any type of comedy anytime you needed it,'' Mr. Berle said yesterday.
        Mr. Kling created and produced the television cartoons ''Casper, the Friendly Ghost'' and ''The Beatles,'' and wrote scripts for Jackie Gleason, Carol Burnett, Red Buttons and other comedians. His television specials, which numbered more than 40, included the ''Cabbage Patch Kids Christmas Special.'' He was nominated for five Emmy Awards and won Emmys in 1972 and 1973 for his scripts for ''The Carol Burnett Show.''
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and his son, Anthony, both of Los Angeles.
