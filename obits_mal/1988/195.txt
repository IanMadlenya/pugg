        Martin K. Speckter, a retired advertising executive known to lexicographers as the creator of the interrobang, a punctuation mark used to convey disbelief, died of bone cancer Sunday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        From 1956 to 1969, Mr. Speckter was president of Martin K. Speckter Associates Inc., which handled promotion for The Wall Street Journal, The National Observer, Barron's weekly and the Dow Jones News Service. In 1962, Mr. Speckter developed the interrobang, since recognized by several dictionaries and some type and typewriter companies.
        The interrobang, which combines an exclamation point and a question mark, looks like this:
        The mark is said to be the typographical equivalent of a grimace or a shrug of the shoulders. It applied solely to the rhetorical, Mr. Speckter said, when a writer wished to convey incredulity.
        For example, the interrobang would be used in an expression like this: ''You call that a hat?''
        In 1969, Martin K. Speckter Associates merged with Clinton E. Frank Advertising. Mr. Speckter retired in 1974.
        He was editor of TYPEtalks magazine from 1959 to 1968 and wrote many articles. He was also the author of a book, ''Disquisition on the Composing Stick'' published by Typophiles Inc. in 1971.
        Mr. Speckter is survived by his wife, the former Penny Bank; a sister, Adeline Sneider of Manhattan, and two nephews.
