        Mr. Novik graduated from New York University Law School in 1972.
        Before his appointment to head the agency in 1986, he worked for 10 years at the American Civil Liberties Union in New York City, where he served as national staff counsel and acting legal director. He led the organization's successful challenges to Louisiana's scientific creationism law, which was an attempt to teach biblical creation in the public schools, and to New Jersey's moment-of-silence statute.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Ann; a daughter, Jennifer; his mother, Pauline, of Manhattan, and a brother, Neil, who lives in Pennsylvania.
