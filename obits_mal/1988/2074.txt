        Mr. Rhoad, a baritone, spent 26 years with the quintet, which was formed in Brooklyn in 1962, singing a repertory ranging from gospel to rock-and-roll. The group has performed in concerts throughout the world and has released a dozen albums. Mr. Rhoad, who was born in South Carolina, sang with several other pop groups after he moved to Brooklyn as a teen-ager.
