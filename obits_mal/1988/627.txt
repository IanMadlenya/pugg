        Michael Lantz, a sculptor who made dozens of monumental, figurative and memorial sculptures for Government buildings, churches and other sites around the United States, died of a stroke Monday at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London, Conn. He was 80 years old and lived in Old Saybrook, Conn.
        Mr. Lantz, whose older brother, Walter Lantz, was a film animator and created the Woody Woodpecker cartoon, studied at the National Academy of Design and the Beaux Arts Institute in New York.
        In 1938, at age 29, he won a $45,600 commission for two monumental stone sculptures. Entitled ''Man Restraining Trade,'' each depicting a burly figure reining in a bucking horse, they still stand at the Federal Trade Commission building in Washington.
        Among his other major commissions is the 28-foot-high sculpture of St. Avold at the Lorraine American Cemetery and Memorial near St. Avold, France, which is the largest cemetery in Europe for American soldiers killed in World War II. Mr. Lantz also frequently designed commemorative and historical medals and seals.
        He served as the president of the National Sculpture Society from 1970 to 1973, and was editor of its publication, the Sculpture Review, from 1955 to 1957 and from 1973 to 1984. He taught sculpture at the National Academy School of Fine Arts in New York, from 1964 to 1980.
        He is survived by his brother and by four nieces.
