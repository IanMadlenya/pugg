        Paul Tasman, an executive of the International Business Machines Corporation who spent nearly 30 years helping to prepare a computerized index of the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, died Saturday. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Tasman was assigned by I.B.M. to work with the Rev. Roberto Busa, a Jesuit, on the Aquinas book, a joint effort of an Italian financial committee and the Roman Catholic Church. He and Father Busa compiled the 50-volume Index Thomisticus, a comprehensive concordance of the 13th-century philosopher's writings.
        The job involved indexing more than 12 million words, 16 times longer than there are in the Bible. It took about 10,000 computer hours and 1 million human hours to finish. Mr. Tasman retired from I.B.M. in 1969, the year the work was completed.
