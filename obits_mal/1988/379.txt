        Billy Butterfield, a trumpeter who played with the Bob Crosby, Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman bands, died of cancer yesterday at his home. He was 71 years old and lived in North Palm Beach, Fla.
        Charles William (Billy) Butterfield, who preferred ballads to jazz, introduced the song ''What's New'' when he was with the Bob Crosby band in the 1930's, and it remained closely identified with him. His tenure with Artie Shaw is remembered for his performance of ''Stardust'' and his playing with Mr. Shaw's 1940 Gramercy Five.
        During his World War II military service, Mr. Butterfield performed with the U.S. Army Band, and in the mid-1940's he started to play with the staff orchestras of ABC and NBC. He also played with the Les Brown orchestra and the World's Greatest Jazz Band, which was founded in 1968. From 1973 until the 80's he toured frequently in the United Kingdom, Europe and South Africa.
        Mr. Butterfield is survived by his wife, Dorothy; two daughters, Deborah Curtis of Lake Park, Fla., and Judi Burke of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and two sons, Michael, of Charlotte, N.C., and Patrick, of Charlottesville, Va.
