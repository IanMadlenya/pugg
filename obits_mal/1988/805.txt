        A native of Cincinnati and a 1955 graduate of Notre Dame, Mr. Kennedy joined Time's Chicago bureau in 1962. Not long afterward, he was assigned to New York, where he wrote 25 cover stories about such subjects as Lee Trevino, Muhammad Ali, Arthur Rubenstein and Rudolf Nureyev. In 1974, he joined Sports Illustrated as a senior writer.
        Mr. Kennedy is survived by his wife, Patricia, and nine children. A funeral Mass will be offered at 11 A.M. on Tuesday at the Holy Name Church, Amsterdam Avenue and 96th Street.
