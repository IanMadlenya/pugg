        He joined The Times in 1953 and reported extensively on railroads and other modes of transportation before becoming assistant to the financial editor. Earlier he had spent 16 years with The Wall Street Journal, where he began as a copy boy while attending New York University at night. He went on to cover bonds and other investments and to start The Journal's Business Milestones column.
        In 1972, he won the G. M. Loeb award for excellence in business and financial journalism. Mr. Bedingfield, a charter member of the New York Financial Writers Association, served as its president in 1963 and received an award last June for distinguished service on the group's 50th anniversary.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Grace Maguire; three daughters, Thomasina, of Ipswich, Mass.; Roberta Gregorchik of Newburyport, Mass., and Penelope Silverman of Oak Park, Ill; three brothers, Clifford, of Oak Park; Victor, of Mount Prospect, Ill., and Charles, of Somers, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
