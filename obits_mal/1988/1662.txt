        It said that Mr. Losev had died on Monday. The announcement did not indicate the cause of his death.
        An obituary note signed by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said that ''Soviet journalism has suffered a grievous loss,''
        Mr. Losev had directed Tass since 1979.
        The announcement today praised him as a ''man of great spiritual generosity'' who ''devoted all of his energy and experience to the work given him by the party and Government.
        ''His sense of purpose, industry and humaneness won him deep respect from all who knew him,'' it added.
        Mr. Losev joined Tass in 1950 after graduating from the Moscow Institute of International Relations, and worked as a correspondent and bureau chief in the United States and in Israel. In 1973 he became assistant director of Tass.
        He was a member of the Communist Party's Central Auditing Commission, a delegate to the last two Communist Party congresses and to the special party conference in June. He had been a member of the Supreme Soviet, the national Parliament, as well.
