        Joseph A. Caruso, founder and chairman of the board of Bar Harbor Airways, died Friday. He was 67 years old.
        Caruso, a native of Lawrence, Mass., founded the airline with his brother Thomas in 1946 with three planes operating from the town pier in Bar Harbor.
        The airline expanded rapidly in the early 1970's, becoming one of the nation's largest commuter lines. In 1986, the company sold a half interest to Texas Air Corporaton and changed its name to Eastern Express.
        Mr. Caruso subsequently founded Maine Aviation Corporation in Portland.
