        Trinidad Silva Jr., who portrayed a gang leader in the movie ''Colors'' and in the NBC television series ''Hill Street Blues,'' was killed Sunday in an automobile accident that also injured his wife and son, the police said. He was 38 years old and lived here.
        Mr. Silva was pronounced dead at the scene, said Dave Campbell, an official of the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.
        Mr. Silva's wife, Sofia, 28, and their 2-year-old son, Samuel, suffered minor injuries and were treated, said Julie Maxwell, a nursing supervisor at Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital.
        In ''Hill Street Blues,'' Mr. Silva played the wisecracking gang leader Jesus Martinez, who taunted Capt. Frank Furillo by calling him ''Frankie boy.''
        He also portrayed ''Frog,'' an older gang leader, in ''Colors,'' a recent film by Dennis Hopper about gang warfare in Los Angeles.
        The driver of the vehicle that struck Mr. Silva's, Douglas Robert Owens, 35, of La Habra, Calif., was booked for investigation of felony drunken driving, felony hit and run and vehicular manslaughter, the police said.
