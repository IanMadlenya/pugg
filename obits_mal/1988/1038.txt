        John W. Yengo Sr., a former controversial Municipal Court judge in Jersey City, died of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare allergic reaction, Saturday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 72 years old and lived in Jersey City.
        Mr. Yengo, a 1948 graduate of John Marshall Law School, was in private law practice in Jersey City and twice ran unsuccessfully for mayor.
        He was appointed to the Municipal Court in 1974 and was often called Maximum John because of the severity of his sentences. He was suspended four years later and eventually ousted by the New Jersey Supreme Court as ''totally unsuited'' because of discourtesy to defendants and their lawyers and ''manifold abuses of the judicial process.''
        He is survived by three daughters, Donna Marie Cardamone of Neshanic, N.J., Laura Ann, of Manhattan, Suzy, of Jersey City, and a son, John, of Jersey City.
