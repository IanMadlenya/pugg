        Mr. Bernstein presented classical and jazz concerts as well as dance and theater performances throughout Long Island during the 1950's, 60's and 70's. His career as an impresario began in 1951, when he helped found the Roslyn Music Group, which presented chamber-music ensembles and soloists on Long Island.
        Mr. Bernstein established the Concert Hall series in 1964, saying at the time that Long Island had ''an omnivorous appetite for the arts.'' The nonprofit subscription series continued for 15 years, and included about 30 performances a season at such sites as the Nassau Coliseum, the C. W. Post Center at Long Island University, and school auditoriums in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. Performances ranged from concerts by the New York Philharmonic to shows by Broadway road companies.
        Mr. Bernstein also wrote plays, novels, magazine articles, television pilots and, for 14 years, the ''Superman'' comic books.
        He is survived by his wife, Beverly, of Upper Brookville; a daughter, Alison, of Manhattan; a sister, Louise Sandler of Elkins Park, Pa., and two grandchildren.
