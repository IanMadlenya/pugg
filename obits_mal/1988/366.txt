        Mr. King, who rarely used his given name, Chevene, represented the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who was not related to him, and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy when they were arrested in civil rignts demonstrations in 1962.
        That year Mr. King suffered head wounds when he went to the Albany courthouse to visit protesters who had been arrested after picketing at City Hall. He accused a sheriff of striking him with a walking cane and causing a gash that required four stitches to close.
        In 1970, Mr. King was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor of Georgia, becoming the first black to run for the office since Reconstruction. He finished a distant third in the Democratic primary.
        Mr. King is survived by his wife, the former Carol Roumain; four sons, Chevene B. Jr. and Kenyon, both of Albany; Leland, of Tallahasee, Fla., and Clennon, of Atlanta; a daughter, Peggy King, of Manhattan; two grandchildren; four brothers, and a sister.
