        Dennis Farrell, who gained brief fame as Los Angeles's ''Hermit of Griffith Park'' in the 1950's, died June 12. He was 62.
        Mr. Farrell fought as an infantryman on Okinawa and received a Purple Heart after he was shot in the lung. He became a nomad after the war, leaving his family in North Platte and wandering to California.
        About 1953, he renounced civilization and moved into a cave in a remote area of Griffith Park, a huge, hilly reserve not far from downtown Los Angeles. He would emerge only at night to scavenge for food left at picnic tables and in garbage cans.
        Police arrested him as a vagrant in 1959, and the resulting publicity brought him worldwide recognition.
        Mr. Farrell never returned to his hermit life, spending the next 15 years or so working at odd jobs and being treated for mental problems at various veterans hospitals.
        He returned to his hometown in the mid-1970s.
