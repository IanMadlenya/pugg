        Benjamin Lawrence, whose advertising art agency, Lawrence Studios, was among the largest in the industry in the 1930's and 1940's, died of lymph cancer at Beth Israel Hospital on April 25. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan. He had lived for many years in New Paltz, N.Y.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Lawrence was a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School. He employed many commercial artists in his agency, which went out of business abruptly in December 1950 after Mr. Lawrence was denounced by Counterattack, an anti-Communist newsletter that gained wide circulation in government and business circles.
        The newsletter, published by a group called American Business Consultants, cited the Lawrence Studios, which supplied advertising art for some of the largest corporations in the country and did work for the United States Navy and the Treasury Department, as an example of how the Communist Party ''gets rich on government and capitalists.''
        Immediately after Counterattack published its charges in its issue of Nov. 24, 1950, Mr. Lawrence found his company cut off by advertising agencies. Within weeks he went out of business. He later became a package designer and a consultant to commercial art firms.
        Mr. Lawrence refused to respond publicly to Counterattack's charges that he was engaged in Communist activities, contending that his political beliefs were a private matter, Surviving are Mr. Lawrence's wife, the former Anne Reynolds; a sister, Anna Lewis of North Hollywood, Calif.; a son, Nicholas, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Christina Longo of Rome, and two grandchildren.
