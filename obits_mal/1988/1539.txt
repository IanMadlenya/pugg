        Mr. Jenner, who received his law degree from the University of Illinois in 1930, was a counsel to the Warren Commission on the Kennedy assassination. He headed the team that investigated the life of Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.
        In 1974, after he advocated the impeachment of President Nixon, he was replaced by the Republicans as their chief special counsel on the House Judciary Committee's inquiry into the President's role in the Watergate breakin and cover-up. The committee later recommended impeachment.
        Mr. Jenner, who received numerous awards and eight honorary degrees, was a former president of the Illinois Bar Association and a former chairman of the Judiciary Selection Committee of the American Bar Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Nadine Newbill Jenner, of Kenilworth, and a daughter, Cynthia, of Manhattan.
