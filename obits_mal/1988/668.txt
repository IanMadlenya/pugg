        Sir William McMahon, a former Prime Minister of Australia, died of cancer today. He was 80 years old.
        Sir William, who entered Parliament in 1949, served as Prime Minister and head of the Liberal Party in 1971-72. He previously headed the Treasury and the Foreign Affairs Department.
        He became Prime Minister on March 10, 1971, after John Gorton was ousted as Prime Minister and Liberal Party leader in a dispute within the party. But Sir William lost to Gough Whitlam of the Labor Party the next year.
        His coalition of Liberal and Country parties had been criticized by opponents for following the lead of the United States too closely in foreign policy.
        Prime Minister Bob Hawke of the Labor Party praised Sir William's service.
        ''Although on opposite sides of the political fence, I found Sir William a generous opponent,'' Mr. Hawke said in a statement. ''He maintained an enormous enthusiasm for and interest in public affairs after his retirement from Parliament and was constructive in his discussions on economics and political matters.''
        Malcolm Fraser, a former Liberal Prime Minister, called Sir William a vigorous administrator and tenacious member of Parliament who would be remembered for three decades of dedicated service.
        Sir William is survived by his wife, Lady Sonia, his son, Julian, and two daughters, Belinda and Deborah.
