        Dr. Clowes taught at the Harvard Medical School for two decades. In 1983 he led a group of researchers who isolated a peptide, a form of amino acid that is released much faster in sick people, converting muscle protein into other amino acids used to supply energy and to heal and maintain vital organ functions but leaving the muscle tissue weak.
        Dr. Clowes suggested that by regulating this process physicians could protect the body from muscle starvation and from susceptibility to other diseases and infections in prolonged illness.
        A native of Buffalo, he was a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. He taught at Case Western Reserve Medical School and at the Medical College of South Carolina before returning to Harvard in 1965 as a clinical professor of surgery. He retired in 1985. Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Jackson; three sons, Dr. Alexander Clowes of Seattle, Thomas, of Rochester, N.Y., and Jonathan, of Walpole, N.H.; two daughters, Margaret Bowles of Woods Hole and Elizabeth, of West Lafayette, Ind.; a brother, Alan, of Indianapolis, and eight grandchildren.
