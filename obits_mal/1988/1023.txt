        Bert Greene, a cookbook author and food columnist, died of a heart attack Friday at New York Hospital. He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan and Amagansett, L.I.
        Mr. Greene based his first book, ''The Store Cookbook,'' published in 1974 by the H. Regnery Company, on his seven years of operating The Store, an Amagansett shop that prepared salads, pates and mousses for summer parties.
        Opened in 1966 by Mr. Greene and Dennis Vaughan, The Store was among the first takeout stores of its kind in the nation.
        Mr. Greene went on to write six more cookbooks and teach at cooking schools around the country. His seventh book, ''Greene on Grains,'' is to be published by Workman Publishing this fall.
        Mr. Greene's syndicated food column, started in 1980, appeared in six newspapers, including The Daily News. His longtime companion, Phillip Schulz, collaborated on the column and other work.
        Before becoming a cookbook author, Mr. Greene wrote several plays, including ''My Mother's House,'' an adaptation of the novel by Colette.
        There are no survivors.
