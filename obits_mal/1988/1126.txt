        Hans Nadelhoffer, the president of Christie's in Geneva, died yesterday in Geneva. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Nadelhoffer died of pneumonia at the Cantonal Hospital, according to Francois Curiel, an executive vice president of Christie's in New York.
        Known for his knowledge of period and modern gems, Mr. Nadelhoffer organized Christie's first major jewelry auctions in Geneva after he joined the house in 1968. Geneva soon became the world center for jewelry auctions organized by Christie's and other auction houses.
        Mr. Nadelhoffer left Christie's from 1981 through 1983 to research and write ''Cartier - Jewelers Extraordinary,'' a history of the Paris-based jeweler, which was published by Harry N. Abrams. On his return to Christie's in Geneva in 1984, he was made president.
        He is survived by a brother, Daniel, of Lausanne; a sister, Fanny Derendeinger of Zurich, and his mother, Gertrude, of Bern.
