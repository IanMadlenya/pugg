        Mr. Kahn, a graduate of New York University and of the New York Law School, was perhaps best known for his book ''The Secure Executive: The Secret of Becoming One, Being One, Staying One.'' published in 1986 by G. P. Putnam's Sons. He also wrote ''The No-Nonsense Success Guides,'' a series of books on how to start a business, and was the author of two works of fiction, ''New York, New York 10022,'' published in 1982, and ''The Mall,'' in 1985.
        He is survived by his wife, Evelyn, and a son, Andrew, both of Greenwich and by his mother, Lotte L. Kahn, and a sister, Carol, both of Manhattan.
