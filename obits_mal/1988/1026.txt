        Mr. Allen, the party's first candidate for Governor in 1944, was the Minnesota National Democratic Committeeman from 1948 to 1955.
        A native of Iowa, Mr. Allen was elected to the Iowa Legislature in 1927 and served until 1932. In 1933 he became secretary of the Iowa Senate. He was director of the Iowa Old Age Assistance System from 1934 to 1939.
        In 1940 he and his family moved to Detroit Lakes, where Mr. Allen continued a farm management and insurance business founded by his grandfather.
        Mr. Allen was a member of the fusion committee that met in June 1944 to found Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. Hubert H. Humphrey was the chief spokesman for the fusion Democrats.
        A few months later, Mr. Humphrey managed Mr. Allen's campaign as the party's first candidate for Governor. Mr. Allen lost to the Republican candidate, Edward J. Thye.
        Mr. Allen gave one of the 17 speeches nominating Franklin D. Roosevelt for President in 1944.
        In 1955, Mr. Allen was appointed Minnesota Commissioner of Agriculture. He left the post in 1961 to become assistant United States Secretary of Agriculture.
        He returned to Detroit Lakes in 1969 and continued in the family business until retiring about three years ago.
        Survivors include a son, a daughter, a sister and five grandchildren.
