        Jens Peter Larsen, a Danish musicologist whose investigations into the music of Haydn contributed enormously to understanding of the composer's style, died Monday of complications from gallbladder surgery. He was 86 years old and lived in Copenhagen.
        Mr. Larsen, who served as the general editor of two major editions of Haydn's music published between 1949 and 1955, began his Haydn studies as a musicology student at Copenhagen University in the 1930's, and it was with his dissertation ''The Haydn Tradition,'', that he earned a doctorate in 1939.
        In 1975 he was the chairman of the International Haydn Conference in Washington, and in 1979 he published a revision of the Haydn catalogue he had first issued in 1941. Trained as an Organist
        Mr. Larsen was born in Copenhagen on June 14, 1902, and was trained as an organist at the Royal Danish Conservatory. He joined the faculty of Copenhagen University after completing his doctoral work there, and later directed its institute of musicology. He was a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley in 1961, and at the University of Wisconsin a decade later.
        Besides his work on Haydn, Mr. Larsen published influential papers on the music of Handel, and on stylistic authenticity in the performance of Baroque and Classical music. He also wrote about Danish church music, and at the time of his death he had been preparing a study on the music of Haydn's predecessors.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Henrik, and a daughter, Anne, all of Copenhagen.
