        Jack Rosenberg, a retired acting justice of the State Supreme Court, died after a heart attack Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Justice Rosenberg was appointed to the Criminal Court in 1959 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner. He ran for election to the Supreme Court but, as a Republican without Democratic Party endorsement, was never able to win. However, he was named an acting justice in 1971 by Chief Judge Lawrence H. Cooke. He served on the Supreme Court until 1982, when he was reassigned to Criminal Court under a plan to rotate acting justices serving in Supreme Court.
        He joined a lawsuit filed by Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, to overturn the rotation system. Justice Rosenberg contended that his service for more than a decade entitled him not to be sent back to Criminal Court. His view prevailed, and he returned to the Supreme Court until his retirement in 1985.
        Justice Rosenberg, a native of Manhattan, graduated from New York University Law School and was in private practice until his appointment to Criminal Court.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Oaklander; a son, David, of Manhattan; a daughter, Barbara Bader of Huntington Beach, Calif., and three grandchildren.
