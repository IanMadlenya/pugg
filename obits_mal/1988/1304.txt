        Mr. Riordan, a graduate of Yale who specialized in combinational mathematics, wrote several books on the subject. He joined Bell Labs in 1926, shortly after they were established, and retired in 1968, when he became a member of the adjunct staff at Rockefeller.
        He is survived by two daughters, Sheila B., of Scituate, and Kathleen T. Speeth of El Cerrito, Calif., and East Hampton, L.I.; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
