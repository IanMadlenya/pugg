        Albert Decker, founder and director emeritus of the Fertility Research Foundation in Manhattan, died of a heart attack Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 93 years old and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
        Dr. Decker established the nonprofit organization in 1963, making it one of the first centers devoted exclusively to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. In 1942 he developed a medical examination called culdoscopy. It was the forerunner of laparoscopy, which made possible in vitro fertilization, the fertilization of an egg outside the body. He was the author of a number of articles and books on fertility. The most recent book, ''Why Can't We Have a Baby?'' was published in 1978 by Dial Press.
        Dr. Decker was born in Ambia, Ind., and received his medical degree in obstetrics and gynecology from New York University's Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1920.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Knippenberg, and two sons, Dr. Wayne, of Scarborough, N.Y., and Albert of Orlando, Fla.
