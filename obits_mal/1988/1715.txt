        Wayland Flowers, a ventriloquist who brought life to a cackling, off-color puppet named Madame, died on Tuesday, five weeks after collapsing on stage. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Flowers had been suffering from cancer for some time, said his press agent, JoAnne Geffen.
        The puppeteer created a number of characters, but it was the craggy old hussy Madame, manipulated with rods rather than strings, that won him popularity on television and in night clubs.
        Mr. Flowers's first big break on television came on the ''Andy Williams'' show and led to guest appearances on ''Hollywood Squares'' and a four-year stint on ''Solid Gold.'' His syndicated situation comedy, ''Madame's Place,'' was shown in 1982.
        ''This was an underground act that took root and shot up out of nowhere,'' Mr. Flowers once said in an interview, adding: ''I'm an illusionist. I'm right out there on stage beside Madame, but within two or three minutes it seems that I disappear.''
        He is survived by a sister and a brother.
