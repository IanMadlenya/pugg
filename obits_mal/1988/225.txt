        Mr. Morse was an executive vice president of the Doughnut Corporation of America, which he joined in 1937. He was elected chairman of the board of trustees of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the national association of Reform Jewish congregations, in 1967 and served until 1971.
        In 1968 Mr. Morse and Alvin C. Coleman, president of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan, the largest Reform congregation in the nation, played major roles in getting the temple to rejoin the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. The temple had split from the organization over policy disputes prompted by the Vietnam War.
        Mr. Morse also served as vice president of the board of governors of the American Jewish Committee.
        A graduate of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, he earned a law degree from Harvard in 1930.
        In 1973 he received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. He was elected to that school's board of governors in 1957.
        Mr. Morse built an extensive collection of ancient Chinese paintings and sculptures. Part of it was shown on a nationwide tour in 1969 and 1970, and paintings and sculptures from his collection have also been featured in exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Irene Levitt of Manhattan; three sons, Albert, of Sausalito, Calif.; Stephen, of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and Jonathan, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
