        Paul Thek, an artist best known for installations of objects depicting surrealistic scenes of death and renewal, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 54 years old.
        Sheyla Baykal, a friend of Mr. Thek's, said the cause of death was complications resulting from hepatitis and gastrointestinal disease.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Thek became well known in the mid-1960's with a series of installations at the Stable Gallery and the Pace Gallery in Manhattan. His works often depicted gruesome scenes of decay and were likened by critics to medical wax models, or to three-dimensional surrealism resembling the work of Salvador Dali.
        Mr. Thek was widely shown in museums and galleries in the United States and Europe, and did commissioned installations for the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Kunst Museum in Lucerne, Swizterland, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art, among others.
        He is survived by his father, George, of Floral Park, L.I.; two brothers, Laurence, of Washington and Robert, of Oyster Bay Cove, L.I., and his sister, Helen, of Germantown, Tenn.
