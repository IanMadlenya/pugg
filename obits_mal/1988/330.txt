        Dr. John Reich, who guided the Goodman Theater from an academic adjunct of the Art Institute of Chicago to one of the nation's best resident professional ensembles, died of congestive heart failure Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 81 years old.
        Born in Vienna, Dr. Reich studied under the influential Austrian director Max Reinhardt and became the youngest director at the National Theater of Austria. He came to the United States in 1938 and six years later earned a Ph.D. in theater arts from Cornell University. Later he directed at schools and festivals around the country, on and off Broadway and for CBS television.
        In 1957, Dr. Reich and Jean Stock Goldstone adapted Friedrich Schiller's ''Mary Stuart,'' in a Phoenix Theater production staged by Sir Tyrone Guthrie and starring Irene Worth and Eva Le Galliene. That year, he became head of the Goodman, hiring professional talent and attracting thousands of new subscribers to the Chicago theater. When he was awarded one of the first Ford Foundation grants to creative artists in 1959, he turned the $10,000 grant over to the Goodman to further the goal of professionalization.
        After leaving the Goodman in 1972, Dr. Reich continued to direct and lecture at such institutions as the State University at Stony Brook and, most recently, at the Hammerstein Center for Theater Studies at Columbia University.
