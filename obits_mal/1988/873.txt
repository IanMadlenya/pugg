        William Sunners, who wrote more than 100 books on how to win prizes in contests, died of congestive heart failure Monday at Brookdale Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 84 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Sunners quit his job as a New York City high school teacher in 1960 because he had earned more writing jingles and devoted his time to jingles, contests and books.
        He is survived by his wife, Rebecca; a son, Harold, both of Brooklyn; a daughter, Marilyn Cranin of Hewlett, L.I.; a sister, Dr. Elizabeth Sunners of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
