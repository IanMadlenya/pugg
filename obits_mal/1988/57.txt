        Rolf Presthus, chairman of the Conservative Party and a former Finance Minister, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Friday, his family said. He was 51 years old.
        Mr. Presthus, a lawyer and a member of Norway's 157-member Parliament since 1969, served from 1981 to 1986 as Finance Minister. He was appointed Defense Minister and party chairman in April 1986, but one month later the Cabinet resigned after a no-confidence vote in Parliament.
        In September, he unexpectedly announced that he intended to resign as the Conservative leader at the party's convention in January.
