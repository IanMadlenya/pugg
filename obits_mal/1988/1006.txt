        The Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Tekle Haimanot, has died at the age of 70, the Ethiopian press agency reported Tuesday.
        It said he died Sunday of an illness that was not specified.
        He was elected Patriarch, or head of the church, in 1976.
        Five years later, he met with Pope John Paul II in Italy. It was the first meeting between the leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church in modern times, and the Pope called it part of a ''common search among all Christians for growth together toward full unity.''
        The Ethiopian Orthodox Church was founded in 328, and it is estimated that more than half of Ethiopia's people are adherents.
