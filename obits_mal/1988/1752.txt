        Dr. Mayers, who was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and earned a Ph.D. in English from New York University in 1969, was also the affirmative action officer for the college and taught English there for almost 30 years. He was the co-author of ''The Two-Way Mirror; Human Interaction in Psychotherapy,'' published this year by Simon & Schuster.
        Dr. Mayers joined the faculty at Brooklyn College in 1959 after a brief teaching assignment at Kent State University. In 1969 he was named director of Afro-American studies and the following year chairman of a newly created department of the same name.
        He is survived by his sister, Barbara L. Smith of Pittsburgh.
