        Memphis Slim, an American blues singer who lived in Paris for more than two decades, died Wednesday in Necker Hospital here, his family announced today. He was 72 years old.
        One of the most successful of modern blues performers, Memphis Slim was the author of the song ''Everyday I Have the Blues,'' which was later popularized by Count Basie's orchestra.
        The singer and piano player, whose real name was Peter Chatman, was given his nickname by the producer Lester Melrose when he moved to Chicago in 1937 after performing in the bars and dance halls of the South. Success quickly followed and he headed a blues band, the House Rockers, in 1944-45.
        In 1959, he founded a duo with the bassist Willie Dixon and made successful appearances in New York before crossing the Atlantic to perform in Europe.
        From the early 60's he performed at the Trois Maillets cellar bar in the Latin Quarter of Paris and appeared frequently on French television.
        He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Nathalie.
        The singer's family said he would be buried in Memphis, his birthplace.
