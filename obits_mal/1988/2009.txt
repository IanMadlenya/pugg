        Mfanafuthi Makatini, a ranking member of the African National Congress and its former observer at the United Nations, died Saturday after a brief illness, the South African black nationalist organization announced.
        A spokesman, Tom Sebina, said Mr. Makatini was hospitalized in Lusaka, Zambia, where the group maintains its headquarters in exile, on Nov. 29. The nature of the illness was not disclosed.  [ Spokesmen for the group in New York said Mr. Makatini, who used the name Johnstone in dealings with Westerners, was 58 years old and died of complications from diabetes. ]  A former teacher, he went into exile after the Pretoria Government outlawed the A.N.C. in 1960. He was the congress's representative in Algeria until 1972, and 1978 became its observer at the United Nations, a post he held until five years ago, when he became director of international affairs.
