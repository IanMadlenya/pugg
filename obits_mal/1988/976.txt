        Stuyvesant Van Veen, a painter who created allegorical and other social realist-style murals in courthouses and other public buildings around the United States, died Saturday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Van Veen emerged on the art scene in 1929, at the age of 19, when he became the youngest contributor to an international exhibition of modern paintings at the Carnegie Institute, in Pittsburgh.
        A native of New York, Mr. Van Veen studied at several art schools, including the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League, where he worked with the muralist Thomas Hart Benton.
        Among Mr. Van Veen's best-known works is a series of seven murals in celebration of the Brooklyn Dodgers, a series that still exists in the lobbies of the Ebbets Field apartment complex in Brooklyn. He also painted works at the New York World's Fair in 1938, and at the Wright-Patterson air base in Fairborn, Ohio, in 1945.
        From 1949 to 1975, Mr. Van Veen also taught painting and drawing at City College of New York. In 1972, he was elected to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
        He is survived by his wife, Felicia, of Manhattan, and by a stepdaughter, Eloise Segal, of Manhattan.
