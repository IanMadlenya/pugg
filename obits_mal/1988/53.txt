        Michele Cantarella, a professor emeritus at Smith College and a leader of anti-Fascist Italian exiles during the rise of Mussolini, died of kidney failure Monday at Bay State Medical Center in Springfield, Mass. He was 88 years old and lived in Leeds, Mass.
        Mr. Cantarella, a native of Giarre, Italy, came to the United States in 1921 and after study at Boston University and Harvard University, he joined the Italian department at Smith College in 1929. He retired in 1964.
        At Smith, Mr. Cantarella and his wife, the former Helene Paquin, formed a center for political opposition to Italian Fascism, and translated the works of a wide range of anti-Fascist writers. In World War II, Mr. Cantarella took a leave from Smith to help with the production of Italian publications for the Government.
        He is survived by his wife; a son, Francesco Cantarella of Manhattan; a daughter, Nelda Ferace of Florence, Italy; a brother, Anthony Costa of Laconia, N.H.; a sister, Sarina Trifiro of Lexington, Mass., and four grandchildren.
