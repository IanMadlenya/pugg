        Serge Jaroff, founder of the Don Cossack Chorus, died Wednesday at the Paul Kimball Medical Center in Lakewood, N.J. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Jaroff was also the conductor and a composer for the group, which consisted of former officers of the Russian Imperial Army. They were discovered singing in Constantinople, where they had fled after the defeat of their army unit in the Crimea, and made their formal concert debut in Vienna in 1923.
        The men, dressed as Cossacks, sang a cappella in a repertory that consisted of Russian sacred and operatic music, army songs and folk songs. Cossack dancing was eventually added to their programs, which were immensely popular in American and international tours in the 1930's, 40's and 50's.
        Born in Makarev in Kostroma Province in Russia. Mr. Jaroff trained at the Moscow Synod School for Choral Singing. His last tour was in the 1977-78 season of the company, which is now known as the Don Cossack Chorus and Dancers of America.
        Mr. Jaroff is survived by his wife, Neonila, and his son, Alex, both of Lakewood. A memorial service is planned for 4 P.M. tomorrow at the Holy Virgin Protection Cathedral, 59 East Second Street.
