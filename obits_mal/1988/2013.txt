        In 1971 Mr. Maher, a native of New York City who never finished high school, founded the Delancey Street Foundation, a self-help organization in San Francisco for former drug addicts, alcoholics and criminal offenders. He was co-president of the organization from 1972 to 1984, when a conviction for drunken driving forced him to resign. The organization has helped thousands of people.
        He is survived by his mother, Marie Maher, of Manhattan; three brothers, William, of San Francisco, and Thomas and Patrick, of Manhattan; and a sister, Linda, also of Manhattan.
