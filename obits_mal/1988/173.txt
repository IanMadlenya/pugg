        Jose Zacarias Arza, former president of Paraguay's ruling Colorado Party, died Tuesday. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Zacarias spent more than 20 years in exile for his opposition to President Alfredo Stroessner. While in exile, he and other opposition leaders formed the Colorado Popular Movement, and he became its first president. He returned to Paraguay after Raul Alfonsin of neighboring Argentina was elected President in 1983.
        He served as Minister of Defense from 1949 to 1952 and as Ambassador to Spain.
