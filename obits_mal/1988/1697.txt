        The diplomat was born on Aug. 12, 1912, and entered the civil service in 1933. He was named Jamaica's representative to the United Nations in 1962, shortly after the island gained independence from Britain.
        He served at the United Nations until 1967, when he was appointed Ambassador to the United States. He remained in that post until 1972.
        Sir Egerton was a graduate of Oxford University. He is survived by his wife, Ivonne, a son and a daughter. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.
