        The Berlin, Md., Democrat was Maryland's youngest State's Attorney when he was elected at the age of 24 and its youngest State Senator when he was elected in 1938 at the age of 28. He served until 1951.
        Mr. Johnson represented Maryland's Eastern Shore in Congress from 1958 to 1962. He lost his seat in 1962 after his indictment on charges that he accepted money from members of Maryland's savings and loan industry to use his influence in Congress.
        In 1968 he was convicted of Federal charges of conspiracy and conflict of interest. He served three and a half months of a six-month sentence and paid a $5,000 fine.
