       Henry Armstrong, the only boxer ever to hold three world titles simultaneously, died of heart failure yesterday in Los Angeles after a lengthy series of illnesses. The former fighter, who for a few months in 1938 reigned as featherweight, lightweight and welterweight champion, was 75 years old.
        Henry Armstrong, the only boxer ever to hold three world titles simultaneously, died of heart failure yesterday in Los Angeles after a lengthy series of illnesses. The former fighter, who for a few months in 1938 reigned as featherweight, lightweight and welterweight champion, was 75 years old.
        Mr. Armstrong, a relentless puncher, was considered by many ring analysts to be, pound for pound, the greatest fighter in boxing history. He was among the first three men active in the ring after 1919 to be elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame, in 1954. The others were Jack Dempsey and Joe Louis.
        The fighter, whose real name was Henry Jackson, was born in Columbus, Miss., on Dec. 12, 1912, and grew up in St. Louis, where he shined shoes and worked as a railroad hand until his graduation from high school. He then rode freight trains to California, where he became a prizefighter and won 58 of 62 fights as an amateur.
        He began his professional career in 1931, fighting under the name Honey Mellody until 1935, mostly in California, Nevada and Mexico. Winning Streak of 46 Bouts
        Beginning in 1937, Mr. Armstrong won 46 consecutive bouts, including a string of 27 straight knockouts, and they carried him East to New York and to his three titles.
        On Oct. 29, 1937, he won the world featherweight (126-pound) crown by knocking out Pete Sarron in the sixth round. On May 31, 1938, he became the welterweight (147-pound) champion by winning a 15-round decision from Barney Ross at Long Island City. And on Aug. 17, 1938, a pared-down Armstrong picked up the lightweight (135-pound) championship with a 15-round decision over Lou Ambers before a crowd of 19,216 at Madison Square Garden.
        Mr. Armstrong's feat of holding three titles simultaneously can never be equaled. The holding of multiple boxing titles has been barred since the 1940's.
        Mr. Armstrong, who was 5 feet 5 1/2 inches tall, varied in fighting weight from 124 to 146 pounds.
        He relinquished his featherweight title three months after taking the lightweight crown. On Aug. 22, 1939, he lost his lightweight title to Ambers on a 15-round decision. After that, he campaigned almost exclusively as a welterweight, although he did challenge Ceferino Garcia for the world middleweight championship on March 1, 1940, in Los Angeles and lost in 10 rounds. Last Title Lost to Zivic
        Mr. Armstrong lost his final title on Oct. 4, 1940, when Fritzie Zivic beat him in 15 rounds to become the new welterweight champion. In a return bout at the Garden on Jan. 17, 1941, before 23,190 spectators, at that time the largest crowd in history for an indoor sports event, Zivic knocked out Armstrong in the 12th round.
        Mr. Armstrong fought for four more years, but never again for a championship. His final listings in ''The Ring Record Book'' show 152 victories in 181 bouts, with 100 knockouts and purses of more than $1 million.
        After retiring, Mr. Armstrong caroused for a few years until he was ordained as a Baptist minister in Los Angeles. He spent most of the rest of his life as an evangelist and as head of the Henry Armstrong Youth Foundation, which he founded in the 1950's to combat juvenile delinquency. In 1956, he published an autobiography, ''Gloves, Glory and God.''
        In recent years, Mr. Armstrong and his wife, Gussie, lived on a monthly $800 Social Security check, and he suffered from a string of maladies that included pneumonia, anemia, cataracts, malnutrition and dementia.
        He is survived by his wife, a daughter and one grandson.
        Correction:  October 26, 1988, Wednesday, Late City Final EditionNovember 5, 1988, Saturday, Late City Final Edition
        An obituary yesterday about Henry Armstrong, the only boxer to hold three world championships at the same time - the featherweight, lightweight and welterweight titles -gave an incorrect date for his death.
        It was Saturday, not Monday.
        An obituary of Henry Armstrong on Oct. 25 misstated the outcome of his world middleweight championship fight with Ceferino Garcia on March 1, 1940. It ended in a draw, and Garcia retained the title.
