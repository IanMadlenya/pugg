        Irving Mansfield, a producer, publicity agent and writer, died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        In the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Mansfield devoted his career to promoting the best-selling novels of his wife, Jacqueline Susann, who died in 1974.
        Her book ''Valley of the Dolls,'' which was published in March 1966, is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the novel with the highest sales: 28,712,000 copies worldwide through May 1, 1987.
        ''He pioneered in using the techniques of mass media to broaden the potential sales of a book,'' said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity at Bantam Books. ''He once said, 'You don't have to talk any louder to be on national television than to be on local television.' He made the art of book promotion respectable and glamorous.''

        Mr. Mansfield was born in Brooklyn and graduated from New York University. After working in public relations, he became a producer with CBS in 1946 and developed ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts,'' ''This Is Show Business'' and ''The Jane Froman Show,'' among other programs. He also produced movie versions of his wife's novels ''Valley of the Dolls,'' ''Once Is Not Enough'' and ''The Love Machine,'' as well as a 1981 television mini-series version of ''Valley of the Dolls.''
        In 1983, Mr. Mansfield was co-author with Jean Libman Block of ''Life With Jackie,'' a book about his 35 years of marriage to Ms. Susann.
        He is survived by his second wife, Beverly, whom he married in 1983, and by a son, Guy.
        A funeral service will be held Sunday at noon at the Riverside Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue and 76th Street.
