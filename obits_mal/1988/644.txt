        Valery A. Legasov, a physical chemist who headed the commission that investigated the Chernobyl nuclear power accident, died on Wednesday, Soviet media announced today. He was 51 years old.
        His death came a day after the second anniversary of the explosion and fire at the nuclear power station in the Soviet Ukraine. It was the world's worst nuclear power accident and at least 31 people were killed.
        Neither the official Tass press agency nor the evening television news broadcast Vremya, which also reported the death, gave a cause or place of death. It was not known if Mr. Legasov was exposed to dangerous levels of radiation while investigating the Chernobyl accident.
        The Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and other top Communist Party officials and scientists signed the obituary carried by Tass.
        Mr. Legasov's name was not mentioned in the dozens of Soviet media reports on Tuesday's anniversary of the accident. He did not appear Wednesday at a Moscow press conference in which senior Soviet nuclear power specialists discussed the present situation in the Chernobyl area.
        His foreign colleagues in nuclear power research had praised his openness in discussing the causes and effects of the Chernobyl accident, in contrast to the initial Soviet delay in releasing information about it.
        Mr. Legasov was first deputy director of the I. V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy and a member of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The official obituary praised his work in the use of nuclear reactors to generate electricity and also his work with inert gases.
