        Martin I. J. Griffin Jr., a historian and, for the last dozen years, dean of undergraduate studies at Yale University, died Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, at his campus residence in Saybrook College. He was 54 years old.
        Mr. Griffin started his administrative career in 1966 as acting dean of Saybrook, one of Yale's 12 residential undergraduate colleges.
        He also held the faculty position of lecturer in history, maintaining his interest in British history and the intellectual development of Europe. Among his colleagues, he was known for the elegance of his writing and his thorough knowledge of Yale and its mores, gleaned in 30 years as a student, a student adviser, a teacher and an administrator.
        Mr. Griffin was born in Philadelphia and graduated in 1955 from the University of Pennsylvania. He earned a master's degree at Yale, studied at the University of London as a Fulbright fellow and received his doctorate at Yale in 1963.
        He counseled Yale students from 1956 to 1958 and was appointed as an instructor in history in 1960, followed by stints as associate professor and director of undergraduate studies in history, a post he held from 1967 to 1972.
        A resident fellow of Saybrook since 1960, he became the college's dean in 1968, serving until 1971 when he joined the Dean's Office of Yale College as assistant dean as well as associate dean of undergraduate affairs.
        Mr. Griffin is survived by a sister, Barbara G. Farrell of Safety Harbor, Fla., and a cousin, William F. Meehan of Menlo Park, Calif.
        There will be a funeral service at 1:30 P.M. tomorrow at the St. Thomas More Chapel on Park Street in New Haven, with a memorial service to be scheduled later.
