        N. M. Bodecker, an illustrator and author of children's books, died of cancer of the colon Feb. 1 at his home in Hancock, N.H. He was 66 years old.
        For many years Mr. Bodecker's illustrations appeared in Harper's magazine, as well as The Saturday Evening Post, Esquire and Holiday.
        He also illustrated books for adults and children's books by other authors, but he was best known for the many children's books that he wrote and illustrated himself.  Awards for Poetry
        Among his honors were two Christopher Awards for poetry, in 1974 and 1976. Much of that poetry consisted of nonsense rhymes, which were reflected in several of his book titles, including, ''Let's Marry Said the Cherry'' and ''A Person From Britain Whose Head Was the Shape of a Mitten.''
        In his book ''Pigeon Cubes and Other Verse'' (1982), Mr. Bodecker - whom the reviewer described as ''by turns antic, meditative and satirical'' - set out the following ''Traffic Rule I'' for his youthful readers:  One traffic rule  we all obey:  the Mack truck has  the right of way.
        Some other books included ''It's Raining Said John Twaining,'' a collection of Danish nursery rhymes that Mr. Bodecker translated as well as illustrated, ''Hurry, Hurry Mary Dear,'' a collection of nonsense poems, and ''Quimble Wood,'' the last of which was illustrated by Branka Starr. Each of those books, and several others, was published by Atheneum/Margaret K. McElderry.
        Niels Mogens Bodecker was born and educated in Copenhagen. He emigrated to the United States after World War II and lived for 20 years in New York City and Westport, Conn., before moving to Hancock in 1972.
        He is survived by three sons, Alexander, of Portland, Ore., Torsten, of San Francisco, and Niels, of Hancock.
