        Stanton Hill Delaplane, an award-winning columnist for The San Francisco Chronicle who championed Irish coffee in the United States, died Monday of emphysema at his home in San Francisco. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Delaplane, who worked at The Chronicle for almost 53 years, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1942 for his articles about attempts by several counties in California and Oregon to secede and form a separate state. He also won National Headliner Club awards in 1946 for feature writing and in 1959 for travel writing.
        In 1952, on one of his frequent trips abroad, Mr. Delaplane sampled Irish coffee at Shannon Airport west of Dublin. On his return to San Francisco, he spent an evening at a bar concocting the proper proportions of Irish whisky, coffee, sugar and cream for the drink. Consumption of Irish whisky at the bar, the Buena Vista Cafe, went from 2 cases a year to about 1,000 cases, almost 10 percent of the United States' consumption at the time.
        Survivors include two daughters, Kris Conti, of Vacaville, Calif., and Andrea Delaplane, of San Rafael, Calif.; two sons, Thomas and John, of Tiburon, Calif., and a brother, Frank, of Reno.
