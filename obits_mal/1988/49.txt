        In 1918, then 20 years old, Mr. Todd shot down five German aircraft, which qualified him as an ace. Flying a Sopwith Camel biplane, he achieved his first aerial victory in the summer of 1918, downing a German Fokker triplane over France.
        After shooting down four more German fighters, Mr. Todd himself was shot down Aug. 26, 1918, in a battle between eight members of his squadron and 40 German Fokkers. One other Allied pilot survived the skirmish; 11 German planes were downed.
        Mr. Todd spent four months at the end of the war in a prisoner-of-war campHe returned to active duty for World War II and served in England as commander of a staging area for gliders and powered aircraft.
        In 1952, Mr. Todd moved to San Diego. He retired in 1965 as a lieutenant colonel. He received the Purple Heart six years ago, 64 years after he suffered his injuries.
