        Nigel Olney, Britain's longest surviving heart transplant patient, died today almost nine years after his surgery. He was 44 years old.
        Mr. Olney underwent a second heart transplant two weeks ago at Papworth Hospital near Cambridge and had been making a good recovery until his condition deteriorated Monday, the hospital said.
        Mr. Olney, divorced with two teen-age children, had worked as a fund-raiser for the hospital since his first operation in January 1980.
