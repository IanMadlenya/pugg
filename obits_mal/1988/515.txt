        Merrill K. Riddick, who campaigned for President three times as the candidate of the Puritan Ethic and Epic, Magnetohydrodynamics and Prohibition Party, died here Wednesday of cancer. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Riddick, who was from Dansville, N.Y., a village 40 miles south of Rochester, was a World War I aviator and 1920's barnstormer before moving to Montana to prospect for gold.
        He ran for President in 1976, 1980 and 1984, campaigning across the country on Greyhound buses. ''I live on the bus,'' he said in 1981. ''I can get the bus passes for less than $12 a day. It's cheaper than living in a hotel.''
        He was a graduate of the Army Air Service's first pilot class in San Diego in 1917 and flew reconnaissance missions over Europe in World War I. He became one of the nation's first airmail pilots and was an instructor at the nation's first private flight school with Eddie Rickenbacker, the most famous American fighter pilot of World War I. Mr. Riddick was an itinerant pilot who made a living giving air shows and selling rides before moving to Montana as a gold prospector.
        He began his political career with a run for the Montana Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1960. He finished sixth in a field of six. He tried again in 1968 with the same result. He switched parties to run for the Senate in 1972, finishing fourth among four Republicans.
        The party under which he ran for President was his creation. The Puritan Ethic and Epic in the title stood for moral values. Magnetohydrodynamics is a process for turning deriving electricity from coal. Prohibition was a personal belief.
