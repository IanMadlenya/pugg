        Walter (Babe) Pratt, one of hockey's first scoring defensemen and a member of the sport's Hall of Fame, died of a heart attack he suffered Friday night while attending a National Hockey League game. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Pratt was stricken at the Pacific Coliseum during the second period of the game between the Vancouver Canucks and the Calgary Flames. He was taken to Vancouver General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
        Mr. Pratt was the first employee of the Canucks when they entered the N.H.L. in 1970, working in public relations. He served the last several years as a goodwill ambassador, promoting the club at conventions, dinners and minor league hockey games throughout British Columbia. 12-Year N.H.L. Career Born Jan. 7, 1916, in Stoney Mountain, Manitoba, he began his N.H.L. career with the Rangers in 1935. He also played for the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins during a 12-year career. With the Leafs in the 1943-44 season, he won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player when he set a scoring record for defensemen with 57 points in 50 games. The record lasted 16 years.
        He was with the Rangers for seven seasons and was on the last Ranger team to win a Stanley Cup, in 1940. He scored the winning goal for the Maple Leafs in the seventh game of the 1945 Cup final against the Detroit Red Wings.
        After his playing career, Mr. Pratt entered the lumber business as a log buyer and inspector. He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; a son, Tracy, who played 10 seasons in the N.H.L.; a daughter, Wallis, and four grandchildren.
