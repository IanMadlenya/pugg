        Dr. Westgate enlarged the enrollment and the physical plant of St. Bernard's, a nondenominational school that now has 325 students in the first through the ninth grades. Pupils in his era included Benno C. Schmidt Jr., now the president of Yale University.
        Dr. Westgate was born in what is now Tanzania, the son of Anglican missionaries. He went to schools in Britain, Ireland and Canada and graduated from the University of Manitoba. He earned a Master of Arts degree in classics from Oxford's Balliol College and a doctorate in classics from Harvard University.
        He taught at Harvard, Radcliffe and two Massachusetts boarding schools, Phillips Academy at Andover and the Brooks School. He became headmaster of St. Bernard's in 1949.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sheila M. Dann; a son, Michael, of Boston; a daughter, Diana, of Arlington, Mass.; a sister, Dorothy Leach of Merrickville, Ontario, and two grandchildren.
