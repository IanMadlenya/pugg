        Harvey Kuenn, a former American League batting champion who managed the Milwaukee Brewers to their only pennant, died today at his home in Peoria, Ariz., the club announced. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Kuenn, the 1953 American League Rookie of the Year and the 1959 batting champion while playing for the Detroit Tigers, had been the Brewers' major league scouting consultant since being replaced as manager at the end of the 1983 season.
        The Peoria police said that Mr. Kuenn collapsed at his home, and that the cause of death was not immediately known.
        Mr. Kuenn suffered from a series of medical problems dating to the mid-1970's when he was the Brewers' batting instructor. He underwent open-heart surgery in 1976, and his right leg was amputated just below the knee in March 1980 after a blood clot had cut circulation.
        Mr. Kuenn returned to coaching only six months after the operation.
        He had a career batting average of .303 in 15 seasons with Detroit, Cleveland, San Francisco, the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia. He retired as a player in 1966.
        He won the Tigers' starting shortstop job after joining the team late in the 1952 season. In his first full season, 1953, he batted .308, setting a rookie record with 167 singles.
        Predominantly a singles hitter, he won the American League batting championship in 1959 with a .353 average for Detroit. He had only 87 career home runs among 2,092 hits.
        Mr. Kuenn became the Brewers' manager in June 1982. He took Milwaukee from a 23-24 start to the American League East Division title with a 95-67 record.
        The Brewers won the pennant after rallying from a 2-games-to-0 deficit to beat the California Angels in the American League title series. They lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.
        Mr. Kuenn's managerial philosophy was cited by many of his players for the team's turnaround. He encouraged players to relax and have fun while playing the game.
        Mr. Kuenn was dismissed as manager after the Brewers finished fifth in the American League East in 1983 with an 87-75 record.
        He is survived by his wife, Audrey, a son, Harvey Jr., and a daughter, Robin.
