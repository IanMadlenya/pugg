        The Rev. Silvester Mooney, who headed Douai Abbey in Britain for 40 years and was believed to be the world's oldest Roman Catholic monk, died Monday night, the abbey said today. He was 102 years old.
        Known as Grandfather Abbot, Father Mooney was a simple, taciturn man, said the Rev. Oliver Holt, a spokesman for the abbey. His 100th birthday brought special greetings from Pope John Paul II. Father Mooney marked the day by giving a 20-minute sermon without notes.
        Father Holt said records indicated Father Mooney probably was the world's oldest living Catholic monk and definitely the oldest Benedictine.
        Born in Liverpool on June 14, 1886, he was sent to the Douai Abbey in France at 11 to be educated. He was ordained in 1911, and returned to England with the 80-strong community, which established a new Douai Abbey 50 miles west of London. In 1929, Father Mooney was made its abbot. He retired in 1969.
