        George H. de Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, a founder of Vox Records and a fourth-generation descendant of the composer Felix Mendelssohn, died on Wednesday in Dusseldorf, West Germany. He was 75 years old and had cancer.
        Vox Records, established in 1945, offered the first complete long-playing recordings of Bach's St. Matthew Passion and Orff's ''Catulli Carmina,'' as well as multi-record cycles of music by Bach, Buxtehude, Vivaldi, Corelli and Tartini. Mr. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy also helped introduce to a wide audience such emerging or established artists as Alfred Brendel, Guiomar Novaes, Fritz Wunderlich, Gyorgy Sander, Otto Klemperer and Jascha Horenstein - all by way of the long-playing record.
        Mr. Brendel's first complete recording of the Beethoven piano sonatas was made for Vox and is still circulating. Indeed, much of Vox's later success was due to earlier recordings made at reasonable costs, then tenaciously kept in the catalogue and offered at bargain prices. In the 1960's, Mr. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy also developed the Turnabout and Candide labels, which operated to a great extent along the same lines. After selling Vox Productions to the Moss Music Group in 1980, he created two more labels: Pantheon and Price-Less.
        Mr. Mendelssohn-Bartholdy is survived by a sister, three daughters, a son and six grandchildren, all living in Europe.
