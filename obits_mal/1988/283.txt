        John Grist Brainerd, an electrical engineer who served as director of a project that built Eniac, one of the first electronic computers, died Monday at his home in Kennett Square, Pa. He was 83 years old.
        Eniac, an acronym for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, helped usher in the computer age in 1946.
        The machine, which filled a 30- by 50-foot room at the University of Pennsylvania, consisted of 30 tons of dials, wire and vacuum tubes. Although its computing power seemed unimaginable at the time, a dime-size chip of silicon can match Eniac's output today.
        ''We were working on something that was unlike anything else in existence and encountered problem after problem,'' Dr. Brainerd said in an interview in 1986. ''Then we saw the outline of how it might all fall together.''
        Dr. Brainerd's work on the pioneer computer was part of a long career at the University of Pennsylvania. He began teaching there in 1925 and went on to become director of the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carol Paxton.
