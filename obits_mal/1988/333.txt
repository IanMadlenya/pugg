        Rabbi Israel Raphael Margolies, who spoke out on a variety of social issues and was a longtime civil rights advocate, died of complications from hypoglycemia yesterday at his home in Teaneck, N.J. He was 72 years old.
        Rabbi Margolies grew up in the Williamsburg and Crown Heights sections of Brooklyn and graduated from the Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan, a seminary for the education of conservative and reform rabbis.
        He served at Temple Emanu-el in Engelwood, N.J., from 1937 until 1953 and at Beth Am The People's Temple in Manhattan, from 1953 to 1981.
        From his pulpit, Rabbi Margolies frequently called for equality for minority group members and for women. He was a supporter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and once marched alongside him in a civil rights parade in Englewood.
        Rabbi Margolies was often quoted for his opposition to the Vietnam War and for his belief in peaceful protest, and he was a founding member of the New Jersey chapter of SANE, a Washington-based organization that opposes nuclear weapons.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Rose; two sons, Allan, of Manhattan, and Irwin, of Hackensack, N.J.; a daughter, Sheera, of Austerlitz, N.Y.; and two brothers, Emanuel, of Westport, Conn., and Leon, of Beacon, N.Y.
        A memorial service will be held next Friday at 8 P.M. at Beth Am The People's Temple at Bennett Avenue and 189th Street in Manhattan.
