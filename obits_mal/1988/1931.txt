        John Duda, who helped his family build one of the nation's largest agricultural empires, died Saturday after a long illness. He was 84 years old.
        A. Duda & Sons began as a 10-acre farm near Oviedo in central Florida. Today the company operates from Florida to California and Australia and is diversified into vegetables, citrus, sugar cane, sod, foliage, cattle and real estate development.
        Mr. Duda, the son of Andrew Duda Sr., the family patriarch who emigrated from Czechoslovakia in 1912, was born in Velcice, Czechoslovakia, and joined the family business in 1926. He retired as corporate vice president in 1976 and served on the Duda board of directors until January of this year.
        The Duda family has not been without controversy. Environmentalists have said the Dudas polluted Lake Apopka by dumping millions of gallons of polluted water into the lake from their farming operations. The state is now working to clean up the lake and stop the discharge of water from farmland.
        John Duda's survivors include his wife, the former Julia Cicmanec; his brother Ferdinand; 5 children from his first wife, Katherine, who died in 1974; 19 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
