        Joseph Clark, an American Communist who resigned as foreign editor of The Daily Worker after crimes by Stalin were disclosed in 1956, died Tuesday after suffering a heart attack at his country house in South Egremont, Mass. He was 75 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Clark announced in 1957 that he was quitting the Communist Party, as well as his post at the paper. In a statement in The Daily Worker, Mr. Clark said all hope of reforming the American party had been lost.
        The editor of the paper in New York, John Gates, attacked Mr. Clark's ''undifferentiated criticism of the Soviet leadership.''
        Mr. Clark was on the staff of the American Cancer Society in the 60's and 70's and was on the editorial board of Dissent magazine.
        He was the father of Judith A. Clark, a former member of the radical Weather Underground group. In 1983, she was sentenced to three consecutive prison terms of 25 years to life for her role in the 1981 Brink's armored-car robbery and shootout in Rockland County, N.Y., in which a guard and two police officers were killed. Mr. Clark was born in Brooklyn.  Also surviving are his wife, the former Ruth Fine; a son, Andrew, of Portland, Ore., and three grandchildren.

        The headline yesterday on an obituary of Joseph Clark described his position incorrectly. Mr. Clark was a former editor of The Daily Worker, the Communist Party newspaper in the United States. He resigned from that post, and from the party, in 1957 after Nikita S. Khrushchev denounced Stalin. He later worked for the American Cancer Society and for Dissent magazine.
