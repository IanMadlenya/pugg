He began his career as a lecturer in the philosophy department in 1920 and became a full professor in 1948. He was chairman of the philosophy department from 1953 to 1960. From 1969 to 1976 he headed the university seminars, an organization that includes nearly 80 scholars and authorities from many fields.
        A widower, he is survived by two daughters, Barbara Rosenkrantz of Cambridge, Mass., and Alice Brandfonbrener of Winnetka, Ill.; a son, Carl of Cincinnati; 19 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
