        The son of a Baptist minister, Mr. Jordan opened his first mission in 1949 on Skid Row. The Fred Jordan Mission, also called the Soul Clinic Mission, now feeds about 1,000 people every day and caters to 6,000 on holidays.
        Mr. Jordan also broadcast ''Church in the Home'' beginning in 1951. The television program is still seen nationally.
