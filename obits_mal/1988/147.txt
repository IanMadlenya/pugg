        After more than two decades in a variety of diplomatic posts, and service in army intelligence during World War II,, he was appointed British delegate to the community in 1963 when Britain was trying to persuade Charles de Gaulle to lift his veto on Britain's joining. He served in Brussels, where the community has its headquarters, until 1965, and again from 1969 through the negotiations that led to British membership in 1973.
