        John Groth, an artist who illustrated many books and was best known for his depictions of combat, died Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        A man of gentle manner who prodded his students to carry sketchbooks and to construct pictures that had something to say, Mr. Groth had taught a weekly night class at the Art Students League since 1942.
        Throughout his life he was both fascinated and repelled by war. He went to Europe during World War II as a correspondent and artist for The Chicago Sun. His first story was the liberation of Paris, in which he got a scoop by riding in the first jeep to enter the city.
        Mr. Groth covered five other wars, including Vietnam. He considered his best work to be his illustration of a Heritage Press edition of ''All Quiet on the Western Front.''
        His work is in collections around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago.
        Mr. Groth is survived by a daughter, Tamara Collins of Mill Valley, Calif., and a sister, Dorothy Lores of Tucson, Ariz.
