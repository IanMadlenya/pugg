        Max H. Seigel, a radio news editor and newspaper reporter for nearly half a century, died of lung cancer yesterday at University Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Seigel spent most of his writing career with The New York Times. From 1942 through 1971, he prepared material for hourly newscasts on WQXR, the radio station of The Times. From 1972 until his retirement seven years later, he covered local courts and City Hall as a reporter.
        For many years, Mr. Seigel had a second career in the antiques trade. With his wife, the former Sylvia Suchow, he operated Covered Bridge Antiques, which imported European antiques for sale at shows in metropolitan New York.
        Mr. Seigel was born in Brooklyn and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at City College. Trained as a teacher of French, he chose a journalism career instead, although he later taught English and journalism at the City University's Baruch College. Before he joined The Times, he was on the staff of The Port Chester (N.Y.) Item and The Bayonne (N.J.) Times.
        In 1983 and 1984 he was president of the Society of the Silurians, an organization of veteran journalists in the New York area.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Kalman, of Brooklyn.
        A funeral service will be held at noon today at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avenue at 91st Street.
