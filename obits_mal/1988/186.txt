        Raimondo Manzini, editor of the Vatican daily L'Osservatore Romano for 18 years and a former member of parliament, died Thursday. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Manzini, a friend of Pope John XXIII, took over as editor of the Vatican newspaper in 1960 after working as editor of the Italian Roman Catholic daily L'Avvenire d'Italia and serving three terms as a member of the Chamber of Deputies.
        He changed the appearance of L'Osservatore, devoting more space to photographs and cultural news, before retiring in 1978.
