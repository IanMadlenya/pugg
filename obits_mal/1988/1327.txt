        William G. Helis Jr., a Louisiana oil producer and sportsman, died at Ochsner Foundation Hospital here Saturday after a long illness. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Helis was the managing partner of the oil properties of his father, William G. Helis, an independent producer who died in 1950. In 1956, as chairman of the Louisiana Mineral Board, Mr. Helis signed an agreement with the Federal Government permitting the resumption of oil and nautral gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after a boundary dispute halted production.
        The younger Mr. Helis, whose father emigrated to the United States from Greece, maintained close ties to Greece throughout his life. He served as honorary consul here for the Royal Consulate of Greece from 1950 to 1968, and represented President Johnson at the marriage in Athens of King Constantine to Princess Ann-Marie of Denmark in 1964.
        Among his civic and philanthropic activities were the Dmitri Mitropoulos Awards for young pianists, which Mr. Helis founded. He helped send dozens of award winners through college and music schools.
        Mr. Helis was once one of the nation's leading breeders of thoroughbred horses, and owned colts that won numerous races at East Coast tracks in the 1950's.
        He is survived by his wife, Bettie; two daughters, Cassandra Conrad of Los Angeles and Vanessa Helis of New Orleans, three sisters and two stepdaughters.
