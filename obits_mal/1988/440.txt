        E. S. (Gandy) Gandrud, inventor of a land-measuring wheel that provided the accuracy needed to carry out New Deal farm programs, died Friday at the age of 85.
        Mr. Gandrud, who held about 80 patents, was working as a county agricultural agent when he invented the Gandy wheel. It replaced earlier jerry-built devices and was used to measure acreage removed from production by farmers in return for subsidies during the Depression.
