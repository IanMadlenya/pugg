        Bradley Cunningham, the owner of Bradley's jazz club in Manhattan, died yesterday of lung cancer at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Cunningham opened Bradley's in 1969, after working for clubs in Laguna Beach, Calif., and New York City. The intimate, low-key club and restaurant on University Place near 11th Street in Greenwich Village featured jazz piano-and-bass duos seven nights a week and was popular among musicians. Bradley's, whose piano was donated by the jazz saxophonist Paul Desmond, is considered one of New York's leading venues for jazz pianists.
        Mr. Cunningham, a pianist, was known for his musical knowledge and respect for musicians. He was friendly with many well-known New York jazz pianists, such as Tommy Flanagan, Hank Jones, Joanne Brackeen and Kenny Barron, who frequently performed at Bradley's, and often visited after finishing their sets at other clubs. Recently, the wood-paneled club began to feature drummers and saxophonists, like George Coleman. The late jazz musicians Al Cohn, Teddy Wilson and Zoot Sims also frequented the club.
        Mr. Cunningham is survived by his wife, Wendy, and his son, Jed, both of Manhattan.
