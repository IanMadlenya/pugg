        Burton Wallace Marsh, the first full-time city traffic engineer in the United States, died of cardiac arrest as the result of pneumonia Thursday at the Bethesda Retirement and Nursing Center in Maryland. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Marsh became the first full-time urban traffic engineer in 1924 in Pittsburgh. Six years later he took the same post in Philadelphia, where he remained until 1933. He had lived in Washington for 50 years.
        Until 1965, he was the director of traffic engineering and safety of the American Automobile Association. He retired in 1970 as executive director of the Institute of Traffic Engineers.
        Mr. Marsh brought felicitous phrasing and humor to his vocation. He once remarked that the best way for a prospective bride to measure her future husband's character was to ride with him through a traffic jam.
        On another occasion, he said that New York City's jaywalkers played ''hopscotch with death every day, but an amazing number win because they have developed the protective traits of cats and squirrels.''
        And in 1950 he warned that the drunken driver was becoming ''death's chief handyman'' in this country.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Alan of Washington; two daughters, Jean Adams of Arlington, Va., and Betsy McCartor of Portland, Ore., and seven grandchildren.
