        Sultan Dorodjatun Hamengku Buwono IX, who held several high Government posts in Indonesia, including the vice presidency, after independence from the Netherlands after World War II, died at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington on Sunday. He was 78 years old and lived in Jogjakarta, Indonesia.
        The Sultan frequently traveled to the United States for medical treatment. A spokesman for the Indonesian Embassy said last night that the exact cause of death was not yet known.
        Sultan Hamengku Buwono, who was Vice President from 1973 to 1978, had held Cabinet-level and other positions, including Minister of State from 1946 to 1949, Defense Minister in 1949 and 1953, and Deputy Prime Minister in 1950 and 1951.
        Before and after his term as Vice President, he was chairman of the Indonesian Tourist Council and served terms as head of the country's Olympic committee and as chairman of the Asian Games Federation.
        Born in Jogjakarta in central Java, he studied at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands before returning home to succeed his father in 1940 as the ninth Sultan of Jogjakarta.
        In the revolution against the Dutch that began in 1945, he was a republican leader; for a time during the war Jogjakarta was the Indonesian capital. When the Dutch occupied central Java, he refused to cooperate and confined himself to his palace, where he directed fighting units throughout the country.
        Sultan Hamengku Buwono is survived by his wife, Norma, who accompanied him to Washington, and by several children and grandchildren from a former marriage.
