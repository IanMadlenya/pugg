        Michael Fessier, a movie and television scriptwriter as well as an author of short stories, died Tuesday. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Fessier, editor of the San Rafael (Calif.) Independent Journal in the early 1930's, wrote the scripts for such movies as ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' ''It All Came True,'' ''Wings Over the Navy'' and ''Angels Wash Their Faces.'' For many scripts he was part of a team with Ernie Pagano.
        Mr. Fessier also wrote for ''Bonanza,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' and ''The Thin Man'' on television.
        He wrote short stories for Story and Esquire magazines, and his story, ''That's What Happened to Me,'' has been published in 70 anthologies.
        In 1935 Mr. Fessier wrote a humorous novel, ''Fully Dressed and in His Right Mind.'' In 1948 he wrote the novel ''Clovis,'' about a ''highly educated, highly opinionated'' parrot.
        He retired as a screenwriter 15 years ago.
