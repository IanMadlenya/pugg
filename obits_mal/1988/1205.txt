        Charles W. Lubin, founder of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, died Friday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, apparently after suffering a heart attack while driving. He was 84 years old.  A Chicago native, Mr. Lubin was apprenticed to a baker at the age of 14 in Decatur, Ill. In 1949, he named his first special cheesecake for his 8-year-old daughter, Sara Lee. He created the rich dessert in one of three small Chicago bakeries he had bought with his brother-in-law for $1,500 in 1935.
        The cheesecakes he made famous cost nearly twice as much as others on the market, but he defended their price, saying: ''Our goal was to make a product so delicious you couldn't resist it. There is no substitute for plenty of butter, eggs and milk in the recipe.''
        The cakes proved popular, and within seven years Mr. Lubin's company had grown into a coast-to-coast operation with annual sales of about $20 million.
        His pioneering work in freezing baked goods helped spur the growth. He invented the process by which the cakes were baked, frozen, shipped and sold in the same light aluminum baking pan.
        In 1956, Mr. Lubin sold the Kitchens of Sara Lee to Consolidated Foods Inc., now called the Sara Lee Corporation, for $2.8 million, and stayed on as president. He left the company in 1964.
        Sara Lee, now headquartered in suburban Deerfield, had sales of more than $9.1 billion last year.
        Mr. Lubin is survived by his wife, Tillie; his daughter, Sara Lee Schupf; four grandchildren, and a sister.
