        Mr. Salomon and his father, both of whom were insurance executives, paid $2 million to establish the N.H.L. expansion franchise in 1967. The team advanced to the Stanley Cup finals three times in its early years, in 1968, 1969 and 1970. The Salomons sold the Blues in 1977. Mr. Salomon is survived by his mother, Jean; a daughter, Patty, and two sons, Sidney IV and Tim.
