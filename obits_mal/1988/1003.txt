        James W. Moore, who in the 1960's pioneered the College Work-Study and Guaranteed Student Loan programs at the United States Department of Education, died of lung cancer Sunday at his home in Lake Oswego, Ore. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Moore retired in 1984 after 24 years with the department and its predecessor, the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. He had been director of student financial aid from 1981 to 1984 and acting deputy assistant secretary of the department from 1982 to 1984.
        From the time he retired until he became ill, he served on the board of the Wilfred American Educational Corporation in New York City.
        He was responsible for formulating the College Work-Study Program in the early 1960's, and later pioneered the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, the largest Federal student aid program still in operation today.
        Mr. Moore received a bachelor's degree from Oberlin (Ohio) College in 1947 and a master's in political science from Columbia University in 1948.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; their children, Polly, Richard, Elizabeth and Margaret, and three children from Mrs. Moore's previous marriage: Douglas Hunt, Scott Hunt and Jeffrey Hunt.
