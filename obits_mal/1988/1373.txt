        Michael Krasnopolsky, a double bass virtuoso who studied with Alexander Glazunov and played in the NBC Symphony under Arturo Toscanini, died in Seattle last Monday. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Krasnopolsky came to the United States from the Soviet Union in 1924 and lived in New York City most of his life. He had been a professor at the Leningrad Conservatory, an appointment he won when he was 24. During his early years in this country, Mr. Krasnopolsky taught at the University of Chicago and played for the Chicago Symphony under Frederick Stock. He came to New York in 1939 and played for the NBC Symphony until it disbanded in 1954. Mr. Krasnopolsky was largely responsible for the formation of the Symphony of the Air, assembled from the remnants of Toscanini's famous group. The Symphony of the Air survived until 1963, when Mr. Krasnopolsky began freelance performing.
        He is survived by his wife, Fara, and two children; Mara Krasnopolsky of Seattle, and Yuri Krasnapolsky of New York City.
