        Lawrence Adler, an East European refugee who rose from office cleaner to become one of Australia's richest men, died on Tuesday. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Adler left a fortune estimated by Business Review Weekly at $323 million.
        Laslo Adler arrived in Australia penniless in 1949 as a stateless person from Hungary. His father, a Jewish businessman, died in a concentration camp during World War II.
        After changing his name to Lawrence James Adler, he worked as an office cleaner, gas station attendant, taxi driver and used car salesman before founding Fire and All Risks Insurance in 1960 with $47,600 in capital.
        The fledgling company blossomed into a multi-million dollar corporation, FAI Insurance Ltd. An 'Original' Business
        ''I certainly had no intention of going into the insurance business when I left Hungary, but as I grew older I realized that it was one of the few original and truly international businesses still going,'' he told reporters in the 1960's.
        He used FAI as a vehicle to build substantial stakes in various United States and British companies.
        A shrewd investor, Mr. Adler started aggressive buying of takeover targets in the early 1980's.
        His death stunned the stock market, and FAI shares fell 46 cents to a low of $2.20 before recovering to $2.30.
        They were trading at $2.90 before Mr. Adler was hospitalized after a heart attack 10 days ago. Mr. Adler suffered from diabetes and had a heart attack 10 years ago.
        Mr. Adler kept a tight hold on his insurance business, which is expected to be taken over by his 28-year-old son, Rodney, now the investment manager of the company. The Adler family controls 50.6 percent of FAI.
        Mr. Adler is also survived by his wife, Ethel, and two daughters, Kathy and Roxanne.
