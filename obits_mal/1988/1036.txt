        Norman S. Ostrow, a defense lawyer specializing in white-collar criminal cases, died Saturday of complications following heart surgery at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 52 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Among Mr. Ostrow's clients was the New York City Comptroller, Harrison J. Goldin, who was cleared earlier this year of allegations of improper financial ties to Ivan F. Boesky, the convicted Wall Street financier. In a prominent case some years ago, Mr. Ostrow represented Eliot S. Weisman, the president of the Westchester Premier Theater, which was reportedly controlled by organized crime. More recently he represented principals of the Beverly Hills, Calif., office of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the securities firm, in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
        Mr. Ostrow was a founder of the New York Council of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a member of the White Collar Criminal Defense Committee of the American Bar Association and a director of the Federal Bar Council.
        A native of Brooklyn, he was a graduate of Adelphi University and New York University Law School. He served as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan and was a partner in the law firm of Rogers & Wells before founding Grand & Ostrow with Paul Grand.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan; two sons, Michael, of London, and Eric, of Manhattan; his parents, Charles and Lillian of Delray Beach, Fla., and two brothers, Robert, of San Francisco, and David, of Merrick, L.I.
