        Stephen J. Jarema, a lawyer and former New York State Assemblyman who was active in the Ukrainian-American community, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Jarema was elected to the Assembly from the former Eighth District on Manhattan's lower east side -now the 61st District - in 1936 and served until 1944.
        In 1942, he sponsored legislation that enabled the demolition of the remaining sections of the Second Avenue elevated tracks in Manhattan between 60th Street and Chatham Square. A large amount of the scrap steel was used to build battleships in World War II.
        He served as minority counsel to the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee from 1945 to 1975. He served from 1966 to 1972 as Democratic district leader for the 61st District.
        On Sept. 28, 1980, Pope John Paul II conferred upon Mr. Jarema the pontifical honor of Knight of St. Gregory the Great, the highest honor the Roman Catholic Church has to offer a lay person.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Olga Bugera; two sons, Stephen Jr. of Newfield, N.J., and William of Queens; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
