        Mr. Ellis, a native of Brooklyn, was a member of the staff of Judge Samuel Seabury during three investigations of the city government, including the one that led to Mayor Walker's resignation because of allegations of corruption. In the 1940's, he was retained by the city's Corporation Counsel to help Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia negotiate the purchase of the subway systems of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Company.
        In 1948, Mr. Ellis became vice president, controller and treasurer of Third Avenue Transit, then the largest privately owned surface transportation system in the country, which operated in New York City and Westchester County.
        His wife, the former Haysel Ralli, died in 1978. There are no immediate survivors.
