        David L. Dodd, who taught finance at Columbia University for four decades and who was the co-author of ''Security Analysis,'' a standard work in the investment field, died of respiratory failure Sunday at Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was 93 years old and had homes in Falmouth Foreside and Chebeague Island, Me.
        Dr. Dodd, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, received his master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1922 and rose to full professorship in 1947. He served as associate dean of the Graduate School of Business from 1948 to 1952, and he retired in 1961.
        ''Security Analysis,'' published by McGraw-Hill, was written with Benjamin Graham in the early 1930's when the authors taught at the business school. It was intended as a common-sense guide for investors but turned out to be a thick textbook that went through five editions and sold more than 250,000 copies.
        Dr. Dodd was a native of Berkeley County, W. Va. He served in the United States Navy in World War I, rising from boatswain to lieutenant (j.g.).
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Lillian Lane; a daughter, Barbara Anderson of Fresno, Calif., from his first marriage to Elise Firor, who died in 1981, and two grandchildren.
