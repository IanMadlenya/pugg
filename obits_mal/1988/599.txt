        Before joining Goodyear in 1929, Mr. Holt, a college basketball star, played two seasons with the Cook Painters, the national A.A.U. basketball champions of that era.
        As a youngster in Oklahoma City, he had been, at 12, the youngest Eagle Scout in the United States.
        At Goodyear he worked his way gradually up the ranks through a series of sales and management jobs, and was named president in 1964. During his tenure, the company enjoyed a period of record profits. He retired in 1972.
        Mr. Holt had a lifelong interest in sports. He won an underwater swimming championship at a local Y.M.C.A. when he was 10.
        He attended the University of Oklahama on a basketball scholarship. As a 6-foot 7-inch senior, he led the Sooners to an undefeated season in 1928 and was named outstanding player of the year in college basketball.
        Mr. Holt is survived by three daughters, Hanna Vesiger, of Howell, N.J.; Victoria Jaycox of Washington, and Judith Folger, of London.
