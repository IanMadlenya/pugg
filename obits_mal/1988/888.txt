        Arthur Selwyn Miller, a retired law teacher and an authority on constitutional law, died of a brain tumor Friday at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Miller was professor of constitutional law at the National Law Center of the George Washington University Law School in Washington from 1961 until 1978. He often testified at Congressional hearings and was a consultant to a succession of Congressional and Presidential committees.
        One of Professor Miller's consulting roles was for Senator Sam Ervin Jr., the North Carolina Democrat who was chairman of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Presidential Campaign Practices, which looked into the Watergate affair and other elements of the 1972 Presidential election.
        He was born in Oregon and received law degrees from Stanford and Yale universities. Professor Miller was the author, co-author or editor of more than a dozen books and scores of articles in periodicals of jurisprudence.
        He briefly taught at George Washington before he joined the faculty of Emory University in Atlanta in 1953. He remained at Emory until his return to Washington in 1961.
        Professor Miller moved from Washington to Key West in 1978.
        His wife, Dagmar, said a book he wrote with Jeffrey Bowman is scheduled for publication later this year. Its subject is Willie Francis, a 17-year-old convict who survived a malfunction of the electric chair in Louisiana in 1946 and was executed the next year after the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4 to allow it.
        Besides his wife, Professor Miller is survived by three brothers, Harold, Lloyd and Wayne Miller, all of California.
