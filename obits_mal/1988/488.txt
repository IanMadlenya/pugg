        Arthur N. Seiff, a trial lawyer, died of heart failure Saturday at his home in Manhattan while he was working on legal papers. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Seiff argued and won a First Amendment case before the United States Supreme Court in the late 1940's in which a New York law banning publications devoted to ''bloodshed, lust or crime'' was ruled unconstitutional. He successfully defended a book dealer who was fined $100 for offering for sale a magazine, called Headquarters Detective: True Cases From the Police Blotter, that contained what were described as ''lurid photographs'' and included such articles as ''Bargains in Bodies'' and ''Girl Slave to a Love Cult.''
        Mr. Seiff was born in Manhattan. A graduate of Morris High School in the Bronx, he studied law at New York University at night to gain admission to the bar. As chairman of the committee on medical jurisprudence of the City Bat Association of of New York in the 1950's, he was active in dealing with the problems of narcotics and alcoholism.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Louise Winter; a son, Eric, former chairman of the New York State Investigation Commission; a daughter, Inky Weiss of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Carole Hoffman of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
