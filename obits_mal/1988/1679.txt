        He directed the school's mid-career development program, which brought 500 senior officials from Federal, state and local governments to Syracuse to study public administration.
        Dr. Iversen, who retired last year after 24 years at the school, is survived by his wife, the former Mary Drake; two sons, Fritz, of Palmer, Alaska, and Nicholas, of Manhattan; a sister, Phyllis Ecklund of Minneapolis, and two grandchildren.
