        Dr. John D. Lewis, a professor of government at Oberlin College for 37 years, died of cardiac arrest Saturday at a nursing home in Oberlin, Ohio. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Lewis, chairman of the government department 19 years, was a teacher and mentor to many political scientists. He wrote three books and many articles, and was regarded as an authority on liberal democratic theory.
        His book ''Against the Tyrant: The Tradition and Theory of Tyrranicide,'' written in 1957 with Prof. Oscar Jaszi, also of Oberlin, is widely used by researchers in political theory.
        Born in Paterson, N.J., Dr. Lewis was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Oberlin and received master's and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Wisconsin, where he taught from 1931 to 1935, before joining the Oberlin faculty.
        After his retirement from Oberlin in 1972, he taught at Case Western Reserve and Pennsylvania State Universities and Colorado College.
        His first wife, the former Ewart Kellogg Lewis, died in 1968. Surviving are his second wife, the former Mary Jane Crow; two sons, David, of Princeton, N.J., and Donald, of Austin, Tex.; a daughter, Ellen, of Denver; a brother, Lew, of High Point, N.C., and four grandchildren.
