        Lothar Wolff, a film producer, died of prostate cancer Sunday at Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne, N.Y. He was 79 years old and lived in New York City and Sharon, Conn.
        Mr. Wolff produced feature-length theatrical films and science documentaries. He made films with groups that included National Geographic, Lutheran Film Associates, Time-Life Films and Louis de Rochemont Associates.
        He was born in Germany, and began his career as a press agent for the films of G. W. Pabst and Louise Brooks. He left Germany after Hitler came to power, worked in Copenhagen and Paris and came to the United States in 1936, where he became chief film editor of the documentary series ''The March of Time.''
        He made 50 films on postwar Europe, as organizer and chief of the Motion Picture Section of the Marshall Plan Information Office. He later went to Indonesia for two years for the Agency for International Development, assisting the new nation in developing its film industry. Films on which he was producer or associate producer include ''The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,'' ''Lost Boundaries,'' ''Windjammer,'' ''Walk East on Beacon,'' ''Man on a String,'' ''Martin Luther'' and ''The Joy of Bach.''
        His 1961 film ''Question 7,'' directed by Stuart Rosenberg, which dealt with an East German youth torn between his religion and his desire for education in a Communist satellite country, was named best film of the year by the National Board of Review.
        He is survived by his wife, Vee.
