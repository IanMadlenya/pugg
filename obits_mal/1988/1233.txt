        Mr. Paige, who established his own laboratory and was commissioned by manufacturers to invent needed products, developed an instructional sighting device used by the military services in World War II.
        He studied at local music and art schools and, in the early days of radio composed theme songs and singing commercials. In the 1930's he began inventing such things as folding boxes, corrugated display stands and carriers for food containers.
        In 1975 he was named to the Packaging Hall of Fame.
        Among Mr. Paige's books were ''The Complete Guide to Making Money With Your Ideas and Inventions'' and ''The Science of Creating Ideas for Industry.''
        Mr. Paige is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Kitz, and a sister, Ethel Banov of Manhattan.
