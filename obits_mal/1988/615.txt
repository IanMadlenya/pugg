        Adolphe Alfred Rempp, creator of Adolph's Meat Tenderizer and owner of several California restaurants, died Tuesday at his home here. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Rempp was born in San Francisco, where he started his restaurant career as a chef at the age of 22.
        Finding conventional liquid meat tenderizers too difficult to handle, he developed a powdered tenderizer in 1935. He then marketed his Adolph's Meat Tenderizer nationwide and earned millions of dollars. Mr. Rempp also owned restaurants in the Los Angeles area and in San Francisco.
        Survivors include his wife, Leah; three sons; two daughters; two stepdaughters; a stepson and seven grandchildren.
