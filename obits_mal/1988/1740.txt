        Qian Changzhao, a former official in the Nationalist Government and a ranking member of the mainland version of the Nationalist Party, died Friday, the official New China News Agency said. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Qian was deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, one of eight small non-Communist parties that the ruling Communist Party allowed to exist.
        Before 1949, Mr. Qian served as secretary of Chiang Kai-shek's Foreign Ministry, Executive Deputy Minister of Education and director of the National Resources Commission.
        He stayed in China after the Nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 and in 1954 was elected as deputy from Shandong Province to the National People's Congress, China's nominal parliament.
