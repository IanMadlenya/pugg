        Hans Brenaa, a former member of the Royal Danish Ballet and an internationally known specialist on August Bournonville, died of cancer of the liver and spine on April 14 in Bispebjerg Hospital in Copenhagen. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Brenaa was best known for his stagings of works by Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer whose ballets gave the Royal Danish Ballet its distinctive style and character. Mr. Brenaa's re-creations of the ballets were performed by the Danish company and by troupes in the United States, Australia and throughout Europe and were noted for their spirit, attention to detail and correctness. Among Mr. Brenaa's stagings in the United States were Flemming Flindt's ''Lesson'' for the Joffrey Ballet and ''Coppelia,'' in a production based on choreography by Hans Beck and last re-created in 1986, for the Boston Ballet.
        Born in Copenhagen, Mr. Brenaa trained at the school of the Royal Danish Ballet and graduated into the company in 1928, becoming a soloist in 1943. He retired as a dancer in 1955 but continued to teach classes in the Bournonville technique and served as a ballet master. When he died, Mr. Brenaa was a guest producer of a revival of Bournonville's ''Kermesse in Bruges'' for the Danish company.
        He is survived by a son, Jens, of Copenhagen.
