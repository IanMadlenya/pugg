        Dr. Siegal, who graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1932, was an internationally known allergist. He won recognition in 1945 for his pioneering work on Familial Mediterranean Fever, a hereditary disorder that afflicts Sephardic Jews, Turks, Armenians and other Mediterranean people, and for describing penicillin anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction to the drug.
        He is survived by his wife, Adele; a son, Frederick, of Kings Point, L.I.; a daughter, Marian S. Krauskopf, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren. His first marriage, to Vivian Weiner, the mother of his children, ended in divorce.
