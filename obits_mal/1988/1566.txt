        Mr. Moore-Betty was in the vanguard of cooks who taught students how to produce French-inspired meals. Like his friend, James Beard, Mr. Moore-Betty accepted students at his townhouse, in Manhattan, and schooled them in much more than making a meal. His lessons were models of the art of hospitality, and he created menus and set tables with flair and finesse.
        Many people who knew Mr. Moore-Betty believed him to be English, but he was born in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Before World War II, he farmed in Rhodesia and the Sudan. He served in the British Royal Army.
        After the war, he lived in London, where he developed an interest in food. He came to Manhattan in 1962. Began Cooking for Children His first cooking classes were for children. But their mothers were quickly charmed by his English manners and style, and he taught and advised many prominent hostesses. He served as food consultant to several corporations, including Mobil and American Express.
        In the food world, which can be petty, he was highly regarded as a gentleman and an excellent cook. ''He taught very simple, basic good food,'' said Barbara Kafka, the author of ''Microwave Gourmet'' and a food consultant.
        Other chefs loved going to parties at Mr. Moore-Betty's home, where he grew herbs on the roof and flowers in an all-white garden. ''His holidays were wonderful,'' recalled Felipe Rojas-Lombardi, the chef at The Ballroom.
        He is survived by his sister, Angel of Northern Ireland.
