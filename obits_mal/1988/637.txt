        Lord Brockway, a veteran socialist, pacifist, political writer and prison inmate who campaigned for Indian independence and championed African nationalism, died Thursday, his family reported. He was 99 years old.
        Lord Brockway died at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire, outside London, family members said. He had been in the hospital since April 19. The family gave no cause of death. Paying tribute to him, Neil Kinnock, the leader of the Labor Party, said, ''Throughout the whole of this century, in Britain and in so many other countries, he was an inspiration to all who love liberty and work for socialism.''
        Archibald Fenner Brockway was born in Calcutta and educated at the School for the Sons of Missionaries. He was elected to the House of Commons as a Labor Party legislator in 1929.
        Throughout his Commons career he campaigned for the abolition of the House of Lords, on the grounds that it is a bastion of privilege. But in 1964 he accepted a life peerage from Queen Elizabeth II, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. He said at the time that he accepted the peerage reluctantly, but he attended debates in Lords regularly.
        Lord Brockway served five prison terms. Two terms, one at hard labor, resulted from his militant pacifism during World War I. The others stemmed from demonstrations against the hydrogen bomb and capitalism and in favor of African nationalism.
        Calling himself a humanist but not an atheist, he once said: ''I don't know if there is a God or an after life and I don't particularly worry about it. But if there is, the best way to prepare is to work for justice here now.''
        Lord Brockway is survived by his wife, Edith King, a son and four daughters.
