        Dr. Bennett Gemson, a pediatrician who wrote and recorded songs intended to ease childrens' fears, died of a brain tumor yesterday at North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, L.I. He was 67 years old and lived in New Hyde Park, L.I.
        Dr. Gemson, who specialized in adolescent medicine, was a founder of North Shore University Hospital and had been an associate attending pediatrician on the staff since 1953. He also became known in recent years as ''the song doctor.''
        He was an accomplished pianist. His record album, ''My Doctor, My Friend,'' with words and music he wrote himself, was released in October 1984 and featured such titles as ''You're Going to the Hospital,'' ''Earache,'' ''Take Your Medicine When You're Sick'' and ''I've Got the Flu.''
        ''Children are very difficult to examine,'' Dr. Gemson said, speaking of his songs in a 1985 interview. ''If we can get them to relax, it can be lifesaving.''
        Dr. Gemson started writing ditties for his grandchildren, and many of his medical songs were reworked family originals.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Cornell University and of its medical college. He was past president of the Nassau County Pediatric Society.
        Dr. Gemson is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Gerstenfeld; two daughters, Carol Rogow of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Meg Ashman of Burlington, Vt.; a brother, Robert, of Valley Stream, L.I., and three grandchildren.
        A funeral will be held Sunday at 11 A.M. at Nassau North Chapels, 55 North Station Plaza, Great Neck, L.I.
