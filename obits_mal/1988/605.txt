        Henry Bradley Martin a book collec-tor and a grandson of Henry Phipps, died Saturday at his home in Key Biscayne, Fla., after a brief illness. He was 82 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Martin, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Christ Church College at Oxford University. He assembled a fine book collection specializing in ornithology, 16th- and 17th-century English literature and 19th-century American and French literature.
        Included in the collection is a first printing of the Declaration of Independence, now on loan to the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan. ''The only copy in private hands,'' said Paul Needham, curator of printed books at the Morgan.
        ''He owned George Washington's copy of the Federalist Papers, as good a copy as you can expect,'' Mr. Needham said. ''It's a beautiful collection of books.'' The Morgan had an exhibition from the collection last fall.
        Mr. Martin was a former director of the Bessemer Securities Corporation, an honorary member of the Grolier Club and a member of the Downtown Association and the Knickerbocker Club.
        He is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; two daughters, Helen Bryan of Rumson, N.J., and Alice Tarafa of Manhattan; a son, Henry, of Marble Falls, Tex.; two brothers, Esmond, of Old Westbury, Conn., and Alastair, of Katonah, N.Y.; 15 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
