        Friar Angelo de Mojana di Cologna, the Grand Master of the Sovereign Order of the Knights of Malta, died of a heart attack Monday at his home in Rome. He was 82 years old.
        Friar de Mojana, a Milanese lawyer of noble birth, was elected Grand Master of the charitable order, the oldest existing order of chivalry, in May 1962. The order has 10,000 members in 90 countries.
        Friar de Mojana joined the order in 1940. Seventeen years later, after taking vows of obedience, poverty and chastity, he became a member of the Knights of Justice and Professed Chaplains, a Roman Catholic religious group.
        The Grand Master is selected, with the approval of the Pope, from that group. The Grand Master is technically equal in rank to a Roman Catholic cardinal.
        The Sovereign Military Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, the order's full title, was established in the 11th century in Jerusalem and operated a hospital for pilgrims.
        It was subsequently based in Rhodes, but was ousted in the 16th century by the Ottoman Turks and moved to the island of Malta. The order remained there until 1798, when it was forced to move by Napoleon's forces. Its headquarters now are in Rome.
        Friar de Mojana's funeral is to be held Thursday in Rome.
