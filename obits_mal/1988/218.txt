        In 1975 Mr. Stivers created ''The People's Choice Awards,'' an annual television program that honors performers and shows that are favorites in opinion polls.
        In 1977 he created and produced his favorite show, ''The Circus of the Stars,'' an annual event in which actors have four months of training and then perform as trapeze, high-wire and trampoline artists.
        Over the last dozen years, he created and produced 27 television specials, including a three-hour ''Stars Salute to the U.S. Olympic Team'' in 1984.
        Mr. Stivers was born in New York, and graduated from Washington and Lee University. He was a B-29 pilot in the Pacific in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife and partner, Bunny; a son, Robert Jr.; two stepsons, Tom and Larry Hendel, and two granddaughters.
