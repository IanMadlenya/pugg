        Colin Birch, vice president of visual presentation for Bloomingdale's, died Sunday in St. Martin in the French West Indies. He was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        A spokesman for Bloomingdale's said Mr. Birch had died of respiratory failure.
        Mr. Birch was born in Birmingham, England, where he graduated from the Moseley Art Institute. He began his career with a two-year apprenticeship in display at Marshall & Shelgrove, a fashion specialty store in Birmingham.
        When he came to the United States in 1970, he worked for the May Company in Cleveland before becoming display manager at Saks Fifth Avenue's Old Orchard store in Chicago. He then became interior display manager at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. From 1975 to 1977, he was corporate director of visual presentation at Bonwit Teller.
        Before joining Bloomingdale's in 1982, he headed his own design company, working primarily with European fashion designers.
        He is survived by his mother, Edith Birch, four sisters and three brothers, all of Birmingham. Burial will be in England, and a memorial service will be held later in New York.
