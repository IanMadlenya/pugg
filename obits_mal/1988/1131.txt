        Frank Zamboni, who invented an ice resurfacer that became a sort of mechanical celebrity for hockey fans, died today after a heart attack. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Zamboni put together his first ice resurfacer in 1947 using a war-surplus Jeep engine, the front ends of two automobiles, a series of pulleys and a wooden bin to catch ice shavings. The machine was patented in 1949.
        Hockey fans often greet the machines with chants of ''Zamboni, Zamboni,'' when the vehicles are driven onto the ice between periods of games.
        The Frank J. Zamboni Company has sold more than 4,000 Zambonis for use in 33 countries.
