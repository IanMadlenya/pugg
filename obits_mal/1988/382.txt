        John B. Kenny, co-founder and principal of the High School of Art and Design, formerly the New York School of Industrial Art, died Thursday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after a long illness. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Kenny helped convert a declining Works Progress Administration unit into the vocational high school. He was appointed principal in 1941. Under his direction, the school created a network of art directors, designers, illustrators, photographers and sculptors.
        In 1960 the name was changed and the school moved to a modern building on 57th Street and Second Avenue. Mr. Kenny retired in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Hubbard; and two daughters, Pamela, of Manhattan and Patricia, of Los Angeles.
