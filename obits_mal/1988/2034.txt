        Paul Heitner, one of Canada's leading contract-bridge players, died of heart failure early Thursday. He was 49 years old and lived in Brampton, Ontario.
        Mr. Heitner won two major national bridge championships, the Life Master Pairs in 1970 and the Men's Teams in 1976. He was second in the Men's Pairs in 1972, and won about 20 regional titles. In 1974, he represented the United States in the World Pair Championships in Las Palmas, the Canary Islands.
        He was a leading theorist and devised, with John Lowenthal of Manhattan, a complex bidding system known as the Canary Club. In the mid-60's, he co-founded and served as managing editor of The Bridge Journal, which from 1963 to 1967 made many contributions to the theory of the game. In 1986, he published the first major computer program for simulating bridge deals with given characteristics.
        Mr. Heitner was a computer systems consultant with special expertise in computer communications. He graduated from James Madison High School in Brooklyn and received a mathematics degree from Brooklyn College.
        He is survived by his wife, Abigail; his daughter, Meredith, and his brother, Herbert Heitner of Marlboro, N.J.
