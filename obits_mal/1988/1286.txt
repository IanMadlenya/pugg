        Born in Chicago, Mr. Salemson was educated at home by his parents until they moved to France in 1922. He attended the University of Montpellier and the Sorbonne. Later, he attended the Experimental College at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
        After returning to France in 1928, Mr. Salemson contributed to English and French literary publications and became a film critic for Le Monde. For two years, he headed a literary magazine, Tambour, which published works by Theodore Dreiser, H. L. Mencken, and Andre Maurois, among others.
        In 1966, Mr. Salemson became a book reviewer for Newsday and began translating books. Among the more than 20 books he translated were ''Pablo Picasso: His Life and Times,'' by Pierre Cabanne, and ''The Unspeakable Confessions of Salvador Dali,'' an autobiography.
        Mr. Salemson is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a son, Stephen, of Durham, N.C.; a daughter, Betsy, of Huntington, L.I.; a sister, Paula Smith of Oxnard, Calif., and three grandsons.
