        Robert Summers Yellowtail Sr., a patriarch of the Crow Indian Tribe, died Saturday at his home. He was 98 years old.
        Mr. Yellowtail studied law and planned to become a lawyer but instead became involved in tribal affairs and politics. The University of Montana School of Law eventually awarded him an honorary degree. He served several times as tribal chairman, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs appointed him superintendent of his reservation, the first Indian named to the post, which he held for 11 years.
