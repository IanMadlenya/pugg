        Mr. Bernd helped develop a recent choreographic style in which autobiographical storytelling is blended with movement. One of his best known pieces, the 1981 ''Surviving Love and Death,'' was made the year he contracted AIDS, and deals with his illness. He began performing his own work in 1978 and received a Bessie, the New York Dance and Performance Award, in 1986.
        Mr. Bernd also appeared in the dance and theater works of Meredith Monk, Jane Comfort, Jeff Weiss and Molissa Fenley, and he collaborated on dance-theater projects with Anne Bogart, Beth Lapides, Fred Holland, Ishmael Houston-Jones and Tim Miller. Known for his drawing together of choreographers and dancers working on the Lower East Side, Mr. Bernd also organized Open Movement, a weekly improvisation workshop held at Performance Space 122.
        Mr. Bernd was from Kansas and graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree in dance and performance studies. Among his teachers were Sara Rudner, Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp, John Cage and Jasper Johns. Mr. Bernd is survived by his mother, Dorothy Williams of Harvard, Mass.; his father, Daniel, of Chicago, and two sisters, Sarah Durkee, of Oakland, Calif., and Kate Bernd-Barnett of Santa Cruz, Calif.
