        His career as a producer, manager and actor took him to London's West End theater district, where he was involved in many contemporary and classical plays. Sir John also appeared in several British films, including ''Things to Come'' in 1936, ''Knight Without Armor'' in 1937, ''Four Feathers'' in 1939, ''Ships With Wings'' in 1942, ''Oh What a Lovely War'' in 1969 and ''Gandhi'' in 1982.
        In 1946 Sir John married the actress Kay Hammond. They became one of Britain's best-known theatrical couples, appearing together in ''Marriage a la Mode'' in 1946 and ''The Beaux Stratagem'' in 1949, which ran for more than 500 performances. The couple also starred in the British Broadcasting Corporation's popular radio comedy show ''We Beg To Differ.''
        Sir John was a member of the Old Vic Company that visited New York in 1962, performing ''Saint Joan'' and ''Macbeth.''
        In 1968, when he was director of the Chichester Festival Theater, Sir John was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. His wife died in 1980.
