        Dr. Reginald S. Lourie, director of the psychiatry department at the Children's Hospital in Washington for 26 years, died of a heart attack last Sunday at George Washington University Hospital in the capital. He was 79 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        Dr. Lourie established the psychiatry department at Children's in 1948 and headed it until he retired in 1974. As a specialist in child psychiatry, he entered a field that was relatively new in this country before World War II.
        Dr. Lourie was a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services School of Health Sciences at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. In his later years, as a senior consultant to the National Institute of Mental Health, he worked in infant psychiatry, which reaches for the roots of mental illness in babies only days or hours old.
        He also was a faculty member of the medical schools of George Washington, Howard and Georgetown Universities.
        Dr. Lourie, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University in 1930 and from the Long Island College of Medicine in 1936. He received his psychiatric training at the Psychiatric Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lucille Radin; three sons, Seth of Chevy Chase, Ira of Rockville, Md., and Benjamin of Silver Spring, Md., and seven grandchildren.
