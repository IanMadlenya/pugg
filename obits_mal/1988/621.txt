        Joseph M. Gasarch, who served for 27 years in the Manhattan District Attorney's office and was its chief accountant when he retired in 1962, died of a heart attack Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach, where he lived. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Gasarch, who was born in the Bronx, was a graduate of City College of New York and New York Law School and he earned an accounting degree from New York University. In 1935 he joined the District Attorney's office under Thomas E. Dewey and helped lay the groundwork for a number of prosecutions of Mafia figures.
        Frank S. Hogan, Mr. Dewey's successor, named Mr. Gasarch chief accountant in 1947 and two years later made him an assistant District Attorney so he could question witnesses before grand juries. Upon Mr. Gasarch's retirement in 1962, Mr. Hogan said that ''no man has given greater service to the administration of criminal justice in the past quarter of a century.''
        Mr. Gasarch's wife, the former Sarah Dombroff, died in February. He is survived by a brother, Harry, of Harrison, N.Y.; a sister, Rose Mack of Queens; a son, Justin, of Monmouth Beach, N.J.; a daughter, Roberta Sonnino of Manhattan; three grandsons, and a granddaughter.
