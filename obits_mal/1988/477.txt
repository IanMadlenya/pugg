        Paul Boubal, former proprietor of the Cafe de Flore, a favorite haunt of French philosophers, writers and poets, has died, the management announced Saturday. He was 80 years old.
        The restaurant, on the Left Bank, and its next-door rival, Les Deux Magots, became popular meeting places for the intelligentsia after World War II.
        Mr. Boubal ran the business, on Boulevard St.-Germain, for 44 years before agreeing to sell it in 1983 on two conditions: the new management had to promise to retain both its literary tradition and its culinary speciality - boiled eggs with bread and butter.
