        William C. McCreery, a lawyer who served in the New York Assembly for 15 years, died of heart failure yesterday morning at his home in Brooklyn. He was 91 years old. Mr. McCreery, a Democrat, was first elected in 1925 and served until 1940, when he returned to practicing trust and estate law in Brooklyn.
        In the Legislature, Mr. McCreery was active in efforts to reform the court system and was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1935. He also sponsored legislation to ban child labor and expand aid to education.
        Not long after his first election, he was credited with thwarting an attack on Gov. Al Smith. A man described as a shell-shocked veteran of World War I tried to force his way into a reception at the Executive Mansion in Albany, and Mr. McCreery, according to news accounts at the time, saw the man reach into his pocket as if to draw a weapon. When the man ran off, Mr. McCreery gave chase and held him until the police arrived.
        A Brooklyn native, Mr. McCreery was a graduate of Poly Prep Country Day School and received his law degree from Fordham University.
        His first wife died in 1932. He is survived by his second wife, the former Florence O'Malley; two daughters, Cornelia McCreery, of Manhattan, and Virginia Butler, of Brooklyn; two sons, William G. , of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Charles , of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.
