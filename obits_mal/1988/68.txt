        Salah Hindawy, a senior Egyptian diplomat who took part in efforts to resolve a border dispute with Israel, died of a heart attack Sunday in Kuwait. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Hindawy became Egypt's Ambassador to Kuwait on Dec. 6 after an eight-year diplomatic rupture with that country was ended.
        He figured prominently in four years of talks between Egypt and Israel on the fate of Taba, a 250-acre stretch of beach on the Sinai Peninsula that both nations claim. In 1986 the two nations agreed to submit the matter to international arbitration, and a decision is expected this year.
