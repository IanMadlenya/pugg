        William H. Scott, general manager of San Francisco's Municipal Railway in its most difficult period, died at the age of 100 on Monday.
        Mr. Scott was general manager of the railway from 1940 to 1952, when he retired.
        In his tenure, the city bought a private street car system and merged it into the city-owned Muni. Most of the private system was worn out, and Mr. Scott directed the program that replaced hundreds of the streetcars with electric trolley buses.
