        John H. Johnson, who presided over the nation's 176 minor-league teams as president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, died of chest cancer yesterday at his home in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 66 years old.
        After serving nine years as administrative assistant to Bowie Kuhn, the major-league commissioner, Mr. Johnson was elected president of the national association by representatives of the 17 independent minor leagues in 1978.
        Sometimes known as the commissioner of minor-league baseball, he was credited with helping to stabilize the shaky organization and steer it through a period of growth. One of his key achievements was an extensive overhaul of the master player development contract, which governs the relations between major-league clubs and their mostly independently owned minor-league affiliates.
        Mr. Johnson, who was born on Staten Island, joined the Yankees in 1947, initially as secretary to the general manager, George Weiss. He later served as general manager of the farm club in Binghamton, N.Y., traveling secretary for the Yankees and ultimately as vice president for minor-league operations.
