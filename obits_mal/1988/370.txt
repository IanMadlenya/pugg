        Maurice Linder, an insurance agent for 45 years and the oldest living member of the industry's ''Million Dollar Round Table,'' died of heart failure Sunday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 93 years old and lived in Palm Beach.
        Mr. Linder was the first president of the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation and longtime head of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The society was the first synagogue established by the reconstructionist movement in Judaism. Mr. Linder was also a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        Born in Austria, he came to the United States as a child and was raised in New York. He opened his own insurance agency in 1928 and was associated with the Travelers Insurance Company throughout his career, which ended with his retirement in 1983. He qualified several times for the round table, made up of agents who have sold more than $1 million worth of life insurance in a year.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Beatrice Travis; a daughter, Eleanor Winter of Manhattan; a son, Jerry, of Manhattan; a brother, Max, of Miami; three sisters, Tessie Edkiss of Queens, Tessie Weissman of Palm Springs, Calif., and Edith Birnberg of the Bronx, 6 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
