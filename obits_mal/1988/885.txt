        Robert H. Hinckley, the former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Authority, died Saturday at his home in Eden, Utah. He was 96 years old.
        Mr. Hinckley, a former Mormon missionary and small-town schoolteacher, was also one of the directors when the American Broadcasting Company was created in 1946.
        At the aviation agency, he spearheaded a drive to train thousands of college students as pilots just before the United State entered World War II.
        He served in a variety of posts in the administrations of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, including the chairmanship of the aviation agency, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for aviation, director of the Office of Contract Settlement and member of the Public Advisory Board for Mutual Security. Retired in 1959
        He also served as a vice president of the Sperry Corporation in the early 1940's and, following his government service, in a number of executive posts at ABC. He retired in 1959 as vice president of its Washington office but remained as a member of the board of directors until 1969.
        In the late 1930's, with United States entry into the war on the horizon, Mr. Hinckley, as chairman of the C.A.A., crisscrossed the country calling for creation of about 4,000 new airports and for the training of as many as 100,000 college students as pilots.
        Survivors include two sons, Robert Jr. of Salt Lake City and John S. of Ogden, Utah; a daughter, Betty H. Nibley, of Ogden; 10 grandchildren, and 25 great-grandchildren.
