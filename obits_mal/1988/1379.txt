        John Howard Sweet, chairman emeritus of U.S. News & World Report and a publishing executive for more than five decades, died Sunday of a heart attack at the Carriage Hill nursing home in Bethesda, Md. He was 81 years old and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Sweet, a native of Manitoba, went to Washington in 1946 as circulation manager of World Report, which merged into U.S. News, its parent company, two years later. He continued in that job at the combined weekly and was elected a vice president and publishing director in 1951, and for a period of years assumed overlapping responsibilities.
        From 1959 until he retired in 1982, he held the titles of president, publisher, chief executive officer and chairman of the board, becoming publisher in 1951 and president seven years after that. He stepped down as president and chief executive in 1981 but remained chairman into the next year, the magazine's semicentennial.
        U.S. News & World Report said yesterday that during Mr. Sweet's tenure the magazine's circulation rose from 350,000 to more than two million.
        Mr. Sweet's first job was to deliver a morning newspaper in Winnipeg. He briefly attended the University of Manitoba, but set out for Chicago in 1926, at age 19, to start his publishing career as an assistant circulation manager for the American Medical Association. He moved on to other positions and, in 1943, joined the U.S. Navy eventually serving as a navigator with the rank of lieutenant commander.
        Mr. Sweet is survived by his wife, the former Anne Ethel Wallace; a son, Anthony H., of Los Altos, Calif., and a daughter, Elizabeth Ternes of Virginia Beach, Va.
