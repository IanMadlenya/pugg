        Phil Leslie, who for more than a decade created the comic antics of ''Fibber McGee and Molly'' on radio, died Friday of cancer. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Leslie, who also brought ''Major Hoople'' and ''Beulah'' to radio in other shows, wrote in later years for such television programs as ''The Lucy Show,'' ''Dennis the Menace'' and ''The Brady Bunch.''
        He was an aspiring scriptwriter who was working as a theater usher in St. Louis when the comedian Al Pierce asked him to write for his show in California. After Mr. Pierce retired, Mr. Leslie wrote for Bob Hope, Roy Rogers and others.
        He became main writer for ''Fibber McGee and Molly'' in the show's heyday in the early 1940's and stayed on until it ended in the 1950's.
