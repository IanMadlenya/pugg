        Leon Pomerance, a New York businessman whose enthusiasm for archeology made possible the rediscovery of an important Bronze Age palace on the island of Crete, died at his Manhattan home Friday after a brief illness. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Pomerance, a self-proclaimed ''archeology buff,'' was president of the Forest Paper Company and a trustee of the Archeological Institute of America when, in 1962, he started an annual grant with which the Greek Archeological Society began a dig at Kato Zakro, a hamlet on Crete's eastern shore. From then until 1971, he and his wife, Harriet, not only financed the excavation but spent a month every summer helping with the work.
        The dig revealed a 250-room palace built in 1600 B.C., which archeologists thought was the center of a thriving trade with Egypt and Syria. The Pomerances' collection of ancient objects was displayed in 1966 at the Brooklyn Museum.
        Mr. Pomerance was a native of Brooklyn and earned a law degree at New York University in 1928 before joining his father's paper company.
        Mrs. Pomerance died in 1972. Mr. Pomerance is survived by two sons, Bernard, of Galisteo, N.M., and Michael, of Cambridge, Mass., and two grandchildren.
        A funeral will be held at 11:30 A.M. tomorrow at the Riverside Memorial Chapel, 76th Street at Amsterdam Avenue.
