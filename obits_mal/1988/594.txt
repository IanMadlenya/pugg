        Mr. Freedman was a founder of the Manhattan firm of Freedman & Slater, which handled the effects of such troupes as the Bolshoi Ballet, the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera.
        As a visitor to Europe in 1937 to 1939, he was credited with helping thousands of Jews leave Europe by advising them to go to Haiti and Cuba and use immigration quotas from those countries to enter the United States.
        His survivors include a son, Jerome, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Arline Goodglass of Carmel, Calif.; a brother, Edward, of Brooklyn; five grandchildren, and nine great-granchildren.
