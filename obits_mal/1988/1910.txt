        Mr. di Belardino, who was born in Rome, was one of the first to introduce fine Italian wines to the United States. He came to this country in 1946 and worked to build a market for good Italian wines. In 1983 he sold the business to Heublein Inc.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Constance Tempesta; two sons, Mario and Philip, both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
