        Willie Velasquez, a leader of the movement to increase political power among Hispanic Americans, died early today of cancer. He was 44 years old.
        In 1974 Mr. Velasquez founded the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, the nation's largest voter registration project aimed at the Hispanic community.
        Under his guidance, a spokesman said, the project conducted voter registration drives in 200 cities and Indian reservations and conducted extensive polling.
        ''What we're most proud of is that from 1974 when we started to 1987, the number of Hispanic elected officials in the U.S. grew from 1,566 to 3,038, an increase of 82 percent,'' the spokesman said.
        Mr. Velasquez, a native of San Antonio, was a leader of a Hispanic-American political party, La Raza Unida, that was active in the Southwest in the late 1960's and early 1970's. In 1968 he led a farmworkers' strike, along with Cesar Chavez, in south Texas. In 1981, he taught a course on Southwestern politics at Harvard University.
        Mr. Velasquez is survived by his wife, Jane, and three children.
