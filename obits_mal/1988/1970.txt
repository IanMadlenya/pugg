        Bertram B. Salwen, a professor of anthropology at New York University who specialized in urban and historical archaeology, died Sunday after suffering a heart attack at his home in Manhattan. He was 68 years old.
        Professor Salwen, best known for using archaeological techniques to study American urban communities, led many digs to uncover the history buried under Manhattan, often feuding with building contractors and construction workers who pressured him to finish. Among his projects were a search for Indian artifacts on Staten Island; an excavation of the original Dutch City Hall on Pearl Street in Manhattan, and a dig near Washington Square to unearth remants of home life in the 19th century.
        In his mid-30's Mr. Salwen, who had taken up archaeology as a hobby, enrolled in Columbia University to earn his doctorate in the field. In 1966, he and several other professors at New York University created the country's first graduate department in urban archaeology.
        Professor Salwen was acting chairman of the N.Y.U. Anthropology department for several years, and served over the years as president of a number of professional groups, including the Society for Historical Archaeology and the New York Archaeological Council.
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah; a brother, Harold, of Teaneck, N.J.; two daughters, Sarah Frances of Manhattan and Nancy, of Keene, N.H.; three sons, Peter, of Manahattan, Joshua, of High Falls, N.Y. Ethan, of High Falls, and a grandson.
