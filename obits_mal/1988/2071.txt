        The Rev. Dr. Donald R. Campion, a Jesuit priest, author and former editor of the national Catholic weekly magazine America, died of Parkinson's disease Sunday at the Murray-Weigel Hall Health Care Center at Fordham University. He was 67 years old and lived at Fordham.
        Father Campion was born in Brooklyn and joined the Jesuits after graduating from Regis High School in 1939. He continued his studies at St. Louis University, taught briefly at Xavier High School in Manhattan and Le Moyne College in Syracuse and studied theology at Woodstock College in Maryland. He was ordained a priest in 1952 and earned a Ph.D. in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania.
        Father Campion was editor in chief of America from 1968 to 1975, after working as associate editor from 1957 to 1965. He was information officer for the Jesuits in Rome from 1975 to 1978 and returned here to become secretary for information and communication of the Jesuit Conference in Washington. In 1984, illness forced him to move to the Fordham infirmary. He became spiritual director for seminarians. Correspondent at Vatican II
        He was a prolific writer and contributed articles to religious and secular journals. In the 60's, as Rome correspondent for America, he wrote extensively about the Second Vatican Council, interpreting for American Catholics the momentous changes being adopted.

        Father Campion was a trustee of several institutions, including Fordham, Woodstock, Holy Cross, St. Peter's and Boston Colleges. He was also a member of Catholic and ecumenical organizations, including the National Council of Churches. As vice president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he visited China, the Soviet Union, Hungary, Morocco and East Germany to discuss human rights.
        ''Don Campion was a quiet but determined force in the struggle for religious freedom everywhere,'' said the Rev. Dr. David H. C. Read, minister of the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.
