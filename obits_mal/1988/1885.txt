        Mr. Bell, a native of Liverpool, was personnel director for British Home Stores Ltd. in England when early in World War II he became an ambulance driver for a Friends unit.
        He went to China in 1943 and became manager of a surgical team with the ambulance service. At the war's end he came to the United States to direct Asian relief activities for the Friends Service Committee. When war broke out in the Middle East he directed Quaker relief in the Gaza Strip under United Nations auspices.
        After holding international posts for the Friends in Geneva Mr. Bell returned to the American headquarters in Philadelphia, where he served until retiring as executive director in 1968. In subsequent years he managed Friends residences and visitor centers.
        Mr. Bell is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Conyers; a daughter, Jennifer Newton of Manakin, Va.; two sons, Alister, of Arlington, Va., and Graham of Kents Store, and two grandchildren.
