        Sir Harold Martin, a retired air marshal and one of Britain's ''Dambusters'' who attacked dams on the Ruhr River in Germany during World War II using a revolutionary bouncing bomb, died at his home in London on Thursday. He was 70 years old.
        Sir Harold, who was born in Australia, was considered one of the Royal Air Force's most experienced pilots and an ideal choice for the raids on the Mohne and Eder Valley Dams.
        The 1943 raids involved flying at an altitude of 150 feet and dropping to 60 feet before releasing the bombs. The bombs, devised by the British inventor Barnes Wallis, could clear anti-mine nets by skipping across the water before hitting their targets.
