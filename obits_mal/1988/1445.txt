        Mr. White, a specialist in building foundations and other heavy construction, worked on underpinnings for a number of major skyscrapers, including the World Trade Center here, the Sears Tower in Chicago and the John Hancock Building in Boston, the tallest structures in those cities. He also oversaw subway construction in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington.
        In the 1950's, Mr. White was a consultant to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, helping to devise plans to save the temples at Abu Simbel on the upper Nile River in Egypt from flooding after construction of the Aswan High Dam.
        Born in Stone Ridge, N.Y., Mr. White was an engineering graduate of Harvard in 1932 and joined Spencer, White & Prentis that year, remaining until his retirement. He served as a trustee of the Village of Larchmont, N.Y., for seven years and was president of the Mamaroneck Free Library.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Fox; a son, Edward Jr., of Boston; a brother, Robert, and a sister, Felicia Gossman, both of Larchmont, and two grandchildren.
