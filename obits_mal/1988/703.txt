        Theodore Harris, a prolific but largely unrecognized composer, died Monday night at his home in Brooklyn. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Harris, who was born in New York City, worked as a jazz musician and then as a piano teacher for most of his life. His great love was composing, however, and he created a large body of work: at least eight sonatas, two concertos, two symphonies, and more than 50 piano compositions. ''He also wrote an opera with William Carlos Williams called 'The First President,' and probably a lot more, too,'' said his son, Steven Harris. ''The closets are full of his work.''
        Among Mr. Harris's compositions were a rhythm-and-blues tune, ''Crying in the Streets,'' that became a hit in the South, and an Off Broadway musical, ''Meet Peter Grant,'' based on Ibsen's ''Peer Gynt,'' which featured David Hartman in a leading role. In January, an Estonian pianist, Malle Magi, performed one of Mr. Harris's sonatas, the ''James Robert Sonata'' (dedicated to the composer's grandson) at Merkin Concert Hall. Several days before the concert, Mr. Harris, who was suffering from chest pains, said, ''I just want to reach Sunday and I want to reach it alive.''
        Mr. Harris is survived by his wife, Dora; a son, Steven, of Cedarhurst, L.I.; a daughter, Melody, of Oceanside, and four grandchildren.
