        Mr. Schlein's paintings reflected his feeling for the quiet of New England and dynamism of New York and his concern with the socially oppressed.
        In the 1930's, after living in Paris, the Russian-born artist taught and painted for the Works Progress Administration. In 1938, he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked briefly in the art departments of motion picture studios, painting publicity portraits of stars like Bing Crosby and Rosalind Russell.
        His work has been exhibited in Europe and throughout the United States.
        Mr. Schlein is survived by his wife, Geraldine, and a son, Steven, both of Los Angeles.
