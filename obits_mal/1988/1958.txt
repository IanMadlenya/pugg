        Ivan Boldizsar, president of the Hungarian PEN Center and one of the first people from a Soviet bloc nation to receive an honorary degree in the United States, died Thursday in Budapest after a long illness. He was 76 years old.
        A novelist, screenwriter and editor who wrote more than 20 books, Mr. Boldizsar was the author of a popular travel book called ''Manhattan Minute by Minute,'' a diary of a visit he made in 1966.
        After the Communists came to power in Hungary in 1947, Mr. Boldizsar became Under Secretary of the Ministry of Information and frequently defended the Hungarian Government when it was criticized on human rights and freedom of speech. He was a Government spokesman during the trial of Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty in 1949.
        After Mr. Boldizsar was purged in 1951, he developed close ties with the West through such organizations as PEN, the international literary organization, and became one of 17 vice presidents of PEN.
        In 1971, Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., gave Mr. Boldizsar an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in recognition of his contributions to literature, journalism and the theater.
