        Parker W. Fennelly, who played Titus Moody, the cryptic New Englander, on the Fred Allen radio program in the 1940's and early 1950's, and who was later the television spokesman for Pepperidge Farm products, died yesterday at his home in Peekskill, N.Y. He was 96 years old.  Mr. Fennelly, who retired at 85, was known especially for his portrayals of old Yankee characters, whose accent he knew well; he was born and raised in Northeast Harbor on Mount Desert Island, Me.
        But he was educated as a classical actor, at the Leland Powers School in Boston, and started out playing Shakespearean roles at Chautauqua, N.Y.
        He later appeared on Broadway and in films and was the author of several plays, including ''Fulton of Oak Falls,'' written with George M. Cohan and produced on Broadway in 1937, and ''Cuckoos on the Hearth'' (1941). 'Howdy, Bub' His Signature
        As Titus Moody on radio and then on television, in the 1950's, Mr. Fennelly got laughs even before the start of a routine, with his classic opening line: ''Howdy, bub.''
        Long before his performances with Fred Allen, Mr. Fennelly and Arthur Allen were heard as Yankee codgers on two radio programs, ''The Stebbins Boys of Bucksport Point'' and ''Snow Village Sketches.'' Other radio programs on which Mr. Fennelly appeared included ''Grand Central Station,'' ''Mystery Theater'' and ''Route 66.'' Appearing on Broadway with Eva LeGallienne in ''The Southwest Corner'' in 1955, he was praised by Brooks Atkinson, The New York Times critic, for his ''brilliant character study'' of a Yankee hired man. His other Broadway credits include ''Mr. Pitt'' (1924) and ''Our Town'' (1944). He played the star keeper in a 1966 revival of ''Carousel.'' 'I Was Born Old'
        His film credits include ''The Whistle at Eaton Falls'' (1951), ''The Trouble With Harry'' (1955), ''It Happened to Jane'' (1959), ''Angel in My Pocket'' (1969), ''The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming!''(1966) and ''How to Frame a Figg'' (1971).
        In an interview marking his 90th birthday in 1981, Mr. Fennelly seemed amused that he finally had reached the age of many of the characters he had played. ''I was born old,'' he said, ''and I played old parts most of my life.''
        He is survived by his wife, the former Catherine Reynolds; his daughters, Jane R. of Quaker Hill, Conn., and Mary Michaelsen of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., four grandsons and one great-grandson.
