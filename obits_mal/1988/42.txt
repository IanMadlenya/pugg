        Joseph H. Ream, a former executive vice president and director of the Columbia Broadcasting System, died of neurological complications from an aneurysm at the Mobile (Ala.) Infirmary Wednesday. He was 84 years old and lived in Fairhope, Ala.
        Mr. Ream was known at CBS as ''the barefoot boy of Wall Street'' because of his ''folksy ways,'' according to his son, Davidson, who said his father would smoke a corncob pipe at CBS board meetings.
        Raised in Kansas, Mr. Ream graduated from the Yale University Law School in 1927 and worked for a Wall Street law firm before joining CBS in 1934 as its first general counsel. Moving into management positions, he represented the network's interests before the Federal Communications Commission.
        He left CBS in 1952, developed a cattle ranch near Tallahassee, Fla., and served for two years as deputy director of the National Security Council. Then he returned to CBS as a vice president in charge of its Washington office. After a quiz show scandal in the late 1950's over rigging of the CBS show ''The $64,000 Question,'' he moved to New York to monitor all CBS programs to insure against deception.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Harris; three sons, Jackson, of Dallas, Davidson, of Chicago, and Christopher, of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Nancy Rose, of San Franciso; 11 grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
