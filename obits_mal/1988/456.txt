        Mayor Thomas Vezzetti, who fought against the ''gentrification'' of this Hudson River city, died early today of a heart attack. He was 59 years old.
        Mayor Vezzetti died at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken after medical workers tried for nearly an hour to revive him, the police said. He suffered the heart attack in his home.
        Mr. Vezzetti, a lifelong bachelor, was said to have been angry Tuesday night over the outcome of a special election in the Fifth Ward. A City Councilman who frequently criticized the Mayor's policies won a special election over a candidate supported by Mr. Vezzetti.
        In 1982, Mr. Vezzetti took a bullhorn and walked up and down Washington Street, the city's main artery, to announce that he was challenging the Council president in the next election. He won, and then successfully used the tactic in the race for mayor in 1985.
        Mr. Vezzetti was born in Bradley Beach, N.J., in 1928, along with a twin sister, Louise, who now lives in Puerto Rico. He once described his father as a ''bootlegger'' who owned five saloons and he said his mother was an heiress to a peanuts and dried fruits fortune. The family owned the Madison Hotel here, but sold it several years ago.
