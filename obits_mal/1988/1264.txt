        William N. King, a retired Army master sergeant and the first enlisted man to make an official parachute jump, died Saturday at his home in Phenix City, Ala. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. King made more than 350 parachute jumps in his career, including one in the invasion of Normandy in World War II on June 6, 1944. He also made combat jumps in the Korean War.
        In 1940 he was a member of a 48-man platoon that was formed to test the use of parachutes by infantry soldiers. On Aug. 16, 1940, Mr. King, who was to have been the second soldier to parachute from a converted bomber circling Lawson Field at Fort Benning, Ga., jumped first after the man in front of him froze. The men in the test platoon became the cadre of the Army's first combat paratroop unit. He retired from the Army in 1960 after a 24-year career.
        Survivors include his wife, Mildred, and a son, Rusty, both of Phenix City; a sister, Olga Turner, of Manning, S.C., three granddaughters and a great-grandson.
