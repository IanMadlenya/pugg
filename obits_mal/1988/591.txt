        Jesse Gray, a former New York State Assemblyman and a leader of rent strikes in Harlem in the 1960's, died Jan. 2 at the Beth Abraham Home in the Bronx, where he had been in a coma for several years. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Gray began organizing tenants to protest conditions in slum areas in the 1950's but gained wide attention in November 1963 when he led a rent strike in a 15-block section in the center of Harlem. Scores of tenants took rats, alive and dead, to a hearing in Civil Court to dramatize the infestation of rodents in their apartment buildings.
        The 1963 strike ended in a standoff. But from his base as head of the Community Council for Housing, Mr. Gray went on to form a broader group, the National Tenants Organization, and in 1969 he ran unsuccessfully for City Council.
        After failing to unseat Adam Clayton Powell Jr. as United States Representative in 1970, Mr. Gray was elected to the State Assembly as a Democrat in 1972. He was defeated in the 1974 Democratic primary.
        Mr. Gray, who was born in a rural area near Baton Rouge, La., came to New York and worked as a tailor before devoting full time to organizing tenants in the mid-1950's.
        Survivors include a son, Jesse Jr., and a daughter, Gail.
        A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. Saturday in the Abyssinian Baptist Church, 132 West 138th Street.
