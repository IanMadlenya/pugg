        Harold Stephenson Sloan, a retired manufacturer, economist, teacher and author who was a brother of the industrialist Alfred P. Sloan, died in his sleep Saturday at his home in Lopatcong Township, N.J. He was 100 years old.
        Mr. Sloan, a native of Brooklyn, began work as a clerk in his father's wholesale grocery business. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees from Columbia University, he opened his own companies to manufacture phonograph and radio equipment.
        In 1925 he began a career in education, teaching history at schools in Brooklyn and at what is now Montclair State College, where he was an associate professor of economics. For many years he was a visiting professor at New York University and at Teachers College of Columbia University. From 1957 to 1971 he was director of research at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
        He was the author of, among other books, ''Today's Economics,'' published in 1936, and was co-author with Arnold J. Zurcher of ''Dictionary of Economics,'' published in 1948.
        He served for nine years as vice president and executive director of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
        Mr. Sloan's wife, the former Bertha L. Florey, whom he married in 1910, died in 1978. He is survived by a son, Alvin, a former mayor of Washington Township, N.J.; a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.
