        Robert P. McCarney, a conservative Republican who led several successful drives to cut state taxes, died Wednesday of pneumonia and heart failure. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. McCarney made his first campaign in 1964 when he ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. He won the 1968 Republican primary but lost in the general election.
        Mr. McCarney led referendum drives that overturned tax packages passed by the Legislature in 1963 and 1965. In 1976, he backed a successful measure that cut the state sales tax to 3 percent from 4 percent.
