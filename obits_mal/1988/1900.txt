He was 88 years old and lived in Bellport, L.I.
        Dr. Jacobus taught chemistry at the Stevens Institute of Technology and was director of research for the Keuffel & Esser Company before joining the radiation laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in World War II.
        He was at Brookhaven from 1949 until 1957, when he went to Harvard as a research fellow. He returned to Brookhaven in 1966 and became head of the mechanical engineering division, a post from which he retired in 1970. At Brookhaven, Dr. Jacobus was the design engineer for the cosmotron and alternating gradient synchotron atom-smashers. At Harvard, he designed the Cambridge Electron Accelerator.
        He was born in Jersey City and was an alumnus of Stevens.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Elinor Hughes; two sons, David, of Princeton, N.J., and John, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
