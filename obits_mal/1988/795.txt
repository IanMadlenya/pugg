        Mr. Pomerantz established the conservation laboratory of the Art Institute in 1951 and headed it until 1961, when he opened a private art conservation practice. He became consultant to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the National Gallery of Canada and other art and natural history museums.
        He also organized several museum exhibitions on conservation, including, most recently, ''Know What You See,'' which has been shown at more than 100 museums around the United States, Canada and Mexico since 1976, as part of a traveling museum exhibition program of the Smithsonian Institution.
        Mr. Pomerantz is survived by his wife, Else, of Spring Grove, and by two daughters, Carrie Luke of Spring Grove and Lonnie Ross of Walled Lake, Mich.
