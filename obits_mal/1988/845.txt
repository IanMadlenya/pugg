       Patrick Hogan, an artist who achieved renown as a painter in Los Angeles despite a handicap that allowed him only the use of his mouth to hold a paintbrush, died of respiratory failure on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 41 years old, and had moved to New York two years ago to pursue his painting career.
        Patrick Hogan, an artist who achieved renown as a painter in Los Angeles despite a handicap that allowed him only the use of his mouth to hold a paintbrush, died of respiratory failure on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 41 years old, and had moved to New York two years ago to pursue his painting career.
        His disease, a rare and progressive form of muscular atrophy, first appeared when he was 5 years old. He used a wheelchair starting at the age of 10, and was given only a few years to live. Nevertheless, he continued to study art at California State University at North Ridge and, after graduation, began a career in Los Angeles.
        Through shows at galleries and, later, museums, including those at the Newport Harbor Art Museum and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, he gradually became well known. An abstract painter, he showed in the early 1970's at the Michael Walls Gallery in Los Angeles, and later, from 1978 to 1984, at the Tortue Gallery in Santa Monica.
        In New York, Mr. Hogan has shown his work in group shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Guggenheim Museum. In 1983, he won a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship, and in recent years he won three fellowships in painting from the National Endowment for the Arts.
        He is survived by his mother, Jean Hogan of Glendale, Calif., and a brother, Michael Hogan of Grants Pass, Ore.
