        Rufus C. Harris, former president of Mercer and Tulane universities, died Thursday. He was 91 years old.
        Dr. Harris was president of Tulane, in New Orleans, from 1937 to 1960.
        In 1943, as chairman of a special committee of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, he helped restore accreditation to the University of Georgia and nine other state-operated colleges.
        The schools were suspended by the association in 1941 after Gov. Eugene Talmadge had dismissed educators and regents for favoring educational opportunities for blacks. The committee restored the Georgia schools to good standing after Mr. Talmadge's successor, Ellis Arnall, appointed new regents and pledged to end political interference.
        After leaving Tulane, Dr. Harris led the Baptist-affiliated Mercer, which has campuses in Macon and Atlanta, for 20 years until 1980. That year the position of chancellor was created for him, which he held until his death.
        Dr. Harris persuaded Mercer's trustees to integrate the student body in 1963 and to begin accepting Federal grants in 1969.
        His wife of 63 years, Mary Louise Walker Harris, died in 1981. Survivors include three sons, J. H. Walker Harris of Columbus and Rufus C. Harris Jr. and Louie K. Harris, both of New Orleans; nine grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
