        Palmer Bernard Wald, the vice president of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, died Wednesday in St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 57 years old and lived on the Upper West Side.
        Mr. Wald died of heart failure caused by a long respiratory illness, his family said.
        Mr. Wald was also secretary and general counsel of the foundation, which raised $300 million for the statue's centennial restoration. He helped retain the 1986 Fourth of July fireworks display after insurance companies underwriting the event threatened to withdraw because of misunderstandings. Mr. Wald worked out an agreement.
        Mr. Wald was a public-school teacher from 1957 to 1966 and attended Brooklyn Law School at night. In 1968 he became an assistant state attorney general. From 1974 to 1983 he was administrator and secretary at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
        He is survived by three brothers, Charles, Alfred and Michael; and two sisters, Andrea Creaney and Catherine Pinheiro, all of Rhode Island.
