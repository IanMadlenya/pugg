        Richard S. Nye, chairman emeritus of Georgeson & Company, and a former ocean-racing yachtsman, died Tuesday in Greenwich, Conn., after a long illness. He was 85 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        A statement issued by the company, a proxy-solicitation firm, said Mr. Nye was ''a pioneer in the field of proxy fights, takeovers and corporate control contests.''
        Mr. Nye's son, Richard B. Nye, is now chairman and chief executive officer.
        Mr. Nye took up ocean racing in 1945 at the age of 42. His record included victories in three races to Bermuda, three trans-Atlantic races and two Fastnet races off England.
        Mr. Nye, then 76, his son, Richard, and a grandson, Jonathan, survived the Fastnet race of 1979 in which 19 competitors were killed and 136 had to be rescued after a violent storm struck the fleet of 306 boats, sinking 24.
        Mr. Nye was Commodore at the Indian Harbor Yacht Club in Greenwich and Commodore of the Cruising Club of America.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Nye is survived by his wife, Joan Hunter Nye; two daughters, Edith Nye Jones of Orchard Park, N.Y., and Carolyn Nye Hawe of Lorton, Va.; a sister, Edith Fuchs of Princeton, N.J., 15 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren. Funeral services will be private.
