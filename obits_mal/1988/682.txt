        Timothy S. Mayer, a stage director for resident theaters in Boston and Washington, died of lung cancer in Linlithgo, N.Y., on Saturday. He was 43, and lived in Boston.
        While at a student at Harvard, Mr. Mayer won the Phyllis Anderson award for play writing. He also co-founded, with Thomas Babe, a theater company at the Agassiz theater in Cambridge, Mass.
        In 1984, as associate director of the Boston Shakespeare Company under Peter Sellars, he directed a critically acclaimed revival of Bertolt Brecht's ''Mother Courage,'' starring Linda Hunt in the title role. Frank Rich of The New York Times said the company had ''created an event that has eluded far wealthier and more seasoned American companies - a 'Mother Courage' with bite and without tears.''

        In 1985, Mr. Mayer moved, along with Mr. Sellars, to the American National Theater in Washington, where he staged Shakespeare's ''Henry IV, Part I'' at the Kennedy Center For the Performing Arts.
        A year later, along with the playwright George Trow and with Jacob Brackman, Mr. Mayer and his longtime companion, Donna Cusimano, established the Hudson Valley Theater in Hyde Park, N.Y.
        Mr. Mayer also wrote the book for the musical ''My One and Only,'' and collaborated with James Taylor as the lyricist on Mr. Taylor's most recent album. He also worked with the songwriter Peter Ivers, and with Donald Fagen for a song on the soundtrack of the film ''Bright Lights, Big City.''
        At the time of his death, Mr. Mayer was working on a play about Rip Van Winkle.
        He is survived by his father, J. Gerald Mayer of Falmouth, Mass.
