        Spyros Theotokis, a former Foreign Minister of Greece and the founder of a right-wing party, died of a heart attack here on Tuesday. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Theotokis was appointed Foreign Minister by Prime Minister Constantine Caramanlis in 1955, but resigned the following year in a dispute with Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus over the Mediterranean island's efforts for independence from British rule.
        A lifelong royalist, Mr. Theotokis resigned his seat in Parliament in 1974 after the Greek monarchy was abolished in a referendum.
        With Stefanos Stefanopoulos, also a former Foreign Minister, he founded the right-wing National Front in 1977.
        Mr. Theotokis's father, Yannis, was briefly Prime Minister of a caretaker government in 1935. His grandfather, Georgios, was intermittently Prime Minister between 1899 and 1909.
