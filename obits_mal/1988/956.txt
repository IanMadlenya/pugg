        Dr. Albert C. Johnston, a black radiologist who passed as a white in the 1930's and was the subject of a film ''Lost Boundaries,'' died Thursday at Castle Medical Center, Honolulu, where he was being treated for chest congestion, according to his son, Albert C. Johnston Jr. Dr. Johnston was 87 years old.
        He is to be buried July 9 in Keene, N.H., where his secret was disclosed when the United States Navy refused him a commission in 1940 because he admitted being part-black, his son said. Both Dr. Johnston and his wife were of mixed parentage. Dr. Johnston continued to work in Keene until the mid-1960's. He then moved to Kauai, one of the Hawaiian Islands, where he was a radiologist at G. N. Wilcox Memorial Hospital.
        The story of Dr. Johnston and his family was the subject of a Reader's Digest article in 1947, followed by a book, ''Lost Boundaries,'' by William L. White.
        Dr. Johnston graduated with honors from the University of Chicago's Rush Medical School, with postgraduate work at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston.
        In addition to his namesake, he is survived by his wife, the former Thyra Baumann; two sons, Donald V. of San Diego, and Paul B. of Buzzard's Bay, Mass.; a daughter, Anne Breen of North Granby, Conn.; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
