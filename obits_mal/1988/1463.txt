        James Charles (J. C.) Heard, one of jazz's most recorded and widely traveled drummers, died of a heart attack on Tuesday. He became ill at a friend's home in Southfield, Mich., and was taken to William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., where he died. He was 71 years old and lived in Troy, Mich.
        In 50 years of performing, Mr. Heard played in the bands of Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, Woody Herman, Dizzy Gillespie and others.
        He played with the Jazz at the Philharmonic ensembles of the early 1950's. After a visit to the Far East, Mr. Heard settled in Japan from 1953 to 1957. It was there that he met his wife, Hiroko.
        Mr. Heard also had his own musical groups. At the time of his death, he was leading a 13-piece band that was scheduled to play with Mr. Gillespie this week at the Detroit Institute of Arts.
        Commenting on Mr. Heard's death, Mr. Gillespie said three men wrote the rules for modern jazz drumming: Kenny Clarke, Max Roach and J. C. Heard.
        In an interview, Mr. Heard said: ''Everyone wants to play solos, but who is going to keep the time? That's what the drum is. Basically, it is the driver of the car.''
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Heard is survived by a son, Eric; a brother, David Heard, and a sister, Shirley Jackson, both of Detroit, and two grandchildren.
