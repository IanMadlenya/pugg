        Mr. Fleischman came to the United States from Rumania at the age of 17. After a brief apprenticeship in the fur industry, he started a manufacturing company that dealt in lamb coats from Persia, Afghanistan, China and India.
        At the age of 40, he embarked on a career in the hotel industry, operating and selling hotel properties. In 1957, he built hotels at La Guardia and Idlewild (now Kennedy International) Airports.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Zausner; two sons, Mark and Alan, both of Manhattan, and two granddaughters.
