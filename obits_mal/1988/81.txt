        Hugh J. Schonfield, author of ''The Passover Plot'' and many other books about religion and the Bible, died Tuesday in London. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Schonfield wrote or edited numerous books, some of which were published in the United States. Among them are ''Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' ''The Authentic New Testament'' and ''Readers' A to Z Bible Companion.''
        But his best-known book was ''The Passover Plot,'' which argued that Jesus did not die during the Crucifixion and that a plot to make Jesus appear dead through a drug was upset by a fatal thrust of a Roman soldier's spear.
        The book, which sold some 2 million copies, caused considerable controversy when published in England in 1965, and only slightly less controversy when published in the United States the following year. After the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York protested plans by WCBS radio to present a discussion of the book - on its ''Let's Talk Religion'' series, which was produced by the station in association with the Archdiocese, the Protestant Council of the City of New York and the New York Board of Rabbis - the station canceled the plans.
        ''Those Incredible Christians,'' a sequel to ''The Passover Plot,'' was published in the United States in 1968.
        Mr. Schonfield was born in London and educated at Glasgow University. The slogan by which he lived his life, he said, was: ''Hats off to the past; coats off to the future.''
