        Mr. Borsody was born in Budapest and came to New York in 1907. He worked for the former Radio Corporation of America, now the RCA Corporation, managing the company's communications exhibit at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago.
        While managing the New York City Fire Department's radio system in 1936-42, he designed a network in which the fire houses could keep in touch with one another.
        After World War II, Mr. Borsody worked for the Economic Cooperation Administration as a communications adviser to foreign governments. He was chief engineer for radio navigational aids for the Air Force from 1952 to 1957, and in this post he designed a standard air-traffic control tower for the service.
        Mr. Borody is survived by his wife, Mary; two daughters, Edith Lindbergh-Jones of Brooklyn and Eleanor Battaile of Washington; two sons, Robert, of Larchmont, N.Y., and Frank, of Gainesville, Va.; 23 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.
