        The Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Tekle Haimanot, has died at the age of 70, the Ethiopian press agency reported today.
        It said he died Sunday of an illness, which was not specified.
        He was elected Patriarch, or head of the church, in 1976, two years after the Marxist coup that deposed Emperor Haile Selassie.
        Five years later, he met with Pope John Paul II at the papal residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy. It was the first meeting between the leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church in modern times, and the Pope called it part of a ''common search among all Christians for growth together toward full unity.''
        The Ethiopian Orthodox Church was founded in the year 328, and it is estimated that more than half of Ethiopia's people are adherents.
