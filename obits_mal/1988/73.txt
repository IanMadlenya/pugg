        Anthony T. Courtney, a former intelligence chief whose political career was ruined by scandal when the K.G.B. released photographs of him with a Soviet tour guide in a Moscow hotel, died Sunday afer a short illness, his family said. He was 79 years old.
        He had a distinguished naval career in World War II and was deputy head of the British Naval Mission in Moscow in 1941-42. He headed the Soviet section of British Naval Intelligence from 1946-48, and then was a senior intelligence officer in Germany until 1951.
        He retired from the Navy in 1953 and was elected to the House of Commons in 1959. There, he launched a campaign against the Russians and their Eastern bloc allies, asserting they used diplomatic cover for espionage.
        In August 1965, the K.G.B. released compromising photographs of him and Zina Volkov, a guide with the Soviet Intourist agency.
        The photos, taken without his knowledge four years earlier in a Moscow hotel room, were sent to his wife, to British legislators, to London newspapers and to Conservative Party workers.
        Mr. Courtney is survived by his third wife.
