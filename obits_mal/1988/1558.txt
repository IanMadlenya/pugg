        Joaquin Roces, a prominent newspaper publisher who persuaded Corazon C. Aquino to run for President, died today of complications from cancer, his doctor announced. He was 75 years old.
        The doctor, Cynthia Dominguez, said Mr. Roces was admitted to a hospital Sept. 13 for treatment of a pulmonary infection.
        Mr. Roces, who was known by the nickname Chino, began a campaign in 1985 to persuade a million people to sign a petition asking Mrs. Aquino to run against President Ferdinand E. Marcos in February 1986.
        Mrs. Aquino, the wife of Benigno S. Aquino Jr., the slain opposition leader, at first rejected all suggestions that she run, saying she knew nothing about being President. The signature drive changed her mind, and Mrs. Aquino went on to claim victory in the disputed election Feb. 7, 1986.
        Mr. Roces left journalism in 1972 when Mr. Marcos closed The Manila Times, then the Philippines' largest newspaper, and other news organizations when he imposed martial law.
        The Manila Times resumed publication after Mrs. Aquino took office.
        Mr. Roces came from one of Manila's oldest and wealthiest families. As publisher of The Manila Times, he was among an elite group known as the ''kingmakers'' because of the influence they exerted over officials and politicians.
        Mr, Roces is survived by his wife, Pacita, and two sons, Joaquin Jr., and Edgardo. His daughter, Rocio, died in a landslide in 1984.
