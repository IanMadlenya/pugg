        George Sklar, a playwright and novelist, died of cardiac arrest Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Sklar was a leading figure in the theater of social protest during the Depression, writing several political plays, helping to organize the Theater Union and serving on the board of the Federal Theater Project. He collaborated with Albert Maltz on the play ''Merry-Go-Round,'' about political corruption, and an antiwar drama, ''Peace on Earth.'' With Paul Peters, Mr. Sklar wrote a satirical revue called ''Parade,'' and ''Stevedore,'' which Brooks Atkinson described as ''comic, brutish, hysterical and defiant.''
        Mr. Sklar spent the early 1940's in Hollywood writing screenplays, and collaborated with Vera Caspary on the 1947 Broadway adaptation of ''Laura.'' A victim of anti-Communist blacklisting, he began writing novels in the late 1940's. His first, ''The Two Worlds of Johnny Truro'' became a best seller that was made into a movie. His other novels were ''The Promising Young Men,'' ''The Housewarming'' and ''The Identity of Dr. Frazier.''
        Mr. Sklar returned to playwriting in the mid-1960's with ''And People All Around,'' about the killing of three civil-rights workers, and a 1972 environmentalist work called ''Brown Pelican.''
        He is survived by a daughter, Judith Rasminsky, of Montreal; two sons, Daniel and Zachary, of New York; a brother, Nathan, of Palm City, Fla., and two grandchildren.
