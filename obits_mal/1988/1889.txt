        Mr. Mundia, envoy to Brazil, Peru and Venezuela as well as to Washington, had presented his credentials to President Victor Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia here Friday and was attending a diplomatic function late Monday night when he collapsed.
        He is survived by his wife and six children. His body was to be flown to Washington later this week.
