        Alan K. Browne, a retired bank official and an authority on tax-exempt bond issues, died of congestive heart failure Saturday at his home in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Browne was senior vice president in charge of the investment securities division of the Bank of America when he retired abruptly in 1971 after raising more than $10 billion for the bank's clients since the end of World War II.
        He criticized the bank as abandoning a public service role for what he saw as an undue emphasis on profitability, a charge that was denied by the bank's management even as his departure was regretted.
        Mr. Browne, a native of Alameda, Calif., joined the bank in 1929. He was a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley.
        Active in civic affairs, he was chairman of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit Commission in the years the rail system was built and was president of San Francisco Stadium, Inc., which built Candlestick Park.
        Mr. Browne is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Henrotte.
