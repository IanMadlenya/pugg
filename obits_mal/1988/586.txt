        As a youth, Mr. Knowles went to sea for several years as a merchant marine radio operator. He then studied physics, mathematics and engineering at Columbia University, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1928. While at Columbia he was an editor for Popular Radio magazine and an associate radio editor of The New York Herald Tribune.
        His first wife, Josephine, died in 1969. He is survived by his second wife, Nancy; a son, James, of Elgin, Ill.; two daughters, Margaret Schink of Portola Valley, Calif., and Katherine Strasburg of Woodside, Calif.; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
