        Vincenzo Celli, a former principal dancer and choreographer at La Scala Opera House in Milan and a dance teacher whose pupils included Alicia Markova and Jerome Robbins, died Sunday at Greenwich Hospital after a heart attack. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Celli, born Vincenzo Yacullo on May 4, 1900, in Salerno, Italy, immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1904.
        As a 14-year-old usher in a Chicago theater, he saw Nijinsky dance with the Diaghilev Company and was inspired. ''I didn't know what it was,'' he once said in an interview, ''but I knew it was great.''
        Mr. Celli was an actor with the Washington Square Players in New York City, appearing on and off Broadway, before beginning his dance career in 1918. The choreographer Adolph Bolm spotted him in a performance of Oscar Wilde's ''Salome'' and asked if he would do a mime role in a ballet production based on ''Le Coq d'Or'' by Rimsky-Korsakov at the Metropolitan Opera House.
        Shortly thereafter, Mr. Celli moved to Italy, where he eventually undertook six years of study with the ballet master Enrico Cecchetti, the teacher of Nijinsky and Pavlova.
        In 1925 he married an American opera singer, Marion Ivell.
        He made his debut at La Scala in 1926 in ''Petrouchka'' and was named balletmaster in 1929, a post he held 12 years.
        Mr. Celli left La Scala during the rise of Fascism and moved to New York, where he opened a studio and taught ballet for 40 years. His other pupils included Anton Dolin, Royes Fernandez and Agnes De Mille.
        Survivors include four nieces and four nephews.
