Mr. Herzer had served in that capacity for many shows produced by Emanuel Azenberg, including Mr. Simon's recent works as well as Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing'' and the 1986 revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' Mr. Herzer also had been a guest lecturer at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.
