        The Rev. Gerald E. Knoff, who served for 20 years as associate general secretary of the National Council of Churches, died of cardiac arrest Friday at the Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. He was 80 years old and lived in East Sandwich, Mass.
        Mr. Knoff was credited with a major role in propagating the Revised Standard Version of the Holy Bible and in obtaining its acceptance among Protestant, Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians. The Revised Standard Version, intended to replace the King James version, has become the best-selling American Bible ever published, with more than 45.5 million copies sold.
        Mr. Knoff was in charge of Christian education for the Council of Churches, the principal umbrella organization for Protestant and Eastern Orthodox church bodies in the United States, from 1952 until 1972.
        Born in Madison Lake, Minn., he was a graduate of Florida Southern College and received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees in divinity from Yale. After serving as minister in Methodist churches in Connecticut, he held administrative and pastoral posts in Iowa and Illinois before joining the staff of the Council of Churches.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Dorothy Mann Cooper, and three children, William C. Knoff of South Burlington, Vt., Elizabeth K. Mayers of Bedford, N.H., and Sarah Bystrom of Denver.
