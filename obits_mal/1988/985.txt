        Bishop Fred G. Holloway, the first bishop of the West Virginia Area of the Methodist Church, died here Wednesday after a long illness. He was 90 years old.
        The Methodist churches in West Virginia, most of which were in rural areas, were under the jurisdiction of Pittsburgh until 1960 when the national church voted to make West Virginia a separate area. There were 200,000 Methodists in the state when Mr. Holloway was named bishop.
        In February 1965, Mr. Holloway announced that the 1,600 white Methodist churches and the 25 Negro Methodist churches in West Virginia would be united under a common administration. West Virginia was one of the first states to make the plans public to combine the two groups.
        Mr. Holloway retired as bishop in 1968, the same year his church merged with the Evangelical United Brethren Church to become the United Methodist Church.
        He was born in Newark and graduated from Western Maryland College in 1918. He attended Westminster Theological Seminary in 1918 and 1919 and graduated from Drew University in Maryland in 1921.
        His first church assignment was in Wilmington and he served in Baltimore and Cherrydale, Va.
        Mr. Holloway also served as president of Western Maryland College from 1935 to 1947 and president of Drew University from 1947 to 1960.
