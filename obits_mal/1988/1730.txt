        Charles J. McCarthy, an aircraft designer and pioneer in the development of naval aircraft, died of heart failure Thursday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. McCarthy, a 1916 graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, began his career at the outbreak of World War I as an aeronautical draftsman for the Navy and for the next 40 years was involved in aircraft design.
        In 1926, he joined Chance Vought, a subsidiary of United Aircraft Corporation, and rose to become chairman of Chance Vought in 1954. He retired in 1960 and later headed the Flight Safety Foundation, a group that seeks to advance the cause of air safety.
        Mr. McCarthy worked on early amphibious aircraft and managed the design of the F4U Corsair, a fighter plane used in World War II. In 1957 he was awarded the Collier Trophy for the design and development of the F-8 Crusader, a jet fighter used aboard Navy carriers in the 1950's and 60's.
        There are no immediate survivors.
