        Ronald K. Sherman, president of the New York City advertising agency of Calet, Hirsch & Spector Inc., died of cancer Saturday at New York University Medical Center. He was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Before becoming the agency's president last year, Mr. Sherman was vice chairman of the Wells Rich Greene advertising agency, where he had been an executive since 1982.
        Mr. Sherman, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Princeton University and spent most of his career at the J. Walter Thompson Company, which he joined in 1956. He had a master's degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Business.
        He switched from advertising to public relations in 1960 but returned to the Thompson agency four years later, where he remained until he joined Wells Rich Green.
        He is survived by his wife, Wendy; a son, Derek, and a daughter, Samantha, both of Manhattan; and his mother, Sylvia, and a sister, Madeleine Ferris, both of Houston.
