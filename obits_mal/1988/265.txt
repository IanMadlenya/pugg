        John Guinness, an Irish banker and a cousin of the Guinness brewing family, was fatally injured today in a 500-foot fall on Snowdon Mountain in northern Wales, the police reported. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Guinness, chairman of the Dublin merchant bank Guinness and Mahon, was climbing with his wife, Jennifer, their son, Ian, and three friends. Two years ago, Mrs. Guinness was kidnapped and held captive for eight days, an affair that drew worldwide attention.
        Mr. Guinness fell from the snow-covered path as he and others descended from the summit of the 3,560-foot mountain, the police said. He was taken by Royal Air Force helicopter to a hospital in Bangor, 10 miles away, but he had already died.
        Mrs. Guinness, 49, was kidnapped from the family home near Dublin on April 8, 1986, and held for $2.6 million ransom. Eight days later, the police stormed a hideout and freed her without payment of the ransom. Three abductors surrendered and three other people were arrested later.
        On the day of the abduction, Mr. Guinness returned home from work to find his wife and a daughter, Gillian, tied up. The abductors struck him and tied him up. Two and a half hours after they fled he freed himself and called the police.
        Mr. Guinness was the sixth cousin of the Earl of Iveagh, chairman of the brewery that bears the family name.
