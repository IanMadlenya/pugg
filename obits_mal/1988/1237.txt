        Hal M. Freeman, who resigned as manager of the Department of Health and Human Services' regional Office of Civil Rights here two years ago in protest of the department's policy toward AIDS victims, died of the disease July 30. He was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.
        Mr. Freeman's protest was aimed at the Government's declining to extend to people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome the provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which bars discrimination against the handicapped by organizations receiving Federal funds.
        As a result of the wide attention given his resignation, and Congressional hearings that resulted from it, the Government later widened its enforcement of the law to include bias against AIDS victims. Subsequent Federal court rulings have further broadened the law's application, extending it to carriers of the AIDS virus who are not actually suffering from the disease.
        Mr. Freeman was born April 19, 1936, in Oklahoma City. He earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from Northwestern University in 1957 and a master's in clinical psychology from the Professional School of Psychology in San Francisco in 1984. He had a private practice as a psychotherapist and counselor.
        Mr. Freeman's longtime companion was Michael S. Macpherson of San Francisco. He is survived by two sons, Brad Freeman of Albany, Calif., and Troy Freeman of San Diego.
