        Christopher Gore, a writer who was nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay of ''Fame,'' died Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 45 years old.
        His mother, Bettylou Gore, said the cause of death was cancer.
        Mr. Gore began writing plays and musicals shortly after graduating from Northwestern University, and one of his first works, ''Mary,'' a musical about Mary Queen of Scots, was produced in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in 1967. His first Broadway production was ''Via Galactica,'' a 1972 science-fiction rock musical that Mr. Gore wrote with Judith Ross and Galt MacDermot. He also wrote the book and lyrics for ''Nefertiti,'' a 1977 work about the ancient Egyptian queen.
        Mr. Gore wrote the screenplay for ''Fame,'' the 1980 film about students at New York's High School of Performing Arts. He received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay written directly for the screen. The movie's success resulted in a television series, for which Mr. Gore wrote several scripts.
        Mr. Gore is survived by his mother, of Fort Lauderdale, and three brothers, David and Lawrence, both of Fort Lauderdale, and Richard, of Washington.
