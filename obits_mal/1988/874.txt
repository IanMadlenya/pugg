        Mr. Keuls, a native of the Netherlands, was best known for the invention of an adhesive used to hold the glass panels in place in the ceiling of the Lincoln Tunnel. Among his other creations was a window ventilator called Vaned-air that operated without electricity.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Thais Kluge; a stepson, Peter Holzer of Rumson, N.J., and a stepdaughter, Ann Van Cott of Venice, Fla.
