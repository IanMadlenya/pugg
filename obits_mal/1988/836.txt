        R. D. Darrell, a music critic and author who was one of the first American critics to concentrate primarily on recordings, died on Sunday at Kingston Hospital after suffering a stroke earlier in the week. He was 84 years old, and lived in Stone Ridge, N.Y.
        The author of several reference books on music and recordings that were considered definitive in their time - among them, ''The Gramophone Shop Encyclopedia of Recorded Music'' (1936), the first comprehensive discography published in the United States; ''The High Road to Musical Enjoyment'' (1943), ''The Schirmer's Guide to Books on Music and Musicians'' (1951) and ''Good Listening'' (1953) - Mr. Darrell wrote with enthusiasm and authority about a wide range of musical topics.
        His primary interest was the classics, which he reviewed for numerous publications including Saturday Review, High Fidelity (where he was a columnist from 1954 through 1987) and most recently, Opus. Early in his career he also wrote about jazz. His article ''Black Beauty,'' published in ''Disques'' in 1932, was the first in-depth study of Duke Ellington's music.
        Robert Donaldson Darrell was born in Newton Center, Mass., in 1903, and studied music at Harvard College and the New England Conservatory until 1926. In 1927, he and Axel B. Johnson founded the Phonograph Monthly Review, for which Mr. Darrell was the sole critic, and frequently wrote under pseudonyms. In 1932, he and Mr. Johnson founded a second magazine, Music Lovers' Guide.
        Mr. Darrell is survived by a sister, Josephine Darrell Holmes of Stone Ridge.
