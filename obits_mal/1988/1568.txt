        Dr. Frederic Ewen, an author, lecturer and former English professor at Brooklyn College, died of a heart attack yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In 1940 Dr. Ewen was one of seven teachers who refused to testify before a New York State legislative panel, known as the Rapp-Coudert committee, that was investigating allegations of subversive activities in the city's public schools and colleges. At the time Dr. Ewen said that the decision to investigate the educational system ''is actually an attack on the things that the system stands for and has fought in the last 20 years to obtain.''
        He remained on the Brooklyn College faculty until his retirement in 1952. A chair has been established in his name at the college for an annual lecture series on civil rights.
        Later he lectured on literature and drama and wrote a dramatic adaptation of James Joyce's ''Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,'' that was produced in Manhattan in 1962.
        He wrote several books on literary figures. This month ''The Collected Short Stories of Maxim Gorky,'' with an introduction by Dr. Ewen, was published by Citadel Press.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Miriam Gideon, a composer; a son, Joel, of Roanoke, Va.; a brother, Louis, of Miami, and three grandsons.
