        Louis G. Seaton, chief bargainer for the General Motors Corporation in the early years of contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers, died Thursday at Sarasota (Fla.) Memorial Hospital. Mr. Seaton, who suffered a stroke four days earlier, was 81 years old and lived in Sarasota.
        Mr. Seaton retired in 1970 after 42 years with G.M., where he became the automobile industry's dean of management negotiators. A native of Detroit and a graduate of Wayne State University there, he joined the company in 1928 as a graphic artist and four years later was transferred to the industrial relations department.
        Mr. Seaton worked behind the scenes to help resolve the union's sitdown strikes of 1936 and 1937, and later served as G.M.'s first representative in arbitration hearings. In 1946 he became director of labor relations, and in 1957 was named a vice president.
        Union negotiators came to regard Mr. Seaton as the most capable and toughest management representative they faced across the bargaining table. Although he spoke with directness, even a bluntness that sometimes surprised his adversaries, he was known for keeping his composure and for having an almost encyclopedic knowledge of plant problems, contract terms, labor laws and the policies of the union.
        Mr. Seaton is survived by his wife, Kathleen; a daughter, Ann Swartwout of Birmingham, Mich.; a son, John, of Orchard Lake, Mich.; 3 brothers; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
