        Mr. Feinberg, who prospered as a fuel-oil distributor in Detroit, began his Whitman collection in 1919 and continued to add many letters, manuscripts and books. He frequently lectured on Whitman at universities around the country. Mr. Feinberg, an honorary vice president of the American Friends of Hebrew University for 30 years, received the S. Y. Agnon Gold Medal this year for intellectual achievement from Hebrew University.
        He is survived by his wife, Lenore, of Detroit; a son, Bartley, of Las Vegas, and two daughters, Judith Kuehne, of London, and Suzanne Ness, of Jerusalem.
