        Mr. Martelli was born in Beverly, Mass., and attended Texas A & M and Loyola Universities as well as several Catholic seminaries before coming to New York in the early 1960's to work as an editor and writer. He was the author of several elementary-school social-studies textbooks and was editorial director of McGraw-Hill's elementary and high-school book division for more than a decade. His book about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, written with Fran D. Peltz and William Messina, was published by Crown Publishers last year.
        Mr. Martelli is survived by his parents, Armando and Helen Martelli, of Dallas, and two brothers, Peter, of Waco, Tex., and Mark, of Dallas.
