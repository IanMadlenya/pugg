        Jean-Pierre Stirbois, the second-ranking official in France's far-right National Front, was killed in an automobile accident Friday night, the police said today. He was 43 years old.
        Mr. Stirbois, who was driving alone, missed a turn and crashed into a tree after leaving a political rally in Dreux for Paris, the police said. He held the post of Deputy Mayor in Dreux.
        Mr. Stirbois's death was a major blow for the National Front, which is led by Jean-Marie Le Pen. The party is struggling to recover from a poor showing in local elections last month and bitter internal disputes.
        As Secretary General of the National Front and a trusted confidant of Mr. Le Pen's, Mr. Stirbois played a decisive role in forming the party's anti-tax, anti-immigrant policies.
