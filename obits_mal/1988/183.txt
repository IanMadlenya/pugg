        Gardner Cox, an artist known for his portraits of prominent Americans, died of heart failure on Thursday in a hospital in Cambridge, Mass., his city of residence. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Cox painted several members of the Supreme Court, including Earl Warren, Felix Frankfurter, Potter Stewart and Byron R. White. Among his other subjects were the poet Robert Frost and Government figures including Robert F. Kennedy, Dean Acheson and Dean Rusk, as well as businessmen and educators.
        In 1978, his portrait of Henry A. Kissinger, commissioned for exhibition in the State Department, created a stir when it was rejected on the ground that it ''didn't quite capture'' Mr. Kissinger. The artist said he understood the real reason was that Mr. Kissinger objected to it.
        Mr. Cox was born in Holyoke, Mass. He graduated from Harvard University and studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Museum School.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Phyllis Byrne; two sons, Benjamin, of London, and James B., of Cambridge; a daughter, Poppy Koch of Boulder, Colo., and a grandson.
