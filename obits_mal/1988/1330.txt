        Alan Napier, a character actor in England and the United States for more than 50 years, and best known for his role in the ''Batman'' television series of the 1960's, died of pneumonia yesterday in the Berkeley East Convalescent Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 85 years old.
        A nursing supervisor at the hospital, Naseem Chunara, said Mr. Napier suffered a stroke last year and been ill for several days.
        The tall, elegant actor, whose original name was Alan Napier-Clavering, was born in Birmingham, England. His long career began in England's Oxford Repertory and went on to include stage and film roles in Shakespearean tragedies. Mr. Napier, who was a cousin of Neville Chamberlain, England's prime minister from 1937 to 1940, immigrated to the United States in 1939, and made more than 50 films here. They include ''The House of the Seven Gables'' (1940), ''The Invisible Man Returns'' (1940), ''Cat People'' (1942), ''Appointment in Berlin'' (1943), ''Lassie Come Home'' (1943), ''The Hairy Ape'' (1944), ''Hangover Square'' (1945), ''Ministry of Fear'' (1945), ''Three Strangers'' (1946), ''Forever Amber'' (1947), ''Young Bess'' (1953), ''Julius Caesar'' (1953) and ''Journey to the Center of the Earth'' (1959).
        In perhaps his most popular portrayal, Mr. Napier starred as Alfred Pennyworth, the dutiful butler and assistant in the American television series ''Batman,'' which was broadcast from January 1966 to March 1968.
        His stage credits include ''Coriolanus'' (1954) and ''Too Late the Phalarope'' (1956).
        Mr. Napier is survived by his daughters, Jennifer Raine Bissell of Los Angeles, and Jennifer Nichols of East Haddam, Conn.
