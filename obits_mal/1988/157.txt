        Mr. Bauduc played with the Dorsey Brothers in a group called the Wild Canaries and later joined Bob Crosby's Bobcats. During World War II, he performed with an elite Army band that was flown to various military bases. Along with a fellow member of the Bobcats, the bassist Bob Haggart, he wrote ''South Rampart Street Parade'' and ''Big Noise From Winnetka,'' both of which sold millions of copies.
