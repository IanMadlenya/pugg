        The nature of his illness was not disclosed.
        Mr. Bozzuffi, who played in about 30 films over 20 years, perfected his bad-guy image in secondary roles. One of the most notable was that of a crazed killer in ''The French Connection,'' in which he terrorized a New York subway car with Gene Hackman in hot pursuit.
        Mr. Bozzuffi, born in Brittany of Italian parents, began his film career in 1955 at the age of 26, playing a truck driver in the Gilles Grangier movie ''Gas-Oil,'' with Jean Gabin and Jeanne Moreau.
        In 1968, he played a homosexual killer in Costa-Gavras's movie ''Z'' and, in a rare move to the other side of the law, a police inspector in Claude Lelouch's ''La Vie, l'Amour, la Mort'' (Life, Love, Death).
        In 1969, he co-directed the film ''L'Americain'' (''The American'') with Mr. Lelouch. It starred Simone Signoret, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Francoise Fabian.
        In later years, he wrote scripts and directed films for television.
