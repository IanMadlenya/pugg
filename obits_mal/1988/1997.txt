        Robert Kingsley, a recently retired California appeals court judge and former dean of the University of Southern California law school who opposed capital punishment through most of his career, died here Sunday. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Kingsley became dean of the law school in 1952 and held the post for 11 years until Gov. Edmund G. Brown Sr named him to the appellate bench.
        As chairman of the southern section of Californians Against Capital Punishment in the 1950's and 1960's, Mr. Kingsley was among the state's leaders in the effort to ban the death penalty. The California Supreme Court voted in 1972 to abolish capital punishment.
