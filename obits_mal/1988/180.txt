        David Bromberg, a lawyer who was a member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, an agency that investigates complaints against judges, died of a heart attack Thursday in Grand Central Terminal after a day of hearings at the commission. He was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bromberg was a partner in the Manhattan law firm Epstein, Becker & Green. He was an arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association.
        He was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1967, where he was the lone dissenter in votes on three taxation restrictions that prevent the Legislature from imposing levies in certain areas. Mr. Bromberg contended that the only purpose in retaining the provisions was ''to satisfy the irrational fears of some members of the business community.''
        He also asked the convention to adopt a ''human bill of rights'' to declare, among other things, that there be decent housing available, that no person lack food, clothing and other necessities and that no person lack proper medical care.
        A Democrat, he was active in state politics and was a former counsel to the New York State Senate Mental Health Commission.
        Mr. Bromberg was born in the Bronx and was a graduate of Townsend Harris High School, City College and Yale University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Eleanor Mallach-Bromberg; his mother, Sara Bromberg of the Bronx; a brother, Herbert, of Worcester, Mass., a son, Matthew, of Manhattan, and a daughter, Emily, of Albany.
