        Ramon Simpas Subejano, a native of the Philippines who became a highly decorated United States war veteran, died after a brief illness Friday at a Veterans Administration hospital here. He was 83 years old, said a close friend, Al Livingston.
        Mr. Subejano left the Philippines for the United States in 1927 by stowing away on a freighter. He was a merchant seaman, traveling to most ports of the world, before he bought a pool hall with $32,000 that he won in a casino.
        Mr. Subejano lost all his money in the Depression, and had to work as a busboy. He was drafted into the Army in 1942 and was sent to Europe, where he was credited with killing more than 400 German soldiers from Normandy to the Rhineland.
        Mr. Subejano was wounded four times, including once by bayonet, and came home disabled.
        He was awarded the Silver Star for his single-handed capture of a factory near Dillingen, Germany. According to his service record, he crept into the factory amid heavy machine gunfire and exploding grenades. He killed 5 German soldiers, wounded 6 and forced 37 others to surrender.
        He was also a holder of the Purple Heart for his wounds and was decorated by the French, Dutch and Belgian governments. Memorial service and plans for Mr. Subejano's burial were pending.
