        Michael Ffolkes, a cartoonist whose work appeared for decades in Punch and major American publications, died Oct. 18 in a London hospital. He had acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis of the liver.
        He was 63 years old and lived in London with Elfa Kramers, his longtime companion.
        The cartoonist drew firm, snaky line drawings of craggy, usually bemused or predatory characters, often bishops, roues, dowagers and lightly clad chorus girls. The tone was irreverent and sometimes manic.
        Mr. Ffolkes, whose real name was Brian Davis, was born in London. He studied at Leigh Hall College in Essex and St. Martin's School of Art in London. He chose the pseudonym Ffolkes out of Burke's Peerage, telling colleagues with typical wryness that it connoted illegitimacy.
        His cartoons in Punch, in which he regularly illustrated film reviews, and in more than 50 books and The New Yorker, Playboy and The Reader's Digest, favored literary and historical allusions. Bud Handelsman, a cartoonist friend, quoted Mr. Ffolkes yesterday as having remarked, ''I don't care what century I'm living in.'' Arnold Roth, another cartoonist friend, decribed Mr. Ffolkes's approach as ''anachronistic, sophisticated, yet simple'' with a stress on ''19th-century fiction, poetry and music.''
        Mr. Ffolkes is survived by two sons, Paul and Oliver, and a daughter, Louisa, all of London.
