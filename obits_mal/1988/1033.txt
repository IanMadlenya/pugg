        Gerardus Wiarda, a Dutch jurist who was president of the European Court for Human Rights, died at his home here on Saturday, a relative said today. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Wiarda had been in ill health for the last few years, the relative said.
        Born in Amsterdam in 1906, Mr. Wiarda finished his legal studies at Amsterdam's Municipal University in 1929.
        After practicing law in Rotterdam and serving as a judge at Amsterdam's district court, Mr. Wiarda was appointed a member of the Dutch Supreme Court in 1950.
        During his 26-year tenure there, the last four of which he served as the court's president, Mr. Wiarda earned a reputation as a progressive jurist on social and judicial issues.
        After his retirement in 1976, he was appointed as a judge at the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. In 1981 he was named president of the 18-member human rights panel for the 21-nation Council of Europe.
