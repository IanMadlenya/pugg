        S. Dudley Nostrand, a well-known real-estate broker in Manhattan, died Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital after a long illness. He was 88 years old and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.
        Mr. Nostrand, the former president and chairman of the Cross & Brown Company, had been in the real-estate business for more than 60 years. He was a specialist in assembling land for large office buildings and had sold some of New York City's leading properties, including the Mayflower Hotel and the Ritz Carlton Hotel.
        In 1950, the Real Estate Board of New York gave him ''The Most Ingenious Deal of the Year'' award for leasing the land on which the Lever Brothers building, at 390 Park Avenue between 53d and 54th Streets, was built. He was co-recipient of the same award last year for the sale of the Saks leasehold to the Swiss Bank Corporation for the construction of a 40-story office tower on Fifth Avenue at 50th Street.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene Gough Nostrand; two sons, S. Dudley Jr. of Miami Beach, Fla., and Robert of Denver, and a grandchild.
