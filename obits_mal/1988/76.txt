        Lorenzo J. Greene, a retired professor at Lincoln University professor who was an authority on the history of blacks in America, died Sunday. He was 88.
        Mr. Greene, who had lived in Jefferson City for 52 years, was a graduate of Howard University and earned a doctorate from Columbia University in 1942. He was an early leader in the civil rights movement in Missouri, having worked to desegregate hotels in St. Louis and housing in Jefferson City.
        President Hoover named him to the Commission on Negro Housing in 1931, and in the late 1950's he campaigned for the establishment of the Missouri Human Rights Commission.
        Mr. Greene was on the faculty at Lincoln University for 39 years, and was chairman of the social science department. He retired in 1972.
        He was co-author of nine books and of many scholarly articles on topics ranging from blacks in colonial America to the Civil War to desegregation of public schools in Missouri.
        He is survived by his wife, Thomasina; a son, Lorenzo Thomas Greene, of Jefferson City, and a sister, Careatha Anderson, of New Haven.
