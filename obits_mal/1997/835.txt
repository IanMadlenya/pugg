        Mario Pittoni, who served for 25 years as a justice of New York State Supreme Court, the first Democrat to be elected to that post on Long Island, died on Sunday at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, N.Y. He was 90 and lived in Lynbrook, N.Y.
        Justice Pittoni, a former prosecutor and briefly the Nassau County Democratic chairman, was appointed to the state bench in 1957 by Gov. W. Averell Harriman. Later that year, Justice Pittoni, running on the Democratic and Liberal tickets, beat his Republican opponent, Representative Henry J. Latham, in the 10th Judicial District, covering Suffolk and Nassau Counties and Queens.
        He was born in New York City. He graduated from Cornell University and received law degrees from Harvard Law School and New York University before going into private practice in Mineola, N.Y., in 1938. Early in his career, he was an assistant United States attorney in Brooklyn for 10 years and headed the Criminal Division in the late 1940's.
        After a stint as a consultant, he was named First Deputy State Commissioner of Commerce in 1955. Mr. Harriman recruited him for an interim appointment as a Nassau County judge in 1956, but he lost an election to keep the job that November.
        He resigned as county Democratic leader the next May, when the Governor named him to the state bench. In his tenure on the state court, he served for several years as a justice of the Appellate Term in Nassau.
        Over the years, he served on the State Law Revision Commission and State Constitutional Convention. He also taught at Brooklyn Law School.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Grace Henjes Pittoni; a daughter, Sue Coan of Bedford, N.Y.; two sons, John, of Garden City, N.Y., and Luke, of Stamford, Conn.; 13 grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
