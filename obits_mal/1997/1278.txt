        Bert Wechsler, a dance and music critic, died on Nov. 30 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said Jonathan Slaff, a colleague.
        Mr. Wechsler was an actor and singer before he went on to full-time writing, working for eight years during the 1980's as the editor of Music Journal. He wrote about dance and music for newspapers and magazines including The New York Daily News, New York Concert Review, Attitude, Video Review and High Fidelity.
        Mr. Wechsler was also an editor of High Performance Review and Computer Buyers' Guide, and was a founding critic and reporter for the New York Theater Wire, an Internet-based theater news service on the World Wide Web. He also wrote ''Dear Rogue,'' a biography of the opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, with Hertzel Weinstat.
        He is survived by his mother, Miriam Pullan Wechsler of Manhattan.
