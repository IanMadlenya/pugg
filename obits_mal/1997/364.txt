        Harold H. Melnick, an expert in retirement benefits who was president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in the New York City Police Department for more than 20 years, died on March 16 at Hospice on the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 75 and had recently moved to Florida from Forest Hills, Queens.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Melnick was the association president from 1961 until his retirement from the police force in 1982. He was concurrently the chairman of the department's Superior Officers Council and a trustee of the Police Pension Fund, with assets totaling more than $2.5 billion.
        From 1982 until 10 years ago, he was chairman of the welfare fund of a city employees' union, Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and executive assistant to Barry Feinstein, the local's president. Local 237 is the largest teamsters' local in the area, representing 24,000 government workers in New York City and on Long Island.
        He was also a charter member of the Municipal Unions/Financial Leaders Group, a consortium of labor leaders, bankers and financial consultants. Recognized nationally for his expertise in health, welfare and pension plans, he was a past president and chairman of the International Foundation of Employee Benefits Plans.
        Mr. Melnick, who was born in the Bronx, joined the police force in 1945 after wartime service in the Army.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, June Pollack Melnick; two daughters, Arlene Glassman of Rosyln, L.I., and Nancy Wiener of Fairfield, Conn.; a brother, Sidney, of Palm Springs, Calif., and four grandsons.
