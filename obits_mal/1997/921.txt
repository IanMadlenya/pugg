        DeWitt Peterkin Jr., a former vice chairman and director of J. P. Morgan & Company, died last Friday at Waveny Care Center in New Canaan, Conn. He was 84.
        The cause of death was heart failure and complications from Parkinson's disease, his wife, Katharine, said.
        Mr. Peterkin, a resident of Darien, Conn., worked at the investment bank for his entire career. He joined the firm, then a private commercial bank, in 1937, and rose to become a vice president by 1953.
        In 1959, J. P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. Mr. Peterkin was named senior vice president of the new company in 1963 and executive vice president two years later.
        He served as vice chairman of J. P. Morgan & Company, a holding company formed in 1969, from 1971 until his retirement in 1976. Mr. Peterkin remained a trustee at Morgan and served on its directors advisory council until his death. He also served on the boards of several companies and nonprofit organizations during his career.
        Mr. Peterkin, who was born in Missouri, graduated from Yale University in 1937. During World War II, he served with the Navy.
        Mr. Peterkin is survived by his wife; two daughters, Clare McDermott of Ponte Vedra, Fla., and Kate Peterkin of Fort Collins, Colo.; three sons, DeWitt 3d of Berlin, N.J., and George and Patrick, both of Darien, and three grandchildren.
