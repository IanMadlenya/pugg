        Edwin W. Rawlings, a four-star general who became a top executive at General Mills after retiring from the Air Force, died on Dec. 8 in a nursing home in Auburn, Wash. He was 93.
        General Rawlings joined General Mills, which makes cereals, snack foods, yogurt and baking products, as a vice president for finance in 1959. He was named president in 1961, and chairman and chief executive in 1967. While he was president and chief executive, the company sold half its flour mills and an unprofitable electronics unit, while emphasizing name-brand lines like Cheerios, Gold Medal and Betty Crocker.
        General Mills also began buying other companies, acquiring Kenner Products, a toy company, in 1967, and Parker Brothers toys, Gorton's seafood and Monet costume jewelry the following year. General Rawlings retired as chairman and chief executive in 1969, but remained on the board through 1976. General Mills continued its expansion, buying Red Lobster restaurants in 1970, Eddie Bauer clothing in 1971 and Yoplait yogurt in 1977. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, the company moved into European markets, and sold its nonfood businesses.
        General Rawlings graduated from Hamline University in St. Paul in 1927 with a degree in economics and received a master's degree in industrial management in 1939 from the Harvard Business School. He joined the Flying Cadets, a reserve unit in 1929, and received his commission the following year. He stayed in the Army Air Corps, and then the Air Force for 31 years, rising to the rank of Air Force brigadier general in 1945 and four-star general in 1954.
        During World War II, General Rawlings was responsible for supplies and materials to meet aircraft production schedules. General Rawlings brought the armed services into the computer age at the end of World War II, and mirrored this accomplishment in academia when he helped establish the first undergraduate computer literacy program, at Hamline in the late 1960's.
        Starting in 1951, General Rawlings was in charge of buying and maintaining the entire aircraft fleet and its equipment for the Air Force, a position involving thousands of aircraft and billions of dollars annually.
        General Rawlings is survived by four sons, Peter E., of Williamsburg, Va.; Charles F., of Bellevue, Wash.; Richard W., of Minneapolis, and John F., of Seattle; his sister, Marcella Engerbretson of Tracy, Minn., and eight grandchildren. His first wife, Muriel Peterson, died in 1983, and his second wife, Kathryn Fradkin, died in 1990.
