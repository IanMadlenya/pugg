        Raymond L. Spangler, a newspaper publisher and a former president of a national journalist organization, died on Sept. 21 at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, Calif. He was 93 and lived in Redwood City.
        Mr. Spangler was the president of Sigma Delta Chi, the national journalism organization that is now known as the Society of Professional Journalists, for a one-year term starting in 1965. He led an effort to grant women journalists full membership in the group, a status they acquired in 1969.
        ''There were a group of men who were very opposed to women becoming members and they blocked all discussion,'' Nita Spangler, Mr. Spangler's wife, said. ''Raymond brought the issue to the convention floor for discussion and advocated it.''
        Mr. Spangler also served on the board of The Associated Press from 1951 to 1961. He was the publisher of The Redwood City Tribune, which is now defunct, from 1945 until his retirement in 1970.
        Mr. Spangler graduated from Stanford University in 1925 and served in the Army from 1940 to 1941.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mary Spangler of Redwood City; two sons, John of Palo Alto, Calif., and Thor of Albuquerque, N.M., and five grandchildren.
