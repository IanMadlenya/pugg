        Wolcott Balestier Dunham, a cancer specialist whose research over more than six decades advanced the treatment of several infectious diseases, died on June 22 at a nursing home in Towson, Md., near Baltimore. He was 97.
        Dr. Dunham, who published his final research paper at 95, was last associated with the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto, Calif. He retired as a senior resident scientist in 1993 and moved back East the following year.
        His work involved penicillin therapy, infectious hepatitis, syphilis, the viral clumping of red blood cells, tissue culture techniques and antibodies to fight ulcerated abdominal infections. His last research project focused on a severe nervous disorder suffered by villagers in Bangladesh, India and Ethiopia. The victims are felled by a toxin in a pea they eat. Working with guinea pigs, Dr. Dunham and his colleagues established that a dollop of vitamin C added to their diet protected against the toxin, and that doses of the vitamin at the onset of paralysis would reverse it.
        Born in Boston, Dr. Dunham graduated from Columbia College and, in 1928, from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. He spent the early part of his career at Columbia's New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital, where he investigated the properties of penicillin in World War II before it became available for civilian use.
        He later worked at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research, the Veterans Administration Hospital in Memphis and the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Me.
        Dr. Dunham's wife of 56 years, Isabel Bosworth Dunham, died in  September. He is survived by a son, Wolcott B. Dunham 3d of Manhattan; a daughter, Anne D. Ewart of Syracuse; two sisters, Beatrice Dunham of Manhattan and Josephine Dunham of Concord, Mass., and four grandchildren.
