        Arthur S. Kling, a California psychiatrist who was an expert on the brain functions linked to emotions and social behavior, died on March 28 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 67.
        The apparent cause was pneumonia, after a long struggle with cancer, according to the University of California at Los Angeles, where Dr. Kling was professor emeritus and former vice chairman of psychiatry in the School of Medicine.
        At his death Dr. Kling was chief of psychiatry at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Sepulveda, Calif. He had been associated with the center since 1984. He retired from U.C.L.A. two years ago as professor in residence.
        Dr. Kling was best known for having advanced the understanding of how emotions are encoded in the brain and how those emotions are expressed in a social context. His work with monkeys and cats helped to explain the psychobiology of attachment and separation in both apes and humans.
        He was born in Chicago and  worked as an assistant curator of reptiles at the Brookfield Zoo in Riverside, Ill. He received his M.D. in the Netherlands at the University of Utrecht and trained in psychiatry, physiology and neurology, principally at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago.
        Before joining the medical faculty at U.C.L.A. in 1980 he was a professor of psychiatry at Rutgers Medical School in Piscataway, N.J.
        Dr. Kling is survived by his wife, Rosalyn; his mother, Rose, of Chicago; three sons, Mitchel, of Bethesda, Md., Joel, of Encino, Calif., and David, of Winchester, Mass., and three granddaughters.
