        Robert E. Pelletier, who worked at The New York Times for 37 years doing everything from executing promotional drawings to helping redesign the newspaper, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 68 and had retired in 1994 as assistant to the editorial art director.
        His wife, Nuala, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
        A native of Belmont, Mass., Mr. Pelletier joined The Times in 1957 as a promotional artist, drawing ads for the paper. He later moved to the editorial department, where, under Louis Silverstein, the corporate art director, he worked on the redesign of The Times when it went from an eight-column format to six columns in 1976. He also designed special sections and helped revamp the designs of several of the company's affiliated newspapers in the South.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Alexandra, of Manhattan and Etain, of Sparkill, N.Y.; a son, Kiernan, of Turbotville, Pa., and two grandsons.
