        James Chandler Bowling, a longtime executive with the Philip Morris Companies who helped initiate the company's program in support of the visual and performing arts, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 69 and had homes in Vero Beach, Fla., and Darien, Conn.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Bowling worked at Philip Morris in Manhattan from 1952 until his retirement in 1986, holding positions ranging from director of public relations to assistant to the chairman of the board. He became a senior vice president in 1976.
        When Philip Morris began to provide funds for arts events in 1958, Mr. Bowling worked closely with arts administrators in helping to decide which projects and shows were to receive support. One such show was ''Vatican Collections,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1983.
        Mr. Bowling, a descendant of John Rolfe, the first colonist to raise tobacco in America, was born in Covington, Ky. He attended the University of Kentucky, but left school to serve as a paratrooper in the Pacific during World War II. He graduated from the University of Louisville in 1951. Mr. Bowling is survived by his wife, Ann Jones Bowling; a son, James C. Jr.; three daughters, Belinda Bowling Bewkes and Nancy Bowling Gramps, both of Darien, and Stephanie Clift Bowling of Los Angeles; a brother, Thomas Barksdale Bowling, and five grandchildren.
