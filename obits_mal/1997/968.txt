        Jerry C. Jacobs, a pediatrician and leading authority on rheumatoid arthritis in children, died on Sept. 6 at his home in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. He was 66 and also had a home in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause was cancer, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center said.
        Dr. Jacobs was a professor of clinical pediatrics at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons; head of the section of pediatric rheumatology at Babies and Children's Hospital, where he was an attending pediatrician, and pediatrician in chief at the Edward Daniels Faulkner Arthritis Clinic of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was also director of the Regional Arthritis Program for Children.
        Dr. Jacobs published numerous articles in medical journals and lectured worldwide about juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and diseases of the connective tissue in children. He was the author of a textbook, ''Pediatric Rheumatology for the Practitioner.''
        A native of New York City, Dr. Jacobs graduated from Columbia College in 1952 and received his medical degree from Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1956. After serving in the Army, he started a private practice in Riverdale, and joined the faculty at Columbia, where he taught until his death.
        Dr. Jacobs is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Isabel Fenster; a daughter, Deborah L., of Brooklyn Heights; two sons, Daniel S., of Washington, and Paul S., of Vienna, Va., and a sister, Tina Mattox of Ventura, Calif.
