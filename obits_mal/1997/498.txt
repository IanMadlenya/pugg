        The Rev. William M. Lewers, a trustee and professor of law at the University of Notre Dame, died on April 19 at Holy Cross House in Notre Dame, Ind. He was 69.
        He suffered a lengthy illness, a university spokesman said.
        Father Lewers joined the law faculty at Notre Dame in 1965. Since 1988, besides serving as a professor, he has also been the director of the Center for Civil and Human Rights in the law school, a member of the board of trustees and a fellow in the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at Notre Dame.
        Father Lewers was a former director of the Office of International Justice and Peace of the United States Catholic Conference. He had also been a provincial superior of the Indiana Province of the Congregation of Holy Cross.
        Born in Kansas City, Mo., he was a law graduate of the University of Illinois and a fellow at Yale Law School. He practiced law before entering the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1960, and he was ordained at Notre Dame in 1965.
        Father Lewers inspired the master of laws program in international human rights at the university. Most recently, he helped shape a program, underwritten by the MacArthur Foundation, that sends new Notre Dame law graduates to assist the United Nations tribunal investigating war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
        He leaves no immediate survivors.
