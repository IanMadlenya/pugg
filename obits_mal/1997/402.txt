        Arthur Cunningham, a composer, pianist and conductor who combined classical forms and instrumentation with elements of rock and jazz, died on Monday at his home in Nyack, N.Y. He was 68.
        John Ellis, a former student of Mr. Cunningham's and a friend of the family, said the cause was prostate cancer.
        Mr. Cunningham's eclecticism yielded a rich, varied repertory that included a rock opera, ''His Natural Grace'' (1969); ''Night Song'' (1973), a theater work with a text in Swahili and the South Carolinian Gulla dialect, and ''Engrams'' (1969), a solo piano work in which jazz and Serialism mingled. His best-known orchestral work, ''Concentrics'' (1968), was performed by Zubin Mehta and the New York Philharmonic in a revised version in 1989. And his ''Lullabye for a Jazz Baby'' was in the repertory of the Alvin Ailey Dance Company in the early 1980's and was regularly performed on orchestral pops programs.
        Mr. Cunningham was born in Piermont, N.Y., in 1928. A prodigious pianist, he was leading a jazz band, and composing for it, by the time he was 12. He continued his musical studies at Fisk University, Columbia University Teacher's College and the Juilliard School, where his teachers included Wallingford Riegger and Peter Mennin. He also studied jazz with Teddy Wilson and Johnny Mehegan.
        In his Nyack studio, he taught piano and composition and worked as a vocal coach. He toured as a lecturer and conductor of his own works and performed as a jazz pianist and accompanist for his wife, Kate Davidson, a cabaret singer.
        He is survived by his wife; his mother, Rachel Cunningham Ingram, and a sister, Hassie Boddy, both of Oxford, N.C., and a brother, Donald Cunningham of Aurora, Colo.
