        Lyle M. Nelson, who played a leading role in several graduate fellowship programs, including the John S. Knight Fellowships program at Stanford University, died on Friday at his home in Stanford, Calif. He was 79.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his wife, Corrine, said.
        Mr. Nelson, a former journalism professor, started what became the Knight program in 1966, and was instrumental in obtaining a permanent endowment for it from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation of Miami in 1982. He was the program's director from 1969 until his retirement in 1985.
        He also served for six years on the governing board of the Fulbright international academic exchange program and was its chairman from 1973 to 1976.
        Professor Nelson is survived by his wife and two daughters, Dr. J. Lee Nelson of Seattle and Gayle Green of Portland.
