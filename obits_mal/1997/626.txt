        Allan Dell, the barkeeper who operated Hogs and Heifers, the offbeat country-western bar in the meat-packing district of the West Village, died early Saturday. He was 31.
        Mr. Dell was stricken in his sleep in his Battery Park City apartment, said Kevin B. McGrath, his lawyer. The nature of the attack was unclear,  the lawyer said, and the Medical Examiner's office said further tests would be needed to determine the cause of death.
        A high school dropout from Long Island, Mr. Dell opened the bar in 1993 at Washington and 13th Streets and turned it into a place favored by celebrities, bikers and off-duty police officers.
        He is survived by his wife, Michelle; his parents, Jeff and Bunny, of Manhattan, and his siblings, Damon and Felisa, also of Manhattan.
