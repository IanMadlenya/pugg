        Donald A. E. Beer, who won a gold medal in rowing at the 1956 summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, and carried the Olympic torch  through Princeton, N.J., last June on its way to the summer Olympics in Atlanta, died on Saturday in a nursing home near Princeton. He was 61 and a longtime Princeton resident.
        The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed last March, his wife, Nancy, said.
        Mr. Beer studied electrical engineering at Yale and was a private investor with a special interest in advanced technologies. He won his gold medal representing the United States as a member of the Yale 1956 varsity crew in the 2,000-meter Olympic rowing event for eight-oared crews with coxswains.
        Before the day last year when Mr. Beer received the Olympic flame from a runner, carried it uphill for a quarter of a mile and passed it on to the next runner, The Princeton Packet reported that he was ailing and had trouble reading and conversing. It quoted his wife on his determination to carry the flame anyway: ''Whenever this subject comes up, he gets teary, and he definitely wants to do it. He can go in a wheelchair if he can't walk it.''
        So many people gathered to watch him carry the torch along upper Witherspoon Street that the police abruptly closed it. Mr. Beer kept smiling as he ran and thousands cheered. Later, he said he felt wonderful.
        Mr. Beer was born in Manhattan, grew up in Sea Cliff, L.I., and graduated in 1957 from Yale College. He received a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University.
        Besides his wife, the former Nancy Gardner, he is survived by two sons, Frederick, of Rochester, and Cyrus, of Boston; a daughter, Catherine, of Princeton, and a sister, Marguerite Platt, and a brother, Andrew, both of Manhattan.
