        S. Howard Goldman, a New York real estate developer and a private collector of American autographs, documents and manuscripts, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. He was 67 and lived in New York City and New Canaan, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, the hospital said.
        Mr. Goldman owned what is believed to be one of only eight existing original printed copies of the United States Constitution, and the only copy known to be in private hands, a spokesman for the Supreme Court Historical Society said.
        Mr. Goldman displayed his copy at institutions throughout the country and at the Supreme Court for a year in connection with the 1987 bicentennial of the Constitution.
        Mr. Goldman, who had an interest in the workings of the Court, was a vice president of the society.
        Experts in rare documents said that at one time he owned one of the most extensive collections of documents containing the signatures of the signers of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
        He also once held at least one document signed by each of the 108 Justices who have held Supreme Court seats, the Historical Society said. Except for the copy of the Constitution, Mr. Goldman's entire collection was sold in 1995.
        Mr. Goldman was an investing partner for 23 years with the Brodsky Organization, a New York real estate development firm, and was one of the founders of the Real Estate School at the University Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
        A native of Brooklyn, he attended Erasmus Hall High School there. He received an undergraduate degree from Syracuse University and a master's degree from Wharton.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Tapper Goldman; two sons by his previous marriage to Sheila Goldman of Weston, Conn., Jim Goldman of Media Township, Pa., and Jeff Goldman of Newton, Mass.; a stepson, Mark Polansky of Manhattan, and a stepdaughter, Barbra Polansky of Point Reyes, Calif.
