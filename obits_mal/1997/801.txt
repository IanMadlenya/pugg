        Bert Phillips, who retired in 1982 after 10 years as chairman and chief executive of the Clark Equipment Company, the maker of forklift trucks and vehicle parts, died July 15 at his summer home in Cassopolis, Mich. He was 78. The cause was myelodysplasia, a bone marrow disease, his son, Eric, said.
        Mr. Phillips, who lived in Tequesta, Fla., became a salesman for Clark in 1948 and rose to president in 1966 and chief executive in 1973. He was known for customer support; during a 1970 trucking strike he airlifted parts to customers.
        Mr. Phillips graduated from Quincy College in Illinois. During World War II, he trained pilots and after the war worked as an airplane salesman and private pilot until one of his clients, a Clark executive, persuaded him to join the company.
        In addition to his son, Eric, of Battle Creek, Mich., he is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, Julie Gleason of Dowagiac, Mich.; a brother, Wayne Lease of Austin, Tex.; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
