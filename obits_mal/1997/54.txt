        Dr. C. Elton Cahow, a professor of surgery at Yale University School of Medicine who was credited with advanced techniques in gastrointestinal procedures, died on Thursday at his home in Branford, Conn. He was 65.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        At his death, he was the William H. Carmalt Professor of Surgery and vice chairman of the department. He joined the Yale medical faculty in 1963, was named a full professor in 1977 and served as chief of surgery for Yale University Health Services between 1975 and 1984.
        Focusing on the liver, bile ducts and pancreas, Dr. Cahow helped develop new approaches in rebuilding the esophagus, pharynx and larynx after cancer surgery. He also developed a technique to reconstruct bile ducts impaired by injury or inflammatory disease.
        He was born in Fort Pierce, Fla., graduated from Davidson College and received his medical degree from Cornell University in 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara Kinder Cahow, who is also a Yale professor of surgery; a son, Eric C., of Waterbury, Conn.; four daughters, Joy C. Oosten of Wolcott, Conn., Robin C. Hickerson of West Haven, Conn., Caitlin K. Cahow of Branford, and Holly C. Lasagna of Peace Dale,  R.I., and six grandchildren.
