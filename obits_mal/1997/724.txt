        Franklin M. Heller, who directed the long-running television quiz show ''What's My Line?'' and many other dramatic and musical programs, died yesterday at Evergreen Woods, a retirement community in North Branford, Conn. He was 85.
        Mr. Heller began his career in the theater, taking up acting while still a student at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he specialized in Elizabethan stagecraft. He appeared in a variety of roles in summer stock and at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego before moving to New York in the 1930's. His Broadway credits included ''Nowhere Bound,'' ''This Is Our House,'' ''Strip Girl'' and ''You Can't Take It With You,'' for which he also served as stage manager.
        He also was stage manager for ''The American Way''; for ''Swingin' the Dream,'' a jazz version of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' that featured Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman and Maxine Sullivan; ''My Sister Eileen'' and ''All Those Endearing Young Charms.'' During World War II he was executive producer for the U.S.O. shows, helping administer entertainment programs for American armed forces around the world.
        After the war, Mr. Heller worked briefly for Paramount Pictures and served as resident director of the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pa., before joining CBS in 1949. He directed shows including ''What's My Line?,'' ''The Web'' and ''Danger'' and was an early producer of ''Omnibus.''
        He joined Goodson-Todman Productions in 1953 and continued to direct ''What's My Line?,'' supervising the show for a total of 17 years. He also directed ''Beat the Clock'' and ''I've Got a Secret.'' After retiring from television, he worked as a literary agent.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jane Stewart of Norwalk, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
