        Samuel J. Friedman, an executive partner of the New York law firm of Hall, Dickler, Kent, Friedman & Wood, died at his home in Great Barrington, Mass., last Sunday. He was 64.
        Mr. Friedman, who also lived in Irvington, N.Y., died of a heart attack, a daughter, Laura Beth Friedman, said.
        Mr. Friedman was chairman of his firm's estate and tax department, and a frequent lecturer to business and professional groups, including the C. W. Post College Tax Institute, the National Catholic Development Conference and the Young Presidents' Organization of New York.
        He was a co-author of two books published by Macmillan, ''How to Take Money Out of a Closely Held Business'' and ''Tax Planning to Increase and Keep Executive Take-Home Pay.''
        Mr. Friedman graduated from  Harvard College and Harvard Law School. After receiving his law degree, he worked as a lawyer for the Internal Revenue Service in Washington. He joined Hall, Dickler 36 years ago.
        Among the firm's well-known partners were Leonard Hall, chairman of the Republican National Committee during the Eisenhower Administration, and William Casey, Director of Central Intelligence in the Reagan Administration.
        At the law firm, Mr. Friedman helped found offices in Los Angeles, White Plains and Bucharest, Romania. The Romanian office counseled American businesses doing business in Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism.
        Mr. Friedman is survived by his wife, Doris, a lawyer and the acting village judge of Tarrytown, N.Y.; three daughters, Ruth Lynn of Appleton, Wis., Laura Beth of Manhattan, and Jill Ann of White Plains, and four grandchildren.
