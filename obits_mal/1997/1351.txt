        Tracy H. Ferguson, a Syracuse lawyer who specialized in labor law, died on Dec. 3, at the age of 87. His family said the cause of death was complications after heart surgery.
        Mr. Ferguson, a strong advocate of arbitration in labor disputes, was known for his outspoken defense of a local newspaper against attacks by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin, in 1952. He also represented the General Electric Company during the 1970's in a major antitrust case.
        He is survived by his wife, Babbette; a daughter, Tina Laboe, of Huntington, N.Y., and a son, Earl Mark Ferguson, of Richmond.
