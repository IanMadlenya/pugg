        Eugene Lehner, a violinist in the Boston Symphony Orchestra for 43 years and the violist in the Kolisch Quartet in the 1920's and 30's, died on Sept. 13 at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 91.
        Mr. Lehner was born in Hungary in 1906, and performed as a self-taught violinist from the time he was 7. When he was 13, the composer Bela Bartok heard him play, and arranged for him to pursue his studies formally.
        At the Royal Conservatory of Music in Budapest, he studied the violin with Jeno Hubay and composition with Zoltan Kodaly.
        In 1925, soon after his graduation from the conservatory at 19, he joined the Kolisch Quartet, an ensemble known for its tonal richness and its pioneering approach to repertory.
        As an ensemble member, Mr. Lehner gave the premieres of Berg's ''Lyric Suite,'' Schoenberg's Third and Fourth String Quartets, Bartok's Fifth Quartet and Webern's Second Quartet.
        After the Kolisch group disbanded, in 1939, Mr. Lehner performed with the Stradivari Quartet. He also joined the Boston Symphony that year, and stayed with the orchestra until his retirement in 1982.
        Mr. Lehner was renowned as a teacher and chamber music coach. He taught at Tanglewood from 1940 to 1996 and at the New England Conservatory from 1960 to 1996. He also taught at Brandeis University and Boston University.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucca, and a son, Andreas, of Waitsfield, Vt.
