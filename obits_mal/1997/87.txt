        Douglas Greenwald, the retired chief of economics for the publications unit of the McGraw-Hill Companies and editor in chief of the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Economics, died Wednesday at his home in Sarasota, Fla.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his wife, Mickey Janis-Greenwald. He was 83.
        Mr. Greenwald worked for McGraw-Hill for 31 years, retiring in 1978 as vice president for economics of the McGraw-Hill Publications Company. In retirement he was an adviser to Japanese executives and government officials as well as editor of the last two editions of the economics encyclopedia. He also wrote and edited seven books and edited the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Modern Economics.
        In 1986, the Japanese Government awarded Mr. Greenwald the Third Class of the Order of the Sacred Treasure for his service as an economic consultant.
        Mr. Greenwald joined McGraw-Hill in 1947 as a staff economist for the magazines division. He later became manager of its economics department, where he was in charge of forecasts and surveys, including the annual survey of corporate capital investment plans for Federal Government and news media use.
        Mr. Greenwald was a fellow of the National Association of Business Economists and a founder of the American Statistical Association.
        He earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Temple University and both a master's degree and a doctorate in economics from George Washington University.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Greenwald was reared in Baltimore and Washington, then returned to New York for much of his adult life. He moved to Sarasota in 1987.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Greenwald is survived by two stepsons, Robert Janis of Marina del Rey, Calif., and Richard Janis of Washington; a brother, Howard Greenwald of Short Hills, N.J., and two grandsons.
