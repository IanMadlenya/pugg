        Julian S. Perlman, a New York lawyer and foundation executive who supported the performing arts in the city, died last Friday while visiting  the Catskill village of Phoenicia, N.Y. He was 70 and lived on the Upper East Side and in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
        He died of a heart attack, said Gary Mailman, a friend.
        At his death, Mr. Perlman was a director and trustee of the Norman and Rosita Winston Foundation. He was in private practice in Manhattan, dealing in trusts and estates, real-estate and corporate law.
        On behalf of the foundation as well as on his own and with his wife, Jane Norris Perlman, he contributed to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the School of American Ballet and the 92d Street Y, among others. Beneficiaries also included the Fordham University School of Law, Jerusalem Foundation and Israel Museum of Jerusalem.
        He was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947 and received his law degree from Harvard University in 1952. He was a partner in Robinson Perlman Kirschner & Leffler until the firm disbanded in the mid-1980's.
        As its president, he oversaw the  Winston Foundation, which at the end of 1993 listed assets of $64 million and disbursements totaling more than $3 million.
        Jane Perlman, his wife, died last year. He is survived by a son, Tom, of Manhattan; a brother, Murray, also of Manhattan, and a sister, Charlotte Walsh of White Plains.
