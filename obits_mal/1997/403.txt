        Gabriel Wiener, an audio specialist and founder of Pro Gloria Musica, which produces recordings of early music, was found dead on Wednesday in his apartment in Manhattan. He was 26.
        No cause of his death was given. His father, Michael, said he was believed to have died of natural causes.
        This year Mr. Wiener produced the Pro Gloria Musica recording of ''The Songs of Solomon,'' liturgical music sung in Hebrew and written by Salamone Rossi, a composer of the late Italian Renaissance associated with the court in Mantua. It was recorded by the New York Baroque, with Eric Milnes as director.
        Mr. Wiener was also the founder and chief audio engineer of Quintessential Sound, specialists in reconstructing old or damaged recordings through electronic methods and transferring them to tape or CD. The company has restored master recordings of jazz and classical music and is often called upon to reconstruct taped conversations for use in legal cases.
        In addition to his father, a founder of the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, which was acquired by the Westinghouse Electric Company last year, Mr. Wiener is survived by his mother, Zena, and a sister, Jennifer, all of New York.
