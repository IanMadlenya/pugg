        Edward Thorgerson, a pioneer sports announcer in the early days of radio, died at his home in Wolfeboro, N.H., on Monday. He was 95.
        As a young announcer for NBC, where he began his career in 1927, Mr. Thorgerson broadcast the news of the Lindbergh kidnapping live from Hopewell, N.J., on March 1, 1932. That same year he received his first major sports assignment, the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, N.Y. He scooped the competition by bringing the new champion, Sonja Henie, to the microphone.
        He soon joined Fox Movietone News as a news and sports announcer, and his staccato delivery made his voice familiar to moviegoers around the country. He then became a producer and editor of sports for the popular ''March of Time'' series in 1950 and was also an independent producer of radio and television commercials. He served as a news commentator with Dumont Television in New York City until retiring in 1959.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; two daughters, Carla Copeland of Wolfeboro and Priscilla Kobbe of Beaverton, Ore., and Borrego Springs, Calif.; a sister, Edna Wright of Aberdeen, N.J., a brother, Arthur of Clearwater, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
