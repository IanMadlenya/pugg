        Richard Nevin Kerst, a former top administrator at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, died on April 22 at his daughter's home in Woodbridge, Conn. He was 83 and lived in Katonah, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Katrena K. Engstrom.
        Mr. Kerst spent 34 years at the center and retired in 1979 as vice chairman of the board of trustees. He was born in Dubuque, Iowa, graduated from the University of Wisconsin and served as a Navy lieutenant in the Pacific in World War II.
        He joined Presbyterian Hospital in 1945 as assistant controller. Two years later, he was named controller of the corporation that then included all voluntary hospitals at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, the New York Orthopedic Dispensary and Hospital and the Mary Harkness Home.
        He rose to assistant secretary-treasurer and vice president of administration and was president from 1975 to 1977. He was a past board member of the Heckscher Foundation for Children and a trustee of the Katonah Museum of Art.
        Besides his daughter, Mr. Kerst is survived by his wife, Barbara Clark Kerst; a son, R. Duncan, of Portland, Ore.; a brother, Kenneth, of Heathville, Va., and three grandchildren. His first wife, Annie Lee Duncan Kerst, died in 1980 after 35 years of marriage.
