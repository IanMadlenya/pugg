        The Rev. Msgr. Anthony Louis Maltese, pastor of the combined parishes of Immaculate Conception and Assumption Roman Catholic Churches in Tuckahoe, N.Y., died on June 15 at his home in Tuckahoe. He was 68.
        He had suffered a lengthy illness, the Archdiocese of New York said.
        He became pastor of the Church of St. Lucy in the Bronx in 1975. John Cardinal O'Connor appointed him pastor of the Immaculate Conception Church in 1985. The parish merged with Assumption four years ago.
        Monsignor Maltese is survived by two sisters, Rose and Mary Maltese, both of Tuckahoe, and two brothers, Joseph, of Tuckahoe, and Frank, of Spring Hill, Fla.
