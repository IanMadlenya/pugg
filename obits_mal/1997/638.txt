        Amasa Stone Bishop, an American nuclear scientist specializing in fusion physics who took up environmental causes under United Nations auspices, died on May 21 at Clinique de Genolier, near Geneva, Switzerland. A resident of Genolier, he was 76.
        His family said the cause was pneumonia related to Alzheimer's disease.
        Dr. Bishop was born in Cleveland, graduated from the California Institute of Technology and earned a Ph.D. in physics at the University of California at Berkeley in 1950.
        He joined the research division of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington in 1953 and was soon named to direct the fledgling American program to develop controlled fusion. On behalf of the A.E.C. he wrote the first book on the subject, ''Project Sherwood: The U.S. Program in Controlled Fusion'' (1958).
        After stints as the A.E.C. scientific representative in Europe, based in Paris, and assistant delegate to the European atomic energy agency, Euratom, in Brussels, he spent several more years doing research in Princeton, N.J., and in charge of the  fusion program in Washington.
        He left in 1970 and joined the United Nations staff in Europe as director of environment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, which included the United States, Canada and the Soviet Union. In that post he worked with scientists and diplomats to chart solutions for regional environmental problems. He retired in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Barbara Merrill Bishop; three sons, Jeffrey B. of Manhattan, A. Reid of Tartegnin, Switzerland, and Gregory M. of Seattle; a daughter, Jennifer B. Bishop of Sedona, Ariz.; and a brother, Dr. Jonathan S. of Minneapolis.
