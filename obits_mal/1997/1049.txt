        Haldor E. Rosvold, a retired neuroscientist known as a pioneer in studying the role the brain's frontal lobes and networks play in numerous mental processes, died at his home in Silver Spring, Md., on Sept. 26. He was 81.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Using animals as subjects, Dr. Rosvold studied mental processes like short-term memory, discovering the first of several complex networks in the brain. Before his work in the 1950's and 1960's, scientists had limited their experiments to localized functions in the brain, unaware that such networks existed.
        ''He was one of the very first neuroscientists to reveal a functional connection between the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia that has now become one of the most important pathways in neurology,'' said Dr. Patricia Goldman-Rakic, a former student of Dr. Rosvold's and a professor of neuroscience at the Yale School of Medicine.
        Dr. Rosvold founded a unit to study animal behavior at the National Institute of Mental Health in 1954. In 1976, the unit became the laboratory of neuropsychology, which he led until his retirement in 1982.
        Dr. Rosvold was born in Calgary, Alberta, and graduated from the University of Alberta. He served in the Canadian Army in England in World War II as a psychologist. After his military service, Dr. Rosvold came to the United States and earned his Ph.D. at Stanford University. He taught at McGill and Yale Universities before moving to the National Institute of Mental Health.
        Survivors include his wife, Mary, of Silver Spring; three children, Rae Rosvold-Skinner of Portland, Ore., Daniel Rosvold of Middletown, Md., and Heidi Rosvold-Brenholtz of Beallsville, Md; a sister, Peggy Rosvold Mason, and six grandchildren.
