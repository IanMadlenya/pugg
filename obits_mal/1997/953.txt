        Lionel Chapman, an award-winning producer for ABC News, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 47.
        The cause was a heart attack, an ABC spokesman said.
        Mr. Chapman, who worked in broadcast news for 20 years, joined ABC News in 1977 and became a producer for ''Nightline'' in 1980. His production credits included coverage of the fighting in El Salvador, the Falklands crisis and Ted Koppel's ''Nightline'' broadcasts from South Africa in 1985.
        He was senior producer and then executive producer of the ''Koppel Report,'' an independent production of Koppel Communications, from 1987 to 1991, overseeing such programs as ''Death of a Dictator'' and ''Tragedy at Tiananmen: The Untold Story.'' After rejoining ABC News in 1991, he was senior producer of ''Pearl Harbor: Two Hours That Changed the World,'' with David Brinkley. The following year he was executive producer of ''The Missiles of October: What the World Didn't Know,'' with Peter Jennings. His other credits included ''D-Day: The Soldier's Story'' and ''The Liberation of Paris.''
        In 1992, Mr. Chapman began development of a documentary history of the 20th century, which is scheduled for broadcast in 1999.
        He won five Emmys, two George Foster Peabody awards and two DuPont-Columbia awards.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Hubbard Chapman.
