        Auxiliary Bishop John Gavin Nolan of the Archdiocese for the Military Services, which serves more than a million Catholics in the United States and around the world, died on Nov. 19 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 73 and most recently lived in Manhattan.
        He suffered a long illness, according to the Archdiocese, which has its headquarters in Hyattsville, Md.
        After many years of service in the Middle East, Bishop Nolan was named in 1987 by Pope John Paul II the titular Bishop of Natchez and Auxiliary Bishop of the Military Ordinariate. He was consecrated at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome in 1988. He spent four years serving the Military Archdiocese in Europe as Episcopal Vicar for American military and civilian personnel and their families.
        At his death, he was the Auxiliary Bishop for development and had a central role in the operations of the Archdiocese, including fund-raising.
        Bishop Nolan was born in Mechanicsville, N.Y., and trained at several seminaries and theological colleges and at Catholic University of America before he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Albany in 1949. He served in upstate parishes and continued graduate studies at Fordham University and Catholic University, earning a doctorate in sacred theology and degrees in history and library science.
        From 1962 through 1987 he was on the staff of the Catholic Near East Welfare Association, serving as its secretary general and as president of the Pontifical Mission for Palestine.
        Bishop Nolan is survived by two siblings, Michael F., of Schuylerville, N.Y., and Sister Kathleen Nolan, of Albany.
