        Joseph Kastner, a nature writer who was nominated for a National Book Award for his 1977 book, ''A Species of Eternity,'' a study of early American naturalists, died on Thursday at his home in Grandview-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 89.
        Mr. Kastner was also a writer and editor at Life magazine from 1936 to 1969.
        ''A Species of Eternity'' is a history of what he called the Romantic Era -- approximately 1750 to 1850 -- of North American natural history. In a 1978 review in The New York Times Book Review, Ann Marie Cunningham, senior editor of Natural History, praised his ''journalistic eye for valuable detail'' in recounting ''the lively eccentricities and venturesome travels of unfamiliar personalities and of famous figures like John James Audubon.''
        Mr. Kastner's book ''A World of Watchers'' (1987) chronicles bird-watching in America and the individuals influencing it, beginning with the early watchers, who included military men and explorers, and continuing up to the mid-1980's, when 450,000 bird-watchers belonged to various affiliates of the National Audubon Society.
        He also provided the text for two books containing visual material from the collections of the New York Public Library: ''The Bird Illustrated, 1550-1900'' (1989) and ''The Animal Illustrated, 1550-1900'' (1991). In addition, he wrote an illustrated book for children, ''John James Audubon'' (Abrams, 1992).
        Mr. Kastner was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Manhattan, graduated from Yale College in 1930, worked for The New Yorker and other publications and went on to be the copy editor of Life, with responsibilities including the reading of every word of the editorial content of each issue just before it went to press.
        His writings as a freelance, after retiring from Life, included articles for Smithsonian and Natural History magazines and book reviews, articles and Op-Ed page essays for The New York Times. He also contributed unsigned editorials, about nature and the environment, to The Times.
        He was married in 1934 to Barbara Harris, who died in 1985.
        He is survived by his companion, Judith Mara Gutman; a brother, Alton, of Manhattan; two sisters, Beatrice Olson of Manhattan and Clara Sack of Richmond, Va.; two sons, Matthew, of Newtown, Conn., and Jonathan, of Deep River, Conn., and two grandsons.
