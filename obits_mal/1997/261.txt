        Andrew J. Valuchek, a former publisher of foreign-language papers in New York who served for many years as a Democratic Party liaison to ethnic groups and foreign visitors to Washington, died on March 16 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 85 and lived in Potomac, Md.
        Mr. Valuchek was born in Smithfield, Pa., and grew up versed in Czech and Slovak. A graduate of New York University, he taught modern European history at Columbia University for 15 years.
        For several years, Mr. Valuchek published two ethnic newspapers in New York, Dennik, in Slovak, and Listy, in Czech. He was an aide in Robert F. Wagner's first campaign for the State Assembly. Mayor Wagner later named him a deputy commissioner of housing.
        He was a founder of the American Fund for Czechoslovakian Refugees, which helped those fleeing Nazism and Communism, and went to Washington as an aide to President John F. Kennedy's choice for chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Senator Henry M. Jackson. Mr. Valuchek worked for the Democratic National Committee for 23 years and, most recently, served as an aide to Speaker Thomas S. Foley. He was in charge of the Democratic organization's Ethnic Committee and an organizer of its All American Council, an umbrella for supporters from ethnic fraternal organizations.
        He was a volunteer for the United States Information Agency, the International Institute of Education and the African Institute and briefed foreign legislators and other dignitaries on the workings of American political institutions.
        He is also survived by his daughter, Jan Clark, of Mill Valley, Calif., and seven grandchildren. His wife, Ethel Kana, died many years ago.
