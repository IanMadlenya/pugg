        Allyn Zelton Baum, a retired editor, news photographer and writer, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 72 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said Anne Trevor Brown, his companion.
        Mr. Baum, a native of Chicago, was a journalism graduate of Northwestern University. He started his career with International News Photos and United Press, based in Berlin, Frankfurt and Paris.
        He was a staff photographer for The New York Times from 1957 to 1967, also contributing articles on special assignment in places like Antarctica, South Africa and Peru. From 1967 until his retirement seven years ago, he was a senior editor, writer and researcher at Medical Economics, publishers of medical and architectural periodicals.
        Mr. Baum was the author of ''Antarctica, the Worst Place in the World'' (Macmillan, 1966). His photographs and articles in newspapers and magazines were published worldwide.
        Besides Ms. Brown, Mr. Baum is survived by his brother, Donald, of Glencoe, Ill. His two marriages, to Nan Robertson and Pell Le Witt, ended in divorce.
