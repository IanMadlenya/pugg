        Robert Arnold Hurwitch, who served as United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic in the 1970's, died on July 16 at his home in Minot, Mass. He was 76.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, he was chosen to head the embassy in Santo Domingo by President Nixon in 1973. He resigned from the post in 1978 and was sentenced to two years' probation in 1979 after pleading guilty to misuse of embassy funds.
        A native of Worcester, Mass., he attended the University of Chicago and served in the military in Europe in World War II an the postwar occupation, then joined the Foreign Service in 1950. Specializing in Latin America, he had assignments in several South American capitals.
        In 1961, as a speical assistant on Cuba for the State Department, he helped negotiate the release of Miami-based Cuban exiles taken prisoner during the Bay of Pigs invasion, and was part of the State Department team engaged in the Cuban missile crisis.
        His career was cut short when the State Department asked him to resign in 1978, after an investigation into his use of embassy funds in Santo Domingo. It involved several thousand dollars spent to refurbish a home there lent to him by a friend.
        Mr. Hurwitch is survived by his wife of 19 years, Beatriz Gil-Borges Hurwitch; four daughters, Jan Hurwitch, of San Jose, Costa Rica; Paula Toomey, of Coral Springs, Fla.; Carol Hurwitch, of Rockville, Md., and Sally Hurwitch-Helikson of Mountville, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Beatriz Cubillan-Borrell, of Spain; a stepson, Jose Alberto Cubillan, of Laurel, Md.; two sisters, Charlotte Fistel, of Newton, Mass., and Dotty Gurland, of Providence, R.I., and three grand-daughters. His earlier marriage, to Saralee Pilot, ended in divorce.
