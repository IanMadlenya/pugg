        Dr. Samuel Gurin, a biochemist who was the only dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who did not hold a medical degree, died on Oct. 22 at the Pine Run Village retirement home in Doylestown, Pa. He was 92.
        He was on the faculty of the medical school for 32 years, starting in 1936. He became the Benjamin Rush Professor of Biological Chemistry in 1954, conducting research with radioactive isotopes that traced the pathways of metabolism.
        In 1946, he arranged for the university to receive radioactive carbon 14 from the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, for studies that tagged molecules as tracers of cell reactions. He also conducted experiments for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee using radioactive metabolic tracers.
        Dr. Gurin was chairman of the medical school's department of biochemistry from 1954 to 1962, and was its dean from 1962 to 1968.
        Later, he became a professor of biological sciences at the University of Florida, where he founded the Marine Biochemical Research Laboratories and was the director there from 1974 to 1984.
        He received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. Survivors include his wife of 67 years, Celia; two sons, Robert, of Stuart, Fla., and Richard, of Richlandtown, Pa.; five grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
