        Henry B. Guthrie, who worked as a lawyer for the wealthy and prominent and who devoted much of his time to providing better hospital care, enriched science education and social services for fatherless youths, died on Feb. 12 at his home in Bedford, Westchester County.
        Mr. Guthrie, who was 94, also had a home in Southwest Harbor, Maine. The cause was pneumonia, his brother-in-law, E. Chandlee Archer of Hanover, N.H., said.
        Much of his professional work was in estates and trust law, said Gilbert Kerlin, a lifelong colleague at the law firm of Shearman & Sterling in Manhattan, which he joined in 1927.
        His clients included the estate of Robert Walton Goelet, who owned real estate, including the old Ritz-Carlton Hotel, among other investments, and Henry Dreyfus, founder and chairman of Celanese Corporation of America. He became a partner at Shearman & Sterling in 1941 and retired from full-time practice in 1987.
        In 1946, as part of what he considered his civic obligation, Mr. Guthrie organized the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation to support scientific research and education in chemistry and he became its first chairman. He was a board member at his death.
        He was a director of the United Hospital Fund of New York from 1959 to 1979 and chairman of the board of St. Luke's Hospital from 1970 to 1979. He had been on the board since 1952. He was president of St. Luke's from 1966 to 1970.
        In the 1930's and 1940's, he was chairman of Big Brothers Inc. of New York City and was for a time a vice president of Big Brothers of America. Big Brothers/Big Sisters, as it is now known, matches hundreds of volunteer adults with boys and girls between 8 and 16 years old who are from single parent homes. The adults provide guidance and friendship.
        A Manhattan native, Mr. Guthrie graduated from Princeton in 1924 and received a law degree from Harvard in 1927.
        His wife of 62 years, Elizabeth Chandlee Archer, died in January. No immediate family members survive.
