        Kennedy Shaw, a consultant on municipal development and the environment, died April 23 at UCSF Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 68 and lived in Guerneville, Calif.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Ralph Prizio, his longtime companion.
        A native of Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Shaw graduated from Syracuse University and came to New Jersey in 1958 to manage the Township of Cedar Grove. He later worked as administrator for East Brunswick, N.J., and Plainfield, N.J., before becoming executive director of the Massachusetts Municipal Association in Boston in 1973.
        In the early 1980's he was city manager of Englewood, N.J., and general manager of Co-Op City in the Bronx. He then became a consultant.
        Besides Mr. Prizio, he is survived by a sister, Carol Goetting of Auburn, Calif.
