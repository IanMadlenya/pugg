        Marion J. Epley Jr., a former president and chairman of Texaco Inc., died on Saturday at Harbour's Edge, a nursing home in Delray Beach, Fla., his family said. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Epley, a lawyer by training,  became president of Texaco in 1964, and ran the company during a period of rapid change and expansion at Texaco and throughout the energy industry, a corporate spokesman said yesterday.
        Mr. Epley was chairman of the company for about a year until his retirement in 1971. He and his wife, Dorris, then moved to Palm Beach, where he served for several years as president of Good Samaritan Hospital.
        Mr. Epley was born in Hattiesburg, Miss., and earned his undergraduate and law degrees at Tulane University in New Orleans, where he practiced law, except for service in the Navy in the war years, until joining Texaco in 1947. Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Marion J. Epley 3d of Millbrook, N.Y.; a daughter, Sara Epley Davis of Houston, seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
