        Robert Lamont Green, a men's fashion editor, consultant and lecturer who was the fashion director of Playboy magazine for more than 20 years, died last Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 79.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his companion, David R. Taylor.
        Always impeccably dressed in well-tailored suits and colorful ties, with wavy silver hair, Mr. Green was a familiar figure in the New York fashion world of the 1960's and 70's. Called Robert L. by his friends and associates, he was widely known for his wit, his skills as a raconteur and the many parties he gave. In particular, he gave an annual picnic at his summer home in Bucks County, Pa.
        At Playboy, from 1958 to 1975, he strengthened the magazine's fashion coverage and increased its presence in the fashion world by organizing special events and founding the Caswell-Massey Awards, which later became Playboy's Creative Men's Wear Awards. His strong opinions and pull-no-punches attitude toward fashion criticism made him a sought-after arbiter of fashion on the lecture circuit and on television.
        He occasionally appeared on ''The Merv Griffin Show,'' ''The Mike Douglas Show,'' the ''Tonight'' show and the ''Today'' show. He also wrote a book, ''Live With Style,'' as well as articles for Architectural Digest, The New York Times Magazine and other publications.
        In 1983, he moved to Los Angeles and became a fashion consultant to the television and film industries.
        After graduating from Michigan State University, Mr. Green worked as a child psychologist until he served in the Army during World War II. Settling in Washington after his discharge, Mr. Green started a public relations agency and became the host of a CBS radio program dealing with musical theater.
        He is survived by Mr. Taylor and by a sister, Louise Barth of Fort Lee, N.J.
