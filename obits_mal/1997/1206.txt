        Mr. Gropp led the Columbus Memorial Library at O.A.S. headquarters in Washington from 1950 until he retired in 1968. He earlier led a project of the American Library Association and the Rockefeller Foundation in Uruguay to give Montevideo an American library, the Biblioteca Artigas-Washington, which he served as director from 1942 to 1950.
        A farm boy from Kendall, Kan., he was a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse after graduating from Kansas State Teachers College. He also earned a master's degree in library science at the University of Illinois.
        In the 1930's, he made a comprehensive survey of libraries and archives in Central American and the West Indies.
        In Montevideo he also helped organize the School of Library Science at the University of the Republic and served as its first director.
        Mr. Gropp is survived by a daughter, Anne L. Meglis, of Greenbelt, two grandchildren and a great-grandson. His wife, Dorothy Muriel Gropp, also a librarian, died in 1995; they were married for 63 years.
