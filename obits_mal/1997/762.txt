        Joe Hauser, the only man in the history of organized baseball to have twice hit more than 60 home runs in a season, died on July 11 in Sheboygan, Wis. He was 98.
        As a minor leaguer, Hauser hit 63 home runs for the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1930 and 69 homers for the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association in 1933.
        A left-handed-hitting first baseman, Hauser reached the major leagues in 1922 with the Philadelphia Athletics with a reputation as a formidable power hitter. He hit .323 in his rookie season and had 27 homers for the A's in 1924 -- second best in the American League to Babe Ruth's 46 -- along with 115 runs batted in.
        But Hauser broke a kneecap during a spring training game in 1925, an injury that forced him to miss the entire season and ruined his career.
        Hauser played with Philadelphia again in 1926 and 1928, then spent a year with Cleveland before returning to the minors for good, having hit 80 homers in the major leagues.
        Despite his prodigious minor league home run totals, Hauser did not hold the professional record for home runs in a season. His mark of 69 was eclipsed in 1954 when Joe Bauman hit 72 home runs for the Roswell (N.M.) Rockets of the Longhorn League.
