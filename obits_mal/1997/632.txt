        Richard S. Aldrich, a cousin of Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller who was elected to a two-year term as a Republican councilman at large from Manhattan in 1963, died on Friday in Massachusetts. He was 73 and lived in Providence, R.I., his birthplace.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, which he evidently suffered in an ambulance en route to a Fall River hospital, family members said.
        Mr. Aldrich, a nephew of the Governor's mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, moved to Manhattan in 1960 from South America, where he was an executive with the International Basic Economy Corporation, an economic development organization.
        While working at the corporation's headquarters in New York, he won the Republican nomination for the Council in a primary election in September 1963, after charges that Rockefeller had insisted upon his getting the party endorsement. Rockefeller denied those allegations. In 1965, Mr. Aldrich withdrew as a candidate for re-election.
        He was an investment banker in New York from the late 1960's until he moved to New England in 1978.
        At his death, he was a vice president and a co-owner of both The Portuguese Times, a Portuguese-language weekly newspaper published in New Bedford, Mass., and a Portuguese-language cable channel in New Bedford.
        Mr. Aldrich was a son of another Richard S. Aldrich, who was a Republican Congressman from Rhode Island, and Janet Innis Aldrich. After military service in World War II, he graduated in 1949 from Yale.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; two daughters, Frances Llopis of Madrid and Abby Gray of Baltimore; two sons, Richard S. Aldrich Jr. of Manhattan and William Stuart Aldrich of Glen Ellyn, Ill.; eight grandchildren and a sister, Janet Lawrence of South Hamilton, Mass.
