        Maurice Braunstein of Schenectady, N.Y., a leading director of bridge tournaments, died on Sept. 20 at his home.
        He was 83 years old and had been suffering from lung cancer, said his wife, Marion.
        Mr. Braunstein was the chief director at three world championships, in Guaruja, Brazil, in 1973, in Bermuda in 1975 and in Miami Beach in 1986. He was also the deputy chief director in Jamaica in 1987 and in Venice in 1988.
        He became a tournament director in 1954 and reached the rank of national director in 1968. He retired in June, after a 43-year career that included more than 120 national championships and thousands of other tournaments.
        From 1973 to 1990 he was in charge of all major events at national championships. He was the creator of the Stanza movement, a modification of the Mitchell movement in pairs play, widely used before the introduction of computer scoring.
        He also created several movements for tournaments involving individual play.
        He was born in Manhattan and  graduated from Columbia University in 1934. He became the head of computer processing for New York State, retiring in 1968.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Rae Nicholson of Auckland, New Zealand, and five grandchildren.
