        W. C. Patton, an Alabama civic leader who worked for voter registration among blacks well before it moved to the forefront of the civil rights movement, died on Jan. 16 at University of Alabama Hospital in Birmingham. He was 84.
        Mr. Patton, whose given name was William, was educated at Alabama State College and worked as a high school teacher and principal in the 1930's and 1940's. He also became active in the Alabama branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, serving as its leader in Birmingham and, from 1947 to 1955, as president of the state organization.
        From the start, he worked quietly to improve the lot of black people who were shut out of the political process. In 1952 he stepped up his efforts by creating the Alabama State Coordinating Association for Registration and Voting.
        Traveling the state and beyond, he urged blacks to claim their rights as citizens, tough as the going might be. In an interview with The Birmingham Post-Herald in 1978, he recalled the tricks that were used to prevent black people from registering successfully.
        ''They'd ask you to interpret the Constitution,'' he remembered. ''They'd ask questions like how many stars are there in the sky, how many bubbles in a bar of soap.'' The tricks finally failed, but, he said, it took Federal action.
        To help open communications between the black community and the police once things began to change, Mr. Patton founded Birmingham's Police Community Affairs Committee and served as its chairman.
        From 1956 until his retirement in 1978 he continued to press for registration countrywide as the N.A.A.C.P.'s national director of voter education.
        Mr. Patton is survived by his wife, Marguerite Boggus Patton; two sons, William Jr., of Atlanta, and Jarvis, of Birmingham; two daughters, Celestra Teele and Jacqueline Patton, both of Birmingham, and six grandchildren.
