        Ronald L. Bittner, chairman of the Frontier Corporation, the corporate parent of Rochester Telephone, died Sunday at his home in Pittsford, N.Y., two weeks after he stepped down as chief executive. Mr. Bittner was 55.
        Mr. Bittner underwent surgery on Dec. 31, 1996, to remove a brain tumor, the company said.
        He joined Rochester Telephone in 1963 after graduating from Muhlenberg College with a degree in engineering. In 1992 he was named chief executive.
        During his tenure, the parent company changed its name to Frontier and expanded into long-distance services; it is now the fifth-largest carrier. In 1995, it became the first local telephone company to open its monopoly in residential service to competition.
        He was a trustee of the University of Rochester and a director of Louisville Gas and Electric and the Dynatech Corporation.
        Mr. Bittner is survived by his wife, Laurie, and two daughters, Nicole Santini and Elayna, of Pittsford; two sons, Ronald A. and Michael, and two grandchildren, all of Rochester; his mother, Jennie Bittner, and a brother, Larry, both of Nazareth, Pa.
