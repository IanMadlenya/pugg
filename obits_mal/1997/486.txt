        Robert Lyons Danly, a translator from the Japanese and an editor and teacher, died on Sunday at his parents' home in Burr Ridge, Ill. A resident of Ann Arbor, Mich., he was 50.
        The cause was a brain tumor, according to a spokesman for the University of Michigan. He had been on leave since the fall as a professor of Japanese language and literature.
        Mr. Danly made his mark with the publication of his dissertation, ''In the Shade of Spring Leaves: The Life and Writings of Higuchi Ichiyo, a Woman of Letters in Meiji Japan.'' Published by Yale University Press, it shared the 1982 American Book Award for translation.
        Born in Oak Park, Ill., he received a bachelor's degree from Yale and spent three years as a copywriter for the Asia Advertising Agency in Tokyo before returning to Yale for his Ph.D. He joined the faculty at Ann Arbor in 1979.
        He directed a popular translation workship for the Program in Comparative Literature and, from 1989 to 1993, directed the university's Center for Japanese Studies. He published translations and edited selections of Japanese literature for ''The Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces,'' writing introductions to guide Western readers.
        He is survived by his parents, Donald and Mary, and two sisters, Christina Denton of Hinsdale, Ill., and Catharine Zoufal of Western Springs, Ill.
