        Cantor Samuel Rosenbaum, a Yiddish poet and composer and a founder and past president of the Cantors Assembly, died on March 23 in Rochester General Hospital. He was 77 and a resident of Rochester, where he served as cantor of Temple Beth El from 1946 until retiring 10 years ago.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Cantor Rosenbaum was a leader in the court fight to win government recognition for cantors as members of the clergy. He was one of 10 cantors who formed the Cantors Assembly at Jewish Theological Seminary in 1947 and saw it grow into the world's largest body of Jewish prayer leaders.
        He is survived by his wife, Ina Levi Rosenbaum; two sons, Michael, of Manhattan, and David, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Judith Witt of Evanston, Ill., and three grandchildren.
