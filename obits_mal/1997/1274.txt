        Vic Lombardi, who was part of a pitching staff that carried the Brooklyn Dodgers to one pennant and part of a trade that helped them win three others, died Wednesday at Community Hospital in Fresno, Calif., following heart surgery. He was 75.
        Lombardi, a left-hander who stood 5 feet 7 inches and weighed 158 pounds, was promoted to the Dodgers in 1945 and was a reliable starting pitcher for them for three seasons. Never overpowering, he posted records of 10-11, 13-10 and 12-11 in his first three seasons in the majors -- all with Brooklyn.
        The Dodgers lost the National League pennant to the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946, but they won it in 1947 with a staff headed by the rookie Ralph Branca and bolstered by Harry Taylor, Joe Hatten and Lombardi, with Hugh Casey in relief. That team took the Yankees to seven games before losing the World Series.
        Lombardi started two games at Yankee Stadium. He lost Game 2 after being chased in the fifth inning, then was knocked out in the third inning of Game 6 before the Dodgers came back to win with the aid of a memorable catch in left field by Al Gionfriddo against Joe DiMaggio.
        The Series was not memorable for Lombardi, who yielded 14 hits and 9 runs in six and two-thirds innings. That winter Lombardi was traded, along with Dixie Walker and Hal Gregg, to the Pittsburgh Pirates for third baseman Billy Cox, pitcher Preacher Roe and infielder Gene Mauch. Cox and Roe were key pieces in the Dodger teams that won pennants in 1949, 1952 and 1953 and just missed in 1950 and 1951.
        Lombardi was 15-19 in three seasons with the Pirates, closing his major league career in 1950 with a 50-51 record and a 3.68 earned-run average.
        He finished his baseball days in the Pacific Coast League in 1960, when he tore a rotator cuff. He took up golf and, in 1967, won the Left-handed Open Golf Championship.
        He is survived by a daughter.
