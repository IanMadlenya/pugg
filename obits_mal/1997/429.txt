        Hugh Percival Henry Gough, an instrument maker who was an important figure in the world of early-music performance, died on Monday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 81.
        Mr. Gough was born in Heptonstall, Yorkshire, England, in 1916, and earned a degree in economics at University College in London in 1937. During his student years, he was attracted to the nascent early-music world and took clavichord lessons from Arnold Dolmetsch, the pioneering musicologist and instrument builder. With guidance from Dolmetsch, he built his first clavichord in 1932 and his first harpsichord in 1935.
        After wartime service in the Royal Air Force, Mr. Gough became secretary of Sulgrave Manor, the ancestral home of George Washington. In 1946 he began building harpsichords and clavichords professionally. Later he expanded his line to include lutes, which he played himself, and reconstructions of early pianos.
        One of Mr. Gough's early assistants, Frank Hubbard, opened his own harpsichord workshop in Boston with William Dowd in 1949. In 1958, Mr. Gough spent six months working at the Hubbard & Dowd workshop, and the next year he moved to Manhattan and opened his own shop in Greenwich Village.
        Mr. Gough collected old instruments, studied them meticulously and modeled his own keyboards and lutes on period originals.
        He is survived by his wife, Christabel Gough.
