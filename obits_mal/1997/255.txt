        Carroll James Jr., a Washington  disk jockey whose promotion of the Beatles on his radio program helped make the group famous in the United States in the weeks before its first appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' in 1964, died on Monday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 60 and lived in Silver Spring.
        The Associated Press reported that the cause was cancer.
        Mr. James was a young disk jockey at radio station WWDC in December 1963, and when reports of Beatlemania in England began to reach the United States, he asked a British Airways flight attendant to bring him a copy of the group's current single, ''I Want to Hold Your Hand.'' When he played the song, the tremendous response helped persuade Capitol Records to release the disk in the United States earlier than it had planned.
        Mr. James won a place in Beatles mythology as the first disk jockey to play the group's records on American radio. But D. L. MacLaughlan, a Beatles researcher at U.C.L.A., has found playlists and top-40 charts from radio stations around the country that predate Mr. James's broadcast by as much as 10 months. The earliest was WLS in Chicago, which began playing ''Please Please Me'' in February 1963. Nevertheless, the Beatles and Capitol considered Mr. James's advocacy helpful, and invited him to be the master of ceremonies at the group's first American concert, at the Washington Coliseum.
        Mr. James was born in Frederick, Md., and began his broadcasting career while he was still in high school. He was a graduate of Princeton University and was a disk jockey at stations in Washington, Baltimore and Norfolk, Va., until 1969, when he became a freelance announcer.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth M. James; two daughters, Christine James Guelcher and Lauren James, of Bethesda, Md.; his parents, Carroll and Margaret James of Frederick, and a sister, Martha Nichols of Jarrettsville, Md.
