        William Joseph Manning, a retired senior partner in the Manhattan-based international law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, died after a long illness on March 1 at Jupiter Hospital in Jupiter, Fla., where he kept a winter home. He was 70 and lived in Garden City and Westhampton Beach, L.I.
        The cause was heart failure from pulmonary complications, his family said.
        Throughout his career, he litigated antitrust, banking, corporate and securities cases in Federal and state courts across the United States.
        Mr. Manning joined the firm in 1952 and became a partner in 1962, advancing to senior partner in 1968. He headed the firm's litigation department, served on its governing board and retired at the end of 1988. In 1983, he became a special master in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and continued in that position until his death.
        Mr. Manning was a past chairman of the American College of Trial Lawyers, a fellow of the American Bar Foundation and a member of the American Law Institute and the American Judicature Society. Mr. Manning graduated from St. John's School of Law in 1952.
        Mr. Manning is survived by his wife of 40 years, Maryanne Cullen Manning; three sons, William Jr. and Michael A., of Garden City, and John A., of Manhattan; three daughters, Maura G. Comerford of Manhattan, Marian T. Adams of Garden City and Mary E., of Manhattan; a sister, Margaret McCabe of the Bronx, and eight grandchildren.
