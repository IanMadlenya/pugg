        Joseph Kahn, who won awards for reporting at The New York Post, died on Tuesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan, where he had lived for three years. He was 84.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Lenore.
        Mr. Kahn attended City College and studied watercolor painting at the National Academy of Design. He joined The Post in 1942, was briefly a copy boy and then was a reporter until he retired in 1978.
        He and another Post reporter, William Haddad, were joint winners of a George Polk Memorial Award in 1959 for articles they wrote exposing abuses in New York City's slum clearance program. Mr. Kahn also received a Society of Silurians award for articles in 1971 on scandals in the Municipal Loan Program.
        After retiring, he taught journalism at the New School.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three sons, Richard, of Manhattan, Robert, of Ramsey, N.J., and William, of New Hyde Park, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
