        George Handy, an arranger and composer with a distinctive, rich musical vocabulary, died on Jan. 8 at Sullivan County Community General Hospital in Harris, N.Y. He was 76.
        The cause was heart disease, said his wife, Elaine Lewis.
        Mr. Handy is best known for a set of albums he collaborated on with the saxophonist Zoot Sims, for whom he was playing piano. Recorded in the 1950's and long out of print, ''Zoot,'' ''Zoot Plays Four Altos'' (which featured Mr. Sims overdubbing the orchestrations) and others in the set showed Mr. Handy's abilities with a reed section.
        Mr. Handy was influential in other ways as well, with a list of swing era associations that includes some of the best orchestras and bands of the time. After attending New York University and Juilliard, where he studied with Aaron Copland, he went on to play piano or arrange for Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Stan Kenton, the Dorsey brothers, Babe Russin, Gene Krupa, Jack Teagarden and Raymond Scott.
        For several years in the early 1940's, he provided music for Boyd Raeburn's progressive orchestra, giving it much of its harmonic personality.
        In 1946, he was named as the top  arranger in Downbeat and Metronome magazines; a year later, Esquire named him the best arranger of the year.
        He also composed for Paramount Studios and the Armed Forces Radio Service. The 1950 album ''The Jazz Scene'' featured his ''Bloos,'' an extended composition; the piece brought him more acclaim. In the 1960's, he wrote compositions for the New York Saxophone Quartet.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children.
