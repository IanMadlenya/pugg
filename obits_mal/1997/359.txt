        Samm Sinclair Baker, whose 30-odd self-improvement books counseled readers on how to help themselves to anything from svelte figures to good sex to making money by writing books, died on March 5 at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 87 and lived in Mamaroneck.
        He had suffered a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Baker, who had an earlier career in advertising as a copywriter and agency executive, changed professions in 1963 to write books but also continued as a self-employed personal business consultant.
        He teamed up with a number of diet and fitness experts to publish their best-selling advice.
        He was a co-author, with Dr. Irwin M. Stillman, of ''The Doctor's Quick Weight Loss Diet'' (1967), and ''The Doctor's Quick Inches-Off Diet'' (1969). With Dr. Herman Tarnower, he published ''The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet'' (1979).
        He joined Dr. Stillman for ''The Doctor's Quick Teen-Age Diet'' (1971) and ''Dr. Stillman's 14-Day Shape-Up Program'' (1973). Among his more recent titles, as sole author, was ''Erotic Focus: The New Way to Enhance Your Sexual Pleasure'' (1984). Mr. Baker published three mystery novels in the 1950's.
        He also wrote popular gardening books, like ''Miracle Gardening Encyclopedia'' (1961), ''Samm Baker's Clear and Simple Gardening Handbook'' (1964) and ''Gardening Dos and Don'ts'' (1970).
        He was born in Paterson, N.J., and was a 1929 economics graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. He went into advertising in Manhattan, starting as a copywriter and ending as president at the Kiesewetter, Baker, Hagedorn & Smith agency.
        In 1955, he joined the advertising agency of Donahue & Coe as a vice president and member of the executive staff.
        Mr. Baker is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Natalie Bachrach, an artist; a daughter, Wendy Cammer of Larchmont, N.Y.; a son, Jeffrey, of Newbury, Mass.; two grandsons, and a great-granddaughter.
