        Gregorio Weber, a biochemist at the University of Illinois who broke ground in an area of chemical analysis called fluorescent spectroscopy, died on July 18 at his home in Urbana, Ill. He was 81.
        The cause was acute leukemia, his family said.
        Dr. Weber's research, still going on at his death, spanned more than five decades at Cambridge University and, since 1962, at Illinois.
        He used fluorescent spectroscopy in novel ways to determine the structure and movement of molecules by measuring the emission of light from a substance.
        He developed a process that enabled him to design and synthesize fluorescent dyes for specific applications. His work enhanced the accuracy of now-common procedures like mammograms and blood analyses.
        He was among the first researchers to recognize and systematically investigate the dynamic properties of proteins. He approached the subject by employing a branch of science called energetics, which deals with the laws of energy and its transformations, an approach now widely used in protein chemistry and enzymology.
        Gregorio Weber was born in Buenos Aires and received his M.D. from the University of Buenos Aires in 1942.
        In 1947, he received a doctorate in biochemistry at Cambridge and remained there doing research until 1953. He continued his research at Sheffield University, in England, until Illinois recruited him.
        He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Dr. Weber's marriage to Shirley Nixon Weber ended in divorce.
        He is survived by three daughters, Alicia and Juliet Weber, both of Manhattan, and Rosalind Weber of New Haven.
