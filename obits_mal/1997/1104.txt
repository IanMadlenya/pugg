        Ira Howard Lustgarten, a Manhattan lawyer and an authority on trusts and estates law, died last Sunday at his East Side home. He was 86.
        The cause was cancer, said Augusta L. Packer, an officer of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, where Mr. Lustgarten headed the trusts and estates department since 1979.
        Mr. Lustgarten served on many committees of the state and city bar associations and his advice helped shape such legislation as the Surrogates Court Procedures Act.
        He was born in Manhattan, and he graduated from New York University in 1950 and from Columbia University Law School in 1958. He is survived by his wife, Rhoda Manne Lustgarten, and two daughters, Lise-Anne Schwartz of Alexandria, Va., and Nancy Lustgarten of Manhattan.
        Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday
        An obituary and headline yesterday about Ira H. Lustgarten, a Manhattan lawyer and authority on trusts and estates, misstated his age. He was 68, not 86.
