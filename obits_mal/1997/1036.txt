        John Reese Stevenson, an international lawyer who represented the United States at the Law of the Sea Conference in the 1970's and served as board president of the National Gallery of Art until 1993, died on Saturday at his home in Fort Worth, Tex. He was 76.
        The cause was multiple systems atrophy, his family said.
        Mr. Stevenson was a former chairman of the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell of New York. He joined the firm in 1950 and interspersed his private law career with lengthy, and increasingly weighty, stints as an adviser to the State Department.
        His public service culminated in assignments connected with efforts to draft an international convention for the high seas and the use of their  resources. The Government first  recruited him as a legal adviser with the rank of assistant Secretary of State in 1969.
        He advised American delegates to the United Nations General Assembly sessions of 1969 to 1974. He headed the United States delegation to the International Conference on Air Law in The Hague in 1970 and was a special Presidential representative and ambassador at the Law of the Sea Conference from 1973 to 1975.
        He sat on the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague from 1969 to 1979 and, again, from 1984 to 1990. He represented the United States in a case involving Namibia in 1970 and assisted in 1984 in arguments between the United States and Canada over where to draw the border in the Gulf of Maine.
        At the National Gallery of Art he headed the board of directors from 1978 to 1993, working with other countries and private institutions to arrange exhibits in Washington.
        Mr. Stevenson was born in Chicago and graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University in 1942. He received his law degree at Columbia University in 1949, adding a doctor of laws three years later.
        He was made a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell in 1956, became chairman and senior partner in 1979 and served as counsel from then until 1992. Among the many international matters he dealt with were property claims in Eastern Europe and the promotion of private enterprise in Latin America through joint ventures.
        He was counsel to the underwriters in the sale of Ford Motor Company stock by the Ford Foundation in the mid-1950's. His expertise also covered foreign securities issues: he worked with European companies in the 1950's and with the Sony Corporation on the first Japanese equity financing in the United States.
        Mr. Stevenson is survived by his wife, Ruth Carter Stevenson, whom he married in 1983; four children, Elizabeth Sevenson of San Francisco, Sally S. Fischer of Caracas, Venezuela; John R. Jr. of Woodacre, Calif., and Patience S. Scott of Locust Valley, N.Y.; and four grandchildren. Also surviving are 5 stepchildren and their 13 children. His first wife, the former Patience Fullerton, died in 1982 after 39 years of marriage.
