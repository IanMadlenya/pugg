        Daniel G. Ross, a lawyer and volunteer who supported education in Israel and services for Jewish immigrants in the United States, died on Monday at his Manhattan apartment. He was 93.

        A lifelong supporter of education, he was president of the American Friends of Hebrew University in Jerusalem and a member of the board at Tel Aviv University, raising millions of dollars for scientific and religious studies at both institutions.
        Under his direction, money was raised to create a new religious center on the campus of Hebrew University in the late 1950's. He also headed a campaign to raise more than $60 million for the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in 1955.
        He was a former president of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism.
        Along with his wife of 63 years, Grace, he was a founder of the Smith College Jewish Studies Program and a supporter of programs at Yale and Columbia Universities.
        A native of New York, he received a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1920 and a law degree from Columbia in 1924.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, James J., also of Manhattan; two daughters, Ann Loeb of Manhattan and Lynn Rosenfeld of Los Angeles; seven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
