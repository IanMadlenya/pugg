        Archie E. Albright, one of the first senior corporate managers recruited by Wall Street in the bull markets of the 1960's, died Tuesday at his home in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 76. The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Albright worked for several investment banking companies after a 14-year career at the Stauffer Chemical Company. He was hired at Stauffer in 1953 as an assistant to the president. He rose to executive vice president and was credited with helping to take sales from $65 million to more than $800 million during his tenure.
        Mr. Albright then embarked on a second career on Wall Street.
        In 1968, he was recruited by the investment banking firm Kuhn, Loeb & Company, where he was a general partner in the corporate finance department. A year later he became president and chief executive of Glore Forgan, William R. Staats. He became chairman, president and chief executive of Drexel Firestone Inc. in 1972 and two years later negotiated the merger of Drexel with Burnham & Company to form Drexel Burnham Inc., of which he became vice chairman and chairman of the finance committee. The firm later became Drexel Burnham Lambert. He resigned in 1977 to form his own investment company.
        In 1984, Mr. Albright left Wall Street to serve as the president and chief executive of the nonpartisan Foreign Policy Association in New York City. From 1988 until his death  he led two technology companies.
        Mr. Albright was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in economics from Wittenberg College. He attended Yale Law School and practiced law for Patterson, Belknap & Webb in New York City before joining Stauffer Chemical.
        Mr. Albright is survived by a son, John S., of Weston, Conn.; two daughters, Anne R. of Wayne, Pa., and Catherine A. of Flagstaff, Ariz., and five grandchildren.
