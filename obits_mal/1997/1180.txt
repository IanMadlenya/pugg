        Meyer Berger, a self-made businessman, philanthropist and national fund-raiser for the Democratic Party, died on Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 85.
        He had been in failing health for six years and had suffered a series of strokes, his family said.
        Mr. Berger, known as Mickey to his political friends, built his fortune as head of an industrial supplies business, the M. Berger Company, and ample real estate holdings. He supported local, state and national Democratic candidates from Adlai E. Stevenson to Bill Clinton and served as a national officer of Americans for Democratic Action.
        A native of Cleveland, he studied for a law degree at Ohio State University but had to drop out in the Depression and became a traveling salesman. Starting with drugstore sundries, he moved into military surplus equipment, factory supplies and warehousing.
        Mr. Berger was a benefactor of local institutions like the Pittsburgh Public Theater. He also served as an officer of the United Jewish Federation, the International Center for Peace in the Middle East and the American Civil Liberties Union.
        He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Merle Ganger Berger; a son, Michael N. Berger, and a daughter, Susan B. Smerd, both of Pittsburgh, and four grandchildren.
