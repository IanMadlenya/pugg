        A. Everette MacIntyre, who served on the Federal Trade Commission for 12 years, died June 5 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 96.
        As an F.T.C. trial lawyer from 1930 until 1954, Mr. MacIntyre participated in 32 antitrust cases and became chief of the commission's antitrust trials division. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the commission. President Richard M. Nixon issued an executive order exempting Mr. MacIntyre from mandatory retirement at age 70, and Mr. MacIntyre resigned in 1973, at age 72.
        Early in his career, Mr. MacIntyre served as chief counsel to an investigating committee of the House of Representatives that was looking into monopolistic practices at various corporations. The investigation produced much of the evidence that was considered by the legislative committees that wrote the Robinson-Partman Act of 1936, which prohibits discriminatory pricing by sellers of goods to buyers.
        Mr. MacIntyre was staff director and then general counsel of the House Small Business Committee from 1955 until he joined the F.T.C.
        After leaving the F.T.C., Mr. MacIntyre practiced law in Washington for 15 years, most recently with the law firm of McKean & MacIntyre.
        Mr. MacIntyre received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a law degree from George Washington University Law School.
        His wife of 66 years, Reita Jane MacIntyre, died in 1995.
