        Robert D. Campbell, a former chairman, publisher and president of Newsweek magazine, died of complications from Parkinson's disease on Monday in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., his son, William, said. He was 79.
        Mr. Campbell, who spent three decades with Newsweek before he retired in 1979, began his career with the magazine as an advertising salesman in California. After holding a broad range of executive posts, in 1966 he was named managing director of Newsweek International. Six years later he was appointed publisher of Newsweek. He added the title of president in 1975 and became chairman the following year. He remained a consultant to the magazine for five years after his retirement.
        Mr. Campbell was a graduate of Northwestern University, was a fighter pilot during World War II and was involved in the Berlin airlift in 1948-49. He was recalled to active duty during the Korean War and held the rank of brigadier general (retired) in the Air Force.
        Mr. Campbell is survived by his wife, the former Julia Briggs, of Rancho Santa Fe; a daughter, Julia C. Campbell, of Stratford, Conn., and a son, William D. Campbell, of Jersey City.
