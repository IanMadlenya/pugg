        Richard Tousey, a solar physicist who used a captured World War II V-2 rocket to take the first photographs of the Sun's ultraviolet spectrum from beyond the atmosphere, died on Tuesday at Prince Georges Hospital Center in Maryland. He was 88 and had lived in Mitchellville, Md.
        At the Naval Research Laboratory, Dr. Tousey concentrated on solar experiments aboard rockets and orbiting laboratories. In what he considered the high point of his career, he helped oversee experiments aboard Skylab that allowed for prolonged observations of the Sun.
        Dr. Tousey joined the research laboratory in 1941 after teaching physics at Tufts University in Boston, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1928. In 1933 he received a Ph.D. in optical physics from Harvard University.
        Dr. Tousey is survived by a sister, Katharine Tousey, of Essex, Mass.; a daughter, Joanna Tousey of Tucson, Ariz.; three grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. His wife, Ruth, died in 1994.
