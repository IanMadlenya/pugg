        Emery Deutsch, a violinist, songwriter and orchestra leader who had his first success in the early days of radio broadcasting, died on Wednesday at the Villa Maria rehabilitation center in Miami. He was 91.
        In a career of 60-some years, Mr. Deutsch wrote more than 80 songs, including ''Play Fiddle Play'' and ''When a Gypsy Makes His Violin Cry,'' which became his theme song. In the 1940's, 50's and 60's, he and his orchestra were a perennial attraction at hotels and nightclubs around the country, including the Ritz-Carlton in New York City and the Mayflower in Washington. In New York, he also appeared at the Copacabana, the Paramount Theater and Radio City Music Hall.
        Mr. Deutsch, who was born in Budapest, came to the United States with his family when he was 8 and grew up in Cleveland. He was a graduate of the Juilliard School of Music.
        Soon after graduation he became the music director of a small radio station in Queens. In 1929, the station was bought by William S. Paley and became the nucleus of the Columbia Broadcasting System. Mr. Deutsch was made music director of the new network, a post he held for 11 years. Artists who joined CBS under his aegis included Bing Crosby, Benny Goodman and Andre Kostelanetz.
        Mr. Deutsch moved to Miami in 1971 and continued to perform at hotels and clubs until 1995.
        He is survived by his companion, Dame Jean Loach of Miami; two sons, Gregory and Christopher; a brother, Arnold, and a sister, Rose Frankel, all of New York City.
