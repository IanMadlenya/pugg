        Seth McCoy, a tenor known for his thoughtful performances in oratorios and orchestral concerts and also appeared in opera late in his career, died on Wednesday at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was 68 and lived in Pittsford, N.Y., a Rochester suburb.
        The cause was complications from a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. McCoy was born in Sanford, N.C., and moved several times before settling in Cleveland. Although he had performed in churches and with a quintet called the Jubilee Singers (a successor to the famous Fisk Jubilee Singers), he had no intention of becoming a musician. After serving in the Army during the Korean War, he studied to become a barber while working evenings as a postal clerk, a job he held for 13 years.
        But after an invitation to audition for Robert Shaw, he became a soloist with the Robert Shaw Chorale, touring the United States and South America. Eventually he moved to New York City, becoming a permanent soloist with the Bach Aria Group. He appeared with the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra, among others, and sang at major American festivals including Tanglewood, Aspen, the Hollywood Bowl and the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center.
        Mr. McCoy did not make his debut with a professional opera company until he was 50, when he sang the role of Tamino in Mozart's ''Magic Flute'' during a live broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera. He also appeared in the American premieres of Janacek's ''Katya Kabanova,'' Joplin's ''Treemonisha'' and Penderecki's ''Utrenja.'' In 1982 he became a voice professor at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Gunter-McCoy, and his mother, Pauline Jackson, both of Rochester.
