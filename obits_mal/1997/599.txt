        Frederic W. West Jr., who rose through the sales ranks of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation to become president and, later, a vice chairman, died last Saturday at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute Inc. in Tampa, Fla. He was 78 years old and had been living in retirement in Vero Beach, Fla.
        Mr. West's wife, Ruth, said he died of complications following surgery for a hernia. She said he had not been suffering with cancer but had been referred to the Moffitt Center by his  physician in Vero Beach.
        Mr. West began his career at Bethlehem in 1941 after graduating from Cornell University, where he played tackle on the school's Ivy League championship team and threw the discus and shot put on the track team. He turned down offers to play professional football, Mrs. West said, because ''he wanted to go into business.''
        After less than a year at Bethlehem, Mr. West enlisted in the Army as World War II was widening. He went through officers candidate school and served in Europe, where he was involved in several major operations including the Battle of the Bulge. He was decorated with a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart.
        Back in the United States, Mr. West was assigned as a salesman to Bethlehem's Detroit office.
        Mr. West was recalled for military service for two years during the Korean War. Then he returned to the steel company and remained there until his retirement in 1980, nearly 40 years after he had joined Bethlehem as a management trainee.
        He was named president in 1974 and was promoted to vice chairman three years later.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Barbara Ann West of Knoxville, Tenn.; three sons, Frederic W. West 3d of Asheville, N.C., John R. West of Knoxville, and William H. West of Washington, D.C.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
