        Pedro de Castro Van Dunem, a former Angolan Foreign Minister who led important negotiations for his country's Government, died on Tuesday in Luanda, the Angolan capital. He was 55.
        The cause was a heart attack, said the French newspaper Le Monde, which reported his death in its Saturday issue.
        At his death, Mr. Van Dunem was the Minister of Public Works and Town Planning in the current Government.
        He was born in the province of Bengo, was trained as an engineer specializing in electronics and was a co-worker of Agostinho Neto, who founded the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola. It became a guerrilla organization leading the struggle for independence from Portugal. The movement went on to hold power for more than a decade after Angola became independent in 1975.
        Mr. Van Dunem held various Cabinet posts, including Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for the administration of the provinces.
        In 1988, he led a delegation of high-ranking officials to Washington to let it be known that they were willing to negotiate the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angolan territory without first getting an assurance that the United States would stop supporting guerrillas in Angola. The Cuban troops had been invited in as a bulwark against South African forces stationed in Namibia.
        In 1990, as Foreign Minister, he was among top Angolan officials who met in Washington with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union in an effort to end the civil war in Angola.
        Early this month, Mr. Van Dunem represented Angola's current Presi ent, Jose Eduardo Dos Santos, at a  meeting of government leaders in the Development Community of Southern Africa in Blantyre, Malawi.
        Information about his survivors was not immediately available.
