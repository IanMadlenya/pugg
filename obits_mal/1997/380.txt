        Ernest Goodman, a Detroit lawyer specializing in First Amendment and civil rights cases who served as president of the National Lawyers Guild, died last Wednesday at Harper Hospital in Detroit. He was 90.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage.
        Mr. Goodman practiced the law in Detroit for nearly seven decades. At his death he was a member of Goodman, Eden, Millender & and Bedrosian, one of the country's oldest interracial law partnerships.
        He defended sitdown strikers at the Ford Motor Company in the 1930's, served as associate general counsel for the United Automobile Workers union in the 1940's and argued labor and civil rights cases before the Supreme Court. He mobilized fellow lawyers against racial segregation in the Deep South and around the country and won an acquittal in 1975 in the main trial stemming from the uprising at the Attica penitentiary in upstate New York. He was also a defender of anti-war protesters during the Vietnam War.
        Throughout, he was active in the National Lawyers Guild, a nationwide organization noted for its concern with liberal and leftist causes and equal rights.
        A native of Hemlock, Mich., he received a law degree from Wayne State University in 1928, the year he was admitted to the Michigan bar.
        He is survived by his wife of 65 years, Freda; their sons Richard and William, both lawyers in Detroit, and eight grandchildren.
