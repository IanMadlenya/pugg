        John Brailsford Elliott, a former chairman of the National Data Corporation who was a leading collector of Chinese art, died on July 25 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. He lived in Princeton, N.J.,  and was 69.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Although Mr. Elliott's career was in finance, he was an avid and lifelong collector of Asian art, assembling a collection of Chinese calligraphy and painting that has been described as one of the most important of its kind outside Asia.
        Works from the collection were included in the exhibition ''Chinese Calligraphy,'' organized by the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1971, and in ''Traces of the Brush,'' at the Yale University Art Gallery in 1977. In 1984, 70 paintings in the Elliott collection were the subject of the exhibition ''Images of the Mind,'' organized by the Art Museum of Princeton University. Princeton is preparing a scholarly catalogue of the collection for a 1999 exhibition that will later travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Elliott was born in Los Angeles. He graduated from Philips Exeter Academy in 1945 and went to Harvard, but after one semester left for Europe. There he worked as a volunteer for the Society of Friends in France and Germany for two years. He graduated from Princeton in 1951, taking courses in Chinese art while majoring in medieval history.
        After a stint in the Army and further travel, he joined his father's investment firm, Elliott & Company, in 1958. He became a member of the New York Stock Exchange.
        Mr. Elliott is survived by a brother, David L. Elliott, of Yarmouth, Me.; an uncle, Robert Brailsford, of Twin Falls, Idaho, and seven nephews and five nieces.
