        Ned A. Ostenso, a geophysicist who was assistant administrator of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research in Washington, died on April 13 at a Washington hospital. He was 66 and had lived in Washington.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Grace Laudon Ostenso.
        Dr. Ostenso retired last year from the agency, which is the research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Research Administration, where he had been the chief scientist. Earlier he was with the Office of Naval Research and was assistant Presidential science adviser.
        His research included helping to determine the mass of the Antarctic ice sheet. An Antarctic mountain is named for him, and he won an American Geophysical Union medal for extraordinary service.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Mary Ellen Jondle of Wales, Wis., and Ruth Lundeen of Edina, Minn., and a brother, Donald of Rochester, Minn..
