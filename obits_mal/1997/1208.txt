        Edwin Mansfield, a leading scholar of the economics of technological change, died on Monday at his home in Wallingford, Pa. He was 67.
        He died of cancer, according to a spokeswoman for W. W. Norton & Company, publisher of his economics textbooks, which were used by millions of college students.
        Investing government money in corporate research and development benefited the public far more than the private companies involved, according to Dr. Mansfield's research. But the technological advances that produced the biggest economic gains since World War II, he found, were not high-tech innovations, but low-tech developments that made clothing more affordable.
        A consultant to corporations, governments and agencies like the World Bank, Dr. Mansfield was director of the Center for Economics and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught until last month. He joined the university as a professor of economics in 1964 after teaching at Carnegie-Mellon, Yale and Harvard.
        Dr. Mansfield received a number of honors for his scholarship, including the Special Creativity Award from the National Science Foundation, as well as Fulbright and Ford Foundation fellowships. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Dartmouth College, he earned a diploma from the Royal Statistical Society and a doctorate from Duke University.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucile Howe Mansfield; a son, Edward, of Columbus, Ohio; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Gambier, Ohio, and a grandchild.
