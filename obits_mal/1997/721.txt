        Daniel J. Lyons, who rose from an assistant actuary to become chairman of the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America, died last Thursday at his home in Princeton, N.J. Mr. Lyons was 92 years old.
        After graduating with a mathematics degree from Harvard University in 1926, Mr. Lyons began his career as an actuary. He worked for two other insurance companies and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance before joining Guardian Life in 1943 as an assistant actuary. He rose steadily up the management ranks to become president in 1964. Two years later, Mr. Lyons was named chairman and chief executive, positions he held until he retired from the company in 1971.
        After his retirement from Guardian Life, Mr. Lyons remained active in the insurance industry, serving as an executive for smaller companies and in professional associations. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Actuaries.
        Mr. Lyons is survived by his wife of 64 years, Irene M. Lyons; two daughters, Jean L. Entwistle of New York City and Irene L. Madden of McLean, Va.; two sons, Daniel J. Lyons Jr. of Princeton, and Paul O. Lyons of Doylestown, Pa., and his sister, Sister Marion Lyons.
