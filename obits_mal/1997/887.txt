        William H. Jordy, one of the first historians to chronicle the rise of modern architecture in the United States, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Riverside, R.I. He was 79.
        The cause was heart failure while swimming in his pool, said Mardges Bacon, a former colleague at Brown University, where Mr. Jordy taught.
        Mr. Jordy was a revered figure among students of American architecture. His writings on the work of Marcel Breuer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and other prominent modernists charted the impact of European architects on American design and education in the postwar years. A frequent contributor to The New Criterion and the British periodical Architectural Review, he was esteemed as a stylist as well as a scholar. His essays highlighted the symbolic and humanist aspects of an architectural style once regarded as purely functionalist.
        Mr. Jordy was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1918. He was educated at Bard College, New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and Yale University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1948. He taught at Yale until 1955, when he joined the faculty at Brown. At his death, he held the position of Henry Ledyard Goddard Professor Emeritus of Art History.
        In recent years, Mr. Jordy had become active at the Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture at Columbia University. ''He was completely open-minded about developments in architecture,'' said Joan Ockman, the center's director. ''He was completely honest, and could be critical, but he was always constructive.'' The Buell Center plans to publish a collection of Mr. Jordy's essays next year.
        Mr. Jordy's books include ''Henry Adams: Scientific Historian'' (1952) and two volumes in the series ''American Buildings and Their Architects'' (1972). He was also co-editor, with Ralph Coe, of an anthology of the writings of the architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler (1961).
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah Spock Jordy.
