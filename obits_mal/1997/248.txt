        Sidney Squire, whose law career in New York City covered more than 60 years, including 21 as a judge, died on Feb. 12 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The cause was pancreatic cancer, family members said. He was 90 and lived in Manhattan.
        As a member of the New York State Court of Claims, he was the senior judge in New York City from 1956 to 1977, when he reached the mandatory retirement age.
        Before he joined the bench, he held several political positions, including executive deputy secretary of state in 1955, the first year of the W. Averell Harriman administration.
        In 1977 he returned to private practice, working in litigation and trusts and estates, in Manhattan. He practiced law until 1996 when illness forced him to retire.
        Born in Manhattan, he attended St. Lawrence University and received a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1928.
        During World War II, he enlisted as a private in the Army. After the war, he returned to his law practice and became a senior partner in Squire & Leavitt.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Friedman Squire of Manhattan; two sons, Walter C. Squire of Manhattan and Jason E. Squire of Los Angeles; a brother, Boris Squire of Boynton Beach, Fla., a sister, Ida Sprafkin of Kingspoint, N.Y., and four grandsons.
