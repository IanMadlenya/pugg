        Dr. Christopher Pavlides, the chief orthopedic surgeon at Wyckoff Heights Hospital in Brooklyn, died on Thursday night when the plane he was piloting crashed just after takeoff in Virginia. He was 66 and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.
        His wife, Hetty Hardin, and two friends, David and Angela Freeman of Glen Cove, also died in the crash.
        Dr. Pavlides had just dropped off one of his granddaughters in Chesapeake, Va., and was flying on to Atlanta to visit Ms. Hardin's daughter when his twin-engine Piper Aerostar crashed. The surgeon had more than 20 years of flying experience.
        Dr. Pavlides was born in Jamaica, Queens, the son of immigrants from Cyprus. He graduated with a degree in education from City College in 1953. He received his medical degree  from the State University's Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn in 1964 and trained in his specialty at hospitals in Brooklyn and on Long Island.
        Dr. Pavlides taught orthopedic surgery at Downstate in the 1970's and 1980's. He served as chief orthopedic surgeon at Wyckoff Heights Hospital for more than a dozen years and also worked in private practice.
        He never lost his passion for sports or flying, his family said. He played in squash tournaments around the country and had recently taken up golf.
        Dr. Pavlides is survived by two brothers, George and Paul, both of Manhasset, L.I.; three daughters, Nicole Gildon of Virginia Beach, Va., Simone Munoco of Rome and Karla Pavlides of Glen Cove, and two grandchildren.
