        James G. Shennan, a former president of the Elgin National Watch Company, died May 24 at the Presbyterian Home in Evanston, Ill. He was 86.
        A longtime resident of Wayne, Ill., Mr. Shennan joined Elgin, one of the oldest companies in Illinois, shortly after graduating from Princeton University in 1932.
        Rising through the ranks, from foreman to vice president, Mr. Shennan helped the company convert to production of military watches during World War II. He was named president of the company in 1948.
        He was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French Government for his involvement in the development of the first electronic watch.
        In 1962 Mr. Shennan left Elgin to form the Weldstar Company, a welding-supply business in Aurora, Ill.
        A past president and longtime board member of the National Association of Manufacturers, Mr. Shennan served as village president of Wayne and was active in civic affairs for more than 50 years.
        He is survived by two sons, James G. Shennan Jr. of Atherton, Calif., and Jerome R. Shennan of Longmont, Colo.; two daughters, Melissa A. Shennan of Chicago and Elizabeth Shennan Loring of Prides Crossing, Mass., and seven grandchildren.
