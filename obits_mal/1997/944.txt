        Mr. Avrett was also the creative director of the ''tiny time pills'' campaign for Contac cold capsules when he was at Foote, Cone & Belding.
        Mr. Avrett graduated from the Grady College of Journalism at the University of Georgia in 1951 and started in retail advertising at Rich's Department Store in Atlanta, and later Stern's in New York.
        He started his agency career at Grey Advertising, and was creative director at Foote, Cone & Belding and Wells, Rich, Greene. In 1969, Mr. Avrett was named president of Marschalk, a division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
        He is survived by his wife, who lives in New York; a stepson, G. W. T. Reynolds of Seattle, and a brother, Dr. Eugene Avrett of North Andover, Mass.
