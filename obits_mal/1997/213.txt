        John E. Tobin, a retired corporate lawyer and founding partner in the New York office of Dorsey & Whitney of Minneapolis, died on Jan. 19 at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 73 and lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Tobin, a graduate of Columbia Law School, joined Dorsey in 1984, setting up its New York office and supervising it for four years. He retired as a senior partner in 1993.
        His work concentrated on mergers, acquisitions, proxy contests and  stockholder and class-action litigation.
        He started in 1950 with Donovan Leisure Newton & Irvine in New York, which named him a partner in 1954. In 1952 and 1953, he was chief counsel to a House Ways and Means subcommittee that investigated scandals concerning the Internal Revenue Service.
        He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Margaret Swope Tobin; three sons, John Jr., of Concord, N.H., Brian D., of Allendale, N.J., and Paul C., of North Attleboro, Mass., and nine grandchildren.
