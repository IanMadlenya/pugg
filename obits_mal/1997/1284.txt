        Kermit Goell, a songwriter, died on Thursday in Portland, Me. He was 82.
        Mr. Goell was perhaps best known as the lyricist for the 1947 hit ''Near You,'' with music by Francis Craig. It was a big seller not only for Craig and his band but also for the Andrews Sisters and, 10 years later, for Roger Williams.
        Mr. Goell was born in Brooklyn. He received a bachelor of science degree in agriculture from Cornell University and served in the Army Air Forces during World War II.
        In addition to writing songs, he  maintained an interest in archeology and helped excavate several ancient Turkish sites with his sister, Theresa, an archeologist.
        His other songs included ''Huggin' and Chalkin' '' (1945), with Clancy Hayes, a novelty tune recorded by Kay Kyser, Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer, and ''One Finger Melody'' (1950), written with Al Hoffman and Fred Spielman, which became a hit for Frank Sinatra.
        He is survived by his wife, Cathy, of New York City; a daughter, Julie, of Portland, and a son, Jonathan, of Takoma Park, Md.
