        Stanley Grover, a longtime supporting player on Broadway and in numerous touring musicals who also acted in films and on television, died on Aug. 24 at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he lived. He was 71.
        Early in his career, Mr. Grover, who was born in Woodstock, Ill., was a winner on ''Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts.'' He made his Broadway debut in 1951 in the chorus of ''Seventeen'' and soon joined the national touring company of ''South Pacific,'' ultimately playing the role of Lieutenant Cable in more than 75 cities.
        In 1956, Mr. Grover created the title role in the musical ''Candide'' in its first Broadway run. He appeared in musicals through the 1950's and 60's.
        He was a regular performer on the 60's television show ''That Was the Week That Was'' and appeared on numerous other series. Mr. Grover also played small roles in more than a dozen films, including ''Network'' (1976) and ''Being There'' (1979).
        He is survived by a daughter, Cindy Grover Nartatez of Kauai, Hawaii, and two sons, Steven, of Berkeley, Calif., and Jamie, of Santa Cruz, Calif.
        Correction:  September 26, 1997, Friday
        An obituary on Monday about Stanley Grover, an actor, misstated his performance history. He did not create the title role in the 1956 Broadway musical ''Candide''; the part was played by Robert Rounseville.
