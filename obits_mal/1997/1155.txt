        Robert M. Bleiberg, who retired in 1991 after long service as editor, publisher and editorial director of Barron's, the weekly business and financial newspaper, died Monday at New York Hospital. The cause of death was leukemia, according to Dow Jones & Company, which publishes Barron's and The Wall Street Journal.
        He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        A big, affable man, Mr. Bleiberg joined Barron's in 1946 after serving in the United States Army infantry in World War II and being wounded in Okinawa. He was named editor in 1954 and held the position through 1981. In 1980, he was given additional responsibility as vice president of the Dow Jones magazine group, and later that year he was named publisher of Barron's.
        He remained publisher until 1989 and was editorial director from 1982 until he retired at the end of 1991.
        Under Mr. Bleiberg's direction, Barron's circulation grew fivefold, to almost 300,000. As editor, he read everything that appeared in the weekly, copy-edited much of it and wrote a weekly column until the day he retired.
        His column often reflected his free-market philosophy.
        Born in Brooklyn in 1924, Mr. Bleiberg graduated from Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan and from Columbia University. He also graduated from the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration, which has been known as the Leonard N. Stern School of Business since 1988.
        Mr. Bleiberg received the alumni achievement award from the N.Y.U. Graduate School of Business Administration, in 1981. In 1985, he received the Elliott V. Bell Award by the New York Financial Writers Association for his long-term contribution to financial journalism.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Diane Beverly; a daughter, Ellen Van Landingham Smith of Colorado Springs; a son, Richard, of New York, and a brother, Lawrence, of Greenwich, Conn.
