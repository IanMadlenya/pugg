        Max Waldgeir, a former administrator of social services in New York City, died on Oct. 30 at Northridge Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Formerly of Douglaston, Queens, he was 80 and lived in Boca Raton.
        The cause was complications from bypass surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Waldgeir was First Deputy Commissioner of social services under Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, from 1970 until Mayor Edward I. Koch replaced him in April 1978. Later, he was an adjunct professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Social Work and Florida Atlantic University.
        Mr. Waldgeir was born in New York. He graduated from City College and earned an M.S. in economics from Brooklyn College. In 1949, he received his master's in social work from Columbia, where he taught part-time in the 60's.
        He started working for the city as a caseworker in 1940 and rose to supervisor at the Kingsbridge Experimental Welfare Center before moving to the State Social Services Department. Mr. Waldgeir directed a suburban office and, in 1968, the city division, when he returned to the city as a deputy commissioner. In 1970, he became First Deputy Commissioner.
        He is survived by two daughters, Marian Graber of Westin, Fla., and Diane Perlberg of Atlanta; a brother, Irving, also of Boca Raton, and five grandchildren.
