        Brian Keith, the gruff, sturdy character actor whose roles in films and on television ranged from Western gunslingers and small-town police chiefs to private eyes and the Manhattan bachelor uncle raising three children in ''Family Affair,'' was found dead yesterday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 75.
        Sgt. Noel Lanier, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said Mr. Keith appeared to have committed suicide, The Associated Press reported. The actor had been suffering from cancer, said a spokeswoman for his manager, Bob Schiller.
        Mr. Keith made his film debut at age 3, but his adult career, spanning more than 35 years beginning in 1953, brought him his greatest popularity as the star of a succession of television series.
        In addition to ''Family Affair,'' which ran from 1966 to 1971, these included ''Crusader'' (1955-56), ''The Westerner'' (1960), ''The Brian Keith Show'' (1972-74), ''Lew Archer'' (1975), ''Hardcastle & McCormick'' (1983-86), ''Pursuit of Happiness'' (1987-88) and ''Heartland'' (1989).
        ''Series come and series go, but Mr. Keith persistently lingers on,'' John J. O'Connor wrote in his review in The New York Times of the debut of ''Archer,'' in which Mr. Keith, grumpy and stone-faced, played the detective created by Ross Macdonald.
        Beginning with ''Pied Piper Malone'' in 1924, Mr. Keith made more than 40 films. His adult career began in 1953 with the western ''Arrowhead.'' He played a homicidal rancher in ''The Violent Men'' (1955). Among his many other films were ''Five Against the House'' (1955), ''The Young Philadelphians'' (1959), ''The Parent Trap'' (1961), ''The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming'' and ''Nevada Smith'' in 1966, ''Reflections in a Golden Eye'' (1967), ''The Wind and the Lion'' (1975), in which Mr. Keith played Theodore Roosevelt, and ''Young Guns'' (1988).
        In recent years, he lent his voice to a number of television commercials.
        Mr. Keith, whose full name was Robert Brian Keith Jr., was born in Bayonne, N.J. His father, Robert, was a Broadway and silent screen actor who also wrote plays and dialogue for early films before appearing in a succession of Hollywood productions from the early 1930's to 1961.
        As a young man, Brian Keith acted in stock productions and on radio before serving as a machine gunner in the Marines during World War II. His Broadway credits included ''Mr. Roberts'' and ''Darkness at Noon.''
        He is survived by his wife, Victoria Young, an actress.
