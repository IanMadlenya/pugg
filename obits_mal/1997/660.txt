        Benson Ellison Lane Timmons 3d, who was United States Ambassador to Haiti as the Duvalier regime tightened its reign of terror in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 81 and had been living in Southampton in retirement.
        The cause was a stroke he suffered at the hospital while recovering from pneumonia, his family said.
        Lane Timmons, as he was known, was born in Sapulka, Okla., and graduated from the University of Georgia in 1937, and, as a Rhodes Scholar, from Oxford in 1941. He joined the Treasury Department, dealing with assets owned by Axis nationals, but then spent the rest of World War II as an Army officer in the military government branch.
        He returned to the Treasury and served with the Economic Cooperation Administration, the parent agency of the Marshall Plan. After he moved to the State Department, one of his responsibilities was to direct United States aid to the French forces in Indochina in the 1950's.
        He was posted to Stockholm and New Delhi, serving as deputy chief of mission, and in late 1963 arrived in Haiti as Ambassador. Dr. Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier had taken over the presidency after a sham election in 1961 and, in 1964, proclaimed himself President for Life.
        In 1967 he was made deputy secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, serving until his retirement in 1974. The organization provides liaison among industrialized countries on economic and fiscal policies and third world aid.
        Ambassador Timmons is survived by his wife of 33 years, Sanya Bezencenet Timmons; his sons, Peter of Washington, and Nicholas of Richmond; a stepdaughter, Nicola Lubitsch of San Antonio, and four grandchildren.
