        Kenneth P. Forbes, a stage and film actor who later became a newspaper executive in Suffolk County, died on Sunday in Muncy, Pa. He was 76 and lived in Hughesville, Pa.
        Mr. Forbes was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., a son of T. Harold Forbes and Carrie Forbes, a song-and-dance team that had turned to managing a string of weekly newspapers in Westchester County and on Long Island.
        He attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City, where he came to the attention of the playwright and director Moss Hart, who cast him in the 1941 Broadway production of ''Junior Miss.'' He later joined the cast of ''Strip for Action,'' a military comedy. He played a hapless lieutenant in the 1949 Broadway show ''At War With the Army,'' and when the play was retooled as the first screen vehicle for Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Mr. Forbes was asked to reprise his role.
        Soon afterward, he decided to leave acting and work for the family's newspaper chain, the News-Review Publishing Corporation. He became advertising manager and later a co-publisher. The company was sold to Cowles Communications in the 1970's.
        In 1942, he married Jane Morrissey, an actress. She died in 1969.
        Mr. Forbes is survived by his second wife, Patricia; three brothers, Harry, of San Antonio, Tex.; Clifford, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Charles, of Hampton, N.J.; two sons, Kenneth Jr., of Newburgh, Ind., and Representative Michael P. Forbes, a Republican from Quogue, N.Y.; two daughters, Jill F. Stubbs and Caroline Forbes, both of Hughesville; 11 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
