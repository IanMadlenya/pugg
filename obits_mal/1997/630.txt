        Dr. Francis Ferenc Foldes, the founding chairman of the department of anesthesiology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, died on May 19 at his home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. He was 86.
        The cause was melanoma, his family said.
        Dr. Foldes was known for his studies on muscle relaxants, local anesthetic agents, narcotics and myasthenia gravis. He was the first American to serve as president of the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists, and he was a past chairman of the medical board of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation..
        Dr. Foldes, who was also a professor of anesthesiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, served Montefiore as department chairman from 1962 until he reached emeritus status in both positions in 1975. He was the co-author of four books and the author of nearly 600 papers.
        He was the first scientist to receive both the Distinguished Service Award and the Award for Excellence in Research of the American Society of Anesthesiology. Francis Foldes was born in Budapest and received his medical degree at the University of Budapest in 1934. He came to the United States in 1941, completed his residency at Massachusetts General Hospital and from 1947 to 1962 directed the anesthesiology department at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Edith Ribary Foldes; three daughters, Eva Travers of Swarthmore, Pa., Judith Dickson of Burlington, Vt., and Barbara Wolkowitz of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a sister, Margit Salamon of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
