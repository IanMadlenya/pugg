        Howard Thomas Frazier, an organizer of people-to-people programs during the cold war and past president of the Consumer Federation of America, died on Tuesday at Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 85 and lived in Milford, Conn.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Frazier was executive director of Promoting Enduring Peace, in Woodmont, Conn. The organization, founded in 1952, sponsored friendship tours for Americans to the Soviet Union, China, Nicaragua, Cuba and Costa Rica, and Mr. Frazier became its executive director in 1974. The religious and educational entity now distributes materials relating to international peace and goodwill.
        A native of Etowah, Tenn., Mr. Frazier graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1935, after which he worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority. He served in the Army Air Force in the Pacific in World War II.
        He spent 19 years in the Department of Labor upholding fair wage standards until President Lyndon B. Johnson named him to his Commission on Consumer Interests in 1965. Mr. Frazier joined the White House staff three years later as administrative assistant for consumer protection and, after retiring from Government service, headed the Consumer Federation from 1970 to 1972.
        Mr. Frazier is survived by his wife of 23 years, Alice Zeigler Frazier; two daughters by an earlier marriage, Kate Frazier of Sebastopol, Calif., and Frances F. Elliott of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a brother, the Rev. Vernon Frazier of Laguna Hills, Calif.; a sister, Edith Redmond of Knoxville, Tenn.; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His first wife, Kate Douglas Green, died in 1965.
