        Dr. Graham Hawks, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Cornell University Medical College for many years, died on Feb. 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 85.
        The cause was lung cancer, family members said.
        From 1953 until retiring in 1984, he held a variety of positions at Cornell, including professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology, and at New York Hospital, where he was director of obstetrics from 1973 to 1979.
        He graduated from Colgate University in 1935 and from New York University School of Medicine in 1940. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Army in World War II.
        He also worked at Polyclinic Hospital and Women's Hospital in Manhattan. He was in private practice until he joined Cornell Medical College and New York Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, Margery; a son, Graham Jr., of Murphy, N.C.; a daughter, Ria Grace, of Englewood, N.J., and a brother, Byron, of Little Rock, Ark.
