        Robert L. Richards, a longtime executive at E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company who helped introduce cellophane to North America, died on March 8 at his home in Wilmington, Del. He was 98.
        Mr. Richards was affiliated with Du Pont for more than 50 years. Shortly after joining the company in 1923, he went to Europe as a member of the Du Pont team that acquired cellophane-manufacturing technology from a French company, La Cellophane S.A.
        He helped establish Du Pont's first cellophane factory, in Buffalo, and served as superintendent of Du Pont cellophane operations in Old Hickory, Tenn., and in Richmond.
        During World War II, Mr. Richards worked in Du Pont's explosives department and was involved in the company's efforts helping to produce the atomic bomb.
        In 1954, after serving as general manager of the rayon division, Mr. Richards became a Du Pont director and vice president and joined the company's executive committee. He retired from active service with Du Pont in 1961, remaining a board member until 1976.
        Du Pont abandoned the cellophane business in 1986, when it sold its last cellophane plant, in Tecumseh, Kan., to Flexel Inc.
        Mr. Richards, who graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1922, also served on the boards of the International Freighting Corporation and the Bank of Delaware.
        He is survived by a son, Robert L. Richards Jr. of Wilmington; three daughters -- Julia Ann Richards Ziegler of Carmel, Calif., Mary Alice Richards Wright of Chattanooga, Tenn., and Jane Elizabeth Richards Atkinson of Scarsdale, N.Y., and 12 grandchildren.
