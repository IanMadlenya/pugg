        Lewis M. Isaacs Jr., a prominent New York lawyer known for his expertise in housing law and co-op conversions, died on Saturday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. A resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, he was 89.
        He suffered a long illness, said Carol H. Isaacs, his daughter.
        Mr. Isaacs spent more than five decades practicing with the law firm of M. S. & I. S. Isaacs, once one of New York's oldest. He joined his father, then the senior member of the firm, upon his graduation from Columbia University Law School in 1931 and became a partner five years later, retiring in 1989, after which the firm was dissolved.
        He served as chairman of the Bar Association of the City of New York's Housing and Urban Development Committee, Rent Control Committee and Committee on Real Property Law. Until his retirement, he was an adviser to the Housing Court.
        Mr. Isaacs served on Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's Commission on Low-Income Housing and Mayor Robert F. Wagner's Advisory Committee on Housing Code Enforcement. A promoter of co-op conversions since the 1930's, he was a member of the Cooperative Housing Lawyers Group, which drafted some of the legal language used in co-op conversions to this day.
        He leaves his daughter, a resident of Manhattan. His wife, Carrie Fabrikant Isaacs, died in 1995 after 55 years of marriage.
