        John J. Reilly, a retired judge of the New York State Supreme Court and a former mayor of Upper Nyack, N.Y., died last Tuesday at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla., where he had a vacation home. He was 84 and lived in Upper Nyack.
        He suffered a brief illness, the Hannemann Funeral Home in Nyack reported.
        Judge Reilly, who was born in New York City, graduated with honors from Fordham Law School in 1950 and became a trial attorney and Deputy State Attorney General. He also took an active role in Republican politics and served as G.O.P. chairman for Rockland County, as well as a county court judge.
        Gov. Malcolm Wilson appointed him a judge of the Court of Claims in 1974. After retiring from that post, Judge Reilly continued on the court until 1995 as an administrative judge. From 1993 until 1995, he also served as the Mayor of his hometown.
        Judge Reilly is survived by his wife, Madeleine Drake Reilly; two stepdaughters, Suzanne D. Tiedemann of Scotch Plains, N.J., and Jacqueline D. Slifko of Fort Myers, Fla., and two stepsons, Stephen C. Drake of Slatington, Pa., and Kevin W. Drake of Macungie, Pa.
