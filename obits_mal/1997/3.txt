        Thurlow Evans Tibbs Jr., a dealer in African-American art who donated about 30 paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs and drawings to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington last year, died on Jan. 16 at his home in Washington. He was 44.
        The cause is undetermined, pending the results of an autopsy, said Janet Fries, his lawyer.
        Mr. Tibbs grew up in Washington.  He studied art while he was a student at Dartmouth College, and graduated in 1974. He went on to receive a master's degree in city planning from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design in 1976.
        He worked for an engineering firm from 1976 to 1979 and then joined the General Services Administration, where he became a facilities planner.
        He left the agency in 1989 to open an art gallery at his home north of Logan Circle in Washington. The house had been in his family since 1904.
        Mr. Tibbs's collection began with paintings left to him by his grandmother Lillian Evans Tibbs, a well-known lyric soprano. He organized many exhibitions at his house, including ''Surrealism and the Afro-American Artist'' and ''Six Washington Masters.''
        His donation to the Corcoran, which besides the works of art also included his archives, is the largest and most important group of historical American art and reference materials to go to the museum for nearly half a century, officials at the Corcoran said.
        ''The gift greatly enriched the permanent collection of American art with outstanding examples by major African-American artists not previously represented in the collection,'' said David C. Levy, director of the Corcoran.
        Mr. Tibbs is survived by a sister, Diane Tibbs of New York City.
