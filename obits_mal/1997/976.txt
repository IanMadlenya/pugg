        John F. Eichorn Jr., a retired chairman and chief executive of Eastern Utilities Associates who played a significant role in completing the Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, died of cancer on Aug. 19. He was 73 and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.
        Mr. Eichorn headed Eastern, an electric utility holding company based in Boston, from 1972 until his retirement as chief executive in 1989.
        He gained attention in the 1980's when Eastern Utilities took a big stake in the Seabrook plant, a project that had been plagued with costly construction delays and was the target of antinuclear protestors. Mr. Eichorn's commitment to the plant helped it finally go into service in 1990.
        Earlier, in the 1970's, he had gone to Poland to negotiate favorable prices for imported coal for the Northeast, which helped the utilities in the region weather the energy crisis. He was also one of the pioneers in establishing the New England Power Pool, the first regional electricity distribution grid in the nation.
        Mr. Eichorn was born in Boston. He received a bachelor of science degree from the University of Maine.
        His first wife, the former Mary Lou MacIsaac, died in 1987. He is survived by his second wife, Barbara J. Schulz, a former president of Peter Norton Computing Inc. of Santa Monica, whom he married in 1989; two daughters, Ellen Eichorn of Boston and Christine Hill of Talladega, Ala.; two stepdaughters, Geri Schultz of Playa Del Rey, Calif., and Kathryn Healy of Centerport, N.Y.; two stepsons, Gary and Glen Schultz of Santa Monica, and seven grandchildren.
