        Robert Bezilla, a national poll taker long affiliated with the Gallup Organization, died on Jan. 2 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 58.
        The cause was arteriosclerotic heart disease, or hardening of the arteries, according to the Mather-Hodge Funeral Home in Princeton.
        Mr. Bezilla, a research professional for 26 years, had directed the Gallup Youth Survey since 1983. His primary responsibility was to design and analyze surveys and edit reports, which are distributed through The Associated Press.
        He also edited two publications issued by the Gallup-affiliated Princeton Religion Research Center: the weekly Gallup Religion Poll, about attendance at religious services as well as about general attitudes on religion, and the monthly Emerging Trends, a newsletter specializing in religion and spirituality.
        Since 1988 he served as a consultant to the George H. Gallup International Institute, for which he directed studies on health, education, religion and ethical values. He wrote extensively on opinion polls and marketing techniques, as well as on the gathering and evaluation of information.
        Mr. Bezilla was born in Minersville, Pa., and graduated in philosophy from Johns Hopkins University in 1961. He is survived by his wife, Elaine Mowery Bezilla, and two sons, Kenneth R., of Tecumseh, Mo., and Gregory A., of Decatur, Ga.
