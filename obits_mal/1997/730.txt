        Dr. Karl Gunther Kessler, a physicist and former associate director for international and academic affairs at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, died on Monday in Bethesda, Md. He was 77 and lived in Bethesda.
        The cause was a heart attack, family members said.
        Dr. Kessler was prominent in the fields of atomic spectroscopy and optical metrology, which involve, respectively, identifying chemical molecules through their electromagnetic spectrum and using lightwaves to measure distance.
        He also helped develop an advanced optical metrological device that uses ultraviolet light and wrote the first computer program for analyzing atomic spectra, in the mid-1950's, institute officials said.
        Karl Kessler was born on Aug. 21, 1919, in Hamburg, Germany, and came to the United States with his family in 1926. They settled in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he later graduated from the University of Michigan and received his master's degree and doctorate in physics.
        In 1948, Dr. Kessler began his career at the National Bureau of Standards, which in 1989 became the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a Federal agency that helps in the commercial development of technology.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Betty Kefgen Kessler, and two daughters, Heidi Ann Kessler and Susan Mary DeBacker, both of Boulder, Colo.
