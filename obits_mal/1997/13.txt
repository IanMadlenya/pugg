        James D. Webb, a former Assistant Secretary of the Interior and a leader of the Wilderness Society who spurred efforts to restore the Florida Everglades, died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 60.
        The cause was brain cancer, said his colleagues at the Wilderness Society, where Mr. Webb had been general counsel since July 1995. From 1986 to 1995 he was director of the society's Florida program, concentrating on Everglades issues.
        As an Assistant Secretary of the Interior under President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Webb was deeply involved in formulating Everglades legislation. He studied Everglades issues with the Army Corps of Engineers and worked to build local and national political alliances on behalf of efforts to restore the vast tract of marshland that covers much of South Florida.
        Mr. Webb, who was born and reared in Arizona, graduated from Arizona State University and the University of Arizona Law School. Before moving to Washington, he was the Tucson City Attorney and a member of the Tucson City Council. Besides his private law practice, he advised the Arizona state government on utilities issues.
        He is survived by three sisters, Verola Howell of San Leandro, Calif., Glenna Morgan of Walnut Creek, Calif., and Ethna Larson of Salt Lake City.
