        The Rev. Stanislaus J. Brzana, the 10th Bishop of the Diocese of Ogdensburg, which covers a large part of upstate New York, died on Saturday at St. Joseph Hospital in Cheektowaga. He was 79 and since his retirement had lived at a residence maintained by his diocese in Buffalo, where he grew up.
        He suffered a stroke earlier in the week, the diocese said.
        The Diocese of Ogdensburg was established in 1872 by Pope Pius IX and now counts about 140,000 Roman Catholics within its 12,000 square miles. Its 120 parishes range from the rural outdoors of eight counties to the towns of Lake Placid, Ticonderoga and Watertown.
        During his tenure, 1968 to 1993, Bishop Brzana served on committees of the National Conference of Bishops and took part in deliberations of the Second Vatican Council.
        He also started several churches and education centers and was active in regional civic and social activities, including caring for striking miners and their families. In addition to receiving a Caritas award from Catholic Charities, he was made an honorary Mohawk Indian chief in 1977.
        Bishop Brzana trained for the priesthood at the Diocesan Preparatory Seminary in Buffalo and Christ the King Seminary at St. Bonaventure University in St. Bonaventure, N.Y. Ordained in 1941, he was sent to the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation and in World War II served as a chaplain with the Ninth Armored Division, ministering to troops in the Battle of the Bulge.
        After serving in pastorates in the United States, he entered advanced theological studies in Rome, where he earned a doctorate at Gregorian University in 1953. He was consecrated Auxiliary Bishop of Buffalo in 1964 and was transferred to Ogdensburg in 1968 by Pope Paul VI.
        Bishop Brzana is survived by two brothers, Frank and Matthew, and two sisters, Helen Kasprzak and Florence Blascak, all residents of the Buffalo area.
