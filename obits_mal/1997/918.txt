        John Paul Itta, an advertising executive who was as well known within the industry for his fanciful Christmas cards as for his multiple awards for creative campaigns, died Aug. 16 at University Hospital in Stony Brook, N.Y. The cause was acute myelogenous leukemia, according to Anthony F. Murray, a longtime friend. He had just turned 67.
        In his decades in the industry, Mr. Itta earned a reputation as a groundbreaker. He was the first to show a nude woman in American advertising, for Pucci Perfume. His ads turned Riunite, then an unknown brand, into one of the largest selling imported wines. Other successful campaigns in his portfolio included the advertising for Kent and Newport cigarettes, for Soft & Dri deodorant and for Kayser-Roth pantyhose.
        Mr. Itta, who had an undergraduate degree from Columbia College and also did some graduate work in architecture, started his advertising career in the mail room of Benton & Bowles. He worked for McCann-Erickson, Cunningham & Walsh, Ketchum MacLeod & Grove, Lennen & Newell and Interpublic before forming his own agency in 1969. He has also published short fiction, and was working on a movie script when he died.
        He is survived by a sister, Alice Vlachos of Yonkers, and two nephews, Paul Vlachos and Nicholas Christopher.
