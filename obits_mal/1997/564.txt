        Gordon Wies Reed of Greenwich, Conn., who for 22 years was chairman of the Texas Gulf Producing Company, an independent oil and gas concern, died on Saturday after a brief illness, said his son, Thomas, a former Secretary of the Air Force. He was 97.
        Mr. Reed was an early supporter of Barry M. Goldwater's 1964 Presidential campaign, starting an independent committee that caused a brief, but sharp, split among Connecticut Republican Party leaders. Mr. Reed was also an early contributor to Ronald W. Reagan's campaign to become governor of California in 1966.
        Mr. Reed was in basic training for World War I combat duty when the war ended. He graduated from the University of Illinois in 1922 and by 1940 was president of the Hanley Company, a New York brick maker.
        In 1941, Mr. Reed and his brother, Lawrence, took over the Texas Gulf Producing Company, which drilled the first oil well in Libya. The company was sold in 1964. Mr. Reed was also an assistant director of a wartime production board that oversaw aluminum production, and after the war he served on a variety of corporate boards.
        In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Mr. Reed chairman of a panel that oversaw the transfer of significant military transport duties to commercial airlines.
        He is survived by his second wife, Genevieve, of Greenwich; his brother, Lawrence, of Houston; his son, Thomas, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; three grandchildren; two great-grandchildren, and a stepdaughter, Susan Whitman, of New Vernon, N.J. Mr. Reed's first wife, Naomi, died in 1967.
