        Norman Joseph Kelman, a Manhattan analyst who helped establish the New York school of psychoanalysis in the 1950's, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Dr. Kelman was associated with the American Institute for Psychoanalysis for more than 50 years as a teacher, training and supervising analyst, associate dean and trustee.
        A disciple of Karen Horney, one of the institute's founders, he helped mesh her post-Freudian approach with the philosophical and humanistic thought of Martin Buber, Paul Tillich and Erich Fromm, with whom he had studied and worked.
        Born in Wallingford, Conn., Dr. Kelman graduated from Wesleyan University and received an M.A. from Columbia University and an M.D. from Harvard University. He had a private practice on Park Avenue, and taught at the New School for Social Research, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Yale.
        Dr. Kelman is survived by two sons, Peter, of Manhattan and David, of Thetford, Vt.; a daughter, Barbara Ravage of Manhattan; a brother, Gilbert, of Stony Creek, Conn.; a sister, Ruth Rosenzweig of Hollywood, Fla.; two stepsons, Michael Katz of Westport, Conn., and Gregory Katz of Berlin; and two stepdaughters, Toni Katz of Santa Fe, N.M., and Stephanie Kasanof of Manhattan.
        He was separated from his wife, Janine Kelman. An earlier marriage to Catherine Sugerman ended in divorce.
        Correction:  May 5, 1997, Monday
        An obituary on Wednesday about Norman J. Kelman, a New York psychoanalyst, misstated the date of his death and misspelled the surname of his first wife. Dr. Kelman died on April 20th; his former wife was Catherine Sugarman.
