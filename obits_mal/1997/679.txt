        Dr. James Hardin Wall, who improved the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders and alcoholism in Westchester County, died on June 13 at his retirement home in Freeport, Me. He was 94 and formerly lived in White Plains.
        Dr. Wall started as a psychiatric resident in 1928 at Bloomingdale Hospital, then little more than an asylum in White Plains. It grew into one of the state's advanced institutions for care and training as the New York Hospital-Westchester Division while he served as its assistant medical director from 1936 to 1946, and then as medical director until his retirement in 1965.
        Dr. Wall was also professor emeritus of clinical psychiatry at Cornell Medical College and founding chairman of the Westchester County Community Mental Health Board, formed in 1954..
        At the Westchester Division he helped develop a program of vocational, educational and recreational guidance and demonstrated the therapeutic value of this approach. His point was that if guidance works for well people, it was doubly effective for those with emotional problems.
        Dr. Wall was born in Lancaster, S.C., and graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1927. He is survived by a son, Edward B. of Brunswick, Me.; two sisters, Mary W. Peterson of Charlotte, N.C., and Ethel W. Stanford of Atlanta; seven grandchildren and three great-grandsons. His wife, Louise Holt Baker Wall, died in 1990.
