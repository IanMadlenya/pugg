        David Anderson, a United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia in the 1980's, died on July 4 in Berlin. He was 60.
        The cause of death was a liver disease, family members said.
        As Ambassador in Belgrade from 1981 to 1985, his main task was to help Yugoslavia cope with a deepening economic crisis by refinancing international loans.
        He was born Jan. 3, 1937, in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, and came to the United States in 1952.
        After earning a bachelor of arts degree from Union College in 1958, and a master's degree a year later from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, he joined the State Department. His initial overseas posts included embassies in Belgrade, Yugoslavia; Bamako, Mali; Brussels and Bonn.
        Mr. Anderson was a member of the United States delegation that negotiated the four-power Berlin Agreement of 1971 with the Soviets, British and French. The pact reduced cold-war tensions and helped pave the way for the unification of Germany.
        After retiring from the Foreign Service in 1985, he was a visiting professor of international relations at Simmons College in Boston and in 1988 was named director of the Aspen Institute in Berlin, bringing together scholars and politicians from East and West.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Doris Helen Heitmann of Berlin; two children from his first marriage, Natalie of Florham Park, N.J., and Scott of Silver Spring, Md.; his mother, Janet, of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., a brother, Alexander of Burlington, Vt., and two grandchildren.
