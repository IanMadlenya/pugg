        Pierre Eugene Brodin, an author, teacher and literary critic who served as a conservator of French culture and Franco-American scholarship in New York City during World War II, died on Jan. 1 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Brodin, who was long associated with the Lycee Francais de New York, belonged to a group of refugee intellectuals who founded L'Ecole Libre des Hautes Etudes (Free French University) of New York in 1941 and nurtured it through years of war and the German occupation of France. The institution shared its origins and some staff with the New School.
        After the war, the Free French University continued with a full curriculum, drawing expatriate and American students who wanted to immerse themselves in French culture. It eventually tapered off into occasional lecture series, of which Dr. Brodin served as a professor, dean and, finally, president.
        Dr. Brodin was born in Paris. He studied history at the Sorbonne and Harvard University and received a doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1935. That year he joined the faculty of the Lycee Francais as a professor of French and dean of studies, positions from which he retired in 1976.
        He lectured at the Alliance Francaise, Adelphi University and other institutions in the United States and Canada. For many years he was also a literary critic for the weekly France-Amerique.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Dorothy Rothschild Brodin; a son, Alain, of Remalard, France, and several grandchildren.
