        William Cade, a decorated French Resistance fighter and later a travel executive, died on Aug. 8 in a hospital in Naas, Ireland. He was 75 and lived in Kildare, County Kildare.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        He joined the Resistance in Nice, conducting tactical missions. Mr. Cade came to New York in 1947. In 1964 he moved to Ireland, where he later opened Kilkea Castle as a hotel.
        He is survived by his wife, Sally; their son, William, of Kildare; a son and two daughters from two previous marriages, Joan Cade of Manhattan, Jonathan of Smithtown, N.Y., and Jennifer Gallagher of Red Bank, N.J.; a brother, Michael Cade-Kadinsky of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
