        Peter A. Leventritt, one of America's greatest bridge players, died on Dec. 6 in Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan. He was suffering from complications from diabetes, his stepdaughter, Hope Igleheart of Manhattan, said.
        Mr. Leventritt represented North America in the world team championship, contesting the Bermuda Bowl, on four occasions -- 1957, 1961, 1963 and 1965. Each time, he and his teammates were defeated by the celebrated Italian Blue Team. He came closest to the world title in 1963, in San Vicenzo, Italy, when his team led for most of the match. The American nonplaying captain, John Gerber, made a decision to bench Leventritt, forming an unfamiliar partnership in the process. The experiment failed, and the Americans lost by 19 international match points.
        His regular partner in world and national championships was the late Howard Schenken, one of the world's best players. Together they created the Big Club system, based on an Italian model.
        Mr. Leventritt won 13 National titles: the Spingold Knockout in 1956 and 1960; the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1953 and 1964; the Board-a-Match Teams in 1941 and 1949; the Life Master Pairs in 1944 and 1951; the Master Mixed Teams in 1949, 1950 and 1959; the Mixed Pairs in 1950, and the Men's Teams in 1966.
        He was a co-founder of the Card School in Manhattan, and was a popular and successful teacher. As an administrator, he served as president of the Greater New York Bridge Association. In 1954, he was president of the American Contract Bridge League and was nonplaying captain of the North American world championship team the next year.
        Mr. Leventritt was born and educated in Manhattan. He attended Princeton for one year, in 1934, and then played professional hockey until his career was cut short by injury.
        Besides his stepdaughter, he is survived by his wife, Faith Leventritt of Marstons Mills, Mass., and by another stepdaughter, Cary Igleheart of Southern Pines, N.C.
