        William Metcalf, a baritone who sang with the New York City Opera for more than a decade, died on June 5 at the Terence Cardinal Cook Health Center in East Harlem. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        His lawyer, Daniel F. Tritter, said he died of AIDS.
        Mr. Metcalf was born in New Bedford, Mass., and studied at the New England Conservatory. After Army service in the early 1950's, he moved to New York City and began his professional career as a chorus singer on the ''Voice of Firestone'' television series.
        He made his New York City Opera debut in 1958 in a contemporary work, Mark Bucci's ''Tale for a Deaf Ear.'' Before he retired from the company in 1969, he sang 19 more roles, including Papageno in Mozart's ''Magic Flute,'' Sharpless in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' and Harry Easter in Kurt Weill's ''Street Scene.'' He also gave many performances at the City Opera as the baritone soloist in Orff's ''Carmina Burana.''
        Mr. Metcalf also performed with the Santa Fe Opera and other companies in the United States, and in New York City he appeared regularly as a soloist with the St. Cecilia Chorus, the Naumburg Symphony and the Little Orchestra Society. After his retirement from the stage in the early 1990's, he taught voice at the Hartt School of Music in West Hartford, Conn., and at the Manhattan School of Music.
        No immediate family members survive.
