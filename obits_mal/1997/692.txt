        Walter F. Weiker, a specialist in Turkish politics and history at Rutgers University who was long active in Jewish causes, died on June 8 at his home in Livingston, N.J. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, according to Rutgers-Newark, where he taught for 35 years and was chairman of the political science department in the 1970's and again from 1991 until last year.
        Dr. Weiker, a native of Berlin, graduated from Antioch College and Princeton University, from which he received a Ph.D. He was associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington before joining the Rutgers faculty in 1962.
        Fluent in Turkish, he was in Ankara in 1960 when the Turkish military took charge to protect the secular heritage of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. The experience prompted his first book, ''The Turkish Revolution, 1960-61: Aspects of Military Politics'' (Brookings, 1963).
        He also wrote ''The Modernization of Turkey: From Ataturk to the Present Day'' (Holmes, 1981); ''Ottomans, Turks and the Jewish Polity: A History of the Jews in Turkey'' (University Press of America, 1992), and ''The Unseen Israelis: The Jews From Turkey in Israel'' (University of America, 1989).
        He was a member of the governing council of the American Jewish Congress and president of the congress's New Jersey region.
        Dr. Weiker is survived by his wife, Miriam; a son, Daniel, of Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Gail, of Manhattan, and two brothers, John, of Los Angeles, and Michael, of Denver.
