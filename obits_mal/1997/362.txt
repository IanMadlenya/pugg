        Cyril F. Hetsko, a lawyer and executive who was instrumental in transforming the American Tobacco Company into American Brands Inc., died of complications of pneumonia on March 1 in Ridgewood, N.J., Mary Horne, an American Brands spokeswoman, said. He was 85.
        Mr. Hetsko was a partner in the New York law firm then known as Chadbourne, Parke, Whiteside & Wolff from 1936 until 1964, when he resigned his partnership to join American Tobacco as general counsel. The next year he was named vice president and director.
        Over the next decade, Mr. Hetsko was one of a handful of key executives who devised and put into effect a diversification strategy that created a broad-based international consumer products company. Among the companies American Tobacco acquired during this period were Sunshine Biscuits Inc., the Master Lock Company, the James B. Beam Distilling Company and the Acushnet Company. He retired as senior vice president, general counsel and a director in 1977.
        American Tobacco changed its name to American Brands Inc. in 1985.
        A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., Mr. Hetsko earned his law degree from the University of Michigan Law School.
        A longtime resident of Ridgewood, Mr. Hetsko was a member of the Explorers Club of New York City. He and his wife traveled extensively to remote areas of the world and lectured on their experiences in Bhutan, Tibet, Ladakh and Mongolia.
        Survivors include his wife, Josephine Stein Hetsko of Ridgewood; a brother, Richard Hetsko of Middlefield, Conn.; two daughters, Jacqueline H. Kaufer of Ridgewood and Cynthia H. Rainey of Lawrence, Kan.; two sons, Cyril M. Hetsko of Madison, Wis., and Jeffrey F. Hetsko of Atlanta, and five grandchildren.
