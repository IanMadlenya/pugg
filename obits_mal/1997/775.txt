        Eric Ashworth, a literary agent who specialized in guiding young authors first into print and then into careers, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said Edward Hibbert of the Donadio & Ashworth literary agency in Manhattan.
        Mr. Ashworth grew up in Bronxville, N.Y., and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Berkeley. He joined Donadio & Associates in 1980, working under Candida Donadio.
        In 1989, he was made a partner in the agency, which was renamed Donadio & Ashworth. Among his clients were Leon Bing, author of ''Do or Die'' (1991); Fae Myenne Ng (''Bone,'' 1993); Darryl Pinckney (''High Cotton,'' 1992) and Mark Salzman (''Iron and Silk,'' 1987, and ''The Laughing Sutra,'' 1991).
        Mr. Ashworth retired in 1992 because of failing health.
        He is survived by his parents, Richard and Amy, of Manhattan, and a brother, Everard, of Ventura, Calif.
