        William E. Slesnick, a professor emeritus of mathematics at Dartmouth College, who wrote about 15 textbooks on the subject for the secondary and college level, died on Nov. 25 at Kendal at Hanover, a retirement home in the New Hampshire town. A resident of Hanover, he was 72.
        He had endured a long illness, the college said.
        Professor Slesnick was also prominent in the Boy Scouts of America. Active in the Scouts for 50 years, he frequently attended national and international conferences, jamborees and camps and served on the organization's international committee and national Jewish committee.
        Born in Oklahoma City, he graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1948 after serving in the Navy. He was selected as a Rhodes scholar and received master's degrees from Harvard University in 1952 and Oxford University in 1954.
        He started his academic career in 1952 at St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. For 10 years he taught mathematics, coached crew and soccer and served as a dormitory master.
        He was appointed to the Dartmouth faculty in 1962 as an assistant professor and became a full professor in 1971. He served on many committees, led those on graduate fellowships and financial aid and for many years was a faculty marshal at Dartmouth's commencement exercises. He retired in 1994.
        Professor Slesnick is survived by a sister, Ruth Gechter, of California.
