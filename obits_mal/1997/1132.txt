        Phineas Indritz, a New Deal liberal and civil-rights lawyer who served as counsel to several committees of the House of Representatives, died on Oct. 15 at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 81 and lived in Silver Spring.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        In decades of work on Capitol Hill, Mr. Indritz helped draft legislation to end racial segregation at colleges receiving Federal money, to forbid sex discrimination in insurance premiums and to fight job discrimination against pregnant women.
        He was a founding member, executive vice chairman and national counsel of the American Veterans Committee, a multiracial organization formed during World War II that championed civil rights.
        Born in Moline, Ill., Mr. Indritz graduated from the University of Chicago in 1936 and from its law school two years later. In 1938, he joined the legal staff of the Interior Department in Washington as an assistant solicitor.
        He worked at the Department until 1957, with time out for service in the Army Air Corps, then became a counsel to House committees including Government Operations, Energy and Power and Conservation and Natural Resources.
        Among the cases he argued before the Supreme Court was Hurd v. Hodge, which barred judicial enforcement of racially restrictive real estate covenants. He also took part in the Brown v. Board of Education case and others that sought to break down racial and sex barriers.
        He retired in the 1970's but kept a desk and telephone on Capitol Hill into the 1990's.
        He is survived by two daughters, Tahma Metz of Bethesda, Md., and Tova Indritz of Albuquerque, N.M.; a son, Dr. Doren Indritz of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister, Edna Steadman of Windsor, Calif., and two grandsons. His wife, Ruth Gould Indritz, died in 1974.
