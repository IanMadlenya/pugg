        Dr. Giovanni Di Chiro, chief of neuroimaging at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, died on Aug. 27 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Barbara.
        Dr. Di Chiro was a pioneer in imaging the central nervous system, specifically in the use of computer-assisted tomography, positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.
        Dr. Di Chiro was born in Naples, and worked in Naples, Paris and Stockholm before moving to the United States. In 1958, he started the neuroradiology section at the National Institutes of Health, which later evolved into the neuroimaging section. He was the editor of The Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography, an international publication. He was also a clinical professor at Georgetown and George Washington Universities.
        In 1996 the American Society of Neuroradiology awarded him a Gold Medal for lifetime accomplishments.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Dr. Giovanna Di Chiro of Meadville, Pa.; twin sons, Marco Di Chiro of Bethesda and Patrick Di Chiro of San Francisco; two sisters, Lucia and Anna, and a brother, Rinuccio, all of Italy.
