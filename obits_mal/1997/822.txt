        Thomas D. Perry Jr., manager of the Boston Symphony Orchestra from 1954 to 1973 and its executive director from 1973 until his retirement in 1978, died last Sunday at his home in West Stockbridge, Mass. He was 83.
        Mr. Perry joined the staff of the Boston Symphony as an assistant manager in 1946. He oversaw the orchestra's first European tour, in 1952; its first tour of the Soviet Union, in 1956, and its first visit to the Far East, in 1960.
        The orchestra's summer program at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass. -- which Mr. Perry attended as a music student during its opening season, in 1940 -- was doubled to eight weeks during his tenure, and its reputation as a school for promising young musicians grew considerably. Before he joined the Boston Symphony, Mr. Perry had a varied career that included teaching English in Delaware schools and working for an advertising agency in Philadelphia.
        He was born in Grand Rapids, Mich., in 1913 and graduated from Yale University with a degree in English in 1935. In 1939, Randall Thompson, the composer, hired him to direct the radio and concert programs of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and it was Thompson who suggested that he study at Tanglewood.
        In the early 1940's, Mr. Perry moved to Boston, where he ran the concert bureau of the New England Mutual Insurance Company. He also served in the Navy Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946.
        Mr. Perry was associated with the Boston Symphony during the tenures of five music directors, Serge Koussevitzky, Charles Munch, Erich Leinsdorf, William Steinberg and Seiji Ozawa.
        After his retirement, he remained involved with the orchestra as a trustee, and was involved in the expansion of Tanglewood by the acquisition of the neighboring Highwood estate in 1989, and in the planning for Seiji Ozawa Hall in 1994.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, Judith, of Pittsfield, Mass., and two sons, Doane, of Cambridge and Richmond, Mass., and Rodney, of Rochester.
