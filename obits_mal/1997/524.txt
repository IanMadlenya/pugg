        Morton L. Deitch, a Manhattan lawyer affiliated for seven decades with the firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and long active in the cause of child care, died on April 26 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 95.
        Mr. Deitch, a native of Knoxville, Tenn., and a graduate of the University of Tennessee, received his doctor of laws degree from Yale in 1924, the year he joined what was then Stroock & Stroock. He formally retired as a partner in 1979 but continued to work in the office until a few weeks ago.
        He was managing partner for about 20 years. He was an expert in wills, estates and trusts, and handled labor law and litigation as well.
        Mr. Deitch's interest in child care led him to assist President Dwight D. Eisenhower in preparing the 1960 White House Conference on Children and Youth. He was president and chairman of the Jewish Child Care Association, and helped the administration of Mayor Robert F. Wagner of New York City establish Hillcrest Center for Children, which was in Beford Hills and which he served as president and a board member. He also helped organize the Council of Voluntary Family and Child Care Agencies.
        Mr. Deitch, who was widowed three times, is survived by a son, Kenneth, of Carlisle, Mass.; two grandsons, and a stepdaughter, Nance R. Turner of Lake Wylie, S.C.
