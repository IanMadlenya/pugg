        Sey Chassler, who expanded the purview of women's magazines beyond printing recipes to promoting equal rights as the editor in chief of Redbook, died on Dec. 11 at the Tisch Hospital at New York University Medical Center. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from colon cancer and a stroke, said his wife, Natalie.
        During his 16-year tenure as editor in chief, Redbook became one of the nation's largest-circulation women's magazine (rising from two million to nearly five million) and earned several awards, including the National Magazine Award for fiction twice.
        A strong advocate for women's rights, Mr. Chassler started an unusual effort in 1976 that led to the simultaneous publication of articles about the proposed equal rights amendment in 36 women's magazines. He did it again three years later with 33 magazines.
        Mr. Chassler was a founding member of the Child Care Action Campaign, serving seven years as its vice president; a member of the advisory boards of the National Women's Political Caucus and the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University and a member of the board of Abortion Rights Mobilization.
        The magazines that Mr. Chassler worked for during an editorial career of more than 50 years included Coronet, Collier's and This Week. He also served as president of the American Society of Magazine Editors.
        In March, he was inducted into the American Society of Magazine Editors' Hall of Fame. Although he retired from Redbook in 1981, Mr. Chassler continued to write and to teach and was a consulting editor to Parade magazine at the time of his death.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Chassler is survived by a daughter, Deborah of Brookline, Mass.; two sons, Philip of Cambridge, Mass., and Joseph of New York; a twin sister, Vivienne Schwartz of Forest Hills, Queens, and five grandchildren.
