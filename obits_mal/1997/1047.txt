        Donald N. Medearis Jr., who as chief of pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital pushed for nationwide improvement in emergency care for children, died last Monday at that hospital. He was 70 and lived in Winthrop, Mass.
        The cause was heart failure, family members said.
        Dr. Medearis was the Charles Wilder Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School as well as  the chief of pediatrics at Massachusetts General from 1977 until he retired in 1995.
        In 1991, he was appointed by the National Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences to run a study of children's emergency care in the United States. After the study was completed, in 1993, Dr. Medearis concluded that thousands of children each year were endangered by substandard emergency care because of the failure of hospitals to understand children's special medical needs.
        Children are not ''little adults,'' Dr. Medearis was fond of saying. He argued that treating them that way could put them at increased health risk because of differences in blood pressures, heartbeat rates and normal breathing patterns.
        Born in Kansas City, Kan., Donald Norman Medearis Jr. received his B.A. in chemistry from the University of Kansas and his M.D. from Harvard. He was an intern in internal medicine at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis and a resident in pediatrics at  Children's Hospital in Cincinnati.
        Survivors include his wife of 41 years, Mary Ellen; two daughters, Ellen Sanford Medearis of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Jennifer Marble Medearis of Cambridge, Mass.; two sons, Donald Harrison Medearis of San Francisco and John Norman Medearis of Los Angeles; two brothers, Kenneth Charles Medearis of Corvallis, Ore., and Robert Walter Medearis of Palo Alto, Calif., and two grandchildren.
