        Norman Cleaveland, who won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 1924 United States rugby team that beat a heavily favored French squad in Paris, died Sunday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 96.
        As one of the last -- if not the last -- living member of that team, Mr. Cleaveland could be eulogized as the man who killed Olympic rugby, as well as French hopes, that day. A crowd of 40,000 booed and hissed the Americans throughout the 17-3 rout, and rioting forced Mr. Cleaveland and his teammates to escape from the field when it was over. That was the last year rugby was played as an official sport in the Olympics.
        ''They had a special tunnel for us to escape,'' Mr. Cleaveland said last year. ''There were times when I didn't know if we'd make it.''
        Mr. Cleaveland did not receive his medal until two months after the victory because of the outraged crowd, which drowned out ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' during the awards ceremony.
        He said last year that he wanted to see rugby reinstated as an Olympic sport, and he wanted to throw out the first ball in the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia.
