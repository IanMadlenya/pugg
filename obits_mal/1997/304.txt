        Marx William Wartofsky, a prominent professor of philosophy at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68.
        He suffered a heart attack, said his wife, Carol C. Gould, who was his co-editor for ''Woman and Philosophy'' (Putnam, 1976), a collection of feminist writings on philosophy.
        Professor Wartofsky's work reflected an overarching interest in what he called historical epistemology, the myriad ways in which social practices influence the formulation of philosophical themes.
        In 1977 he produced ''Feuerbach'' (Cambridge University Press), a definitive study of the works of the 19th-century German philosopher and moralist. He also wrote ''Conceptual Foundations of Scientific Thought'' (Macmillan, 1968) and ''Models: Representation and Scientific Understanding'' (1979), an analysis of the meaning of scientific models and metaphors.
        Dr. Wartofsky was also the editor of The Philosophical Forum, a quarterly he founded in 1970.
        A native of Brooklyn, he earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. He taught for 26 years at Boston University, , rising to department chairman in 1967. Baruch and the CUNY Graduate Center named him Distinguished Professor of Philosophy in 1983.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by their son, Michael Gould-Wartofsky; two sons from a previous marriage, Steven, of Round Lake Beach, Ill., and David, of Fort Washington, Md., and three grandchildren.
