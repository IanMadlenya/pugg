        Herbert Resnicow, a late-blooming mystery writer, died on April 4 at a hospitalin Roslyn, L.I. He was 75 and lived in East Williston, L.I.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        A civil engineer by training and trade, Mr. Resnicow changed careers at 60 with his first mystery, ''The Gold Solution.'' Like other novels that followed, its plot reflected his long experience in the construction business.
        That first effort earned him a nomination for an Edgar Allan Poe Award of the Mystery Writers of America in 1984. Richard F. Shepard of The New York Times called it ''the most intriguing architectural murder since Stanford White was killed by Harry Thaw.''
        Forgoing the hard-boiled blood-and-sex approach to the genre, Mr. Resnicow preferred to treat his readers to puzzlers of logic and meticulous technical detail solved by an analytical middle-aged sleuth.
        Besides writing a total of 15 novels of his own, he abetted the literary aspirations of Edward I. Koch, Tom Seaver, Fran Tarkington and Pele, among others. He was Mr. Koch's co-author for ''Murder at City Hall'' (1996), Pele's for ''World Cup Murder (1989) and Mr. Seaver's for  ''Bean Ball'' (1989).
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and served overseas with the Army Corps of Engineers in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Melly Engelberg Resnicow; two sons, Norman, of Riverdale, the Bronx, and David, of Manhattan; two daughters, Eva Resnikova of Manhattan and Ruth Resnicow Streiter of Atlanta, and four grandchildren.
