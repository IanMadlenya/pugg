        Junichi Ueno, co-owner of Japan's second-largest daily newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, died of pneumonia at a Tokyo hospital on Sunday. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Ueno represented the third generation of the family who, jointly with Michiko Murayama, owns the newspaper and its subsidiary businesses, which include television and satellite broadcasting.
        He joined the newspaper in 1937 after graduating from Kyoto University with a degree in economics. He held several posts at Asahi and served as a member of its executive board during World War II. After Japan's defeat in 1945, he resigned from Asahi along with several other executives who took responsibility for Asahi's one-sided reporting during the war.
        He then briefly worked as an elementary school teacher and later took a position at the Kobe University of Commerce. After that, he served as secretary to Kotaro Tanaka, who was then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Japan.
        But in 1952, Mr. Ueno returned to Asahi as the head of its newly established employee training center. He inherited his family's portion of the media company's ownership in 1970 when his father died, and was a board member until 1994.
        Although virtually all newspaper companies in Japan are privately owned, the owners do not typically participate in management or in making editorial policy. Although its competitor, Yomiuri Shimbun, boasts a larger circulation, Asahi is valued by Japanese intellectuals for its more liberal bent.
        Mr. Ueno was known for his support of the Ueno Memorial Foundation, a research institution devoted to studying Buddhist art and culture. He was also active in the Ueno Library at Kyoto University, a repository for materials about Japanese and British newspaper history.
        Mr. Ueno is survived by his wife, Miyoko; three sons: Shoichi, Katsuji and Shingo, and a daughter, Kuniko Kamiya.
