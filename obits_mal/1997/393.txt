        Fredric S. Fay, a professor of physiology and pharmacology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School who was an expert on the function of muscle cells, died on March 18 in Germany. He was 53 and lived in Worcester, Mass.
        He suffered a heart attack on a visit to the University of Halle, where he had gone to present a paper to the German Society for Cell Biology, the medical school said.

He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Cornell University and earned a doctorate in physiology at Harvard University. He became a founding faculty member of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester in 1970.
        Dr. Fay did innovative research on smooth muscle, and he helped develop a digital imaging microscope to observe living cells in action.
        Dr. Fay is survived by his wife, Dr. Madeleine Fay, an endocrinologist at the Fallon Clinic in Worcester; two sons, Dr. Andrew and Dr. Nicholas, both of Worcester; a daughter, Isabel, also of Worcester; a sister, Louise Fay Bergman of New York City, and three grandchildren.
