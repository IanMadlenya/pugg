        Isidore Englander, a civil liberties lawyer who was a founder of the National Lawyers' Guild, died on Sept. 4 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 93.
        Mr. Englander, who was born in Lublin, Poland, and whose original first name was Itzhak, came to the United States in 1920. He graduated from Fordham Law School seven years later and practiced law from 1928 to 1994.
        He practiced immigration law primarily. In addition to helping found the Lawyers' Guild, he also helped found the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee and served as counsel to the Abraham Lincoln Brigade and the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born.
        Mr. Englander also worked as a corporate counsel to provide for his family, because much of his other legal work was free, his daughter, Yola Coffeen of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., said, recalling that he could not charge people who could not pay.
        Mr. Englander's wife, the former Florence Levy, died in 1981. In addition to Ms. Coffeen, he is survived by a son, David, of Sneden's Landing, N.Y., two sisters, Sarah Blumstein and Florence Slipyan, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Herman, of Sag Harbor, N.Y.
