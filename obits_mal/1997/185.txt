        Paul Cummings, a curator, publisher and authority on American drawings and prints, died on Friday at Beth Israel North Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of a stroke that he suffered on Jan. 24, said Judith Goldman, a friend.
        An avid collector of books, Mr. Cummings was known for his wide-ranging artistic knowledge. He was born in Detroit Lakes, Minn., in 1933 and attended the University of Minnesota before moving to London to study set design. He moved to Manhattan in the mid-1950's, worked briefly in the theater and ran a small gallery in Greenwich Village.
        He directed the Louis Alexander Gallery on East 61st Street in the early 1960's. From 1968 to 1978, he was director of the oral history project of the Archives of American Art, conducting interviews with nearly 250 artists, patrons, collectors and dealers. From 1975 to 1987 he was adjunct curator of drawings at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he expanded the drawing collection and organized exhibitions of such artists as David Smith and Willem de Kooning.
        In 1969, he founded the Print Collector's Newsletter, now called On Paper, which he published for two years. In 1978 he became president of the Drawing Society, and in 1979 he founded a second journal, Drawing, which he edited until 1995.
        He also edited six editions of ''The Dictionary of American Artists'' and under his own imprint, Catchword Papers, published volumes of poetry by Gregory Corso, Kenneth Koch, Ron Padgett and Allen Ginsberg. At the time of his death, he was working on a biography and catalogue raisonne of the artist Mark Tobey.
        He is survived by a sister, Rita Yankasammy of Garden Grove, Calif.
