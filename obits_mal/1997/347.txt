        Patrick R. Wallace, who for many years was the confidential assistant to successive city editors and metropolitan editors of The New York Times, died on Tuesday at home.
        Mr. Wallace, who was 79, had lived for several decades in the Inwood section of Manhattan but recently had been staying with his sister, Mrs. Kathleen Murphy, in East Rutherford, N.J.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wallace started working for The Times in 1935 as a $15-a-week copy boy. He was promoted to clerk in 1947 and became confidential assistant to the city editor, Frank Adams, in 1953. He retained that job through successive executives, who later became known as metropolitan editors, indicating the department's broader approach to The Times's local coverage. He retired in 1980.
        Because his job put him at the center of the day-to-day newsroom operation, he touched the lives of several generations of Times reporters as he helped them organize their lives on and off the job.
        Mr. Wallace's wife, Helen, died about 15 years ago. Among survivors are his sister, Mrs. Murphy, and a brother, James, of Clifton, N.J.
