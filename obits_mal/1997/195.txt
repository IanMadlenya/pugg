He was production stage manager for ''Cyrano,'' ''Pippin'' and ''Good News'' as well as for touring companies of ''Falsettos'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' He was also stage manager for the Martha Graham Dance Company and the American Shakespeare Festival Theater. In 1972, he was the producer of the Off Broadway production of Tennessee Williams's ''Small Craft Warnings.''
