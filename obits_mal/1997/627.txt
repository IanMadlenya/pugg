        Charles Jones, a composer who taught at the Juilliard School and the Mannes College of Music, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 86.
        The cause was complications from recent heart surgery, said a friend, James Slater.
        Early in his career, Mr. Jones composed music that was diatonic and neo-classical. As he matured, his language became increasingly complex and chromatic. His large output includes four symphonies, nine string quartets and an oratorio, ''Piers the Plowman.'' In his numerous vocal works, he favored texts of literary distinction (Pope, Milton, Henry James). His vocal music is characterized by his sensitive and clear setting of words. His symphonic works have been performed by major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic and the National Symphony Orchestra.
        Mr. Jones was born in Tamworth, Ontario, on June 21, 1910. At 18 he went to New York, where he studied violin at the Institute of Musical Art and composition with Bernard Wagenaar at Juilliard. In 1939 he was sent by Juilliard to teach at Mills College in Northern California, then a notably experimental institution. There he formed a close collegial association with a fellow teacher, the composer Darius Milhaud, which lasted for 30 years.
        Mr. Jones's teaching career included work at the Music Academy of the West at Santa Barbara, Calif., at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado and, after 1946 when he moved to New York, at Juilliard and Mannes. He was still involved with teaching composition at Mannes and Juilliard at the time of his death. His last composition was a piano sonata, completed three weeks ago.
        His music, which is published by Peters, has been championed by the Friends of Charles Jones organization, headed by Mr. Slater.
        Mr. Jones is survived by his wife, Sally P. Jones, and a grandson.
