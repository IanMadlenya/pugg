        Joseph Corteggiano, a bass-baritone with the New York City Opera, died on April 7 at his mother's home in Baltimore. He was 49 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Susan Woelzl, spokeswoman for the City Opera.
        Since his company debut in 1990 as the Bonze in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' Mr. Corteggiano was regularly heard in both comic and dramatic roles at the City Opera.
        He sang both Leporello and the Commendatore in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' Don Basilio in Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia,'' Escamillo in Bizet's ''Carmen,'' Raimondo in Donizetti's ''Lucia'' and Scarpia in Puccini's ''Tosca.''
        He also took part in many of the contemporary productions the company offered, playing Mordecai in Hugo Weisgall's ''Esther,'' Riedinger and Wealth in Hindemith's ''Mathis der Maler'' and Zola in ''The Dreyfus Affair'' by George Whyte and Jost Meier.
        Mr. Corteggiano was born in Baltimore and came late to his professional opera career, having worked as a hairdresser in Washington and a caterer in New York City before devoting himself fully to the stage in 1989. Before that, he sang with small companies, including the New York Grand Opera, with which he appeared in several summer performances in Central Park.
        Besides the City Opera, he performed with Opera Colorado, the Pittsburgh Opera, the Cincinnati Opera, the New Jersey State Opera, the Baltimore Opera and the Summer Opera Theater in Washington.
        He is survived by his mother, Charlotte Corteggiano; two sisters, Debbie Kennedy and Antoinette Torsch, and two brothers, E. Joseph and Daniel Corteggiano, all of Baltimore.
