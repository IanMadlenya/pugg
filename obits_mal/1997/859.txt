        Nicholas J. Hoff, professor emeritus of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, who helped devise and develop the fragile aluminum skins of ever-faster aircraft from the 1940's into the supersonic age, died on Aug. 4 at his home on the Stanford campus. He was 91.
        An aeronautical engineer, Dr. Hoff was one of the early specialists who studied the static and dynamic stability of such vulnerable structures under the stresses of air resistance and heat. He came to the subject as an expert on applied mechanics and the properties of shells like airplane fuselages.
        Dr. Hoff was born in Hungary and earned an engineering diploma at the Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, studying thermodynamics and steam-engine design. An interest in mountain gliding caused him to shift to aerodynamics.
        He worked on plane designs in Hungary before moving to Stanford in 1939 to study under Stephen P. Timoshenko. He continued his explorations on structural stability there and received a doctorate in engineering and mechanics in 1942.
        He spent the years from 1940 to 1957 at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, rising to professor of aeronautics and head of the department of aeronautics and applied mechanics. In 1957 Stanford asked him to return and organize its new department of aeronautics, which he helped build into one of the foremost in the country.
        He reached emeritus status in 1971. He was the author of six books, including a classic text, ''The Analysis of Structures'' (1965).
        Dr. Hoff is survived by his wife, Ruth Kleczewski Hoff; a stepdaughter, Karen Brandt of Palo Alto, Calif., and a brother, George, of Santa Barbara, Calif.
