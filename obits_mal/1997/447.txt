        Chester A. Gore, the founder, president and creative director of the Chester Gore Company, an advertising and marketing agency in Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was kidney and respiratory failure, said Gerie Shanks Gore, his wife and the company's vice president and general manager.
        Mr. Gore founded his agency in 1955. The products it helped to sell over the years included premium-priced alcoholic beverages like Bombay gin and Sambuca Romana liqueur and expensive sports equipment like Prince tennis racquets and items from Foot-Joy, a golf shoe company, and the MacGregor Golf Company.
        Mr. Gore found he was comfortable with products for buyers moving up the social scale, even if they might feel uneasy shopping for them. The kidding way his agency handled the mispronunciation of Fazi-Battaglia verdicchio wine in television commercials was aimed at helping such buyers.
        ''We wanted to help these people to enjoy these things knowledgeably and make them feel comfortable,'' he explained.
        Other accounts included Grand Marnier, Bolla wines, Tommy Armour Golf and, most recently, Pittards Chamois and the International Chamois Council. He helped create a market for brand-name golf gloves and was among the first to use pre-printed magazine inserts.
        Mr. Gore, born in the Bronx, attended New York University. He wrote copy for the Gimbels and Macy's advertising departments and was in the Army Air Force during World War II. Besides his wife of 54 years, he is survived by a daughter, Eloise Gore of Arlington, Va.
