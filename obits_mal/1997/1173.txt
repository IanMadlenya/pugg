        Prospero DeBona, a lawyer, member and past president of the Monmouth County Board of Taxation and one of the first members of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, died on Oct. 22 at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. He was 77 and lived in Red Bank.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said Eugene A. Johnson, his law partner.
        Mr. DeBona, a general litigator, served on the Casino Control Commission, the state's casino regulatory agency, from 1977, the year after casino gambling was legalized in Atlantic City, to 1980. He was also a member of the State Board of Higher Education and the Monmouth Ethics Committee in the 1970's, and served on the Monmouth County Improvement Authority.
        Born in Hartford, he graduated from Trinity College there in 1941. He was an Army parachutist in both World War II and the Korean War. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1949 and became a partner in the firm of Milton, McNulty & Augelli in Jersey City in 1957. Twenty years later, he and Mr. Johnson started their own firm, DeBona & Johnson, in Red Bank.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Elizabeth; two sons, Daniel Andretta of Bandon, Ore., and Gage Andretta of Caldwell, N.J., and four grandchildren.
