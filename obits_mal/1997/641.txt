        Robert Emmett Jones Jr., an Alabama Democrat who served 30 years in the House of Representatives, where he helped speed passage of legislation creating the Interstate System of highways, died on June 4  at a hospital in Florence, Ala. He was 84, and a resident of Scottsboro, Ala.
        Mr. Jones went to Congress in 1947 after a special election for the seat held by John J. Sparkman, who had moved on to the Senate. Mr. Jones retired in 1977 after serving as chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee.
        As a member of that committee he pushed legislation that led to the Federal Highway Act of 1956, which authorized $32 billion over the next 13 years to build a 41,000-mile Interstate System of highways, with the Federal Government contributing 90 percent of the construction costs. Eventually, the costs exceeded $76 billion and the Interstate network was extended to 42,500 miles.
        Mr. Jones also played an important role in shepherding projects dealing with rivers, harbors and flood control, and providing electricity for Alabama from the Tennessee Valley Authority.
        He received a law degree from the University of Alabama in 1935, and went into private practice in Scottsboro. He was elected as a Jackson County judge in 1940 and re-elected in 1945 while still serving in the wartime Navy.
        Mr. Jones is survived by his wife of 59 years, Christine Francis Jones; a son, Robert E., of Florence; a brother, C. Rudolph, of Scottsboro, two grandsons and a great-granddaughter.
