        Michael G. Pugliese, a composer, conductor and percussionist, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 41.
        The cause was a stroke, according to his father, Michael.
        Mr. Pugliese toured with the musical ensemble of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, the composer John Cage and the road company of ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' He also played with ensembles including the Brooklyn Philharmonic, the Buffalo Philharmonic and the Philharmonia Virtuosi. He was best known, however, as a proponent of new music. He produced the 12-hour ''Tribute to John Cage'' for WNYC radio in 1994. He recorded the premieres of two solos by Cage, ''Etudes Boreales'' and ''Ryoanji,'' which the composer then dedicated to Mr. Pugliese. He also performed the premieres of pieces by Robert Ashley, Wendy Chambers and David Tudor.
        Born in Buffalo, Mr. Pugliese received a bachelor's degree from the University of Buffalo, where he helped establish an annual music series. He received a master's degree from the Manhattan School of Music, where he also taught. He performed in numerous Broadway musicals, among them ''A Christmas Carol,'' ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''Miss Saigon.''
        In addition to his father, of Hamburg, N.Y., he is survived by his mother, Marianne, and three sisters, Renee Brooks of Pendleton, N.Y.; Cheryl Earl of Ogden, Utah, and Allison Giambra of West Seneca, N.Y.
