        Dr. Leroy Louis Schwartz, a former pediatrician who found a second career researching, lecturing and writing about health care and the many factors affecting it, like costs or social conditions, died on May 25 at his home in Princeton N.J. He was 64.
        The cause was ataxia, a neurological disorder, his family said.
        Dr. Schwartz was the president of the Princeton Institute for Health Policy and Health Policy International, a nonprofit foundation that examines health policy issues from a scientific perspective. Both are based in Princeton and were founded by him in the early 1980's.
        A native of Philadelphia, he was reared on Staten Island, where he graduated from Wagner College. He received his medical degree at the University of Bern, Switzerland, completed his residency at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and practiced pediatrics on Staten Island.
        He also developed a strong interest in the impact of public policy on health care and involved himself in issues like unnecessary surgery, substitution of generic drugs for brand-name drugs, marketing infant formula in undeveloped nations and the misuse of statistics and science in policy debates. He testified at Congressional hearings, wrote widely and was an advocate for science in medical affairs on the state, national and international levels.
        Dr. Schwartz is survived by two sons, Peter, of Manhattan, and David, of Highland Park, N.J.; a daughter, Adriane Hulsman of Santa Monica, Calif., and four grandchildren. His marriage to Deidre Schwartz, of Sag Harbor, Long Island, ended in divorce.
