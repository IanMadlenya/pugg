        Jascha Brodsky, a violinist who performed as a member of the Curtis String Quartet for more than 50 years and was renowned as a teacher, died on Monday at the Palm Garden Nursing Home in Ocala, Fla. He was 90.
        Mr. Brodsky was born in Kharkov, Ukraine, in 1907 and was the son of a violinist, who gave him his first lessons. He studied at the Conservatory of Tblisi in Georgia and performed in orchestras in the Soviet Union until 1926, when he left the country to study in Paris with Lucien Capet and Eugene Ysaye. In the late 1920's he toured Europe and the Soviet Union as a soloist and performed the Prokofiev Violin Concerto No. 1 with the composer conducting.
        On the advice of the violinist Mischa Elman, Mr. Brodsky applied to the newly founded Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, and in 1930 he enrolled there as a student of Efrem Zimbalist. That year he became first violinist of the ensemble that eventually became the Curtis String Quartet. He continued to perform with the ensemble until 1981, when it disbanded after the death of its founding violist, Max Aronoff.
        Mr. Brodsky joined the faculty of Curtis in 1932, and continued to teach the violin and chamber music there until his retirement in 1996. He also had a long teaching relationship with the Esther Boyer College of Music at Temple University, of which he was a founding faculty member in 1942, when it was known as the New School.
        Mr. Brodsky's students include Jaime Laredo, Nadia Salerno-Sonnenberg, Hilary Hahn and Leila Josefowicz, as well as violinists in several major American orchestras. He is survived by his wife, Marion Head Brodsky; a daughter, Mary Anne Lumi of Philadelphia, and two sons, Robert and Stephen, of Ocala.
