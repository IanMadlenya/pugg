        Richard H. Gallagher, retired president of Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y., died on Sept. 30 at Northwest Hospital in Tucson, Ariz. He was 69.
        He had cancer, said his wife, Terese.
        From 1988 to 1995, Dr. Gallagher, a civil engineer, was president of Clarkson, a small university where most students study engineering. It also has schools of management and science.
        The chairman of Clarkson's board of trustees, Ralph Hawes, said Dr. Gallagher was ''recognized internationally as a great scholar'' and, as president, ''was key to raising the academic standards for Clarkson.'' He also oversaw a sizable increase in the endowment, the founding of five new engineering programs and the construction of new buildings.
        Dr. Gallagher was born in Manhattan and earned three civil engineering degrees: bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University and a doctorate from the State University of New York at Buffalo. He worked in industry and at Cornell University, and was a professor and administrator at other colleges before going to Clarkson. He also had a substantial role in the early development of the finite element method, a computation technique widely used in engineering.
        Besides his wife, the former Terese Doyle, he is survived by five children, all engineers: a daughter, Mary Lee Rodin of Tucson; and four sons, Richard S., of Ithaca, N.Y., William J., of Newport Beach, Calif., Dr. Dennis M., of Stamford, Conn., and John B., of Mountain View, Calif., and five grandchildren.
