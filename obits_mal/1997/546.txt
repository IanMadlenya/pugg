        Alton Harrington Ketchum, a retired advertising executive and historian, died on April 29 at Reston Hospital Center in Reston, Va., during a family visit. He was 92 and lived in Cos Cob, Conn.
        Mr. Ketchum, a native of Cleveland and a 1926 graduate of what is now Case Western Reserve University, was the author of ''Uncle Sam: The Man and the Legend'' (Hill & Wang, 1959). In it, he traced the origins of the tall, bewhiskered character who came to personify the United States.
        The original Uncle Sam was Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in Troy, N.Y. Mr. Ketchum's book told how an incident in the War of 1812 provided the seed from which the symbol grew.
        Mr. Ketchum began his career as a globe-trotting United Press correspondent and then worked for Cleveland advertising agencies and The New York World Telegram before embarking on a 35-year career with the McCann-Erickson agency in 1934.
        He became vice president and creative director in the international division and later wrote a training text that was widely respected in the industry. He also wrote booklets for the United States Information Agency.
        Mr. Ketchum, whose wife, Robyna Neilson Ketchum, died in 1972, is survived by their daughter, Deborah Lambert of McLean, Va.; a half-brother, Dr. Robert Ketchum of St. George, Utah, and two grandsons.
