        Richard H. Randall Jr., an authority on medieval ivory carvings who was the director of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore from 1965 to 1981, died on Thursday in Baltimore. He was 71 and lived in Baltimore.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Christopher.
        Mr. Randall was assistant director of the Walters Art Gallery from 1964 to 1965 and also its curator of medieval art from 1964 through 1984.
        As the director, he oversaw the building of a $6.25 million addition to the museum that opened in 1974 and tripled its exhibition space to more than 40,000 square feet.
        The current director of the Walters, Gary K. Vikan, said Mr. Randall was ''a very object-focused and sensitive connoisseur.'' ''He lived for the thing itself,'' Dr. Vikan said. ''The first time I saw him at the Walters, he was opening a case of ivories and moving things around. His admonition to me was: 'Know your collections. Know the pieces.' ''
        A native of Baltimore, Mr. Randall  received a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1950 from Princeton and a master's degree in art history in 1951 from Harvard. From 1953 to 1959 he was assistant curator and then associate curator of medieval art at the Cloisters, the branch of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Washington Heights devoted to the art and architecture of medieval Europe. From 1959 to 1964 he was assistant curator of decorative arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
        He delighted in what he called ''the detective aspects of art history and the solution of problems of attribution.'' His many writings -- about arms and armor, decorative arts, American furniture and medieval art -- include more than 150 articles and the book ''The Golden Age of Ivory: Gothic Carvings in North American Collections'' (1993, Hudson Hills). The critic John Russell, writing in The New York Times Book Review in December 1993, called it ''in its understated way, one of the more voluptuous art books of the season.''
        Besides his son, of Concord, Mass, he is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Lilian Cramer; two daughters, Julia, of Oakland, Calif., and Katharine, of Tucson, Ariz.; two grandchildren, and a sister, Julia, of North Bennington, Vt.
