        Will Hare, a veteran character actor and a founding member of the Actors Studio, died on Aug. 31 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 and lived in Weehawken, N.J.
        He died of a heart attack after collapsing onstage during a rehearsal at the Actors Studio, said his agent, Jerry Kahn.
        Off Broadway, Mr. Hare starred in Brian Friel's ''Crystal and Fox'' (as the leader of a provincial acting company), played Dylan Thomas in a revival of Sidney Michaels's ''Dylan'' and was in John Ford Noonan's ''Older People'' and Conrad Bromberg's ''Dream of a Blacklisted Actor.'' He also appeared in plays by Horton Foote, Clifford Odets, David Rabe and Maxim Gorky.
        Mr. Hare was born in Elkins, W. Va., and moved to New York City in the late 1930's. In 1944, he was on Broadway in Jack Kirkland's ''Suds in Your Eye,'' and was also in Mr. Foote's ''Only the Heart.''
        In 1953, he appeared on Broadway with Lillian Gish in Mr. Foote's ''Trip to Bountiful.'' Through the next four decades, he worked on and off Broadway, in films and on television.
        His first film was ''The Wrong Man,'' directed by Alfred Hitchcock. On television he appeared in ''The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman.'' Mr. Hare gave his last New York performance in 1996 in Samuel Beckett's ''Nacht und Traume,'' directed by Joseph Chaikin.
        No immediate family members survive.
