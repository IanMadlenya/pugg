        Harry D. Gotwals, vice president of development and public and alumni relations at Swarthmore College for the past seven years, died on Oct. 2 at Taylor Hospital in Ridley Park, Pa. Mr. Gotwals, a resident of Swarthmore, was 50.
        The cause was a heart attack, the college reported.
        During Mr. Gotwals's service, $140 million was raised for Swarthmore's development fund, including $30 million donated last April by Eugene M. Lang, a New York philanthropist and alumnus. It was the largest gift ever to the college.
        A native of Chambersburg, Pa., Mr. Gotwals received a bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1969 and later earned a master's. He held several positions in college development before moving to Swarthmore.
        Mr. Gotwals is survived by his wife, Katherine; six daughters, Jennifer Gotwals of San Francisco, Lissa, Caitlin and Laura Gotwals of Durham, N.C., and Christie Bryan and Mary Katherine Bryan of Swarthmore; his father, Joseph, of Chambersburg; his brothers, Joseph Jr. of Schenectady, N.Y., Steve of Dublin, Ohio, and Edward of Chambersburg, and a sister, Anne Boryan, also of Chambersburg.
