        Edward Artinian, the founder and publisher of Chatham House Publishers, died on Sept. 9 at his home in Chatham, N.J. He was 61.
        The cause of death was heart failure, a spokeswoman for the publishing company said.
        Mr. Artinian founded Chatham, which specializes in political science and public policy works, in 1979. The publisher's books include ''The Real World Order'' (1993) by Max Singer and Aaron Wildavsky; ''Privatization: the Key to Better Government'' (1987) by E. S. Savas, and ''The Theory of Democracy Revisited'' (1987) by Giovanni Sartori.
        Chatham also published a collection of commentary and analysis on Presidential elections, which was edited by Gerald Pomper. It started with ''The Election of 1984'' and continued through 1996.
        Mr. Artinian graduated from Brown University in 1957 with a bachelor's degree and received an M.B.A. in 1977 from Columbia University. Before starting Chatham, he worked in sales and as an editor in the social sciences division for Dodd, Mead & Company, now defunct, and as an editor and college-division manager at David McKay Publishers, also defunct.
        Mr. Artinian is survived by his wife, Patricia, of Chatham.
