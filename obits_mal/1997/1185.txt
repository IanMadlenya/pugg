        Stephen D. Paine, an art collector and museum benefactor, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in Boston. He was 65 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        The cause was respiratory failure due to post-polio syndrome, his wife, Susan Woods Paine, said.
        Mr. Paine, an investment counselor who retired in 1995 as partner and senior vice president of the Wellington Management Company, was born in Cambridge on April 7, 1932, and raised in Brookline. He graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1950 and Williams College in 1954, with a degree in economics. In 1955, he contracted polio while serving in the United States Air Force and began to study art during his recuperation. He emerged from his illness confined to a wheelchair but with what was to be a lifelong passion for art.
        He began by collecting the drawings of the Abstract Expressionists in the early 1960's and was soon a regular visitor to galleries in Boston and New York, known for his discerning eye and eclectic taste. The works that he and his wife gave to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where he was a trustee for more than 20 years, included paintings, sculptures and prints by such artists as Kandinsky, Robert Rauschenberg, Helen Frankenthaler, Jean Dubuffet and David Smith.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Priscilla P. Fuller of Minneapolis and Sarah P. O'Brien of Scottsdale, Ariz.
