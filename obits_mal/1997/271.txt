        Tim Johnson, a concert promoter, producer and former owner of the Ballroom, a popular New York cabaret, died on March 14 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a stroke, Jimmy Roberts, a friend, said.
        In the 1950's, Mr. Johnson worked as an actor and model in Los Angeles and appeared in the film ''Daddy Long Legs'' and in the television series ''Father Knows Best'' and ''Maverick.'' While an owner of the Ballroom, he was instrumental in bringing Brazilian music to New York.
        With George Wein, he produced the Brazilian segment of the JVC Jazz Festival and Brazilfest, a component of Lincoln Center's Out of Doors festival. At his death, he was working on two events, a samba concert at Town Hall on Friday and a JVC Festival concert featuring Caetano Veloso at Avery Fisher Hall on  June 21.
        No immediate family members survive.
