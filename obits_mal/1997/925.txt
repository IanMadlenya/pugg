        Herbert A. Einhorn, a retired New York lawyer who specialized in corporate mergers, takeovers and proxy fights, died Sept. 19 at his home in Amherst, Mass. He was 84.
        Mr. Einhorn was a co-author of several books dealing with legal and policy questions in takeovers and the mechanics of making tender offers for stock in companies in which directors and executives resisted handing control to a new management team. In one dispute that attracted public attention, he represented Charles Green of the United Cigar-Whelan Stores Corporation in 1953 in a bid to elect outside directors of the 20th Century-Fox Film Corporation.
        He was an assistant New York state attorney general in the 1940's under Attorney General Nathan L. Goldstein. After a leave for Army service during World War II, he was assigned to deal with early disputes after the state introduced rent control in 1946. He was also a senior lawyer with the New York State Insurance Fund.
        Mr. Einhorn was a partner in the law firm of Aranow, Brodsky, Bohlinger, Einhorn & Dann from 1946 to 1979. He then moved to Washington as a senior law fellow with the Securities and Exchange Commission for two years, after which he returned to New York and joined the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
        Mr. Einhorn was born in New York City and graduated from Ohio University in 1933 and from Columbia Law School in 1935.
        His wife, Roslyn, died in 1994. He is survived by a son, Eric, of Amherst;  a daughter, Diane Einhorn Colish, of Harrison, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
