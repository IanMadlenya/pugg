        Ray Hyman, a musician and inventor, died on Aug. 15 at his home in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. He was 86.
        Mr. Hyman was an accomplished saxophonist who performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra for nearly 60 years. He was one of the few musicians to have worked under the orchestra's three longtime conductors, Leopold Stokowski, Eugene Ormandy and Riccardo Muti.
        He also performed with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra and with the Lester and Howard Lanin Society Bands.
        In the late 1950's, Mr. Hyman designed and patented a saxophone strap that quickly won favor among musicians and is widely used today. He also designed a popular saxophone case, the Sax-Pak. And he was the designer of several homes in Philadelphia, in Penn Valley, Pa., and on Long Beach Island in New Jersey.
        He is survived by two daughters, Judith Corson and Dena Robbins; two sons, Asher and Michael; nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
