        Delaney Kiphuth, a former director of athletics at Yale and one of the first administrators of the Ivy League, died on Feb. 12 at his home in Hamden, Conn. He was 78.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Kiphuth was the only son of Robert J. H. Kiphuth, a longtime Yale swimming and conditioning coach of international renown who coached six United States Olympic teams. Father and son were strong advocates of continued amateurism in Olympic and intercollegiate athletics at a time when professionalism threatened both.
        Mr. Kiphuth was a history teacher and a football and swimming coach at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., when he was appointed athletic director at Yale in 1954, a post his father had filled from 1946 to 1949.
        He held undergraduate and graduate degrees from Yale and had served as an officer in the United States Army Air Forces in World War II, earning a Bronze Star.
        The Ivy League, an organization of eight like-minded institutions when it came to keeping sports in balance with academics, began formal competition in 15 sports in 1956. Mr. Kiphuth, along with athletic directors from Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Pennsylvania and Princeton, were the league's first administrators.
        Carmen Cozza in football and Tim Taylor in hockey were among the successful coaches whom Mr. Kiphuth appointed in his 22 years as athletic director at Yale.
        After retiring in 1976, Mr. Kiphuth began an association with the Hopkins Grammar School in New Haven and continued another with Luther Gulick summer camp in South Casco, Me., where he was the swimming director for several years.
        He is survived by a daughter, Margaret, of Hamden.
