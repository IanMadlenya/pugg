        Rolf Knie, a master elephant trainer who led Switzerland's foremost circus family for 50 years, died on Monday. He was 75.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said a Knie Circus spokesman, Hans Rathgeb.
        Mr. Knie, who was billed as the man who spoke to elephants, headed the family-owned Swiss National Circus from the death of his father in 1941 to his retirement in 1991.
        The Knie family originally came from Austria, where it gained prominence in 1803 by founding the Society of Tightrope Walkers in Vienna.
        The family settled in Rapperswil, Switzerland, a lakeside town about 15 miles southeast of Zurich, early in this century, and began the Swiss Knie circus in 1919 to considerable success. Its first performance, under a big top, was in Bern.
        Rolf Knie began his circus life as an acrobat at the insistence of his father, who said Mr. Knie and his older brother, Fredy, ''must begin their performing life just like everyone else,'' Mr. Rathgeb said.
        At 16, Mr. Knie discovered his love of elephants when he took over for a trainer who had become ill. He was often quoted as saying that he considered elephants his friends, and that ''their success is also mine.'' He quickly grabbed attention, performing in 1941 with his elephant, Baby, who walked on two suspended ropes, Mr. Rathgeb said.
        With the death of his father that same year, Mr. Knie and his brother inherited the circus leadership. Rolf Knie handled the commercial side and his brother was the artistic director.
        Mr. Knie, who worked with more than 50 elephants until his last appearance in 1969, also established the Zoo for Children at Rapperswil, at which youngsters could view the circus animals when they were not performing. Four baby elephants were born at the zoo.
        Mr. Knie is survived by his wife, Tina di Giovanni, and two sons, Louis and Franco, who have followed their father into training and performing with elephants.
