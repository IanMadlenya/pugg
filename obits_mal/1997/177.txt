        Thomas Daniel Young, a professor of English at Vanderbilt University and a leading authority on literature of the American South, died on Jan. 29 at the Bay Springs General Nursing Home in Bay Springs, Miss. He was 77 and lived in Rose Hill, Miss.
        The cause was complications after abdominal surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Young's many books and articles on Southern writers were influential in promoting Southern literature around the world. Among them were ''The Literature of the South,'' ''Conversations With Malcolm Cowley,'' ''Tennessee Writers'' and ''Gentleman in a Dustcoat: A Biography of John Crowe Ransom,'' whose writing Mr. Young especially championed.
        A native of Mississippi, Mr. Young received a bachelor's degree from the University of Southern Mississippi. After serving in the Army Air  Forces during World War II, he went on to earn a master's degree from the University of Mississippi and a doctorate from Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
        He later joined the Vanderbilt faculty, becoming the chairman of the English department and Gertrude C. Vanderbilt Professor of English. He retired in 1985. He had previously served on the faculties of several other colleges, including the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg and Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss.
        He is survived by his wife, Arlease; three sons, Thomas D. Jr., of Austin, Tex., and Terry Lewis and Kyle David, both of Nashville, and a sister, Janie Kemp of Noxapater, Miss.
