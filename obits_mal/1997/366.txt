        Nelson Frederick Sievering Jr., the United States representative at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna from 1993 until recently, died on March 6 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sievering, who resigned from the agency shortly before his death, was the deputy director general for administration at the agency from 1980 to 1987. The agency is responsible for inspecting civilian nuclear plants to verify that no materials are being diverted to military uses.
        Mr. Sievering graduated from Yale University in 1945 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1948.
        Survivors include his wife, Dorothy; two sons, Nelson 3d, of Rockville, Md., and Jeffrey, of Springfield, Va., and seven grandchildren.
