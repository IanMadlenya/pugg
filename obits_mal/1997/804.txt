        Buddy Hassett, a first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers, Boston Braves and Yankees who was known as a fine hitter and fielder, but was best remembered for his propensity to croon at the drop of a baseball hat, died on Saturday. He was 85.
        Hassett, who had bone cancer, died at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, N.J.
        In a seven-year major league career, Hassett had a batting average of .292. He was a master of bat control, striking out only 17 times in 635 at-bats as a rookie with the 1936 Dodgers. He never had as many as 20 strikeouts in a season.
        But John Aloysius Hassett -- an Irish tenor dubbed the Bronx Thrush -- loved to entertain without a bat in his hands. ''I did a little singing in the Paulist church choir on 59th Street when I was growing up and then we moved to the Bronx,'' he once recalled. ''My father ran the Shamrock Democratic Club, and he'd have parties up there and I used to sing. I didn't have any formal lessons.''
        While with the semipro Bay Parkways in Brooklyn, Hassett kept fans around when skies grew gray. ''If some drops came down before game time, Joe Press, the manager, used to grab me,'' Hassett remembered. ''He had a little megaphone. He'd get up there and say, 'Hey, sing them a couple of songs to keep them in the park.' Once in a while, it worked.''
        While with the Dodgers, from 1936 to 1938, Hassett sang in stage shows between movies at the downtown Brooklyn Strand, often performing in a vaudeville routine with Stan Lomax, a sportswriter and broadcaster. His specialty, not surprisingly, was ''When Irish Eyes Are Smiling.''
        Hassett played three seasons with both the Dodgers and Braves, then took over at first base for the Yankees in 1942. After serving as a naval officer in World War II, he managed the Yankees' Newark farm team.
        Hassett, who lived in Hillsdale, N.J., is survived by a daughter, Patricia Gradziel of Davis, Calif., and three grandchildren.
