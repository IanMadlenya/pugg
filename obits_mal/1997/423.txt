        Les Cason, whose overwhelmingly successful basketball career at East Rutherford High School in New Jersey signaled a promise he never came close to achieving, died on Wednesday. He was 43.
        Cason died from complications from AIDS at a nursing home in Manhattan, said Rod Malloy, a spokesman for the Bowery Mission in Manhattan, where Cason lived.
        Few shooting stars ever flared as brightly as Cason's or burned out as swiftly. As a player for East Rutherford under Coach Dick Vitale, now a broadcaster, Cason scored 2,871 points, still a Bergen County boys basketball record, and led the school to state titles as a junior and senior in 1971 and 1972.
        At 6 feet 9 inches, he was so exceptional as a scorer, rebounder and defender that he was offered scholarships by 320 colleges. He was often compared to Lew Alcindor, the New York City schoolboy who went on to basketball glory at U.C.L.A. and in the National Basketball Association as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
        There was no road to glory for Cason. As the pressures from college recruiters and low test scores intensified, his skills on the court eroded. Cason made brief stops at Long Beach State in California, San Jacinto Junior College in Texas and Rutgers in New Jersey before his career ended.
        By 1975, he had developed a drug problem that troubled him the rest of his life.
        He is survived by his mother.
