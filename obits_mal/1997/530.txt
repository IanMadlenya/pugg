        Meir Lev, the director of research services and a professor of microbiology at City University of New York Medical School-Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, died on May 1 at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer of the esophagus, his family said.
        Dr. Lev's research concerned the biosynthesis and enzyme structure of sphingolipids, fundamental parts of cell membranes that serve as receptors for various bacteria and viruses. His work was aimed at the treatment of inherited disorders like Gaucher's and Krabbe's diseases  and at the inhibition of the herpes virus and retroviruses like H.I.V., which causes AIDS.
        He developed a new compound called Lev-cycloserine, or L-CS, and at his death was exploring its potential as an anti-AIDS drug.
        Born in Hull, England, Dr. Lev received degrees in microbiology from the Universities of Birmingham and Reading in England, where he worked before moving to the United States in 1964 to join the faculty at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He joined City University Medical School in 1986 as an associate dean and was named director of research services three years later.
        Dr. Lev's marriage to Lenore Lev, of Jackson Heights, Queens, ended in divorce. He is survived by two daughters, Shoshana and Rachel Lev, both of Riverdale, and his siblings, Anita and Lionel Lev, both of Birmingham, England.
