        Dr. John Gray Peatman, a statistician who studied audience reaction to early radio broadcasts and was a professor of psychology at City College for several decades, died on March 9 at his home in Norwalk, Conn. He was 92.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Dr. Mary Peatman of Manhattan and Norwalk.
        In the 1940's, he was one of the first people to use scientific methods to study listeners' attitudes toward radio broadcasts. Later, his methods were used to study audiences for television, and royalties to composers were based on his methods for estimating the size of broadcast audiences for programs on which music was played.
        He was the author of ''Geographical Sampling in Testing Appeals of Radio Broadcasts'' in 1950 and two textbooks on statistics.
        Dr. Peatman was born in Centerville, Iowa. He received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate from Columbia University and from 1931 until his retirement in 1970, he taught there and at St. Mark's Hospital in Manhattan, and at the City College of New York, where he was associate dean of liberal arts and sciences from 1944 to 1953 and chairman of the department of psychology from 1952 to 1963.
        His marriage to Lillie Burling ended in divorce. He later married Madeline Martin, who died in 1984. Survivors, in addition to his daughter, include two sons, Dr. John Burling Peatman of Atlanta and Dr. William Burling Peatman of Berlin; 9 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren.
