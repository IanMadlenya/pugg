        Robert M. Rogers, founder, chairman and chief executive of TCA Cable TV in Tyler, Tex., died on Sept. 18 at his home in Tyler. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, a TCA spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Rogers started the company in 1954 with the purchase of a cable television operator. Today, TCA operates 64 cable systems in eight states, most of them in the South.
        Mr. Rogers served in the Navy and owned several drive-in movie theaters before starting TCA.
        He is survived by his wife, Robyn Malone Rogers of Tyler; three daughters, Sheryl Rogers Palmer and Cynthia Louanne Rogers, both of Tyler, and Rebecca Jean Rogers of Dallas; two sons, Randall Kent Rogers of Tyler and Russell Bradley Rogers of Russellville, Ark.; two stepsons, John David Harwood and Joseph Matthew Harwood of Tyler, and two grandchildren.
