        Joseph Jablow, professor emeritus of anthropology at Brooklyn College and chairman of the department from 1971 to his retirement in 1977, died on Jan. 20 at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 82.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Jablow, whose teaching focused on physical vestiges like artifacts, started his teaching career at Brooklyn College in 1947 and was granted tenure in 1954. In the early 1950's he led a United Nations technical assistance mission, based in Liberia, that set up health and educational programs for UNESCO.
        He also served as an expert witness in land disputes brought before the Indian Claims Commission.
        He joined the Brooklyn faculty in 1950 and became chairman of the Anthropology Department in 1971.
        Dr. Jablow is survived by his daughter, Lisa Jablow of Manhattan and Waterville, Vt.; and a sister, Mildred Cherry of Tenafly, N.J. His wife of 45 years, Prof. Alta Gusar Jablow, also an anthropologist at Brooklyn College until she retired in 1986, died five years ago.
