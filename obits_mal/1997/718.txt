        Henry Evans Howell Jr., a populist-style liberal Virginia Democrat who irked party old-liners so much that they banded with conservative Republicans to end his political career in 1977, died on Monday at his home in Norfolk. He was 76.
        He had suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Howell was Lieutenant Governor from 1971 to 1973. After he lost a 1973 race for governor, he stayed active in politics and marshaled enough support from blacks and suburbanites to surprise the party establishment by winning the 1977 Democratic primary for governor.
        Conservatives got their revenge that November by helping his Republican opponent, Lieut. Gov. John N. Dalton, to a lopsided victory. A notable exception to the defeat of the Howell slate that year was Charles S. Robb, who was elected lieutenant governor that year and later governor and senator.
        Mr. Howell crusaded for civil rights, organized labor and consumer interests. He lost his first race for governor in 1969, but was elected lieutenant governor as an independent candidate in 1971 after being shunned by party leaders.
        After his 1977 defeat, he returned to the practice of law as a founding partner of what is now Howell, Daugherty & Brown.
        Henry Howell was born in Norfolk and attended the College of William and Mary before earning a law degree at the University of Virginia. He first won elective office, to the House of Delegates, in 1960 and in 1966 moved on to the State Senate, where he remained until 1971.
        Mr. Howell is survived by his wife, Elizabeth McCarty Howell; two daughters, Mary E. Howell of Norfolk and Susan H. Howell of Portsmouth, Va.; a son, Henry H. 3d, of Virginia Beach, Va., and three grandchildren.
