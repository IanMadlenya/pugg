        Richard Mason, a British author best known for ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' a novel about a Hong Kong prostitute, died on Monday in a hospital here. He was 78 and had lived in Rome for nearly 40 years.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' published in 1957, is the story of a Chinese prostitute who falls in love with an artist. It is set against the background of Hong Kong's glittery night life. The novel was dramatized by  Paul Osborn and produced on Broadway in 1958 with William Shatner as the artist and France Nuyen as the prostitute. The 1960 film starred  William Holden and Nancy Kwan.
        Mr. Mason's earlier books, based on his experiences in World War II when he served in Burma with the Royal Air Force, included ''The Wind Cannot Read'' (1947) and ''The Shadow and the Peak'' (1950).
        He is survived by his wife, Maggie, and two children, Theo and Jessica.
