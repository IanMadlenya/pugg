        John Spencer-Churchill Guest, a retired investment banker who wrote about the Middle East, died on May 14 at his home in New Canaan, Conn. He was 84 and also lived in Fishers Island, N.Y.
        Mr. Guest, a native of London, graduated from Cambridge University and received an M.B.A. from Harvard University in 1937, the year he joined the firm of Kuhn Loeb & Company in Manhattan.
        As a partner and subsequently a managing director of the firm, which became Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., he specialized in transportation finance and restructuring.
        He retired in 1989 as an advisory director. The firm was then known as  Shearson Lehman Hutton.
        He was the author of ''The Ancient Road: From Aleppo to Baghdad in the Days of the Ottoman Empire,'' which was published by Columbia University Press last year, and ''Survival Among the Kurds: A Study of the Yezidis'' (Routledge; 1993).
        Mr. Guest's interest in the Middle East ran in his family. He was a great-grandson of a Duke of Marlboro, and his father, Col. Christian Guest, was a first cousin of Winston Churchill.
        He was a longtime board member and past chairman of Burke Rehabilitation Hospital in White Plains and a trustee of Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., and of Robert College in Istanbul, Turkey. He was also a director of the British American Educational Foundation in New York.
        Mr. Guest is survived by his wife of 48 years, Margaret Houck Guest; a son, Richard, of Norwalk, Conn.; a daughter, Cornelia, of North Salem, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
        Correction:  May 23, 1997, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about John Spencer-Churchill Guest, a retired investment banker who wrote about the Middle East, misspelled the title of his great-grandfather. He was Duke of Marlborough, not Marlboro.
