        Bruce K. Gelbard, the powerful secretary to the New York City Board of Education who was ousted last summer, died Saturday at Staten Island Hospital. He was 45.
        The cause was cardiac arrhythmia, his friend and lawyer, Samuel A. Abady, said. Mr. Gelbard had been in a coma since Tuesday.
        Mr. Gelbard was at the center of a battle for control of the seven-member board last year, when his chief ally, the former board president, Carol A. Gresser, was unseated by William C. Thompson Jr. Mr. Thompson garnered the support of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in part by characterizing Mr. Gelbard as obstructing the board's efforts to streamline the bureaucracy.
        Led by Mr. Thompson, the board dismissed Mr. Gelbard last July amid accusations that he had used his authority to dispense cellular phones and chauffeured cars to cultivate the loyalty of board officials. Mr. Thompson stopped short of charging the secretary with corruption, but he said he had overstepped the bounds of his clerical duties.
        Mr. Thompson ordered an audit and reorganization of the secretary's office and appointed his personal assistant, Ron LeDonni, as the interim secretary. The post has not yet been filled permanently.
        Mr. Gelbard earned both his bachelor's degree in education and psychology and his master's in educational psychology from Brooklyn College. He began his career in the New York City school system as a classroom aide in 1974. In 1990, he became board secretary.
        Mr. Gelbard is survived by his wife, the former Lila Schaefer; a stepdaughter, Debra Reinish; his parents, David and Jean Gelbard of Staten Island and Delray Beach, Fla.; a brother, Dr. Mark Gelbard of Miami, and a sister, Trudy Markowitz of Great Neck, L.I.
