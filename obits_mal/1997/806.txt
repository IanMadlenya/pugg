        Johnny Byrne, a sound engineer and producer who was a fixture on New York's Irish music scene, died on Saturday at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. He was 39.
        He died after falling from the fire escape of his East Village apartment on Aug. 3, said his sister, Bronwyn O'Donnell of Dublin.
        Born in Dublin, Mr. Byrne began his musical career in the late 1970's as bass guitarist for an Irish punk rock group, the New Versions. But while working on some low-budget recordings of the band, he discovered his true calling and soon put down his bass to take over chores behind the mixing console.
        He worked at the Keystone and Windmill Lane studios in Dublin with artists like U2, the Chieftains, Christy Moore, the Boomtown Rats, Thin Lizzy, Paul Brady, the Radiators from Space and Rory Gallagher. He also worked on commercials for radio and television.
        Mr. Byrne moved to New York City in 1985, where he worked as a live sound engineer while producing and recording acts that included Black 47, Eileen Ivers, Pat Kilbride, Rogue's March, the Rascals and Ploughman's Lunch. He recently finished recording an album of children's songs with Larry Kirwan of Black 47; at the time of his accident he was completing an album by the traditional Irish music band the Tain.
        In addition to Mrs. O'Donnell, Mr. Byrne is survived by his mother, Una; two brothers, Diarmuid and Brian, and another sister, Avril O'Farrell, all of Dublin.
