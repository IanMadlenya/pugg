        Johnny Coles, a trumpeter and fluegelhornist who illuminated some of the best jazz groups of the 1950's and 60's with his warm, soft sound, died on Dec. 21 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 71.
        The cause was stomach cancer, Darlene Drummond, his niece, said.
        Mr. Coles was born in Trenton, and  his family moved to Philadelphia when he was still a child. There he joined a pool of first-rate jazz musicians who would move on to New York and greater recognition. Among them were Benny Golson, Jimmy Heath and John Coltrane.
        Mr. Coles's style had a connection to Miles Davis, and the arranger Gil Evans hired him for many recording sessions in the early 60's. Besides taking part in the trumpet section of the famous Evans-Davis collaborations ''Porgy and Bess'' and ''Sketches of Spain,'' Mr. Coles contributed some well-known solos to Evans's 1960 album ''Out of the Cool.'' He also recorded under his own name  for the Epic and Blue Note labels.
        In 1964 he toured with Charles Mingus and in the late 60's was a member of Herbie Hancock's sextet and toured with Ray Charles. In the 70's, he played with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. He played in the early incarnation of the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis band and was a regular presence in New York as a leader and a sideman in groups that paid tribute to Basie and Mingus.
        No immediate family members survive.
