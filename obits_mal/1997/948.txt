        John A. Esposito, a former Republican State Assemblyman who ran for mayor of New York on the Conservative Party ticket in 1981, died on Sunday in Garden City, N.Y., at the home of a daughter. He was 69.
        He died after long battle with lung cancer, said another daughter, Patricia Todd of New Hartford, N.Y.
        Mr. Esposito, who was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1950, had lived in Queens Village since 1955. From 1950 to 1982, he worked as a lawyer in private practice. During that time, he also served as an assistant district attorney for Queens County and held executive positions with the New York State Public Service Commission and the New York State Court of Claims.
        In 1971, he was elected to the Assembly from the 23d District, which covers southeastern Queens, and served six terms. He was known for spending much of his time tending to his constituents' smallest needs -- seeing that a toppled mailbox was righted, inquiring about a better phone system for a police station house.
        He was known, too, for his unpretentious, uninhibited style and a lack of oratorial skills. ''They've called me Claudius because I'm not the perfect speaker,'' he said in 1981.
        In 1977, Mr. Esposito ran unsuccessfully as the Republican Party candidate for president of the New York City Council.
        As a mayoral candidate in 1981, he ran against Edward I. Koch for the Republican nomination, bitterly campaigning against the Mayor for running as both a Democrat and a Republican. After Mr. Koch won the primary, Mr. Esposito ran on the Conservative Party ticket and, as he expected, lost.
        Besides Ms. Todd, Mr. Esposito is survived by his wife, Estelle; his other daughter, Dr. Anne Anderson of Garden City; a son, Thomas Esposito of Farmingdale, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
