        Jerome Alden, a writer for stage, television and screen whose works included the play ''Bully'' and the musical ''Teddy and Alice,'' died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan.
        The cause was kidney cancer, said his wife, Barbara Gaye. He was 76.
        Mr. Alden was born in Portland, Ore., and graduated with a degree in theater from the University of Oregon. After serving in the Special Services during World War II he moved to New York City, where he acted off Broadway and wrote scripts for documentary films and television.
        He wrote two plays based on the life of Theodore Roosevelt. ''Bully,'' a one-man show with James Whitmore in the title role, played at the 46th Street Theater in 1977, and the musical ''Teddy and Alice'' ran briefly at the Minskoff Theater in 1987. He also wrote ''Shakespeare Revisited,'' an evening of Shakespeare that Helen Hayes and Maurice Evans took on tour around the United States in the early 60's.
        Mr. Alden was the executive story editor and writer for ''Bicentennial Minutes,'' a series of instant history lessons that ran on CBS in 1976. His television credits include ''The Truman Years,'' ''A Gathering of One'' and ''The American Adventure.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Manhattan, and David, of London; and a daughter, Jennifer, of Manhattan.
