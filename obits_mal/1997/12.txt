        Richard A. R. Pinkham, a retired New York advertising executive who was a member of the team that helped the National Broadcasting Company enter the era of network television, died last Sunday at Jupiter Medical Center in Jupiter, Fla. He was 82 and had homes in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Rye, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        NBC appointed him manager of planning for its budding video network in 1951. Then, as a vice president, he was given responsibility for network programming. In that post he had a leading role in shaping the ''Today'' show with Dave Garroway and the ''Tonight'' show with Steve Allen.
        He moved to Ted Bates & Company in 1957, where he held senior management positions in television programming and production.
        After Bates merged its media and programming functions in 1963, Mr. Pinkham led the combined department. He was elected to the advertising agency's executive committee, served as its chairman and in 1976 was named vice chairman of the company. He retired in 1979.
        A native of Manhattan, he graduated from Yale College in 1936. He worked briefly for Time magazine and The New York Herald Tribune before moving into television and advertising.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Struthers Pinkham; two daughters, Mary Janeway of Cambridge, Mass., and Elisabeth Anderson of Billings, Mont.; two sons, Richard A. R. Jr., of Rye, and David S., of Barrington, R.I., and eight grandchildren.
