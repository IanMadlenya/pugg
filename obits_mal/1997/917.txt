        Albert Haas, a specialist in heart-and-lung disease and the physical rehabilitation of the patient, died on Aug. 12 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. A resident of Greenwich Village, he was 85.
        Dr. Haas was a retired professor of medicine at New York University and its Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine. He was also a former director of cardiopulmonary service at Bellevue Hospital. He retired from N.Y.U. in 1979 and from Bellevue five years later.
        He was a native of Hungary and graduated from the Royal Hungarian Medical School in 1937. He moved to France and then trained at the Institute of Tropical Diseases in Antwerp, Belgium.
        He and his wife, Sonja Nadel Haas, joined the French Resistance in World War II, were captured by the Gestapo and sent to separate concentration camps.
        He began his career in pulmonary rehabilitation in postwar France, beginning with an institute near Paris. It offered physical, psychological and vocational recovery to camp survivors who had contracted tuberculosis.
        He set up a similar center in Germany's Black Forest for handicapped people in the displaced persons camps. His work there came to the attention of Dr. Howard Rusk, the principal architect of rehabilitation medicine in the United States.
        Dr. Haas was invited to Bellevue Hospital in 1950 to establish a chest rehabilitation service for chronic disease like emphysema. He created a similar service for Dr. Rusk's institute at N.Y.U.
        In 1971 the French Government awarded the French Legion of Honor to him.
        His wife died in 1989. Dr. Haas is survived by their son, Francois, of Manhattan; a sister, Francoise Haas of Montreal, and two grandchildren.
