        Carl Jacobi, a short-story writer whose tales of the macabre and fantastic filled pulp magazines and books for six decades, died on Monday at a nursing home in suburban Minneapolis. He was 89.
        Mr. Jacobi sold his first story in 1928; four years later his work became a staple of Weird Tales and similar magazines. A selection of his stories -- his fifth -- dating from the 1930's to the 1980's, ''Smoke of the Snake'' (1994), remains in print. With translations into many languages, his readership extended around the globe.
        A graduate of the University of Minnesota, he started out as a reporter for The Minneapolis Star and also worked in public relations before turning to full-time freelance writing. Though he never traveled farther than Canada, his fourth collection, ''East of Samarind'' (1989), was set in Borneo and New Guinea and was his only fiction outside the horror genre. It consisted of adventure tales backed by painstaking research, including correspondence in the early 1930's with military outposts in what were then Dutch and British colonies.
        His books also included ''Revelations in Black'' (1949), ''Portraits in Moonlight'' (1964) and ''Disclosures in Scarlett'' (1972). His research also produced a textbook for the Minneapolis high-school system, ''Paths to the Far East,'' published in the 1930's.
        A biography of Mr. Jacobi by R. Dickson Smith was titled ''Lost in the Rentharpian Hills'' (1985). The title referred to the fictional Midwestern locale in which he often set his spooky tales.
        No immediate family members survive.
