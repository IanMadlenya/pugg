        Norman D. Waters, who owned an advertising agency bearing his name and who in 1941 produced the first fashion show broadcast on television, died Tuesday at Osborn Retirement Community in Rye, N.Y., his daughter, Elizabeth Waters Haron, said. He was 92.
        Mr. Waters was an early champion of television, saying it would ''exert a greater influence on fashion than any factor yet known'' and trying throughout World War II to get the Government to use broadcasting to make training efficient.
        In September 1941 he produced ''Five O'Clock Party,'' a playlet sponsored by Abraham & Straus and Bloomingdale's that was staged to show off women's fashions. The show was one of 17 staged at Radio City  that were broadcast by WNBT (now WNBC), the National Broadcasting Company's station.
        Mr. Waters also produced ''The Arthur Murray Party,'' a precursor of today's infomercials that sought to attract clients to the chain of dance schools by entertaining people with dancing on television. He was also the first president of the American Television Society.
        In addition to his daughter, Elizabeth, of Greenwich, Conn., Mr. Waters is survived by his wife of 70 years, Elaine Lion Waters; one son, L. Sanford, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
