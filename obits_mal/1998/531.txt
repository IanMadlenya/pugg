        Arthur F. Mathews, who helped build one of the country's leading legal practices dealing with securities enforcement and white collar crime, died on Sunday at his home in Washington. He was 60.
        The cause was complications from stomach cancer, according to his brother-in-law, Ben Crisman.
        Mr. Mathews, a senior partner of the Washington law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering for 29 years, defended such high-profile clients as Paul A. Bilzerian, the former chairman of the Singer Corporation who was one of the few Wall Street figures to be convicted of insider trading in the late 1980's.
        He also represented major corporations, including Prudential Securities, the Grumman Aircraft Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company.
        After graduating from Albany Law School in 1962, Mr. Mathews served in the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission and left in 1969 as deputy associate director of enforcement.
        He taught securities law for 20 years at Georgetown University Law Center and Washington College of Law at American University.
        A participant in 16 marathons and a collector of antique fountain pens, Mr. Mathews was raised on his grandfather's farm in Herkimer, N.Y., and spent the last few years writing short stories for children based on those childhood experiences.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy Crisman; their two children, Colin and Sunisa of Washington; three children from his first marriage, Scott of Germantown, Md., Susan of Washington, and Clarissa of Inwood, W. Va., and a grandchild.
