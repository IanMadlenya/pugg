        Thomas E. Norton, an art consultant, writer and former senior vice president and director of Sotheby's,  died on Feb. 7 at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. He was 63 and lived in Kennebunkport, Me.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Mary Louise.
        A well-known appraiser and art consultant, Mr. Norton was the author of several books, including ''100 Years of Collecting in America,'' which was published in 1985.
        Mr. Norton was born in Portland, Me., and grew up in New York and New Jersey. He graduated from Fordham University in 1956 and that year began his career at the Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York, eventually becoming a director and senior vice president of the company when it was purchased by Sotheby's in 1964. Besides being an expert in American paintings, Mr. Norton headed what was then Sotheby's paintings department. He left the auction house in 1981.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Norton is survived by a son, Andrew Edward Norton, also of Kennebunkport, and three sisters, Maureen Wolferse, Margaret Braun and Kathleen Larsen, all of New Jersey.
