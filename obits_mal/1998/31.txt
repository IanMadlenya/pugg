        Bob Wilvers, a former advertising executive, died on Dec. 10 at his home in New Milford, Conn. He was 65.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Francine Wilvers, a former wife.
        Mr. Wilvers was the art director for the Carl Ally agency in the early 1960's when he developed a campaign for Salada Tea. The commercial featured little old ladies on large Harley-Davidson motorcycles and the tag line ''Who says that Salada Tea is for little old ladies?''
        In 1964, he became a founding partner and co-creative director at Jack Tinker & Partners, with a client roster that included Coca-Cola, Gillette and Alka-Seltzer Plus.
        When Jack Tinker disbanded in 1969, Mr. Wilvers went to Scali, McCabe & Sloves. In 1972, he joined Wells, Rich & Greene, and worked there for 20 years, except for three short stints at other firms. At Wells, he helped develop the commercials for Alka-Seltzer built around the jingle ''Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is.''
        That team was also responsible for other campaigns including the Citibank series, ''The Citi never sleeps''  and the ''There's a Ford in America's future'' effort for the Ford Motor Company. In 1993, Mr. Wilvers was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame. He was an accomplished watercolor painter and illustrator whose work was featured in several galleries and museums.
        He is survived by Francine Wilvers of New York, whom he divorced in 1994; two daughters, Roberta Wilvers of New York and Tracy Wilvers Cassidy of Framingham, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Erica Wexler and Merin Wexler Spiro, both of New York, and one grandchild.
        Mr. Wilvers is also survived by his first wife, Marilyn Armstrong of North Chatham, N.Y., whom he divorced in 1967.
