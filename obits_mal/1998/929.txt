        Bill Cratty, a choreographer and dancer with the Jose Limon Dance Company, died on Sept. 9 at his home in London. He was 47.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Trader Selkirk, Mr. Cratty's companion.
        Mr. Cratty was ''a very pure and concentrated dancer'' with ''integrity of gesture,'' Anna Kisselgoff wrote in 1987 in The New York Times. Ms. Kisselgoff added, ''Unlike so many others, he knows how to tell a story and create a character portrait.''
        Mr. Cratty performed for eight years with the Limon company, achieving the rank of soloist, during the late 70's and early 80's. He also danced with Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak Project and appeared on Broadway in ''Jerome Robbins's Broadway.'' He taught dance at various colleges. In 1994, he moved to London, where he was director of Transitions, a troupe affiliated with the Laban Center.
        He began choreographing in 1981 and directed his own company, the Bill Cratty Dance Theater, from 1981 through 1988. His first piece, ''The Kitchen Table,'' was probably his best-known, chronicling a family's robotlike preparation of a meal.
        In addition to Mr. Selkirk, Mr. Cratty is survived by his parents, Robert and Dorothy, of Cleveland, and two brothers, Scott, of Cleveland, and Robert, of Boston.
