        Gary Nardino, a television executive who was instrumental in bringing long-running programs like ''Happy Days,'' ''Cheers'' and ''Taxi'' into American homes, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Saturday of complications from a stroke, Bill Nuss, his business partner, said. He was 62 and had lived in Los Angeles.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Nardino was co-president of North Hall Productions, the producer of the ''Pacific Blue'' series, which is in its fourth season on the USA Network.
        For much of the late 1970's and 1980's, the television studios Mr. Nardino ran were powerful forces in Hollywood. From 1977 until 1983, he was president of Paramount Television. During his tenure the studio turned out popular weekly situation comedies and also developed the mini-series ''Shogun'' and ''The Winds of War.''
        In 1988, after a five-year stint as an independent producer, Mr. Nardino was named president and chief executive of Orion Television Entertainment. Over the next three years, the studio produced series including ''Equal Justice'' and ''Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures.'' In 1991, when Orion closed its television production operation, he moved to Warner Brothers Television and remained there until 1994.
        A native of Paterson, N.J., Mr. Nardino was a graduate of Seton Hall University. He began in the entertainment industry as an agent.
        Mr. Nardino is survived by his father, Louis Nardino of Paramus, N.J.; two sisters, Theresa N. Sodaro of Paramus and Angela N. Stafford of Sterling, Va., and three children, Caroline Nardino, Gary Nardino and Teresa Nardino, all of Los Angeles. His marriage to the former Florence Peluso ended in divorce.
