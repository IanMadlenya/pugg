        Tim Greathouse, a leading figure of the East Village art scene of the 1980's, died on Oct. 18 at his home in Manhattan. He was 48.
        The cause was AIDS-related complications, said Kathe Burkhart, a friend.
        Mr. Greathouse first showed his own photographs, many documenting life on the Lower East Side, at Gracie Mansion Gallery in 1982 and soon afterward published ''Who's Who in Lower Manhattan,'' a book of portraits of art world personalities.
        He opened his own gallery, Oggi Domani, in a storefront on East 11th Street in 1984. In 1986 he moved to a larger space nearby, renamed the gallery T. Greathouse and showed painting, sculpture and conceptual art there as well as photography. Artists to whom he gave first or early shows include Ms. Burkhart, Anne Messner, Andrew Masullo, Zoe Leonard, Peter Hujar, Jimmy de Sana and Hope Sandrow.
        Mr. Greathouse closed his gallery in 1988 when the East Village boom ended and worked as an art consultant and graphic designer.
        He is survived by his companion, Jay L. Katz of Manhattan; his mother, Elsie J. Greathouse of New Manchester, W.Va., and a brother, Mark, of Pittsburgh.
