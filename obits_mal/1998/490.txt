        James Carroll McIntyre, a fund-raiser for the arts and a former executive at Carnegie Hall and the Big Apple Circus, died on Friday at his home in Saylorsburg, Pa. He was 49 and also had a home in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was not known, said Gary Dunning, executive director of the Big Apple Circus and Mr. McIntyre's successor in that position.
        Mr. McIntyre was executive director from 1989 until 1995, when he resigned after testing positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Since then he had worked as an advocate for people with AIDS and as a consultant for arts organizations.
        A native of Sanford, N.C., he graduated from Duke University in 1971. After graduation, he remained in Durham, N.C., and helped found the Durham Arts Center, serving as its executive director at a time when it played a pivotal role in revitalizing the downtown.
        In 1971 he was named director of the corporate fund at Carnegie Hall. In that role, he oversaw the $60 million Campaign for Carnegie Hall, which financed the restoration and renovation of the auditorium. He was appointed director of development in 1985 and supervised the opening of the refurbished Carnegie Hall the following year.
        He became executive director of the Big Apple Circus in New York, a popular not-for-profit performing arts center, in 1989. At his death he was a member of its board.
        He is survived by his companion, Gary Rosard.
