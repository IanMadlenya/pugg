        Maurice Sorrell, a photographer who covered the height of the civil rights era in the South and became the first black member of the White House Photographers Association,  died on June 22 at Providence Hospital in Washington. He was 84 and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Sorrell was a news photographer in the Washington bureau of the Johnson Publishing Company, which publishes Jet and Ebony magazines, from 1962 until he retired in 1993. He  photographed civil rights events during the 1960's despite ''dogs snipping at my heels, tear gas, bayonets at the back,'' he once recalled in an interview.
        He joined the White House Photographers Association in 1961 after some trouble working with other White House photographers. As he recalled: ''They had a little thing where they would get arm in arm and try to push me back. Once they found out that I could shoot as well as they could, they accepted me.''
        Mr. Sorrell was born in Washington, went to schools there and became fascinated by photography. He worked for years at the Federal Bureau of Printing and Engraving, and at the Defense Department, not as a photographer, and went on to be a staff photographer for The Afro-American newspaper in Washington before joining Johnson Publishing.
        He is survived by his wife, Beatrice, and a sister, Lillian Strange, of Hyannis, Mass.
