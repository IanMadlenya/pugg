        A. Keith Brodkin, chairman and chief executive of MFS Investment Management, which oversees the MFS family of mutual funds, the country's 21st-largest fund company, died on Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 62.
        The cause was an embolism, said John Reilly, a spokesman for MFS, a unit of Massachusetts Financial Services. Mr. Brodkin had remained in the hospital after coronary bypass surgery three weeks ago.
        Mr. Brodkin joined MFS in 1970 as an investment officer specializing in fixed-income securities. Initially, he managed the bond portion of the MFS Total Return fund and oversaw the MFS Bond fund, introduced in 1974, as well as the bond portfolios of the company's institutional clients.
        After he was named director of the MFS subsidiary that oversees $10 billion in institutional assets in 1980, Mr. Brodkin was named president and chief investment officer of MFS in 1987 and chairman and chief executive in 1991. MFS manages $70 billion in assets, about $45 billion of which is in MFS mutual funds.
        Mr. Brodkin served on the board of the American affiliate of the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada, MFS's parent company. He was also on the board of WGBH Public Broadcasting in Boston.
        He is survived by his wife, Judy Brodkin of Sherborn, Mass., and three children: Adam, of Austin, Tex., and Paul and Heather, both of Sherborn.
