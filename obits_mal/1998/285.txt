        Koong-Kai Tse, a former senior executive of the American International Group, one of the nation's largest insurers, died March 9 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 91 and lived in New York and Miami.
        Mr. Tse joined the company as a junior accountant in the 1920's and served as a senior executive in China and Southeast Asia from the late 1940's to the 1970's before joining headquarters in New York to help oversee business in Asia and handle special assignments. He never fully retired and kept an office at headquarters until his death.
        Mr. Tse, who graduated from the University of Shanghai, twice saved the company's fortunes in China. First, when the Japanese occupied Shanghai in 1941, he persuaded them to let him put the company's records into storage. When peace came, the company was one of the first to resume operations in China. Then in 1949, as the Communists were coming to power, he directed the airlift of employees and records to Hong Kong.
        Mr. Tse is survived by his wife, Teh Ying Tse; a son, Stephen Y. N. Tse of New York; four daughters, Cecilia Y. H. Tse Ying of Boca Raton, Fla., Angelina Y. G. Tse Wang of Miami and Virginia Y. C. Tse and Helena Y. N. Tse Yeung, both of New York; nine grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren.
