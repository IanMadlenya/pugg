        Chaim Suller, a longtime editor of The Morning Freiheit, a left-wing Yiddish newspaper in New York, who criticized Soviet policy regarding Jewish culture, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 96 and lived in the East Village of Manhattan.
        Mr. Suller was with The Freiheit for more than 30 years until it ceased publication in 1988 because of soaring expenses, shrinking circulation and the deaths of benefactors.
        He was The Freiheit's manager in 1957 when an article by him appeared in the English-language Communist newspaper The Daily Worker, accusing Soviet leaders of violating ''the fundamental principles of socialism'' in refusing to allow a vigorous revival of Yiddish culture in the Soviet Union. He said the leaders clung to ''an incorrect policy'' that Soviet Jews had ''no need for separate institutions.''
        Mr. Suller was The Freiheit's co-editor in 1976 when he and three other left-wing American Jewish editors sent a letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington and the Soviet delegation to the United Nations saying that they were ''deeply disturbed at the continuing violation of Marxist principles with respect to the Jews in the Soviet Union.''
        Born in Belorussia -- later part of the Soviet Union -- Mr. Suller came to New York not long after World War I and was a teacher before joining The Morning Freiheit. He is survived by his wife, Elsie; a daughter, Dina Bray of Princeton, N.J.; a brother, Bryel, of Boston, and three grandchildren.
