        Merle E. Severy, who founded the National Geographic Society's book division and edited many of its most popular titles, died on May 13 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, the society said.
        Among the books that Mr. Severy produced as chief of the National Geographic Book Service were ''Men, Ships and the Sea,'' ''Greece and Rome, Builders of Our World,'' ''The Age of Chivalry'' and ''Great Religions of the World.'' He also traveled extensively to research articles on subjects ranging from the Byzantine Empire to Martin Luther.
        Born in Los Angeles, Mr. Severy received a master's degree in music from Columbia University, where he also studied history. He served in the Army as a band leader in Europe during World War II and after the war arranged music for Jack Teagarden's orchestra and ''Your Show of Shows'' on television.
        After his retirement from National Geographic in 1992, he published articles and lectured.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne; two sons, Alan, of Wolfeboro, N.H., and Randall, of Mount Airy, Md.; three daughters, Karen, of New York City, Melissa, of Bethesda, Md., and Leslie McDowell of Kensington, Md.; a stepson, Michael Oberlander of New York City; a stepdaughter, Sylvie Haller of Bethesda; a sister, Thelma Rado of Brevard, N.C., and two grandchildren.
