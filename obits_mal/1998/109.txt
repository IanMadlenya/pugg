        James J. O'Brien Sr., a former executive at the Chase Manhattan Bank and on Wall Street, died on Friday at Johns Hopkins Geriatric Rehabilitation Center in Baltimore. He was 88.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, his daughter Patricia O'Brien Roth said.
        Mr. O'Brien joined Chase Manhattan in the trust department in 1929, after he graduated from New York University. He remained with Chase for 35 years, rising to be senior vice president and chairman of the trust investment committee.
        During World War II, Mr. O'Brien served in the Navy. In 1964, he left the bank and joined Salomon Brothers & Hutzler -- what is now a part of the securities firm of Salomon Smith Barney -- as a general partner. He retired in 1972.
        Mr. O'Brien is survived by his wife, Kathleen O'Brien of Madison, N.J.; two daughters, Virginia O'Brien Stacey of Baltimore and Patricia, of Washington, and five grandchildren. Mr. O'Brien's son, James Jr., died in 1995.
