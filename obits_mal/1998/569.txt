        Sarkis Soultanian, who rose to become chairman and chief executive of a company he first joined as an office boy, died on June 5 at his home in Franklin Lakes, N.J., of complications from a heart attack. He was 57.
        The company, National Utility Service in Park Ridge, N.J., monitors energy and telecommunications bills for businesses.
        Mr. Soultanian was born in Haifa, Israel, to Armenian parents. His family immigrated to the United States in 1956. After graduating from Richmond Hill High School in Queens, he joined National Utility Service in 1958 as an office boy, making $45 a week. While working at the company, he earned an accounting degree from Queens College in 1965.
        Mr. Soultanian lost little time learning the business of finding mistakes in utility bills and was named an account analyst in 1961. He became a vice president in 1968 and, the next year, joined the company's board as its youngest member.
        In 1986, Mr. Soultanian became the company's chairman and president. He bought the company from the founder's family in 1990 and nearly tripled the company's revenues. Both of Mr. Soultanian's sons are executives of National Utility.
        Mr. Soultanian was also active in the Armenian Church, serving as the chairman of the parish council of St. Leon Armenian Church in Fair Lawn, N.J., for several years.
        He also served as a trustee of the Armenian Church Endowment Fund of America and the Armenian Assembly of America.
        Mr. Soultanian is survived by his wife of 35 years, Takouhy; two sons, Richard, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and Gary, of Mahwah, N.J.; one brother, David, of North Haledon, N.J., and three sisters, Alice Khatcherian, Lucine Sinainan and Asdghig Sarkisian, all of Queens.
