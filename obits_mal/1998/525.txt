        Robert Campbell Kirkwood, a former chairman and chief executive of the F. W. Woolworth Company, died on Monday at the Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. Mr. Kirkwood, who lived in North Palm Beach, Fla., was 93.
        Mr. Kirkwood, who worked for the variety-store chain for 46 years, got his first job as a stock boy at a Woolworth's five-and-dime store in Salt Lake City. He became an assistant manager there, and a store manager in Denver when he was only 21.
        Mr. Kirkwood was manager at stores in several states, and then merchandising district supervisor and vice president at the headquarters in New York.
        He was named president and chief executive of the company in 1958, when it had more than 2,000 stores in the United States and Canada and employed more than 85,000 people. During his tenure as head of the chain, he helped modernize its management policies and, with the rest of the variety industry, expanded the five-and-dime concept to include sales of furniture, appliances and clothing.
        By 1961, the company had grown to 3,483 stores, including 2,300 in the United States and Canada, in addition to those in Britain, West Germany and Mexico. Woolworth opened the first of its discount stores under the Woolco name in 1962.
        In 1964, Mr. Kirkwood was named chairman, while remaining as chief executive.
        The company began merchandising under the Woolworth brand name in 1966, and it bought the Kinney shoe store company in 1969. When Mr. Kirkwood retired in 1969, worldwide sales were at $2.25 billion.
        Mr. Kirkwood is survived by a son, Robert C., of Hollywood, Fla.; a daughter, Mary K. Van Loan of East Dennis, Mass.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. Mr. Kirkwood's wife, Virginia, died in 1987.
