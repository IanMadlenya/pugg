        Jack Farris, a novelist, playwright and retired professor of English, died on Nov. 26 at a hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 77 and had recently moved to Rockville, Md., from Lockesburg, Ark.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Anna.
        Throughout his teaching career, Mr. Farris published poetry and fiction, including five novels. His novel ''Me and Gallagher'' (1982) dealt with the vigilante movement in the Montana Territory in the 1860's.
        Another novel, ''Ramey'' (1951), about the struggles of a Depression-era family, was turned by Mr. Farris and Abby Mann into a screenplay for NBC in 1974, ''The Greatest Gift'' (the pilot for the series ''The Family Holvak'') with Glenn Ford. Mr. Farris's play, ''Into Thy Narrow Bed,'' was first produced at Circuit Playhouse in Memphis in 1981.
        His other novels were ''A Man to Ride With'' (1953), ''The Abiding Gospel of Claude Dee Moran Jr.'' (1987) and ''Keeping the Faith'' (1990).
        Born in Forest, Tex., Mr. Farris grew up in Arkansas and spent six years in the Navy, including service during World War II in the South Pacific. He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark., in 1949 and earned a master's degree at the University of Michigan a year later.
        He taught at several colleges before joining the faculty at Southwestern, now Rhodes College, in Memphis in 1961 as a professor of English. He retired in 1984.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Steve, of Camden, Ark.; a daughter, Carrie, of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
