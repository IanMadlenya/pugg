        George Hecht, a retired electronics manufacturer, inventor and major supporter of Cooper Union and many civic causes, died on March 9 at Astoria General Hospital in Queens. He was 90 and lived in Astoria.
        Until recently, Mr. Hecht was a presence in most activities of the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Arts. He was a 1930 graduate, earning his degree in electrical engineering at night while working for Bell Labs.
        His legacy includes the George Hecht Viewing Gardens, which are under construction in the St. Mark's Historic District of the East Village. Made up of two small, triangular parks, the gardens are transforming a former traffic island into a leafy vision of 19th-century New York where East Ninth and Stuyvesant Streets meet Third Avenue.
        The project is supported by Cooper Union, other public and private sources and a $500,000 gift from Mr. Hecht. Completion is scheduled for the summer.
        Mr. Hecht also supported the Central Park Conservancy, the New York Zoological Society and the Horticultural Society of New York, as well as cultural institutions like Channel 13 and the New York Public Library.
        Mr. Hecht went to work at 16 as a messenger for Bell Labs in lower Manhattan. He joined the technical staff after graduating from Cooper Union, did research on quartz crystals and helped produce Bell's first crystal used in radio broadcasting.
        By the time he left Bell Labs in 1959, he held 16 patents for crystals, tuning forks, electronic switchers and the like. He was also a partner in Romero Metals Products in Long Island City, which manufactured equipment for tire and rubber companies. He sold the company in 1986 after the death of his partner.
        Mr. Hecht is survived by a brother, Richard, of Manhattan.
