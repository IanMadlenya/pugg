        Julius Larkin Hoyt, a lawyer and official of the United States Tennis Association, died on Nov. 23 at his farm in Wallkill, N.Y. He was 77.
        The cause was lung cancer.
        Mr. Hoyt served as president of the Eastern Tennis Association during the 1960's, a time when ''Lawn'' was dropped from the association's name and tennis was emerging from the gentility of a club sport to the mass appeal of the Open era. In later years, Mr. Hoyt became vice president of the North Atlantic Regional Tennis Association, treasurer of the U.S.T.A. and a member of its management board.
        Mr. Hoyt established the law firm of Scott and Hoyt in Newburgh, N.Y., in 1950. He was a member of the Orange County Legislature from 1972 to 1984.
        A native of Walden, N.Y., Mr. Hoyt attended the Pawling School. He graduated from Cornell University with a Bachelor of Sciences in 1943. After three years in the 20th Air Force Division during World War II, Mr. Hoyt returned to Cornell and graduated in 1950 with a law degree.
        He is survived by his wife, Elisabeth of Wallkill; three sons, Gunther of Salem, Va., Hubertus of Frankfurt, Germany, and Alexander of New York; four grandchildren and four nephews and nieces.
