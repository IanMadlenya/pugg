        Frank L. Goffio, a former executive director of CARE who helped shape its present mission of sending disaster relief and assistance for self-help projects to the far corners of the world, died on June 27 at a nursing home in Avon, Conn. He was 82 and lived in Farmington, Conn.
        Mr. Goffio retired in 1972, after 17 years as executive director. Altogether he spent 30 years at CARE, the Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere.
        Nonprofit and nonsectarian, the organization began its work in 1945, with a shipment of CARE Packages to war-ravaged Europe. It soon extended a helping hand to the hungry in underdeveloped regions of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
        During Mr. Goffio's tenure, CARE became one of the world's largest international relief and development organizations, with an annual budget of some $350 million to help people recover from disaster. Mr. Goffio took the lead in making self-help projects a priority and putting a food-for-work concept into practice.
        Mr. Goffio was a native of Brooklyn.
        His survivors include his wife of 57 years, Evelyn Wilburger Goffio; a daughter, Christine May of Melrose, Mass., and two grandchildren.
