        George Howard, a soprano saxophonist who was a mainstay of the smooth-jazz radio format, died on March 22 at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. He was 41.
        The cause was cancer, said Chris Wheat, a publicity agent at GRP records.
        Mr. Howard grew up in Philadelphia. After classical training on the clarinet, he changed to the bassoon and finally to the soprano saxophone.  At 15 he began touring with Philadelphia-based rhythm-and-blues groups like First Choice and Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes.
        After working with the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. in 1979, he began a solo career, releasing more than a dozen albums. He was nominated twice for Grammy Awards in the best rhythm and blues instrumental performance category: in 1988 for the album ''Reflections'' and in 1992 for the track ''Just the Way I Feel'' from the album ''Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?'' His final album, which the Blue Note label will release tomorrow, is a full-length cover version of the Sly and the Family Stone record ''There's a Riot Goin' On.''
        Mr. Howard is survived by a daughter, Jade, and two sisters, Mary Howard of Atlanta and Doris Beverly of Philadelphia.
