        Scott P. Mason, a former chairman of the finance department at Harvard University's business school, died on Sept. 8 at his home in Wellesley, Mass. He was 50.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Linda.
        Mr. Mason joined the faculty of the Graduate School of Business Administration at Harvard in 1980. He was the chairman of the finance department from 1993 to 1997. During his tenure, he introduced financial engineering, which is the use of mathematical models to assess the value of financial instruments like bonds and stocks, into the business curriculum. The use of financial engineering to predict what will happen in a business or market area is considered comparable to the use of meteorological models in weather forecasting.
        Robert C. Merton, a Nobel laureate who taught Mr. Mason as a graduate student at M.I.T. in the 1970's and worked with him on the faculty at Harvard, credits Mr. Mason with making the use of mathematical models an integral part of the courses at the business school. When Mr. Mason was a graduate student, his thesis was on financial engineering.
        At Harvard, Mr. Mason created a capital markets course for second-year students. Mr. Merton said that Mr. Mason refined the mathematical models and applied them in research, in the classroom and in practice.
        A native of Presque Isle, Me., Mr. Mason graduated from the University of Maine in 1969. He received a master's degree at M.I.T. in 1972 and a doctorate of finance there in 1979. Before going to Harvard, Mr. Mason worked at Goldman, Sachs & Company in Boston.
        In 1997, Mr. Mason was named president and chief executive of Investment Technology Group, a brokerage house in New York, after having served as a consultant and director.
        Mr. Mason is survived by his wife, Linda; a daughter, Meredith; a son, Aaron, all of Wellesley; his mother, Patricia, of South Natick, Mass., and  a sister, Paige Mason, of Wellesley.
