        Robert Wells, a lyricist and composer who also wrote and produced programs for television, died on Sept. 23 at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers said in a statement.
        Working with the singer Mel Torme, Mr. Wells had his biggest hit with a durable holiday ballad, ''The Christmas Song.'' He wrote the words, beginning with ''Chestnuts roasting on an open fire . . . ,'' and Mr. Torme wrote the music. Several artists, including Mr. Torme and Doris Day, recorded it, and the version by Nat Cole and the King Cole Trio became a best seller and a perennial holiday favorite.
        Mr. Wells also wrote the lyrics for ''It's Easy to Say,'' with music by Henry Mancini, which was introduced by Dudley Moore in the 1979 film ''10''; ''From Here to Eternity,'' with music by Fred Karger, inspired by the 1953 film and later a hit for Frank Sinatra, and ''County Fair,'' written with Mr. Torme for the 1949 film ''So Dear to My Heart.''
        His other compositions included ''Born to Be Blue,'' again with Mr. Torme; ''Re-enlistment Blues,'' with James Jones and Mr. Karger, and ''What Every Girl Should Know,'' with music by David Holt. He wrote lyrics and special material for ''Three for Tonight,'' a 1955 Broadway revue that starred Marge and Gower Champion and Harry Belafonte.
        Mr. Wells also had a successful career in television. He won four Emmy Awards as the producer and head writer of ''The Dinah Shore Chevy Show'' and won two more Emmys for his work on ''Shirley MacLaine: If They Could See Me Now.'' He also wrote or produced specials for such stars as Julie Andrews, Victor Borge and Gene Kelly.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn; a stepdaughter, Stefanie Gaines, and a stepson, Michael Gaines, all of Los Angeles.
