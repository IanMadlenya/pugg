        Adrian Spies, an award-winning television writer who turned out dozens of acclaimed scripts for the live drama series ''Climax'' in the 1950's and wrote one of the first ''Star Trek'' episodes in 1966, died on Oct. 2 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.
        His family said he died during heart surgery.
        A native of Newark who graduated from the University of North Carolina and the School of Journalism at Columbia University, Mr. Spies worked as a reporter and feature writer for newspapers including PM and The New York Mirror before switching to jobs in radio and then  television in Chicago.
        During the 50's in New York, Mr. Spies wrote for several television drama series, including ''Playhouse 90'' as well as ''Climax.'' Later he wrote for ''Ironside,'' ''Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' ''Dr. Kildare,'' ''The Defenders'' and ''Hawaii Five-0.'' Among other honors, he won a prestigious Robert E. Sherwood Award for ''Island in the City,'' a 1957 script for the ''Climax'' series.
        He later won an Edgar Award, given by the Mystery Writers of America, for the ''Edge of Truth,'' a ''Studio One'' live drama on CBS.
        But it was his script for ''Miri,'' the eighth ''Star Trek'' episode, broadcast on Oct. 27, 1966, that made him something of a minor icon among the ranks of the show's fans. In the episode, the Enterprise crew lands on an Earth-like planet and discovers a group of 300-year-old children who are infected with a disease that prolongs youth but causes madness and death in adolescence.
        Mr. Spies moved to Los Angeles in 1957 and continued to write for television, including the made-for-television movie ''Looking for Patty Hearst.''
        He is survived by his wife, Martha; two daughters from a previous marriage, Nancy Haberman of Manhattan and Amy Spies of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and four grandchildren.
