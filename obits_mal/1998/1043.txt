        Edmond A. Levy, an Academy Award-winning documentarian, died on Oct. 10 at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his stepson William H. Judson said.
        Mr. Levy wrote, produced and directed more than 120 documentary films. He won an Oscar in 1966 for ''A Year Toward Tomorrow,'' a documentary short about the Vista volunteer program. Two other short films, ''While We Run This Race'' and ''Beyond Silence,'' brought him Academy Award nominations.
        He also directed ''Mom, the Wolfman and Me,'' a feature film starring Patty Duke. His television work included writing and directing films for NBC, CBS and ABC as well as PBS and the Disney Channel.
        Born in Toronto, Mr. Levy moved with his family to Buffalo. He was a graduate of Harvard University and  studied acting at the Yale Drama School and directing at the Actors Studio in New York. He was the author of ''Making a Winning Short.''
        In addition to William Judson, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Denise; two sons, Jonathan of San Francisco and Jeremy of Pittsburgh; two other stepsons, Stephen Judson of Manhattan and Peter Judson of Los Angeles; a sister, Kay Michaels of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
