        Raymond O. Mithun, who helped found the Campbell-Mithun Inc. advertising agency with $1,500 and three clients, died March 31 in Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. Mr. Mithun, who was 89, lived in Indian Wells, Calif., and died from complications from pneumonia, an agency spokesman said.
        Mr. Mithun was born in Warren, Minn., in 1909, and graduated from the University of Minnesota. After a brief stint as a journalist, he joined the BBDO advertising agency. At age 23, he co-founded Campbell-Mithun Advertising with Ralph Campbell Sr. Their first three clients were Northwestern National Bank, the Andersen Corporation and Land O' Lakes.
        Among the campaigns he helped create was one for Hamm's Beer, showing an animated beer and the tag line ''From the land of sky blue waters.'' He retired in 1983, and in 1989 he was elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame.
        The agency, now know as Campbell Mithun Esty, had billings in 1997 of $863 million.
        Mr. Mithun is survived by his wife,  Doris, and three sons, Lewis, of Teton Village, Wyo.; Raymond Jr., of Wayzata, Minn., and Jack, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
