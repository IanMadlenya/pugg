        Eugene Walter, a poet and novelist, died on March 29 at the University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile, where he lived. He was 76.
        The cause was liver cancer, the hospital said.
        Mr. Walter, a native of Mobile, often celebrated his hometown in his fiction. His best-known work was ''The Untidy Pilgrim'' (1954), which a reviewer for The New York Times found ''engaging, lighthearted and humorous.'' He also wrote ''Love You Good, See You Later'' (1964), set in the bayou country near Mobile, and ''The Likes of Which'' (1980).  Fluent in Italian, he translated ''Are All Italians Lousy Lovers?'' published in the United States in 1975.
        During World War II, Mr. Walter served as a military cryptographer in Alaska. He later worked for the New York Public Library and designed sets for Off Broadway shows. He moved to Italy in 1956 and remained abroad for the next 20 years, translating Italian films into English. He became friends with the director Federico Fellini, who cast him in a bit part in his film ''8 1/2.''
        Mr. Walter was the winner of a Lippincott Award, a Sewanee Rockefeller fellowship and an O. Henry citation for his short stories. He was a founding contributor to The Paris Review.
