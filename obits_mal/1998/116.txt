        Sir Francis Harry Hinsley, a British historian and authority on wartime intelligence and naval warfare, died on Feb. 16 in Cambridge, England. He was 79 and had been associated with St. John's College, Cambridge University, since his student days.
        He was an undergraduate at St. John's in 1939 when the British Foreign Office recruited him for its code-breaking headquarters at Bletchley Park. It was there that Germany's Enigma codes were broken, and Professor Hinsley in later decades became the official historian of British intelligence, authorized to tell how it was done and what role he played in it.
        He was the author of the five-part ''British Intelligence in the Second World War,'' published between 1979 and 1990. He produced the huge volumes with a special security clearance and a team of historians who helped him research the relevant documents from the Bletchley headquarters. An abridged edition appeared in 1993.
        Professor Hinsley, who was knighted in 1985, was born in Walsall, Staffordshire, and earned his M.A. at Cambridge in 1946 after his Bletchley experience.
        He was a professor of the history of international relations and served for 35 years as a research fellow, tutor and lecturer in history and for 10 more years as the Master of St. John's College.
        He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1985. He retired in 1989 but remained active at the university almost to the last.
        His other books included ''Command of the Sea'' (1950), ''Hitler's Strategy'' (1951), ''The Naval Side of British History'' (1952), ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'' (1963), and ''Sovereignty'' (1966).
        His survivors include his wife, Hilary Brett-Smith Hinsley, whom he met at Bletchley; two sons, Charles and Hugh, and a daughter, Clarissa.
