        Federico Zeri, an  Italian art historian whose expertise was sought by many American museums and private collectors, died on Monday of a heart attack in his villa outside Rome, the news agency ANSA reported. He was 77.
        An expert in medieval and Renaissance art, Mr. Zeri was among the first Italian critics to put paintings in their social and historical context.  He was co-author of a catalogue of the Italian paintings collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York with Elizabeth E. Gardner.
        Mr. Zeri, who appeared frequently on Italian television, often to criticize the Government for neglecting the country's artistic heritage, was well known even to Italians who never frequent museums. Though he had been a trustee of the J. Paul Getty Museum in California and was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris, he was never given a major academic post in Italy. He is survived by a sister, Nuncia Melgeri.
