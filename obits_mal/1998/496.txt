        Morton Rosenthal, whose family's funeral business evolved through mergers and acquisitions into Time Warner Inc., died on Friday. He was 89.
        With his brother, Edward, and Edward's son-in-law, Steven J. Ross, Mr. Rosenthal helped run a group of funeral chapels that acquired companies including the Kinney garage business. Kinney eventually grew into Warner Communications, a vast entertainment company with little apparent link to the businesses with which Kinney started. But Warner remained very much a family enterprise, with Mr. Rosenthal serving as a director of the company and a member of its executive committee. In 1989, Mr. Ross merged the company with Time Inc.
        After Mr. Rosenthal retired from Warner in the late 1970's, he moved to Ocala, Fla., from Chappaqua, N.Y., to pursue his lifelong interest in thoroughbred horse racing and breeding.
        Mr. Rosenthal is survived by his wife, Rosalind; a son, John of Charlotte, Vt.; and three daughters, Judy Rosenthal of Stowe, Vt.; Jane Goldman of Chappaqua and Sarah Hart of Hartsdale, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
