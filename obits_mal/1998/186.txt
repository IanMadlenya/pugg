        Alex J. Kramer, a writer of popular songs whose best-known compositions included ''Candy,'' ''Far Away Places'' and ''It All Comes Back to Me Now,'' died on Tuesday in Fairfield, Conn. He was 94 and lived in Westport, Conn.
        Those hits, and most of his 125 other songs, were written with his wife, Joan Whitney, who died in 1990.
        Mr. Kramer, who was born in Montreal, began his show business career when he was 17, working as a pianist in a silent-movie house. Eight years later, he moved to New York City, where he became a band leader and vocal coach. Ms. Whitney was one of his students, and after they married, she became his songwriting partner.
        Their first collaboration, ''High on a Windy Hill,'' on which they shared credit for both the words and music, became a No. 1 hit for Jimmy Dorsey in 1941.
        The couple's subsequent successes, sometimes written with additional collaborators, included ''So You're the One'' (for Eddy Duchin), ''My Sister and I'' (Jimmy Dorsey), ''It All Comes Back to Me Now'' (Gene Krupa), ''Candy'' (Johnny Mercer and Jo Stafford), ''Far Away Places'' (for both Bing Crosby and Perry Como), ''Love Somebody'' (Doris Day and Buddy Clark), ''It's Love, Love, Love'' (Guy Lombardo) and the novelty ''Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens'' (Louis Jordan).
        Mr. Kramer also led the orchestras for radio shows and worked as an accompanist in vaudeville and nightclubs.
        He is survived by his son, Doren Voeth of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and a brother, Samuel, of Montreal.
