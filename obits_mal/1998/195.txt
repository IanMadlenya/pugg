        Maurice V. Russell, an educator who taught and directed social services at New York institutions for four decades, died on Feb. 8 in a fire at his weekend home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. He was 74 and lived on Manhattan's East Side.
        He died of smoke inhalation from a fire near a wood stove, the Dutchess County Sheriff's office said.
        At his death, Dr. Russell was professor of clinical social work at the New York University School of Medicine. He was a trustee of Columbia University from 1987 to 1995 and was the first African-American elected to represent university alumni on the board.
        He taught at Columbia, Hunter College and Albert Einstein College of Medicine and directed the social service department at New York University Medical Center from 1973 to 1988.
        He organized Harlem Hospital's department of social work 30 years ago and subsequently served as director of social services at Jacobi Hospital.
        For the last 25 years, he was president of the Kenworthy-Swift Foundation, which underwrites mental health programs for young people. In recognition of his contributions, Columbia created a Maurice V. Russell Professorship in Social Policy and Social Work Practice in 1994 with a $1 million gift from a colleague, Edith K. Ehrman.
        A native of Philadelphia, he received his B.A. in psychology and sociology from Temple University in 1948. Two years later, he received a degree in psychiatric social work from Columbia's School of Social Work, to which he added a doctorate from Teachers College in 1964.
        He taught at Hunter College School of Social Work from 1955 to 1960 and was a professor at Columbia's School of Social Work and School of Public Health from 1966 to 1980.
        He was the author of many articles on mental health, public health and social work.
        He is survived by a sister, Frieda Durham of Philadelphia.
