        Frank S. McCullough, a former New York State lawmaker and justice in State Supreme Court in Westchester, died last Wednesday at the United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 92 and lived in Rye, N.Y.
        After working as a lawyer in Westchester, Mr. McCullough, a Republican, entered politics in 1942 as the supervisor of the City of Rye. He became a State Assemblyman for the Fourth District in 1945; in 1951, he was elected to the State Senate to represent the 30th District.
        Mr. McCullough quickly became a noted figure in Albany. He served on many committees and panels, including one formed to study the use and protection of milk products; its main goal was to regulate the sale of yellow oleomargarine. He also served on committees to curb charity rackets and to regulate wiretapping.
        He also pushed for standardized building codes and for permanent voter registration. In 1959, Mr. McCullough was appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller as the County Judge of Westchester. A year later, he was elected as a State Supreme Court justice, a position he held until his retirement at the age of 68.
        After his retirement, he practiced law in his son's law firm, McCullough, Goldberger & Satudt, which has offices in Harrison, N.Y., and in White Plains. He left the firm last year, at the age of 91, his son, Frank Jr., said.
        Mr. McCullough's wife of 51 years, Lovedy McPherson McCullough, died in 1989.
        In addition to Frank Jr., Mr. McCullough is survived by another son, James E. McCullough of Brooklyn Heights; a daughter, Judith Ellis of Winder, Ga.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
