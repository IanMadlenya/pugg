        Alfred W. Van Sinderen, who served as the top executive of the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation for 17 years, died Oct. 12 at the Harborside Healthcare-Willows, a nursing home in Woodbridge, Conn. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Van Sinderen's wife, Suzanne, said he had been at the Willows since shortly after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage more than two years ago.
        Mr. Van Sinderen, who had become the telephone company's most senior executive, with the title of president, in 1967, gave up operational control in 1984 and retired a year later as chairman. He had been with the company 38 years.
        In 1984, Mr. Van Sinderen began teaching at Yale University's graduate school of management. He increased his duties at Yale when he left the telephone company and also took on a series of civic projects. In one civic job, he served as president of the Foundation for the New Haven Green from 1986 to 1991.
        Mr. Van Sinderen received an undergraduate degree from Yale and a master's degree in business administration from the Harvard Business School. He served as a naval officer in the Pacific during World War II.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Van Sinderen is survived by five children, Alexander Van Sinderen of Lafayette, Calif.; Sylvia Abbate of Cheshire, Conn.; Jean Vashaw of Ridgefield, Wash.; Katherine Tucker of Waxhaw, N.C., and Alex Madlener of Woodbridge, Conn.; two sisters, Katharine Howe of Delray Beach, Fla., and Jean Henry of Middlebury, Conn., and 10 grandchildren.
