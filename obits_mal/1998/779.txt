        Eugene Aserinsky, a pioneer in sleep studies, died on July 22 when his car hit a tree north of San Diego. He was 77 and lived in Escondido, Calif.
        In 1953, for his Ph.D. in physiology at the University of Chicago, Dr. Aserinsky produced his ground-breaking thesis, ''Eye Movements During Sleep.'' His discovery of rapid eye movement, or R.E.M. -- the periodic, rapid, jerky movement of the eyeballs under the lids during stages of sleep associated with dreaming -- showed that the brain was in a state of some alertness for about 22 percent of total sleep time.
        In a long career, he taught at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Marshall University Medical School and West Virginia University.
        Dr. Aserinsky is survived by his wife, Angela; his son Armond, of North Wales, Pa.; his two daughters, Jill Asher Buckley, of Carlsbad, Calif., and Iris Carter, of Charlotte, N.C., and three grandchildren.
