        James Chittenden Dudley, an investor and geologist who was also active in education, died Sept. 16 in Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Conn. He was 77 and lived in Redding, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Dudley had been a managing partner of Dudley & Company, a Manhattan-based investment management firm he helped found, for more than a decade.
        He was born in Duluth, Minn., graduated in 1943 from Harvard College and was a navigator on American bombers in World War II.
        After the war he worked in metals exploration. Then he was an analyst at Grace Bank and later was a general partner in the investment firm Cyrus J. Lawrence & Sons, both in Manhattan. In 1969, he became an independent investment adviser. He was also a longtime vice chairman of AEA Investors Inc. and served on the boards of several other companies.
        Mr. Dudley headed the board of trustees of Dana Hall School in Wellesley, Mass. He was on several visiting committees at Harvard, where he endowed a chair in economic geology. He also endowed scholarships at Dana Hall and at Milton Academy in Milton, Mass., and, with his wife, established the 36-acre Highstead Arboretum in Redding, Conn.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elisabeth Claypool; his sons David C., of Denver, and Henry C., of Bedford, N.Y.; two daughters, Sarah Dudley Plimpton of Manhattan and Jane C. Dudley of Seattle, and 10 grandchildren.
