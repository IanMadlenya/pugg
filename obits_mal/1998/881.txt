        Douglas C. Jones, a writer who chronicled the mythology of the American West through fictional accounts of historic events, died on Aug. 30 at his home in Fayetteville, Ark. He was 73.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        In 1968, after 25 years in the Army, Mr. Jones retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He then embarked on a second career as a writer, having already published a nonfiction work, ''The Treaty of Medicine Lodge,'' in 1966, his master's degree thesis at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he taught journalism from 1968 to 1974.
        Mr. Jones took his cue as a writer from his memories of growing up in Fort Smith, Ark., close to what had once been Indian territory. ''I was captured by the idea of the Indian frontier then -- and I still am today,'' he said in an interview in The New York Times in 1977.
        An intriguing parlor game of ''what if'' that Mr. Jones played with his friend Benjamin Rush 3d led him to first imagine the consequences that General Custer would have faced had he survived the Battle of Little Bighorn. The outcome was ''The Court-Martial of George Armstrong Custer,'' a 1976 fictional reconstruction that wove much of its substance from fact. The book was illustrated with pen-and-ink drawings by Mr. Jones, who eventually showed his artwork professionally.
        Mr. Jones continued to conjure alternative histories in works like ''Arrest Sitting Bull'' in 1977; ''A Creek Called Wounded Knee'' in 1978,  which, with ''Court-Martial'' formed a de facto trilogy, and ''The Barefoot Brigade,'' about the dirt-farm infantry of the Confederate Army.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, D. Eben Jones, both of Fayetteville; three daughters, K. G. Martino, also of Fayetteville; Martha Lunsford of Greenland, Ark., and Meg Butler of Rochester; two sisters, Gayle Phillips of Fayetteville and Jackey Ivey of Denver, and 10 grandchildren.
