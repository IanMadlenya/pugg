        Satu Khamphouy Sinnolai, one of the first Buddhist monks from Laos to take refuge in the United States and the first to arrive as a pastor to immigrants in the New York metropolitan region, died on May 28 at Bridgeport Hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 79 and lived in that city.
        The cause was prostate cancer, but he was active until a week before his death, said Damdee Kingsidaphone, secretary to the Buddhists in Bridgeport.
        Satu (a title meaning venerable) Sinnolai was the abbot of the Thepchantharam Buddhist Temple in Bridgeport and a spiritual leader to Laotian and Thai Buddhists in the Northeast. Mr. Kingsidaphone said final respects to Satu Sinnolai would be paid on Sept. 5 at the temple.
        Satu Sinnolai was born on Feb. 16, 1919, in Ban Houei Sai, Laos. He became a novice when he was 12 and a monk when he was 21. In 1968 he became the abbot of the Temple Phonsavanh in Houei Sai, the capital of the Haut-Mekong Province and the home of hundreds of Laotians now living in the New York area.
        He fled Laos in 1978, stayed in a refugee camp in Thailand and continued to the United States in 1980. He founded the Thepchantharam Temple that year in Rye, N.Y., with the support of Laotian families.
        There are no immediate survivors.
