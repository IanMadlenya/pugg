        Richard Niles Bull, a dancer, choreographer and educator, died July 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Gill Wright Miller, a friend.
        A genial man who stood by his esthetic convictions with a wit that was at times cantankerous, Mr. Bull was known as a pioneer in the development of structured improvisation  in dance. He used jazz improvisation techniques in his choreography and incorporated material like texts into his dances.
        Mr. Bull presented concerts and festivals of dance improvisation regularly in his Warren Street Performance Loft in TriBeCa.
        Born in Detroit, Mr. Bull began his career as a jazz pianist, moving to New York City in 1948 to work with Lenny Tristano. He supported himself by accompanying dance classes at the Juilliard School, where he was exposed to modern dance and began studying with Alwin Nikolais. He performed in the mid-1950's with the Munt-Brooks Dance Company.
        In 1965, Mr. Bull began a long academic career as co-coordinator of undergraduate dance students at New York University, then became chairman of dance at the State University of New York at Brockport, where he was a teacher and mentor to Lois Welk and Bill T. Jones.
        Mr. Bull's loft theater opened in 1978, and he directed the graduate studies program in dance at Wesleyan University from 1983 to 1997.
        Mr. Bull's wife, Cynthia Jean Cohen Bull, professionally known as Cynthia Novack, died in 1996. He is survived by a daughter, Katie Bull Pritchett, and a sister, Joanna, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Dan, of Montclair, N.J.
