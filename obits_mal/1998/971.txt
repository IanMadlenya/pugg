        Richard Dior, a recording engineer whose work on the film ''Apollo 13'' won an Academy Award for sound, died on Monday at his home in Marlboro, N.J. He was 51.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Dior was a mixer, an engineer who balances the dialogue, sound effects and music in a film. The final step in a film's production, the mixer manipulates sound -- moving dialogue into the foreground, erasing background noise, ''sweetening'' a bird's chirping -- to create a scene's desired mood.
        For 18 years, Mr. Dior was the chief mixer at Todd-A.O. East in Manhattan, working on films by directors like Ron Howard, Brian de Palma, Alan Pakula, Robert Altman, Sidney Lumet and Tim Robbins.
        Around the time of the release of Mr. Howard's ''Apollo 13'' in 1996, Mr. Dior moved to another company, Sync Sound, before joining forces with two other engineers, Ken Hahn and Bill Marino, to create Digital Cinema last year.
        A member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Mr. Dior was the first New York mixer to win an Oscar, beating out the sound team for the Best Film winner, ''Braveheart.''
        Among the more than 200 feature films and 300 documentaries and television series in his credits were Mr. Howard's ''Ransom,'' ''The Paper'' and ''Parenthood''; Mr. Robbins's ''Dead Man Walking'' and ''Bob Roberts,'' and Marc Levin's ''Slam,'' now in movie theaters.
        He is survived by his wife, Sandra; a son, Scott, and a daughter, Rachel Rodriguez, all of Marlboro.
