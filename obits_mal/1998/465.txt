        Ray Noble, a catcher on the New York Giants team that staged a memorable comeback to overtake the Brooklyn Dodgers for the 1951 National League pennant, died on Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He lived in Brooklyn and was 79.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, his son, Ernesto, said.
        Noble joined the Giants after batting .316 for Oakland of the Pacific Coast League.
        As a rookie in 1951, Noble (pronounced NO-blay), a native of Cuba, played in only 55 games, but was outstanding as a fill-in for Wes Westrum when the Giants' longtime regular catcher was injured during the team's final western trip.
        He displayed a strong throwing arm and showed some power that season, hitting five home runs in 141 at-bats.
        Noble was a backup for the Giants in 1952 and 1953 and had a batting average of .218 over his three major league seasons.
        After retiring from baseball, he owned a liquor store in Brooklyn.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Haydee; a daughter, Daisy, and two grandchildren.
