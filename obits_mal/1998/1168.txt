        Dr. William Taylor Miller, an organic chemist and expert in fluorine chemistry who worked on the team that built the atomic bomb in World War II, died on Nov. 15 at the Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 87.
        Dr. Miller spent 41 years on the faculty at Cornell University, where he was a professor of chemistry from 1947 to 1977
        A native of Winston-Salem, N.C., he graduated from Duke University and received a Ph.D. in organic chemistry there in 1935 before joining the Cornell faculty as an instructor the next year. His early research in organofluorine chemistry led to his recruitment for the Manhattan Project.
        The task was to create materials, like lubricants or pump oil, that would not react with highly corrosive uranium gas. His team developed novel polymers that made possible the separation of the fissionable isotope Uranium-235.
        A member of the American Chemical Society, he received its award for creative work in fluorine chemistry in 1974. He was also a member of Britain's Royal Society of Chemistry, and in 1986 he was awarded the Moissan Centenary Medal in Paris, named in honor of Henri Moissan, who discovered the element fluorine in 1886 and won a Nobel Prize in chemistry.
        Dr. Miller is survived by his wife of 47 years, Betty Robb Miller, and his brother, Robert L., of Panama City, Fla.
