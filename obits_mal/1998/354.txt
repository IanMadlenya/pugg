        Seth R. Thomas, a sixth-generation descendant of a 19th-century clockmaker of the same name and himself a keeper of timepieces, died at the Cleveland Clinic on Monday.  He was 56 and lived in Brecksville, Ohio, near Cleveland.
        The cause was prostate cancer, the family said.
        Mr. Thomas, who earned bachelor's and master's degrees in metallurgical engineering from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., was a former vice president of technology at the Thomas Steel Strip Corporation in Warren, Ohio. He also worked for Texas Instruments and Rodney Metals in Massachusetts. He was a fellow of the American Society for Metals.
        Though the family sold the Seth Thomas Company in 1931, Mr. Thomas remained active in collecting and repairing Seth Thomas clocks and watches. He was the keeper of the Seth Thomas Tower Clock in Ravenna, Ohio, near Akron, and was instrumental in having a clock tower included in plans for the Hiram College Library in Hiram, Ohio, which opened in 1995. He was a member of the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Beth; two daughters, Rebecca, of Akron, Ohio, and Sara Pappa of Cincinnati; two sons, Seth, of Ijamsville, Md., and Michael, of Brecksville; his parents, Seth and Mary Jane Thomas of Oak Bluffs, Mass.; two sisters, Penelope Parmelee of Gobles, Mich., and Katherine Dryfoos of Oak Bluffs, and two grandchildren.
