        Szeming Sze, a former director of the United Nations Health Service who helped build the World Health Organization into a specialized United Nations agency, died on Oct. 27 at Presbyterian Senior Care, at Presbyterian Medical Center in suburban Pittsburgh. Dr. Sze was 90 and most recently lived in Hillsboro Beach, Fla.
        A native of Tientsin, China, Dr. Sze was the eldest son of Dr. Soa-Ke Alfred Sze, who became his country's Ambassador to Britain and, later, the United States.
        The younger Dr. Sze received degrees in chemistry and medicine at Winchester College and Cambridge University and interned in Britain before returning to China in 1934.
        He was in the United States when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, and he joined the Lend-Lease program for the Chinese Government. Dr. Sze attended the San Francisco conference that gave birth to the United Nations as a Chinese official and medical expert.
        He joined the staff of the United Nations and was a key figure in the preparatory work that created the W.H.O. He became medical director of the United Nations in 1955, and he served until his retirement in 1968, when he moved to Hillsboro Beach.
        Dr. Sze is survived by a daughter, Diane Wei of Pittsburgh; a son, Chiaming Sze of Boston; two sisters, Julia Sze-Bailey of Manhattan, and Alice Wang of Boston; five grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
