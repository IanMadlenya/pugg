        Lee Sherman, who danced with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman in the 1930's and 40's, died on Feb. 12 at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan after a brief illness. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Sherman, who was born in Brooklyn, was a track star in high school; he began to dance when he got a job with the Federal Dance Project of the Works Project Administration. After studying ballroom, ballet and tap dancing with Nina de Marco, he became a member of the Humphrey-Weidman company in 1936. He also choreographed dances that he performed with his partner, Beatrice Seckler, at the Roxy Theater in Manhattan. Mr. Sherman became known for his experimental mixing of jazz and modern dance, an innovation at the time.
        In 1943, Mr. Sherman was drafted. He returned to dance three years later, working as a choreographer for the Broadway musical ''Nellie Bly,'' and later choreographing ''Make Mine Manhattan'' and ''Catch a Star!'' In the late 1940's and 50's he was the resident choreographer at the Roxy.
        He worked with many nightclub acts, singers, dancers and comedy teams at the Roxy and on the stage, in television shows and commercials and in industrial shows. He also choreographed during summers at Camp Tamiment and Camp Green Mansion in the Poconos, working with Neil Simon, Sheldon Harnick, Jerome Robbins and others. He choreographed acts in London and Glasgow, in Paris at the Moulin Rouge and the Lido, and in Las Vegas. His clients included the stripper Lili St. Cyr, for whom he choreographed an entire show. He also choreographed musical shows in Italy.
        Mr. Sherman retired from dance in the early 1970's and began to create leaded stained-glass objects in a Chelsea studio, where he worked until shortly before his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Sally; a daughter, Margo Lee Sherman of New York City; a brother, Joe, of Hatboro, N.J., and a sister, Helen Tabb of Miami.
