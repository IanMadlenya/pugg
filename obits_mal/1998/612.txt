        The cause was heart failure, his son, Robert, said.

        Besides his son, Robert, of Silver Spring, Md., he is survived by his wife, the former Betty Timberlake;  a son, John, of Danbury, Conn.; two daughters, Bess Rathbone of Larchmont and Nan Widdop of Tallahassee, Fla.; a brother, Bernard, of Dayton, Ohio, and nine grandchildren.
