        William L. Snyder, an Academy Award-winning animation producer, died on June 3 at the Adventist Nursing Home in Livingston, N.Y. He was 80.
        He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Adam Snyder.
        With his signature Cuban cigar in hand, Mr. Snyder was among the first Americans to do business in postwar Eastern Europe, particularly in Czechoslovakia. He founded Rembrandt Films in 1949 as an importer of films from Europe. Two years later, the company brought to the United States ''The Emperor's Nightingale,'' a puppet-animation feature based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale and directed by the Czechoslovak master Jiri Trnka. With a new English narration by Boris Karloff, the film was released in the United States to widespread critical acclaim. Other classic films followed, including ''White Mane'' and ''The Red Balloon.''
        In 1959 Mr. Snyder began producing cartoons in Prague with the animator Gene Deitch, the former head of UPA Studios in New York. Together they garnered five Academy Award nominations, winning an Oscar for the best animated short subject in 1960 for ''Munro,'' Jules Feiffer's eight-minute film about a 4-year-old boy mistakenly drafted into the Army.
        A pioneer in the animation of classic children's books, Rembrandt Films adapted Ludwig Bemelmans's ''Madeline'' series, James Thurber's ''Many Moons'' and Eve Titus's ''Anatole,'' as well as ''Tom and Jerry'' cartoons for MGM-United Artists and ''Popeye'' cartoons for King Features.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Snyder is survived by his wife, Peggy L. Snyder of Manhattan and Hillsdale, N.Y.; two daughters, Trinka Snyder of Sharon, Mass., and Dana Snyder-Grant of Acton, Mass., and four grandchildren.
