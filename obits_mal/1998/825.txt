        Frederick H. Knubel, director of public information at Columbia University and a spokesman for the university for 35 years, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island after emergency surgery. He was 62 and lived near the campus in Morningside Heights in Manhattan.
        He was fatally injured while bicycling in East Hampton when an oncoming vehicle struck a deer, which then struck him, causing severe internal injuries, the university said.
        Mr. Knubel, director of the public information office since 1969, acted as Columbia's chief spokesman in annoucing the annual Pulitzer Prizes for print journalism and du Pont-Columbia awards in broadcast journalism and in releasing news of Nobel Prizes won by faculty and alumni. He worked with six presidents at Columbia, guiding news coverage of major events, including the novelist Salman Rushdie's appearance in 1991 at Columbia, his first public appearance in the United States after death threats against him by Iran's religious hierarchy, and the 1968 student demonstrations.
        Born in Rochester, Mr. Knubel graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., in 1957 and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in 1959. Before joining the university's news bureau in 1963 as assistant director, he worked for The Rochester Times-Union as a reporter.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith Leynse; his mother, Alice Knubel of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a sister, Helen Perry of Milford, N.J.; and two stepsons, James and Andrew Leynse of Manhattan.
