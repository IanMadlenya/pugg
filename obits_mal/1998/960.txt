        Philip F. Cohen, the founder and former president of Oceana Publications Inc., a publishing house that specializes in international law, died on Aug. 29 at Dobbs Ferry Community Hospital in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 87 and lived in Dobbs Ferry.
        Mr. Cohen was born in Manchester, England, in 1911, and came to the United States when he was 16 with $50 and the hope of supporting his extended family back home. His first job was as a clerk at Columbia University's law school library, where a 14-year career finally led him to the title of head of acquisitions.
        Culling from his years of research through his jobs at Columbia, Mr. Cohen compiled reference pamphlets on marriage and divorce and sold them for 50 cents each at the library. This modest publishing venture would eventually lead to the founding of the Legal Almanac Series, which still exists.
        Mr. Cohen might have spent the rest of his career at Columbia had it not been for World War II. From 1941 to 1945 he served in the counterintelligence unit of the United States Army Air Forces in the European Theater.
        When he returned from the war, Mr. Cohen continued his legal publishing career. He founded Oceana Publications in 1945, and his earlier pamphlets were expanded into books, ''The Law of Separation and Divorce'' and ''How to Make a Will,'' both published in 1947.
        From there Oceana became a well-known publishing house specializing in international and comparative law. It releases various publications, including ''The Consolidated Treaty Series,'' a compilation of treaties and international agreements in more than 240 volumes. He retired from Oceana, which is based in Dobbs Ferry, in 1995. His son, David R. Cohen, took over.
        Besides his son, David, who lives in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., Mr. Cohen is survived by his wife of 55 years, Fay, and two daughters, Anne Loscalzo of Whitehall, N.Y., and Karen Schnabel of Berriere, British Columbia.
