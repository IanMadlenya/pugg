        Allen B. Morgan, a former chairman and chief executive of First Tennessee Bank, died on Monday at the Allen Morgan Health Center of the Trezevant Manor retirement community in Memphis. He was 89.
        The cause was heart failure, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Morgan joined First Tennessee in 1929, after graduating from Washington and Lee University, and remained with the bank for 44 years. He was named president in 1960, chief executive in 1967 and chairman two years later.
        Over the period in which he was the leader of the company, First Tennessee grew from a bank with less than $500 million in assets to one with more than $1.5 billion. Mr. Morgan retired in 1973.
        During World War II, he served with the Navy.
        He is survived by his wife, Elise Wetter Morgan; a daughter, Elise Stratton Morgan; two sons, Henry and Allen Jr., all of Memphis, and seven grandchildren.
