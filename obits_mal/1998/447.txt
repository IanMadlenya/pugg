        Jack Frederick Wilder, a retired educator and administrator in psychiatry who was an innovator in the move toward community-based services for the mentally ill in the 1960's and 70's, died on April 28 at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 72.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        Dr. Wilder, who took emeritus status two years ago from Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University in the Bronx, was the founder of the Soundview-Throgs Neck Community Mental Health Center in 1967. The center was the first of its kind in New York City, and remains in operation. It offered outpatient services for area residents with chronic mental problems who would otherwise have been institutionalized.
        In 1973, Dr. Wilder started the annual national Conference on Leadership for Psychiatric Chief Residents in Tarrytown, N.Y., which he led for a quarter of a century.
        Dr. Wilder, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Yale in 1949 and received a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University in 1951 and his M.D. from New York University School of Medicine in 1956. He joined the Einstein College faculty in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, Therese Saint Clair Wilder; two sons, David and Marc, both of Greenwich; a sister, Julie Grayson of Roslyn, N.Y., and a grandson.
