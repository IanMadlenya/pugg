        Vincent J. Galvani, a chemical engineer who was in charge of designing the trigger mechanism for the first atomic bomb during World War II, died on Wednesday at his home in Southampton, N.Y. He was 89.
        Mr. Galvani made use of research on a number of other weapons, including buzz bombs and torpedoes, in his top-secret work on the atomic-bomb trigger for the Manhattan Project.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Galvani received a B.S. in chemical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
        He served in the United States Navy in the high-explosives research section of the Bureau of Ordnance, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.
        He later worked as a chemical engineer for Sears, Roebuck & Company in St. Paul and developed a formula for reflective paints used on the interstate highway system.
        Mr. Galvani is survived by his wife of 55 years, Mary Galvani; two daughters, Ann, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Gail, of Manhattan; a son, Patrick, of San Francisco, and five grandchildren.
