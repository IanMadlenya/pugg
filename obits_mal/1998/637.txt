        Peter Wyden, a journalist and author whose most recent book delved into his younger son's fight against schizophrenia, died Saturday evening at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Conn. He was 74.
        The cause was a stroke and a subdural hematoma, or blood on the brain, according to a statement issued by his older son, Ron, a United States Senator from Oregon. Mr. Wyden's wife, Elaine, said that he had bumped his head getting out of a car on Wednesday and that doctors thought he had probably burst a blood vessel, which led to the stroke.
        Mr. Wyden, who lived in Ridgefield, Conn., with his wife, was born in Berlin in 1923. He came to New York City when he was 13 and attended the City College of New York. His journalism career took him from The Wichita Eagle of Kansas to Newsweek to Ladies' Home Journal.
        He wrote more than a dozen books, one of which, ''Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story,'' won an Overseas Press Club Award. His other books ranged from the story of a Holocaust survivor to a peek inside the Masters and Johnson sex clinic, the latter written with his second wife, Barbara. That marriage, like the one to his first wife, Edith, ended in divorce.
        Mr. Wyden's most recent book chronicled his son Jeff's battle  against mental illness. The book, ''Conquering Schizophrenia: A Father, His Son and a Medical Breakthrough,'' was published by Alfred A. Knopf this spring.
        In addition to his wife and his sons, Ron, 49, and Jeff, 46, of San Jose, Calif., Mr. Wyden is survived by his two former wives and two stepchildren, James Seaton, 48, of Silver Spring, Md., and Andrea Miller, 45, of New Haven. He is also survived by two grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.
