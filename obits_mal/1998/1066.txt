        John G. Gude, an agent who represented many prominent figures in broadcasting and publishing, died on Oct. 11 at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts after a fall at Long Hill Nursing Home in Edgartown, Mass. He was 96.
        Over the years, Mr. Gude's clients  included Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite, William L. Shirer, Andy Rooney, Fred W. Friendly, Elmer Davis and James Thurber.
        Born in Montclair, N.J., Mr. Gude was a graduate of Brown University. He joined the CBS News department in the 1930's, writing publicity releases and editing news broadcasts. Shortly thereafter, with Thomas L. Stix, he formed the Stix & Gude agency, which represented radio news personalities, including Mr. Murrow, during World War II.
        After the war, Mr. Gude brought Mr. Murrow and Mr. Friendly together for the production of ''I Can Hear It Now,'' a recording of historic events conceived by Mr. Friendly and narrated by Mr. Murrow. The success of the recording led to a radio series and then to the ''See It Now'' television program, which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1955.
        Mr. Gude's wife, Helen, died in September at 94. He is survived by two sons, Jonathan and David; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Chilmark, Mass., and three grandchildren.
