        The Rev. Dr. Frederick Myers Morris, who led St. Thomas Episcopal Church on Fifth Avenue into a period of renewal during his 18-year tenure as its 10th rector, died on March 27 at the Duncaster retirement home in Bloomfield, Conn. He was 92.
        Dr. Morris, who retired in 1972, was credited with bringing new life to the parish at 53d Street by attracting young people and strengthening other elements of the church community. He restored its Sunday school program and prompted restoration of its Skinner organ, among other things. His ministry also ended the pew rents that had existed since the parish was founded in 1823.
        He was born in Los Angeles and graduated from Hobart College in 1927 and Virginia Theological Seminary three years later. He was a missionary to the Arapaho Indians of Wyoming and a rector in Maryland and Massachusetts.
        From 1948 until his arrival at St. Thomas in 1954, he was dean of St. Mark's Cathedral in Minneapolis.
        His wife of 65 years, Dorothy Hastings Morris, died last year.
        He is survived by three daughters, Dorothy Curtis of Lincoln, Mass., Ruth Keitt of Archer, Fla., and Elizabeth Lenerville of Keldron, S.D., and 15 grandchildren.
