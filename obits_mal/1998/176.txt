        William Burling Cocks, the nation's leading trainer of steeplechase horses five times between 1948 and 1986 and a member of thoroughbred racing's Hall of Fame, died on Saturday at his home in Unionville, Pa. He was 82.
        Mr. Cocks, known as Burley, was born in Old Westbury, N.Y., the son of United States Representative William Willets Cocks. In 1935, he was the nation's leading steeplechase jockey when one of his mounts fell. He sustained a head injury, ending his riding career, and he became a trainer.
        He trained Zaccio, who won the Eclipse Award as America's best steeplechase horse in 1981, 1982 and 1983. Mr. Cocks was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1985, and Zaccio was elected in 1990. In 1973, Mr. Cocks received steeplechasing's highest honor, the F. Ambrose Clark award. He helped develop such trainers as Billy Turner, who trained the Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew, and D. Michael Smithwick and Jonathan Sheppard, both members of the Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Barbara Lucas; a son, William, known as Winky, a trainer based in Camden, S.C.; three daughters, Susan Cocks Jones, Barbara C. Vannote and Jessie Wright Cocks, all of Unionville, and 10 grandchildren.
