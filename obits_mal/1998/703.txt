        Jack Friedberg, an authority on currency and the former president of a nationwide coin dealership, died on June 14 at Scottsdale Health Care Hospital in Arizona. Mr. Friedberg, a Scottsdale resident, was 83 and formerly lived in Roslyn, N.Y.
        He was president of the Capitol Coin Company and the Coin and Currency Institute from 1963 until his retirement in 1977. The Manhattan-based company was founded in 1931 by his brother Robert, a leading American numismatist.
        After World War II, Jack Friedberg helped build Capitol Coin into an enterprise with retail outlets in some of the country's largest department stores, including Gimbels in New York, Marshall Field in Chicago, the Emporium in San Francisco and Rich's in Atlanta. The company operated into the early 1980's.
        Robert Friedberg was the author of four standard reference books for numismatists, ''Gold Coins of the World: An Illustrated Standard Catalogue With Valuations,'' ''Paper Money of the United States,'' ''Coins of the British World'' and ''Appraising and Selling Your Coins.'' After Robert's death in 1963, Jack Friedberg took over the editing and kept the books up to date.
        Since Mr. Friedberg's retirement, the editing has been taken over by Robert's sons Ira and Arthur. Arthur is the current president of the Coin and Currency Institute in Passaic, N.J.
        The institute, founded by Robert and Jack Friedberg as a division of Capitol Coin, expanded into book publishing, the production of coin albums and coin jewelry and the distribution of commemorative medals.  Those included inaugural medals for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon and the Liberty Series of medals struck by the United States Mint.
        Mr. Friedberg is survived by his wife of 47 years, Libby Nessanbaum Friedberg; three sons, David of Phoenix, Richard of Scottsdale and Steven of Huntington, N.Y.; a daughter, Harriet Caspar of Phoenix, and nine grandchildren.
