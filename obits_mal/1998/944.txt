        Dr. Donald A. Pious, a University of Washington immunologist who advanced understanding of the immune system's responses to transplants and infection, died on Sept. 6 at his home in Seattle. He was 68.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, family members said.
        Dr. Pious made important contributions to immunology by producing cell mutations that revealed how the body's killer T-cells distinguish between foreign substances, or antigens, and the the body's own cells, said Dr. Hugh McDevitt, an immunologist at Stanford University.
        Dr. Pious's work led to the discovery of how particular molecules appear on protein markers, like flagpoles, that protrude through the cell's membrane and can identify a cell containing a virus as foreign tissue to be rejected.
        Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, a medical geneticist at the University of Washington, said Dr. Pious was a leader in the use of genetics to create mutant cells for immunology studies.
        Dr. Pious's advances were central to later research on autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well as on the entire system of histocompatibility, which involves the body's response to transplants.
        Dr. Pious, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1952 and his M.D. there in 1956.
        After his residency in pediatrics at Yale University Medical School, he was a postdoctoral fellow in biology at the University of California at San Diego from 1961 to 1964. Dr. Pious then joined the University of Washington, working in its departments of pediatrics and genetics and helping to create the department of immunology there in the 1980's.
        He is survived by his wife, Constance; a son, Tony, of Oakland, Calif.; a daughter, Lisa, of Berkeley, Calif., and a sister, Barbara Bresler, of Fairfield, Conn.
