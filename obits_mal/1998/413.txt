        James Tilton, a scenery and lighting designer whose work was a regular feature of the A.P.A.-Phoenix repertory company during its Off Broadway heyday in the 1960's and early 70's, died last Saturday in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 60 and lived in East Hampton.
        The cause was cancer, said his companion, Joseph Patton.
        Mr. Tilton began his association with the A.P.A. company in 1963 and designed many of its best-known productions, including ''War and Peace,'' ''You Can't Take It With You,'' ''Right You Are,'' ''The Showoff,'' ''Scapin,'' ''The Lower Depths'' and ''The Misanthrope.'' In 1967, he became the company's lighting designer as well.
        His Broadway credits include ''Private Lives'' (1969), ''Harvey'' (1970), ''The Grass Harp'' (1971) and ''Seascape'' (1975), for which he received a Tony nomination.
        He began his career while serving in the United States Army, where he designed theatrical productions in Germany.
        In addition to his companion, he is survived by his parents, Mag and Paul Marelli, and a brother, Norval, all of Rockford, Ill.
