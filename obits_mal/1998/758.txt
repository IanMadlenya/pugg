        John R. Williams, who was Governor of Arizona from 1967 to 1975 and helped the Republican Party gain a solid foothold in the state, died on Monday at his home in Phoenix. He was 88.
        Mr. Williams was the first Arizona governor to serve a four-year term,  as a result of a constitutional amendment that state voters approved in 1968. He had previously served two two-year terms.
        Born in Los Angeles, Mr. Williams knew poverty and illness in his youth. But he managed to graduate from Phoenix Junior College in 1929 and to get a job as a radio broadcaster, which made him a familiar figure statewide. He eventually came to own the station.
        Entering politics, he served as a school board member and Phoenix city councilman before being elected mayor in 1956 for the first of two terms. With Mr. Williams's election as governor in 1966, the Republicans gained their first clear mandate in Arizona history as they also took control of both houses of the legislature.
        Mr. Williams's wife, Vera May Williams, died last December after 55 years of marriage. He is survived by his sons, Michael M. and John R. Jr.; a daughter, Nikki Newcome, and five grandchildren.
