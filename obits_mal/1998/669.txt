        William D. Carey, a former executive officer of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a former assistant director of the Bureau of the Budget, died on June 24 at his home in Washington. He was 82.
        The cause was chronic lung disease, said his son, Eric.
        Mr. Carey was the association's executive officer, and at the same time publisher of its journal, Science, from 1975 until he retired in 1987. In that year the association, the nation's largest general scientific organization, had 132,000 members.
        In 1982, Science published a letter from Frank C. Carlucci, who was then Deputy Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration, which contended ''the Soviets exploit scientific exchanges to enhance their military posture.'' Mr. Carlucci voiced concern over the disclosure of information to the Soviet Union through exchanges of scholars and students, and through other means.
        Mr. Carey argued in an interview that Mr. Carlucci's letter ''focused mainly on half a dozen bad cases, including some exchanges that were discontinued because they were so one-sided.''
        After joining the budget bureau in 1942, he went on to be executive assistant director from 1959 to 1966, in the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, and assistant director from 1966 to 1969.
        Mr. Carey was born in the Bronx, grew up in Boston and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Columbia University and master's degrees from Columbia in public law and government and from Harvard University in public administration.
        Besides his son, Eric, of Arlington, Va., he is survived by his wife, the former Mary Margaret Rhodin, whom he married in 1944; four daughters, Teresa Boswood of Oxford, England, Jane Long of Washington, Julia Corrado of Alexandria, Va., and Elizabeth Langley of Arlington, Va., and nine grandchildren.
