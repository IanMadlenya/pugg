        Hershel L. Herzog, a pharmaceutical executive instrumental in developing several popular antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs, died on Aug. 4 at his daughter's home in Coopersburg, Pa. He was 74.
        The cause of death was Lou Gehrig's disease, said his daughter, Laura J. Herzog.
        Mr. Herzog received his bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering at the University of Illinois in 1944, graduating summa cum laude. After he received his master's and doctorate degrees from the University of Southern California, he went to work for E. R. Squibb & Sons.
        But it was not until 1950, when he joined the Schering Corporation, now known as Schering-Plough, that his skill in the laboratory would pay enormous dividends. Out to improve methods of hydrocortisone synthesis, Mr. Herzog was part of a team that developed prednisone and presnisolone, two anti-inflammatory drugs.
        The two drugs established Schering as a leader in the category. Schering reported $45.9 million in sales in 1955, with $20 million of that amount from prednisone. Two years later, total revenues topped $80 million.
        Mr. Herzog was also part of the team in the early 60's that developed gentamicin, an antibiotic used to treat eye, ear and skin infections.
        Mr. Herzog, who spent 32 years at Schering, was appointed senior vice president of drug development in 1977 and remained in that post until he retired in January 1983.
        Mr. Herzog married Levonna Horwin, another chemist, in 1944. She  died in 1995. Mr. Herzog is survived by their three children, Laura J. Herzog of Coopersburg; Barbara Herzog of Montclair, N.J., and Daniel Herzog of Newark, and two grandchildren.
