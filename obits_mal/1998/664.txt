        Gardner Patterson, a prominent trade economist and a prolific writer who helped negotiate several important international treaties, died at his home in Washington, on June 26. He was 82.
        Dr. Patterson died from lymphoma.
        A native of Burt, Iowa, Dr. Patterson had a doctorate in economics from Harvard University.
        In 1946, at the age of 30, Dr. Patterson was one of two advisers to a currency committee that took control of Greece's imports and exports. He left that post in 1949 to become a professor of economics at Princeton University.
        While teaching at Princeton, Dr. Patterson served in various roles on United States Government economic missions in Tunisia and Turkey and was a consultant to the State Department. He became director of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton in 1958.
        Dr. Patterson left Princeton in 1965 to become deputy director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in Geneva, now the World Trade Organization. He returned to Princeton two years later, but in 1969 he returned to GATT as director general for trade policy.
        He retired from GATT in 1981 and moved to Washington, although he remained actively involved with the organization, assisting in the resolution of four international trade disputes before the group.
        Dr. Patterson wrote several books, including a number of editions of the ''Survey of United States International Finance'' and more than 63 articles on international economic issues.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Evelyn, and one daughter, Eliza Patterson.
