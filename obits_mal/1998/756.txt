        Karl Schirdewan, a high-ranking figure in the old East German Communist Government who wanted to ''democratize'' the Communist Party but lost a power struggle and fell into disgrace, has died in Potsdam, Germany. He was 91.
        His death was reported on July 17  in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which did not say when he died.
        Mr. Schirdewan was born in Konigsberg, Germany, and became a worker and a Communist functionary. He was arrested after Hitler came to power for illegal party activity and was interned in concentration camps.
        In the postwar era he rose swiftly in the East German Communist Party. He was elected to its Politburo in 1953 and came to be described as the No. 2 man to the dictator Walter Ulbricht, an uncompromising Stalinist.
        But in a 1972 book, ''The Changing Party Elite in East Germany,'' Peter C. Ludz, a West German professor of political science, wrote that Mr. Schirdewan and two like-minded Politburo members came to constitute ''the last political alternative to the Ulbricht group'' within the party and that the elimination of that alternative was decided upon by its opponents.
        ''Schirdewan's wish to 'democratize' the party was perceived as a threat,'' Mr. Ludz wrote, and ''after a decisive struggle,'' the Ulbricht faction ''succeeded in re-establishing its positions of power.''
        On Feb. 8, 1958, Mr. Schirdewan and his two allies were expelled from the party's Central Committee and Politburo. The decision to expel them was made at a meeting of the Central Committee. Essentially, the three were accused of wanting to democratize the party, decentralize the East German economic system and introduce certain intellectual freedoms.
        Mr. Schirdewan was relegated to an obscure Government post but was rehabilitated by the party in 1990.
