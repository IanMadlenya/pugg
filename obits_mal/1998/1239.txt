        Enrique Martinez, a ballet dancer and rehearsal director at American Ballet Theater who staged the classics for ballet troupes in North and South America and Europe, died on Nov. 17 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was hepatitis, his family said.
        Mr. Martinez was born in Havana,  where he received his ballet training. His teachers included Alicia Alonso and Igor Schwezoff. He was offered a contract with Ballet Theater after Lucia Chase, director of the troupe, saw him performing with a Cuban  company. He joined the New York troupe in 1947 and remained with it until 1980.
        Mr. Martinez started as a corps dancer and moved up to soloist before becoming a ballet master, ballet director and assistant director of Ballet Theater. He was known for a serenity that did not fail him even when tested by the most volatile of ballet stars. In 1968, Mr. Martinez created a sunny, good-natured production of ''Coppelia'' for Ballet Theater and became associated with that ballet.
        Mr. Martinez choreographed and staged the classics for companies including the National Ballet of Cuba, the Dusseldorf Ballet, troupes associated with La Scala in Milan and the opera houses of Rome and Helsinki, the Milwaukee Ballet and companies in Denver, Norfolk, Atlanta and Detroit. During the 1980's and early 90's he directed and helped  organize ballet companies in Mexico, Caracas and Rio de Janeiro. His most recent productions, created in the late 1990's, were stagings of ''Coppelia'' for the Atlanta Ballet and companies in Canada and France.
        He is survived by two brothers, Jose and Rodolfo, and a sister, Teresa, all of Virginia Beach, Va.
