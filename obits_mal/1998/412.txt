        David Blum, a symphonic conductor and a writer on classical music, died on April 17 at a hospice in Kirkland, Wash., near his home in Bellevue. He was 62.
        His family said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Blum was born in Los Angeles and studied conducting and composition at the Juilliard School in New York.
        As a conductor, he made a number of recordings, including works by Mozart and Telemann and a series of Haydn symphonies for the Vanguard label, with the Esterhazy Orchestra of New York, which he founded in 1961 and directed until 1969. He was music director of the Lausanne Symphony Orchestra in Switzerland from 1973 to 1982 and of the Geneva Symphony Orchestra, which he also founded, from 1977 to 1986, and conducted many other orchestras as a guest.
        Mr. Blum devoted his later years to writing, showing a particular fascination with musical performers and their approaches to their art.
        In addition to three books -- ''Casals and the Art of Interpretation,'' ''The Art of Quartet Playing: The Guarneri Quartet in Conversation With David Blum'' and ''Paul Tortelier'' -- he wrote articles for The New Yorker, The Musical Times, The Strad and the Arts and Leisure section of The New York Times.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara, a daughter, Pamina, and a son, Ardan Michael.
