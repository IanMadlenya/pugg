        Garner Edward Shriver, a former Republican Congressman from south-central Kansas, died on Sunday at Via Christi-St. Francis Hospital in Wichita, Kan. A resident of Wichita, he was 85.
        Mr. Shriver served eight terms in the House of Representatives, from 1961 through 1975. He was defeated when seeking re-election in 1976.
        Among his priorities were veterans benefits, civil rights and domestic spending cuts. He fought against the erosion of veterans benefits and for combat pay for servicemen in Vietnam even before the war there began to engage American forces fully.
        He was the minority counsel and then general counsel to the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee from 1976 to 1982. He then returned to law practice in Kansas.
        Born in Towanda, Kan., Mr. Shriver graduated from the University of Wichita in 1934 and earned a law degree in 1940 at Washburn University of Topeka. He served as a Navy lieutenant in the Pacific in World War II.
        He was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives from Sedgwick County in 1947. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the Fourth Congressional District in 1960.
        Besides his son, David G., of McPherson, Mr. Shriver is survived by his wife of 56 years, Martha Jane Currier Shriver; two daughters, Kay Kwon, of Seaside, Calif., and Linda Ann Breeding, of Bixby, Okla., and seven grandchildren.
