        William Box Cook, associate director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, died on Tuesday at his home in Chicago. He was 48.
        He had a heart attack in the lobby of his apartment building, a spokeswoman at the museum said.
        Mr. Cook joined the museum in September after serving as executive director of the Cunningham Dance Foundation in New York City for four years. Mr. Cook also supervised the activities of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, producing annual seasons in New York, London, Paris and California and coordinating Mr. Cunningham's collaborations with Roy Lichtenstein, Rei Kawakubo, Brian Eno and others.
        He is survived by his father and stepmother, Box and Maxine Cook of Port Townsend, Wash.; three brothers, Stephen and Michael, of Sacramento, Calif., and Richard, of Carlisle, Pa., and a sister, Karen, of Whidbey Island, Wash.
