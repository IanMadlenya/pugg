        Sgt. Maj. Herbert J. Sweet, who served as the top enlisted marine during the corps' heaviest fighting in Vietnam, died on June 18 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 79.
        A Marine Corps statement said the cause was respiratory failure.
        Sergeant Major Sweet, who grew up in Troy, N.Y., enlisted in the corps at age 17 in 1937 and saw action on Guam and Iwo Jima in World War II as well as combat service in Korea and Vietnam. He won a Bronze Star and the Navy Commendation Medal, each with a combat ''V,'' and was awarded four Purple Hearts.
        He held the highest noncommissioned officer's position in the corps from 1965 to 1969, serving as the fourth Sergeant Major of the United States Marine Corps.
        He was awarded his 14th medal, the Legion of Merit, on the day of his retirement after 32 years of service.
        Sergeant Major Sweet is survived by his wife, Dorothea; a son, Michael J., and daughter, Kathleen Sweet Charters, both of Vienna, Va., and two grandchildren.
