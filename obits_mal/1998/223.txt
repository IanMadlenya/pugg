        M. Norvel Young, the chancellor emeritus who guided Pepperdine University through a period of robust growth as its third president, died last Tuesday at his campus residence in Malibu, Calif. He was 82.
        The cause was a heart attack, a Pepperdine spokesman said.
        Dr. Young was president from 1957 to 1971, when he became chancellor. He took emeritus status in 1985 but continued as a fund-raiser. Under his leadership, Pepperdine grew from a small college with 950 students in Los Angeles to a full-fledged university with an enrolment of 9,500.
        Dr. Young was born in Nashville. He graduated in 1936 from Abilene Christian University and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in history at Vanderbilt University. After beginning his career as a history professor at Pepperdine in 1938, he returned to Nashville to work on his doctorate.
        In 1956, he helped found Lubbock Christian College. The next year George Pepperdine and the college trustees persuaded him to return to Southern California to lead the school where he had first taught.
        Surviving are his wife of 56 years, Helen Mattox Young; 3 daughters, Emily Lemley and Sara Jackson, of Agoura Hills, Calif., and Marilyn Stewart of Grants, N.M.; a son, Matt N. 3d, of Topanga, Calif., and 13 grandchildren.
