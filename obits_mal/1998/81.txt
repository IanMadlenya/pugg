        Edward Safani, founder of one of the oldest galleries of ancient art in the United States, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        He founded the Safani Gallery, on Madison Avenue near 76th Street, in 1946. He sold ancient art from Greece, Rome, Egypt and the Near East to major museums, including the Metropolitan Museum, the Cleveland Museum, the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington and the Detroit Institute of Art.
        In 1990, he sold a group of Cycladic marble idols to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles that became the core for the institution's collection of early Greek art.
        He was born in Teheran in 1912 and traveled by train to Paris as a teen-ager to work as an apprentice to his uncle, Ayoub Rabenou, an Islamic art dealer. During those early years he sold Islamic ceramics and glass to the Louvre in Paris and to the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. In 1946 he came to New York.
        Mr. Safani was considered an expert in Islamic art, ancient glass and ancient Near Eastern art and was often asked by museums, auction houses and dealers to authenticate ancient works.
        He is survived by his wife, Fakhri, and two children, Lily and Alan, all of Manhattan.
