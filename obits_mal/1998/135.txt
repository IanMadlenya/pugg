        Clifford D. Siverd, a former chairman of the American Cyanamid Company, died on Jan. 16 at his home in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 85.
        Mr. Siverd was named president and chief executive of American Cyanamid in 1967, and was appointed chairman in 1972.
        He continued Cyanamid's shift away from an emphasis on chemical products, largely through a series of acquisitions.
        During Mr. Siverd's tenure as chief executive, American Cyanamid bought Shulton, a toiletries and perfume company, and some residential builders.
        Earlier acquisitions had included the Formica Corporation, the maker of surfacing products, and the Breck Company, which makes shampoo.
        From 1961 to 1971, the percentage of sales from chemical products dropped from 42 to 32 percent of the company's total. By 1971, 27 percent of sales came from building and consumer products; 21 percent from medical products and 20 percent from the agricultural division.
        American Cyanamid itself was acquired by American Home Products for $9.7 billion in 1994.
        Mr. Siverd had been with American Cyanamid, which was based in Wayne, N.J., for five decades when he retired in 1975.
        After he graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a degree in chemistry in 1935, he joined the United Color and Pigment Company. United Color was acquired by American Cyanamid in 1944, and Mr. Siverd held various positions there before he became, in 1960, the head of the agricultural division, which made fertilizers and other agricultural chemical products. In 1965, he was named vice president, responsible for the agricultural and consumer divisions.
        During World War II, Mr. Siverd served with the Army Corps of Engineers.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, of Boynton Beach; a daughter, Mary Carol Staiger, of Alta, Wyo.; two sons, John, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and Robert, of Cincinnati, seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
