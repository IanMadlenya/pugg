        Clancy Carlile, a novelist and screenwriter, died on June 4 at South Austin Hospital in Austin, Tex. He was 68 and lived in Austin.
        He had cancer, said Leonard Gardner, a friend.
        Mr. Carlile, whose original name was Clarence Lawson Carlile, wrote  four novels. ''Children of the Dust'' (1995), about the settling of Oklahoma, became a CBS mini-series that starred Sidney Poitier. ''Honkytonk Man'' (1980), the story of the life and death of a country singer, became a movie directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. He also wrote ''Spore 7'' (1979) and ''As I Was Young and Easy'' (1958).
        Mr. Carlile, whose father was half Cherokee, was born in 1930 on a Choctaw Indian reservation in Oklahoma. As a young man he worked in  cotton fields in Texas until his family, who were sharecroppers, migrated to California to pick fruit. He discovered the delights of fiction while serving in the Army during the Korean War. After his discharge, he received a master's degree at San Francisco State University. He wrote his first novel, ''As I Was Young and Easy,'' in 17 days.
        He is survived by a son, Steven, of Brownsville, Ore.; two sisters, Peggy Lasado, of Dixon, Calif., and Jane Sanders, of Sacramento, and four grandchildren.
