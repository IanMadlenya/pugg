        Lou Cioffi, a broadcast journalist who covered the Korean War in the 1950's, the Vietnam War in the 1960's and the 1979-1981 hostage crisis in Iran, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He turned 72 last week.
        The cause was complications from liver cancer, his son, Marc, said.
        Mr. Cioffi, a native New Yorker, began his career as a foreign correspondent in 1952, when he was assigned by CBS News to cover the Korean War. He went on to report on insurrections in Algeria and the wedding of the actress Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier of Monaco and became the network's Paris correspondent.
        Joining ABC News in 1961, Mr. Cioffi filed radio and television reports from Vietnam from 1965 to 1967, covered the famine in Ethiopia in the mid-1980's and received an Emmy for his coverage of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, in 1981. Mr. Cioffi was also the network's United Nations correspondent for many years, retiring in 1988.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Cioffi is survived by his wife, Naomi, and a grandson.
