        William C. K. Irwin, a pianist and conductor, died on Friday at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. He was 91 and had lived for many years on Staten Island.
        Mr. Irwin spent much of his career in musical theater. He was introduced to George Gershwin by the composer Vernon Duke in the 1920's and was a regular dinner guest at Gershwin's Manhattan apartment, where he would sit in on impromptu piano improvisations with Gershwin and the pianist Oscar Levant.
        Gershwin introduced Mr. Irwin to Irving Berlin, starting a musical relationship that lasted six years. Mr. Irwin worked alongside Berlin, writing melodies as they were composed, and often had to hurry over to Berlin's studio in the middle of the night to write down a new tune that had popped into the composer's head.
        In the 1940's Mr. Irwin was music director for the national tours of ''Oklahoma!,'' ''South Pacific'' and ''The King and I.'' He became choral director for Radio City Music Hall in the 1960's and later was the staff composer and musical director for the music hall. He retired in 1979.
        Born in San Francisco, Mr. Irwin grew up in Louisville, Ky. As a teen-ager, he studied piano in Chicago with the composer Percy Grainger and then moved to New York to continue his studies at the Manhattan School of Music.
        Mr. Irwin's wife, Helen, died in 1984. He is survived by a son, Dean, a producer for ABC News.
