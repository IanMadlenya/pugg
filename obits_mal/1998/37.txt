        Herbert Grossman, a pharmaceutical industry executive who helped introduce some of the world's most widely prescribed drugs, including Valium and the Sabin polio vaccine, died of congestive heart failure in Manhattan on Dec. 29. He was 67.
        During his 47-year career in the pharmaceutical business, Mr. Grossman worked for a variety of companies, including Pfizer Laboratories, Roche Laboratories and the Revlon/ USV Laboratories, gaining a reputation as a pioneer in both drug marketing and strategic planning. He was also a consultant to General Foods and Johnson & Johnson.
        Mr. Grossman liked to speak out on issues facing the pharmaceutical industry. Writing in 1990, he bemoaned the fact that a disproportionate amount of medical research funds was devoted to AIDS compared with cancer and heart disease, even though the latter killed many more Americans.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Grossman was president and chief executive of Beacon Laboratories in Wayne, N.J., which is developing drugs for the treatment of cancer and blood disorders.
        He is survived by Sandra Grossman, his wife of 46 years; three daughters, Robin Mangino and Lynne Grossman of West Caldwell, N.J., and Laurie Salter of Sherman Oaks, Calif.; a sister, Helen Graf of Fort Lee, N.J., and four grandchildren.
