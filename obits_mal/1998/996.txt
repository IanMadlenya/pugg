        Hoke S. Simpson, a former associate dean at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, died on Sept. 26 at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. Mr. Simpson, a resident of Rye, N.Y., was 83.
        The cause of death was lung disease, said his daughter, Drayton Jenkins Gerety.
        Mr. Simpson joined the business school as the director of executive programs in 1954 and was promoted to associate dean for executive education in 1967. The executive education program, which is part of the business school, is a series of one-  to four-week nondegree courses for executives, including those in management, finance, leadership and marketing. Courses are sometimes custom-designed for private companies, too.
        When Mr. Simpson joined the business school, its executive education division was just starting. He helped develop a wide range of business courses, and during his tenure the school had programs in New York, France, Spain and South America. He retired in 1985.
        After he graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1935 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and industrial management, Mr. Simpson went to work as a salesman for the General Foods Corporation. During a 16-year career at General Foods, except for a six-year stint with the Naval Reserve, Mr. Simpson worked in the marketing, personnel and labor relations divisions. Before joining Columbia University, Mr. Simpson worked for the Vick Chemical Company as director of personnel and public relations.
        Mr. Simpson is survived by his wife, Suzanne, of Rye; his daughter, Drayton Jenkins Gerety of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; two sons, Hoke Jr., of San Diego, and Willis W., of Asheville, N.C.; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
