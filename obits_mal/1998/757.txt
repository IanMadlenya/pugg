        Harold Siegel, a former secretary and counsel to the New York City Board of Education, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Siegel joined the professional staff of the school board in 1951 as a confidential secretary, and left a year later to serve as executive director of the United Parents Associations of New York City for 13 years. He returned in 1965 as executive assistant and was promoted to secretary the following year.
        The board, which regarded him as the layman with the most intimate knowledge of the educational system, combined two positions in 1977 to create the post of secretary/counsel and named Mr. Siegel to it.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Siegel graduated from City College in 1931 and earned a law degree at Brooklyn Law School in 1934. He received a master's degree in education at New York University in 1947.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Miriam Gzibeck; two daughters, Toni, of Manhattan, and Martha, of New City, N.Y.; two sisters, Bea McNanie of Garden City, N.Y., and Harriet Moss of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
