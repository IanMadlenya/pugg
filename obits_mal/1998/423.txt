        The Rev. William James Chase, an advocate of hospital chaplain services and a former assistant to the rector of St. James Episcopal Church, on Madison Avenue at 71st Street, died on April 11 at his home in East Hampton, N.Y. He was 82.
        Born in Boston, he graduated from Hamilton College in 1936 and from Episcopal Theological Seminary in Cambridge, mass., in 1939. He also studied at Air Force Chaplains School and in World War II served on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's staff in the Pacific.
        He was at St. James from 1949 to 1971, assisting the Rev. Dr. Arthur Lee Kinsolving. In 1971, Mr. Chase set up the chaplain program at Roosevelt Hospital and arranged for financing to staff the chaplain's office round the clock through an effort involving more than 20 churches. He continued as a volunteer chaplain at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital after he retired.
        He is survived by a brother, John L., of Norfolk, Va.
