        L. Edwin Smart, a former chairman and chief executive of Trans World Airlines, died June 1 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York. He was 74 and lived in New York.
        The cause of death was heart disease, said Jeanie M. Smart, his wife.
        Mr. Smart became chairman and chief executive of T.W.A. in 1977 and was named chairman and chief executive of the Transworld Corporation, a holding company formed when the airline was restructured in 1978.
        In 1979, Transworld bought Spartan Food Systems, the largest franchisee of Hardee's restaurants, and the Century 21 Real Estate Corporation, the real estate brokerage chain.
        The conglomerate spun off T.W.A. in 1983, after defeating a takeover bid by Texas International Airlines, which was led by Frank A. Lorenzo. T.W.A. was eventually purchased by Carl C. Icahn in 1985.
        Mr. Smart sold Transworld's hotel division in 1986, and liquidated most of the assets to avoid an acquisition  by Ronald O. Perelman, the takeover investor and chairman of Revlon Inc. The resulting company, called TW Services, was devoted to the food services industry. Mr. Smart left in April 1987. In 1989, TW Services was acquired by Coniston Partners, a New York investment firm.
        Louis Edwin Smart graduated from Harvard University in 1947, and Harvard Law School in 1949, both with magna cum laude degrees. He joined Hughes, Hubbard & Reed (then Hughes, Hubbard & Ewing) that year, and became a partner in 1957. During his tenure at the firm, one of his major clients was the Bendix Corporation. In 1964, Mr. Smart was named president of the international division of Bendix, a position he held until he joined T.W.A. as an executive vice president in 1967.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Smart is survived by a daughter, Cynthia S.,  of San Antonio; two sons, Dana G., of Long Beach, Calif., and Douglas E., of Madison, Conn., and five grandchildren.
