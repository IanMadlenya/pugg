        Lucio Battisti, a singer and songwriter who was the voice of Italians who came of age in the late 1960's and early 70's, died on Sept. 9 at a hospital in Milan. He was 55.
        The Associated Press said the cause was liver cancer.
        A fiercely private figure who had not made a public appearance in two decades, Mr. Battisti was Italy's best-known pop performer.
        His fame and youthful following were such that he was sometimes compared to Bob Dylan, less for the political content of Mr. Battisti's songs than for the way they defined an era.
        He was born in Poggio Bustone, a small town north of Rome. He began playing the guitar as a teen-ager and moved to Milan in 1964 to be a songwriter. In 1966 he met Giulio Rapetti, better known as Mogol, a lyricist with whom he wrote his most famous songs, many of them among Italy's best-selling records. Early in his career he wrote songs that were successes for leading Italian pop singers as well as for Americans like Gene Pitney and the Hollies.
        Mr. Battisti's singing style was once described as ''the voice of someone who has just gotten out of bed and hasn't had his coffee yet.''
        He is survived by his wife, Grazia Letizia Veronesi, and a son, Luca.
