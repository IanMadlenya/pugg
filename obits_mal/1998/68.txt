        Dr. Ira Progoff, a New York psychotherapist and author known for an intensive journal-writing method he developed as a way to encourage personal growth, died on Jan. 1 at Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 76 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological condition, said his son, Jonathan, the associate director of Dialogue House, the organization set up by Dr. Progoff to run his journal workshop program.
        Dr. Progoff discussed his theories of depth psychology and related subjects in 14 books, starting in the 1950's when he began what he called  ''psychological workbooks.''
        Dr. Progoff shunned the traditional medical model of diagnosis and analysis and focused on the spiritual and creative potentials of personality. ''Each human life,'' he wrote, ''has the potentiality of becoming an art work.''
        He set forth his central ideas on keeping a meaningful personal diary in ''At a Journal Workshop: The Basic Text and Guide for Using the Intensive Journal Process'' (Dialogue House Library, 1975). A revised version, subtitled ''Writing to Access the Power of the Unconscious and Evoke Creative Ability,'' was published by Putnam in 1992.
        Dr. Progoff taught his intensive journal method as a tool for personal growth in workshops that Dialogue House says were attended by about 200,000 people throughout the country.
        Ira Progoff was born in Brooklyn. He received his bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and his Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1951.
        Besides his son, a resident of Manhasset, N.Y., Dr. Progoff is survived by his wife, Mary Lou; his daughter, Susan, of Manhattan, and two grandsons. A previous marriage, to Rose Goldwyn Progoff, also of Manhasset, ended in divorce.
