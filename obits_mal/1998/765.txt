        Paul J. Anderson, who directed the Division of Neuropathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and School of Medicine for 30 years, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Manhattan. He was 72 and also kept a residence in New Paltz, N.Y.
        The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed early last month, according to the medical school, which is affiliated with the City University of New York.
        At his death, Dr. Anderson was clinical professor of neurology and pathology at Mount Sinai and an attending neurologist at Beth Israel Hospital.
        He served as an editor of The Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology for 20 years and was the editor in chief of The Journal of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry from 1973 to 1996.
        Dr. Anderson joined the faculty at Mount Sinai in 1958 as an assistant attending pathologist. He also accepted the administrative post of division chief that year and held it until 1987, directing the residence program in neuropathology.
        Born in Akron, Ohio, he graduated from Ohio University in 1949 and received his medical degree at the University of Chicago in 1953.
        His survivors include three sons from his first marriage, and a daughter from his second marriage: Jon, Colin, Kell and Rebecca Anderson, all of New York City. His marriages to Joan E. Anderson of Ocala, Fla., and Rachael Anderson of Tucson, Ariz., ended in divorce.
