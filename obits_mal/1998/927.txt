        Frederick H. Korth, a Texas banker who served for two years as Secretary of the Navy in the Kennedy Administration, died on Sept. 14 at his home in El Paso. He was 89, and had retired from his practice at a Washington law firm in December.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Fritz-Alan, of Washington.
        Mr. Korth, who was named Secretary of the Navy in 1961, succeeded John B. Connally, who resigned to run for governor of Texas. But Mr. Korth resigned after two stormy years as the Navy's civilian chief. He was criticized for having a conflict of interest in awarding a multibillion-dollar aircraft contract to the General Dynamics Corporation of Fort Worth and of using Navy stationery for matters pertaining to a Fort Worth bank with which he was associated. A Congressional committee investigating the accusations concluded that they were groundless.
        Mr. Korth also clashed with Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara over a proposal to build the nation's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and over a shift of responsibility for the Middle East and India from the Navy to the Army.
        The son of a Texas banker and rancher, Mr. Korth grew up on the family ranch in Karnes County, in Central Texas. He graduated from the University of Texas and received a law degree from George Washington University, where he met his future wife, Vera Sansom Connell, a fellow Texan who was attending a Washington finishing school.
        After returning to Fort Worth to practice law, he joined the Air Transport Command of the Army Air Forces in World War II. After the war, he became president of Continental National Bank, a post he left for two years to serve as an assistant secretary of the Army in the Truman Administration.
        Besides his son, Mr. Korth, whose first marriage ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, Charlotte, of El Paso; a daughter, Nina Maria Cole of Fort Worth; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
