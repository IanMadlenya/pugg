        Frank Lovell, an American disciple of Leon Trotsky's brand of Marxism-Leninism and a New York City writer and editor concerned with socialist and trade-union issues, died on May 1 at his home in the East Village. He was 84.
        He was a former labor editor of The Militant, the newsweekly of the Socialist Workers Party. Most recently he was an editor and contributor to The Bulletin in Defense of Marxism, a small bimonthly subscription publication.
        A native of rural Ipava, Ill., he graduated with a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley. He became a follower of Trotsky in San Francisco in 1935 after a wrenching general strike in that city.
        He was a founding member, in 1938, of the Socialist Workers Party, the American affiliate of Trotsky's small Fourth International, an attempt to organize a world revolutionary movement.
        He worked as a merchant seaman, joining the Sailors Union of the Pacific and serving through the war years. He later wrote a critical book about the maritime industry and the union, titled ''Maritime!'' (1943). Settling in Detroit after the war, he found work at General Motors and became active in the United Auto Workers.
        Mr. Lovell helped to build and lead a branch of the Socialist Workers Party and he served for many years on the party's national committee. He was the party's trade-union director and during this period became labor editor of The Militant.
        By the 1980's, the party had split between the old-line Trotskyists and younger members, who used Fidel Castro's Cuba as their model for a ''workers' and farmers' government'' in this country. Mr. Lovell and other old-liners were forced out, and in 1983 he became the founding editor of The Bulletin in Defense of Marxism.
        He is survived by his companion, Miriam Braverman, and a daughter, Joan Lovell of Detroit. His wife, Sarah, died in 1994.
