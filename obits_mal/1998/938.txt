        Victor A. Coopersmith, a fashion entrepreneur who in July closed the company that made women's wool suits and other clothes designed by his wife, Andrea Jovine, drowned Sept. 9 while swimming in Lake Powell near Page, Ariz., the United States Park Service said. He was 51.
        Mr. Coopersmith was last seen by family members and friends about 3:30 in the afternoon near a marina as he swam from a ski boat that was on a towline behind a houseboat, said Char Obergh, a spokeswoman for the Park Service. She said divers recovered the body in 200 feet of water on Sunday.
        Mr. Coopersmith was a combative businessman who in 15 years built sales of Coopersmith Enterprises to a reported $75 million a year but struggled in the last year to keep the company going before closing it.
        The Andrea Jovine line of women's suits and other clothing was known as bridge wear, expensive clothing that is marketed one notch below designer labels. At its peak, Jovine's bridge business had sales of about $70 million, according to an estimate by Women's Wear Daily, the trade publication.
        Last month, he vowed to sue three department stores over what he considered excessive returns of unsold merchandise and unauthorized deductions from invoices.
        Mr. Coopersmith started his career at 19 as a dress salesman for the Leslie Fay Companies and was named president of the women's division of Damon six years later. In 1979, he was a founder of the Adrienne Vittadini clothing company, selling out in 1982 to go into business with Ms. Jovine the next year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Alexander, of Greenwich, Conn., and Jordan Coopersmith of Westbrook, Conn.; a daughter, Lisa Coopersmith Schwartz of Manhattan; his parents, Norman and Beverly Coopersmith of Tamarac, Fla., and a brother, Richard Coopersmith of Newtown, Conn.
