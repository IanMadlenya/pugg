        Edward N. Hoffman, an advertising executive for 50 years who never retired, died on April 23 in Chicago. He was 79 and had moved to Chicago last year from New Canaan, Conn.
        Mr. Hoffman's specialty was promoting real estate developments and, in the 1980's, advertising condominiums converted from rental apartments.
        Tom Riley, a former associate, said Mr. Hoffman had helped to sell thousands of condos in Florida, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia and Chicago by advertising ''discounted'' prices for current renters and for buyers who put down cash deposits before a deadline that he established.
        Mr. Hoffman was born in New York City on April 21, 1919. He graduated from the University of North Carolina and attended Columbia University Law School. As a young Naval Reserve officer in World War II, he took part in a number of battles in the Pacific, including Subic Bay, Eniwetok and Okinawa.
        After the war, he worked in advertising in New York, Miami and Chicago, sometimes directing his own agencies. For the last 10 years, he was a senior vice president and account executive of the New York-based Miller Advertising Agency.
        An avid jazz fan, he promoted the music on radio and in the early years of television. His wife, Lola Manning Hoffman, said his family planned to donate his collection of more than 12,000 jazz record albums, 3,500 tapes and compact disks to a library in southern Florida.
        Survivors also include a son, E. Norman Hoffman 2d of San Francisco; a daughter, Diane Parker Walsh of Miami; two sisters, Flora Jean Jacobson of New York and Ruth Sisisky of Richmond; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
