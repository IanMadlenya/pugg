        Phil Leeds, a durable funnyman who began his pursuit of laughs as a stand-up comic in the 1930's and went on to work in theater, films and television, died on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 82.
        Mr. Leeds's rumpled face -- ''I'm not pretty, but I'm warm and feisty,'' he told an interviewer -- was a familiar one to television viewers. Indeed, in May he appeared in the final episodes of four television series on the same night: ''Ally McBeal,'' ''Ellen,'' ''Everybody Loves Raymond'' and ''Murphy Brown.'' Over the years he made guest appearances on dozens of shows, including ''All in the Family,'' ''Maude,'' ''The Golden Girls,'' ''Barney Miller,'' ''Roseanne'' and ''The Larry Sanders Show.''
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Leeds was a member of the Army Special Service Unit during World War II and entertained troops in the Pacific. After the war he returned to New York and performed at the Village Vanguard, the Blue Angel and other clubs. He eventually won parts in several Broadway shows, including ''Make a Wish,'' ''Can-Can,'' ''Romanoff and Juliet'' and ''Nobody Loves an Albatross.''
        In the 1970's he appeared with Jose Ferrer in a successful production of Neil Simon's comedy ''The Sunshine Boys'' in San Francisco. He also performed in the musical ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' at the Los Angeles Music Center in 1973. His film credits included ''Rosemary's Baby,'' ''Beaches,'' ''Enemies, A Love Story'' and ''Soapdish.''
        No immediate family members survive.
