        Tully Filmus, a realist painter and portraitist, died on Wednesday at his home in Fern Hill, Mass. He was 94.
        Mr. Filmus was born in Ataki, a region of Bessarabia, which is now part of Moldova, in 1903 and came to  the United States with his parents in 1913. They lived in Philadelphia, and  he studied art at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
        A scholarship in 1927 enabled him to spend two years in Europe, where he studied for a period with Andre Lhote in Paris. In New York, he shared a studio with Willem de Kooning in the early 1930's, and worked on Works Progress Administration  projects in New York City in 1936. From 1937 to 1939 he taught at the American Artists School in New York and from 1938 to 1950 at the Cooper Union School of Art.
        Mr. Filmus had his first exhibition in New York at the American Artists Congress; his most recent was at the ACA Gallery in 1971. In 1985, he and his sons, Michael and Stephen, who are also artists, exhibited together.  While his portraits were usually of family and friends, Mr. Filmus also painted commissioned portraits of  figures like Eleanor Roosevelt and Jonas Salk.
        He is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
        He is survived by his sons, who live in Great Barrington, Mass.
