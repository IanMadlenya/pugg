        Thomas Crawford Mayers, a retired department store executive and former Mayor of Stamford, Conn., died on Dec. 20 at a nursing home in Stamford where he had lived since 1995. He was 88.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Mayers was nominated by the Republican Party as a fresh face in the 1963 Stamford mayoral election,  which he won on a pledge to reverse downtown blight. He succeeded in marshaling support for a revitalization plan and was credited with preparing the ground for the city's corporate boom of the 1970's.
        He also tried to improve conditions for low-income families who lived in substandard housing and those displaced by slum clearance. A backlash cost him re-election to a third term in 1967.
        Mr. Mayers, who was born in Dorchester, Mass., attended Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard College in 1930. Opting for a career in merchandising, he started at Macy's and then went to work for  Bloomingdale's, where he was manager of the Stamford store and director of branch store development.
        After his tenure as Mayor, he worked with a Stamford real estate company, Harry Bennett & Associates.
        Mr. Mayers is survived by three sons, Thomas Jr., of East Northport, N.Y., Lawrence, of Littleton, Colo., and Paul, of Rowayton, Conn.; six daughters, Mary Young of Lake Worth, Fla., Marjorie Wolf of Dallas, Ruth Schofield of Stamford, Eileen Zebroski of Ponte Vedra, Fla., Rosemary Collyer of Chevy Chase, Md., and Brenda Danielson of Seal Beach, Calif.; 22 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
        His wife, Alice Henry Mayers, died in 1995.
