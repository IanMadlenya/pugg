        James Prescott Carter, an international banker and economic consultant who also bred Aberdeen Angus cattle, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Keene, Va. He was 99 years old.
        Mr. Carter worked for more than three decades as an executive of the predecessor of Citibank in Spain, Belgium and Latin America and spent another eight years as a consultant in Latin America and Africa before retiring in 1963.
        As the bank's manager in Cuba he became concerned about the rise of the revolutionary forces of Fidel Castro long before Mr. Castro seized power in 1959 and began nationalizing foreign businesses. His advice to begin reducing investments in Cuba was credited with sharply limiting the bank's losses.
        Mr. Carter had bought a 450-acre cattle farm in Virginia in the 1940's and when he stopped consulting in 1963 he began spending much of his time there breeding prize-winning Aberdeen Angus. Among his customers were several state agriculture departments. He sold the farm in 1983 and had been living in Keene since.
        Mr. Carter, who earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering at the Virginia Military Institute and a master's degree in economics at the University of Wisconsin, started his career in Madrid in 1921 with what was then known as the National City Bank, with headquarters in New York.
        Mr. Carter is survived by five daughters, Katherine Parker of Madison, Tenn.; Susan Miller of Richmond; Rachel Brown of York, Pa.; Enriqueta Bond of Pittsboro, N.C., and Adelaide Ruffner of Charlottesville, Va.; 11 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
        His wife, Harriette Mortley Bovard, died in 1983.
