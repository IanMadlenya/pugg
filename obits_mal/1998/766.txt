        Wouter F. Germans, a partner in Hague Art Deliveries, which developed 420 West Broadway, one of the primary gallery buildings during the heyday of the SoHo art scene, died on Aug. 24 at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications after heart-bypass surgery, said his partner, Fritz de Knegt.
        Mr. Germans was born in the Hague in 1938 and immigrated to the United States in 1960. In 1964, he and Mr. de Knegt, who is also Dutch, founded Hague Art Deliveries, one of the few art-handling businesses that specialized in storing, moving and installing works of contemporary art, which could be large and bulky. In 1970, Mr. Germans and Mr. de Knegt bought a large loft building at 420 West Broadway and persuaded Leo Castelli and three other prominent uptown art dealers -- Ileana Sonnabend, John Weber and Andre Emmerich -- to open galleries in the building.
        In subsequent years, Mr. Germans became a familiar figure around SoHo, a participant in community board meetings and a host to visiting European artists.
        Hague Art Deliveries closed in 1984, and Mr. Germans opened the Germans Van Eck Gallery in its ground-floor space, showing the work of Donald Lipski, Maureen Connor, Heide Fasnacht, Daniel Weiner and others.
        Mr. Germans is survived by his wife, Trudy Ellen Carney; their son, Teddy; a son from a previous marriage, Wouter F. Germans Jr. of London, and two brothers, Teo, of Smithtown, N.Y., and Jacques, of Bayside, Queens.
