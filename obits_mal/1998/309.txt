        Edward V. Lipman Sr., whose career at Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. spanned 51 years, died on March 13 at his home in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 87.
        Mr. Lipman retired in 1977 after 21 years as manager of southeastern operations of the marketing cooperative, which is owned by more than 900 berry and citrus farmers in the United States and Canada. He joined Ocean Spray in 1946 as director of grower relations for New Jersey and Wisconsin after nine years with the United States Agriculture Department.
        Until last year Mr. Lipman remained an Ocean Spray director.
        He not only helped sell cranberries but also grew them. He bought his first cranberry bog, in Ocean County, N.J., in 1950. But the development of New Jersey sometimes threw hurdles between Mr. Lipman and berry raising.
        In the 1960's he lost a bog in Lakewood, N.J., after the patch was said to have been contaminated by a nearby dump. In the 1980's he learned that another of his bogs, adjacent to the Naval Air Engineering Center in Lakehurst, N.J., might be contaminated by industrial chemicals.
        Mr. Lipman is survived by his wife, Gardina Armstrong Lipman; a brother, Daniel H. Lipman of New Brunswick; a daughter, Gardina L. Mawhinney of Edgewater, Md., and two sons, Edward V. Lipman Jr. of Franklin Park, N.J., and Jeffrey A. Lipman of New Egypt, N.J.
