        Francis Lee, a combat cameraman who documented the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 and was a member of an avant-garde film movement, died on May 29 at a  nursing home in Manhattan. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Lee was taken to New York from Sicily as a child and began to work in experimental film in 1939 with a movie camera and editing equipment he bought with a small inheritance. In World War II he joined the infantry and, assigned as a combat cameraman, shot some 500,000 feet of film. Thirty years later, he retrieved much of that film and fashioned it into a 20-minute documentary. After the war he worked as a commercial filmmaker and taught at New York University.
        He is survived by a son, Michael W. Lee.
