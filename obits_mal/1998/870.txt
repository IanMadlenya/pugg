        David Craig, a singing teacher whose students included many stars of film and stage musicals, died on  Aug. 28 at Tarzana Regional Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 75 and lived in Studio City, Calif.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter, Miranda.
        Mr. Craig developed a widely praised technique for performing in musical theater. The actress Lee Grant, for one, called him ''a master at creating exercises that released talent.''
        Among those who studied with him were Roddy McDowall, Cyd Charisse, Barbara Harris, Lucille Ball, Raquel Welch, Tony Roberts and Cicely Tyson.
        After attending the Juilliard School and City College in Manhattan, Mr. Craig began teaching in 1948. He was on the faculty of Carnegie-Mellon University in 1986-87 and taught most recently at the University of California at Los Angeles.
        In 1952, he was arranger and music coordinator for Ira Gershwin and George S. Kaufman for the first Broadway revival of the musical ''Of Thee I Sing.'' His Broadway credits also included ''Phoenix '55'' and ''Copper and Brass.''
        He was the author of ''On Singing Onstage,'' ''On Performing: A Handbook for Actors, Dancers and Singers'' and ''A Performer Prepares.''
        Mr. Craig's wife, the actress Nancy Walker, died in 1992. He is survived by his daughter, of Studio City.
