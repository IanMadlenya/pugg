        Richard Boswell Finn, a former naval intelligence officer, diplomat and scholar of Japanese affairs, died on Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 80 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Finn was the author of ''Winners in Peace: MacArthur, Yoshida and Postwar Japan'' (University of California Press, 1992), and edited a ''U.S.-Japan Relations'' series issued by Transaction Publications.
        Mr. Finn was born in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and graduated from Harvard College in 1939 and from Harvard Law School in 1942. He attended the Navy's Japanese language school in Boulder, Colo., entered Naval Intelligence, then became a Foreign Service Officer and remained in Japan until 1954.
        Later he was an adjunct professor at American University and administered Harvard's United States-Japan Program from 1983 to 1987. The Japanese Government awarded him an imperial decoration in 1987.
        Mr. Finn is survived by his wife of 56 years, Dallas Rumsey Finn; two daughters, Allison Finn of Tallahassee, Fla., and Vaughan Finn of West Hartford; and four grandsons.
