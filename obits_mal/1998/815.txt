        Richards Ruben, an abstract painter and teacher, died on July 21 in Venice, where he was teaching in the summer art program of the Pratt Institute. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Gail Divan, said.
        Mr. Ruben's heavily worked surfaces tended to be dominated by one color and one shape, a burly, wedgelike form that seemed to emerge from a field of brushwork. Neither geometric nor gestural, his style aligned him with the second generation of Abstract Expressionism.
        He was born in Los Angeles in 1925 and after serving in the United States Army from 1942 to 1944, returned there to study art at the Chouinard Art Institute. In the 1950's and early 60's, he was part of the growing Los Angeles art world, exhibiting his work at two of its most prominent galleries, Paul Kantor and Ferus. He moved to New York in the early 1960's, exhibiting at the Poindexter Gallery.
        Mr. Ruben's teaching career began in the late 1940's and included stints at Chouinard, the Pasadena Art Museum, Pomona College, Claremont Graduate School, Cooper Union, New York University, Columbia University and Pratt.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Ruben is survived by their daughter, Caitlin Feron of Sag Harbor, N.Y.; a son from his first marriage, John Ruben of Austin, Tex., and one grandchild.
