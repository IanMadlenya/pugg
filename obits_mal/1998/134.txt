        Alfred Edward Maumenee, director emeritus of the Wilmer Eye Institute at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, died on Jan. 18 at his home in Port Clear, Ala. He was 84 and lived in Stevenson, Md., until his retirement in 1991.
        An eye surgeon and former William Holland Wilmer professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Dr. Maumenee was recognized internationally for advancing the prevention and treatment of eye disease in more than four decades of teaching and research. He introduced the use of fluorescein dye injections, which became a widely used technique for examining the interior of the eye.
        He was noted for studies of congenital glaucoma, the blood vessel supply to the optic nerve, and uveitis, an inflammation of the eye's middle layer. He classified disorders affecting the macula, in the center of the eye, and discovered an important immune response involved in rejection of tissue grafts, which helped make corneal transplants more successful.
        Born in Mobile, Ala., he graduated from the University of Alabama and Cornell University Medical School. He headed the Wilmer Eye Institute from 1955 to 1979, taught more future chiefs of ophthalmology departments than anyone else in the world and gained a reputation as one of the world's foremost corneal transplant and cataract surgeons.
        He was the author of some 250 scientific papers and five textbooks. He played a crucial role in the creation of a nationwide network of eye banks and the founding of the Eye Institute at the National Institutes of Health in 1968.
        Dr. Maumenee is survived by his wife, Sue Ballard Maumenee; a daughter and three sons from two earlier marriages, Anne Elizabeth Nelson of Easton, Md., Alfred E. 3d of Daphne, Ala., and Niels K. and Nicholas R., both of Baltimore; a brother, Radcliff, also of Daphne, and four grandchildren.
