        Waldo Howland, a yacht builder and preservationist, died Feb. 26 at his home in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 89.
        After graduating from Harvard in 1930, Mr. Howland went to work at the Concordia Company of Padanaram, Mass. He rose to a leadership position and ran the company until his retirement in the late 1960's. The Concordia Yawls are among the most widely respected family racing and cruising yachts of this century, and many sailors learned their skills in the company's class of 12-foot boats known as Beetle Cats.
        Mr. Howland was one of the most senior members of the Royal Ocean Racing Club.
        In recent years, Mr. Howland was active at the Mystic Seaport Museum in Mystic, Conn., and became a member of the board of trustees in 1970. As chairman of the ship's committee of the seaport for many years, he was influential in supervising the preservation of some of the nation's most important wooden vessels.
        Mr. Howland wrote two books, ''A Life in Boats: The Years Before the War'' and ''A Life in Boats: The Concordia Years.'' A third book in the series is awaiting publication.
        He is survived by a brother, Llewellyn Howland Jr., of Westport, Mass.; five children, Charles Child Howland, Katherine Sue Means and Waldo Howland Jr., all of South Dartmouth, Mass., Kinnaird Howland of Providence, R.I., and Thomas Baker Howland of Tampa, Fla., and 13 grandchildren.
