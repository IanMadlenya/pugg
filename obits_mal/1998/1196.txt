        Miguel Angel Garcia Mendez, a former legislator in Puerto Rico and lifelong champion of statehood for the island commonwealth, died in a hospital in Mayaguez, P.R., on Nov. 17, his 96th birthday.
        Mr. Garcia Mendez, a former Speaker of the Puerto Rican House of Representatives, helped found the Statehood Republican Party in 1948. The organization was a forerunner of the pro-statehood New Progressive Party.
        Gov. Pedro J. Rossello, the party's current head, declared a three-day period of official mourning. At the Governor's urging, Puerto Ricans will take another nonbinding vote on the status of the island on Dec. 13.
        Mr. Garcia Mendez was born in Aguadilla in the island's northwest. He served in Puerto Rico's House of Representatives from 1932 to 1940 and became its youngest leader. He was later elected senator.
        A prominent lawyer and businessman, he founded Western Bank. He also owned El Imparcial, a newspaper that is defunct.
        Mr. Garcia Mendez is survived by two daughters. His wife, Freddery Ramirez de Arellano, died some years ago.
