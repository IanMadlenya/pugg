        William M. Cafaro, an entrepreneur who turned a 1940's investment in a property in Youngstown, Ohio, into one of the nation's biggest real estate development companies, died at his office in Youngstown on Wednesday, a company spokesman said. He was 84 and lived in Youngstown.
        The Cafaro Company, which Mr. Cafaro created, is among the 10 largest commercial real estate developers in the nation, and has close ties with retailers like J. C. Penney and Sears that typically anchor shopping centers and malls.
        Along with the late Edward J. DeBartolo Sr., who lived in nearby Boardman, Ohio, Mr. Cafaro was one of the first to see the economic possibilities of shopping centers and strip malls. (Mr. DeBartolo died in 1994.)
        Along with his brother John, Mr. Cafaro built his first strip mall in the late 1940's. His company also constructed some of the first enclosed shopping malls in the country, including the American Mall in Lima, Ohio, built in 1965. His company eventually developed more than 70 commercial properties.
        All of this business made Mr. Cafaro a wealthy man. Forbes magazine estimated last year that he was worth $800 million.
        Born in Youngstown, Mr. Cafaro  went to work in the tube mills of Republic Steel at age 17, rising to the position of shift foreman.
        Proceeds from his first real estate investment were used for other business ventures, including a car dealership in Warren, Ohio.
        In 1950 he built supermarkets for the Kroger Company in Barberton, Ohio, and in Akron. Other, more ambitious projects quickly followed.
        Mr. Cafaro is survived by two sons, Anthony M. Cafaro of Vienna, Ohio, and John J. Cafaro of Liberty, Ohio; a daughter, Flora Cafaro of Brookfield, Ohio; a sister, Mrs. Helene Griffith of San Diego, and seven grandchildren. His wife, the former Alyce Prystash, died in 1996.
