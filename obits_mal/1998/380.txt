        Phil R. North, a journalist and former president, chairman and chief executive of the Tandy Corporation between 1978 and 1981, died Sunday in All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth, after a long illness. He was 79.
        A journalist with The Fort Worth Star-Telegram from 1937 to 1962, Mr. North rose from reporter to executive editor and general manager.
        After retiring from the newspaper, Mr. North joined Tandy, founded by Charles Tandy, his boyhood friend.
        When Mr. Tandy died unexpectedly in 1978, Mr. North was named chairman of the company four days later. ''If I had to describe how I got here,'' he said after he was named chairman, ''I would have to say I was in the right place at the right time.''
        Survivors include his wife, Janis Harris North; two daughters, Mairin North Terry and Deirdre North Wilson of Fort Worth; a son, Kerry C.L. North of Dallas, and seven grandchildren.
