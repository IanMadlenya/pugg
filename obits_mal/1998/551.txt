        Ted Dunbar, a jazz guitarist who performed with some of the leading musicians of his day, died on May 29  at a hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 61 and lived in Kendall Park, N.J.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, said Ethel Wells, a friend.
        In the early 1960's, Mr. Dunbar began to make a national name for himself, substituting for the guitarist Wes Montgomery. By the mid-1960's, Mr. Dunbar had moved to New York and allied himself with some of the bigger, more adventurous names in jazz, working and performing with Gil Evans in the early 1970's and taking part in another ground-breaking group, Tony Williams's Lifetime.  He also worked with artists including Sonny Rollins, McCoy Tyner, Roy Haynes and Jimmy Heath.
        Mr. Dunbar's sound was warm and clean, and he borrowed some of Mr. Montgomery's technique. But he had his own ideas, and his solos regularly used both modern harmonies and blues motifs.
        In 1972, Mr. Dunbar became a professor of jazz at Livingston College at Rutgers University, where he taught, among others, the guitarist Kevin Eubanks. During his teaching career he maintained a busy recording schedule. He also continued to practice pharmacy, his first profession, along with numerology and astrology. He also wrote books on jazz harmony and guitar technique.
        He is survived by two daughters, Anita Kelly of Plano, Tex., and Natalie Dunbar of Pasadena, Calif., seven grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
