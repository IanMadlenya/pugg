        Louis K. Sher, a movie exhibitor who pioneered the showing of foreign films, died on Nov. 25 in Phoenix, Ariz. He was 84.
        Mr. Sher opened his first movie theater in 1954 in Columbus, Ohio, and made foreign films his specialty. He eventually built a national chain called the Art Theater Guild, which at one time included more than 50 theaters. In addition to foreign films, Mr. Sher showed the work of Andy Warhol and Shirley Clark as well as the early films of George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese. He was a key figure in the obscenity trial involving Louis Malle's 1958 film ''The Lovers,'' which brought a ruling by the United States Supreme Court that the film was not pornographic.
        He was also the producer or co-producer of shows for Broadway, including the musical ''Shenandoah.''  Born and raised in Columbus, Mr. Sher attended Ohio State University. He served in the United States Army during World War II and was awarded the Bronze Star.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen; four children from his first marriage, Larry of Los Gatos, Calif., Robert of Phoenix, Linda Dunn of Chicago and Nancy Beigel Sher of New York; a stepdaughter, Cathy Smith Sapin; a stepson, Michael Tash; 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
