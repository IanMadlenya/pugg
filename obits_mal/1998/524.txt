        Philip Hardy Rhodes, a yacht designer of sailboats as diverse as modern ocean racers and topsail schooners, died May 5 at Middlesex Hospital in Middletown, Conn. He was 72.
        Mr. Rhodes, who lived in Oyster Bay, N.Y., died of cancer, said Paul D. Barefoot, a family friend.
        Besides his design work, Mr. Rhodes, who was known as Bodie to friends, was also an engineer and lifelong sailor. From 1952 to 1966, he worked with his father, Philip L. Rhodes, a noted New York naval architect, in the family boat-design business. Together they worked on plans for Weatherly, the 12-Meter yacht that successfully defended the America's Cup in 1962. His father died in 1974.
        From 1966 to 1983, Mr. Rhodes worked at McCurdy and Rhodes, a naval architecture firm in Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., that he founded with a partner, James McCurdy, who died in 1994. Among the yachts he helped develop were three versions of the sailboat Carina, an ocean racer that in its third variation, a 48-foot sloop, won the 1970 Newport to Bermuda Race. He was also a designer of Bill of Rights, a 95-foot topsail schooner, and the boat's sister ship, Harvey Gamage.
        In 1987, Mr. Rhodes took a position as an engineer at Oyster Bay Pump Works.
        He is survived by three daughters, Robin Buchanan of Claremont, Calif.; Mary Jo Rhodes of Hoboken, N.J., and Renee H. Rhodes of Chester, Conn., and five grandchildren.
