        Robert Griffin, a retired track coach at Florida A&M University who helped guide the career of the sprinter Bob Hayes, died last Wednesday at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital in Florida. Griffin, who lived in Tallahassee, was 81.
        The cause was a stroke, his wife, Charlotte, said.
        Griffin, who was known as Pete, was the star center of the Florida A&M football team that was undefeated, untied and unscored on in 1938.
        In the fall of 1960, as an assistant to the football coach, Jake Gaither, Griffin was impressed by Hayes's speed and talked him into running for the university's track team.
        In less than two years, Hayes had become the world's top-ranked sprinter, setting a world record of 9.1 seconds for the 100-yard dash in 1963.
        Hayes went on to win Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter dash and the 400-meter relay at the 1964 Games in Tokyo before beginning an 11-year career as a star wide receiver for the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys.
        After Griffin's retirement from active coaching in 1976, he continued to do volunteer work for the Y.M.C.A. and the Red Cross, where he taught swimming, cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first-aid courses for more than 50 years.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Leslie Griffin Whitter, of Tampa, Fla., and two grandchildren.
