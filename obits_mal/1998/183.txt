        Woody Romoff, who moved effortlessly for a half-century between the worlds of Broadway and light opera, died on Jan. 20 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan, just down the block from his former apartment. He was 79.
        One of four sons born to Romanian and Hungarian parents in New York, Mr. Romoff told an interviewer that when he got out of the United States Army in 1945, he was too frightened to look for a job, so he enrolled in Sanford Meisner's acting school at the Neighborhood Playhouse.
        Two years later, he joined the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va., where he worked until 1951, acting in 60 plays. He ''worked for nothing but toothpaste money and room and board,'' he said, but ''I learned to be an actor.''
        Back in Manhattan, Mr. Romoff appeared on Broadway in ''Romanoff and Juliet'' (1956), ''She Loves Me'' (1963), ''Barefoot in the Park'' (1963), ''Cafe Crown'' (1964), ''Cantorial'' (1989) and other shows. He also performed in regional productions and touring companies.
        His second love was operetta, particularly Gilbert and Sullivan, and he appeared during the years in ''The Student Prince,'' ''The Merry Widow,'' ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' and other works, performing with the Houston Grand Opera, the Cleveland Opera and other companies.
        He is survived by two brothers, Colin, of Manhattan, and Albert, of Coconut Creek, Fla.
        ''I went to work in '46 and never stopped,'' Mr. Romoff told an interviewer in 1989, when he was appearing on Broadway in ''Cantorial'' at age 70. ''I was one of those lucky actors; I never had to leave the theater to do anything else.''
