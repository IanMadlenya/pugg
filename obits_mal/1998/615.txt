        Walter Gold, a songwriter and music producer, died on June 7 at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. He was 70.
        The cause was colitis, his wife, Fredda, said.
        Mr. Gold, who wrote songs as Wally Gold, was born in Brooklyn. After Navy service in World War II, he sang in a quartet, the Four Esquires, before becoming a songwriter.
        In 1960 he and his partner, Aaron Schroeder, wrote ''It's Now or Never,'' which was recorded by Elvis Presley and became a No. 1 hit. In 1963 Mr. Gold wrote ''It's My Party'' with John Gluck Jr. and Herb Wienner, and it became a best seller for Lesley Gore. Later Mr. Gold worked as a record producer.
