        Theodore Apstein, a writer for theater, films and television, died on July 26 in Los Angeles. He was 80 and lived in Brentwood, Calif.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Apstein's theater work included ''The Innkeepers,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1956. Directed by Jose Quintero, the play starred Geraldine Page and Darren McGavin as a husband and wife who leave the United States for Mexico after he is deemed a security risk and is dismissed from his job.
        Another play, ''Come Share My House,'' was produced Off Broadway in 1960. He also wrote several screenplays, including ''Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice?,'' with Ms. Page, Ruth Gordon and Mildred Dunnock; ''Baffled,'' with Leonard Nimoy, and ''The Link,'' with Michael Moriarty and Geraldine Fitzgerald.
        He was also a prolific writer for television, with more than 100 shows to his credit. He wrote original scripts for such series as ''Studio One,'' ''Alcoa Playhouse,'' ''Dr. Kildare,'' ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' and ''The Waltons.''
        Mr. Apstein taught play writing at Columbia University and play analysis at the American Theater Wing before joining the faculty at the University of Southern California at Berkeley, where he taught the master class in the graduate play writing program for 27 years.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia Elliott Apstein; two daughters, Catherine Ertel of Los Angeles and Susan Apstein of Phildelphia; three sons, Elliott, Norman and Michael, all of Los Angeles; a sister, Consuelo Patargo of Mexico City, and 11 grandchildren.
