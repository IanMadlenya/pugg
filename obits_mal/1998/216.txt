        Joseph E. Marine, a Democratic State Senator from the North Bronx in the 1960's, died on Jan. 25 at the Oakwood Health Facility in Amherst, N.Y. He was 92 and had lived in Oceanside, N.Y., after his stint in Albany.
        Mr. Marine entered the Senate in 1960, representing the borough's Wakefield and Woodlawn sections. Before that, he spent 21 years in the City Comptroller's Office and four more as executive assistant to Lieut. Gov. George B. DeLuca in Albany.
        Redistricting cut short his political career in 1965, when he defied orders from former Representative Charles A. Buckley, the Bronx Democratic boss. Mr. Marine lost the Democratic primary that year.
        He was born in Manhattan, and he received his education at De Witt Clinton High School, the School of Public Administration of New York University and what was then Pace Institute. He had to drop out to help his family through the Depression and began to work as a claims adjuster in the Comptroller's Office.
        To make ends meet, he worked part time selling tickets at Yankee Stadium. He did well enough for the Yankees to appoint him their ticket manager, a job he did from 1946 to 1951.
        After his Senate experience, he left the Bronx for Long Island to become an executive and controller of the Hallen Construction Company of Garden City, a company involved in airport fuel systems and land development projects. He retired in 1974.
        His wife, Josephine Del Genio Marine, died last February. They were married 65 years. Mr. Marine is survived by their son, Dr. Edward Marine of Buffalo; his sister, Rachel Salerno of Bethpage, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
