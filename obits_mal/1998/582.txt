        Reg Smythe, the British cartoonist who invented the internationally popular character Andy Capp and drew  comic strips about him for more than four decades, died on Saturday  at his home in Hartlepool in northeastern England. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, Reuters reported.
        Mirror Group Newspapers in London began publishing the ''Andy Capp'' strip in 1957. Ken Layson, the cartoon editor of The Mirror, said, ''Reg was so prolific, there is at least a year's supply of cartoons left.''
        Born Reginald Smyth, the cartoonist added an ''e'' to his last name and used Reg Smythe and Reginald Smythe as pseudonyms. Andy Capp, a deep-dyed member of the working class, was reportedly based on the cartoonist or his father. Andy's long-suffering wife, Flo, was based on Mr. Smythe's mother.
        Mr. Smythe told an interviewer in 1990 that the comic strip was syndicated to as many as 1,600 newspapers in about 57 countries -- 1,000 in the United States alone -- and that 200 million readers followed Andy's antics every day.
        Andy has been described as a friendly and familiar fellow, but also a crude, lazy, irresponsible, beer-guzzling, woman-chasing, wife-beating one. He is instantly recognizable by his ever-present floppy cloth cap, pulled down over his eyes. When a cheeky interviewer asked Mr. Smythe in 1990 about the possibility of Andy appearing without the cap, Mr. Smythe was not pleased. ''Preposterous,'' he said. ''That would be like Groucho without his mustache, the Lone Ranger without his mask. I couldn't believe anybody could be so stupid.''
        Mr. Smythe spent his childhood in Hartlepool, went to Galleys Field School there and was in the British Army from 1936 to 1945. Later he worked as a civilian clerk and began cartooning part time. Mr. Smythe faxed his cartoons from Hartlepool to The Mirror, which has been publishing them daily.
        In 1949 Mr. Smythe married Vera Toyne, who died in 1997.
