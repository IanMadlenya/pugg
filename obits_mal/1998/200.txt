        Arthur Cohn, a versatile and prolific composer, conductor and author whose books and articles celebrated the diversity of classical music and made it accessible to a large audience, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        As an author, Mr. Cohn was best known for his writing on contemporary music. Two of his books, ''The Collector's 20th-Century Music in the Western Hemisphere'' (1961) and ''20th-Century Music in Europe'' (1965), were long considered the standard texts on the post-Debussy repertory.
        He also had a more direct hand in the promotion of modern works in several positions as a music publishing executive. Mr. Cohn directed the concert music divisions at Mills Music from 1956 to 1966, at MCA Music from 1966 to 1972, and at the Carl Fischer Company, which he joined in 1972 and where he remained as a consultant.
        Many contemporary composers, including some whom Mr. Cohn's firms did not publish, considered him an encouraging and powerful advocate, and when he believed strongly in the music, he took risks on their behalf. Most notably, he smuggled the scores of Shostakovich's 13th, 14th and 15th Symphonies out of the Soviet Union and helped to arrange for their American premieres and first recordings. In 1994, the American Music Center awarded him a Letter of Distinction for his contributions to the field.
        Recordings were Mr. Cohn's other principal fascination. After working as a reviewer for the American Record Guide for many years, he compiled ''Recorded Classical Music: A Critical Guide to Compositions and Performances,'' a tremendous tome that was published in 1981 and won a Deems Taylor Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1982.
        Besides his books on contemporary music and recordings, Mr. Cohn published two books of musical puzzles, ''Musical Quizzical'' (1970) and ''Musical Mind Benders'' (1988). His last work, the four-volume, 3,000-page ''Literature of Chamber Music,'' is to be published in April.
        Mr. Cohn was born in Philadelphia in 1910 and studied the violin and composition at the Combs Conservatory of Music there, as well as at the University of Pennsylvania and the Juilliard School, where his composition teacher was Rubin Goldmark. From 1934 to 1952 he headed the Fleisher Music Collection at the Free Library of Philadelphia, and the library's music division. From 1952 to 1956, he was director of the Settlement Music School of Philadelphia.
        As a performer, he founded the Dorian Quartet and the Stringart Quartet, ensembles that specialized in new music, in the 1930's. He was for many years the conductor of the orchestra of the Symphony Club of Philadelphia and the Haddonfield Symphony Orchestra in New Jersey.
        Mr. Cohn's symphonic works included ''Music for Ancient Instruments,'' a concerto for five antique instruments with a modern orchestra (1939), a Flute Concerto (1941), Variations for Clarinet, Saxophone and Strings (1945), ''Kaddish'' (1964) and a Percussion Concerto (1970). Among his chamber scores were ''Machine Music'' for two pianos (1937), six string quartets composed between 1928 and 1945, and ''Quotations in Percussion,'' for six musicians to play on 103 instruments (1958).
        He is survived by his wife, Lois, the director of marketing and public relations for the New York Philharmonic; a daughter, Leslie Cohn Hettle of Cedar Falls, Iowa, and a son, Alan, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
