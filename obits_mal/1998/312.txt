        Paul Oberkotter, a former chief executive of the United Parcel Service, died on March 16 at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 93.
        In 1925, Mr. Oberkotter began his career at U.P.S., then a fledgling package delivery outfit, as a stenographer-clerk. A native of Chadron, Neb., who moved to New York in 1938, Mr. Oberkotter had a high school education and learned the logistics of the delivery business on the job. He rose through the ranks and is credited with playing a significant role in guiding U.P.S. through tremendous expansion.
        He was president of the company for 10 years until 1972, when he was named chairman and chief executive. He served in that capacity for only a year, but remained as chairman of the company's executive committee until 1980 and continued to serve on its board of directors until 1994. When he resigned from the board he had been a director for 51 years.
        Mr. Oberkotter is survived by his daughter, Mildred L., of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter-in-law, Joyce Oberkotter, widow of his son, Robert, of Newport, N.H.; three grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren. His wife, Louise, died in 1987.
