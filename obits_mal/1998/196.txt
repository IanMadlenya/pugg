        Richard S. West, a former member of Lloyd's of London in the United States, died Feb. 3 at his home in Wenham, Mass. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Ruth.
        Mr. West and his partner, Allan D. Parker, became members of Lloyd's of London in 1968, and founded Lloyd's, Parker & West, an American affiliate of the British insurance concern, in Boston. Mr. West served as chairman in North America for the Association of Lloyd's Members, and helped the parent institution reorganize in 1994. He retired in 1997.
        Mr. West graduated from Harvard College in 1947. He and Mr. Parker started an insurance brokerage firm in 1960, which they sold in 1967 before joining Lloyd's.
        Mr. West is survived by his wife, of Wenham; three daughters, Jennifer, of Cumberland, Me., Ruth, of Leverett, Mass., and Emily, of Boston; two sons, Angus, of Wenham, and Gifford, of New York City, and three grandchildren.
