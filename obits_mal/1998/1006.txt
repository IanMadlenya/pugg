        Joseph P. Kearney, a senior vice president for the PG & E Corporation who built it into one of the largest independent power producing companies in the nation, died Oct. 3 of a heart attack. He was 52 years old and lived in Tiburon, Calif.
        Mr. Kearney, who had been a track star while in college, died while jogging in Washington.
        He was chosen to head the U.S. Generating Company in 1989 when Pacific Gas and Electric, the largest utility in the nation, decided to form the unit to get into the growing field of independent power plants. The utility is a subsidiary of PG & E, which is based in San Francisco.
        Mr. Kearney received a Bachelor of Science degree from Manhattan College and a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        He is survived by his wife, Michele; one son, Michael, both of Tiburon; his mother, Mary Agnes, of Brooklyn, and three brothers, John T., of McLean, Va., and James and Kevin, of New York.
