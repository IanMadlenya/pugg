        Ben C. Morris, a professor of fashion design at the Savannah College of Art and Design who had an earlier career as a fashion illustrator, died on Jan. 5 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah, Ga. He was 67 and lived in Savannah.
        The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the college, whose faculty Mr. Morris joined in 1983.
        Mr. Morris, a native of De Funiak Springs, Fla., received a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1971, where he majored in fine arts, and a master's degree in social work in 1976. Before moving to Savannah, he taught at Parsons School of Design, the Art Students League of New York and Florida State University.
        Mr. Morris began his first career as a design assistant at the Givenchy fashion house in Paris and with Lily Dache of New York. His fashion illustrations appeared in Women's Wear Daily and The New York Times, among other publications, and his clients as a freelance artist included Elizabeth Arden and Lord & Taylor.
        He is survived by his companion, Don Mondanaro of Savannah.
