        Nat Bassen, the founder and chief executive of a chain of fabric stores and an important donor to charitable causes, died on Aug. 11 at his home in Melville, L.I. He was 66.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Victoria Schneps, his fiancee.
        Mr. Bassen founded the chain, Fabric Bonanza, in 1957. It has 21 outlets in the New York City region.
        Charities that he assisted included the Working Organization for Retarded Children and Adults and the Midway Jewish Center on Long Island.
        In addition to his fiancee, of Melville, he is survived by two sons, Todd, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and Mitchell, of East Northport, L.I.; a daughter, Gail Seiden of Port Washington, L.I.,; his mother, Gertrude, also of Port Washington, and six grandchildren.
