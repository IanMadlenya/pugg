        Dr. Martin D. S. Braine, a professor of cognitive psychology at New York University who researched the acquisition of language by children as well as the thinking and reasoning of children and adults, died on April 6 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 69 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At his death, he remained active in teaching, research and writing. With his co-author, David O'Brien, he was nearing completion of "Mental Logic," a book presenting new theoretical developments relating language acquisition to thinking and reasoning. It is scheduled to be published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, an N.Y.U. spokeswoman, Phyllis Gillis, said.
        Dr. Braine was born in Kuala Lumpur, where his father worked as a civil engineer. He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from Birmingham University in England and in psychology from the University of London. He received a Ph.D. in psychology from N.Y.U. in 1957, and worked as a researcher at Downstate Medical Center of of the State University of New York before joining the faculty of N.Y.U. in 1971.
        He was the author of many scholarly articles. Recent articles described his study of the logical structures that make human language and thought possible. He proposed that both share a "syntax of thought," and that the types of inferences people make while reading and speaking reflect a universal mental logic that is part of all natural languages.
        He is survived by his wife, Lila Rosenzveig Braine, a psychology professor at Barnard College; a son, Jonathan, of Grenoble, France; a daughter, Naomi Braine  of Brooklyn; and two grandchildren.
