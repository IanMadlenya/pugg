        Leon Schwab, co-founder of the Sunset Boulevard pharmacy that was a meeting place for Hollywood stars and would-be stars from the 1930's through the 1950's, died on Thursday in Harbor South Medical Center in Los Angeles County. He was 85.
        The cause was complications after surgery for a broken hip, said Rick Latman, a grandson who lives in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Schwab and his three brothers owned seven Schwabs' Pharmacies, including two in Beverly Hills and the one in Hollywood frequented by actors, including Marilyn Monroe, Ronald Reagan and Charlie Chaplin, who would step behind the counter to make his own sodas.
        Mr. Schwab once told an interviewer that the actress Gloria Swanson bought her makeup from him. The drugstore's lunch counter was also part of an enduring  story that Lana Turner had been discovered there while still in high school. Miss Turner later denied the story.
        The counter was also a favorite gathering place for would-be stars and for tourists hoping for a glimpse of a movie star.
        After financial difficulties, the pharmacy closed in 1983 after 52 years as a Hollywood landmark. It was the last of the brothers' pharmacies to survive. Mr.  Schwab said at the time: "It's a tough decision to make, but everything comes to an end."
        Mr. Schwab and his brothers began their pharmacy business in Los Angeles in the 1920's. Two of Mr. Schwab's brothers, Jack and Martin, died many years ago.  He is survived a third brother, Bernard, who lives in Los Angeles.
        His other survivors include a daughter, Lynne Latman of Los Angeles; two sons, Norman, of Los Angeles and Kent, of Nashville, and six grandchildren.
