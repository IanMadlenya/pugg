        George Barati, a Hungarian-born composer, conductor and cellist who came to the United States in 1938 and played in a faculty string quartet with Albert Einstein at Princeton University, died on June 22 at the Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, Calif. He was 83 and lived in Soquel, Calif.
        Mr. Barati had been found unconscious with severe head injuries in downtown Los Gatos, Calif., on June 11, and had been unconscious since then, said a spokeswoman for the Santa Clara County Coroner's Office.
        Mr. Barati was born in Gyor, Hungary, on April 3, 1913. He studied composition with Zoltan Kodaly and Leo Weiner at the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest, and with Roger Sessions at Princeton.
        He was the principal cellist in the Budapest Symphony Orchestra from 1935 until he left Hungary.
        He was also a founder of the Pro Ideale Quartet, which changed its name to the Westminster Quartet when its members emigrated and settled in Princeton.
        Mr. Barati taught music at Princeton, at the New Jersey State Teacher's College and at the Westminster Choir College in the early 1940's. He also conducted several local ensembles in Princeton, as well as military orchestras during his Army service, from 1943 to 1945. In 1946, he joined the cello section of the San Francisco Symphony, for which he also conducted in 1948 and 1949. He  left the orchestra in 1950, when he was appointed music director of the Honolulu Symphony, a post he held until 1967.
        During the 1970's, Mr. Barati was music director of the Santa Cruz Symphony Orchestra in California. He also toured as a guest conductor, and composed more  than 50 symphonic works, concertos and chamber pieces.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, George, and a daughter, Donna, all of California.
