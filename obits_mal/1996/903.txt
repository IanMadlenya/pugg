        Arthur E. DePhillips, a former judge on New York City's Municipal Court and its successor, the Civil Court, died on Tuesday at Long Island College Hospital  in Brooklyn. He was 86, and a lifelong resident of Greenwich Village in Manhattan.
        Judge DePhillips graduated from Fordham University and Law School and worked  for the city as a lawyer handling condemnation proceedings. He then went into private practice, specializing in real estate.  A Democrat, he was elected to the Manhattan Municipal Court with Republican support in 1954 and moved to Civil Court a few years later when the city's court systems merged. He was re-elected, but left the bench in 1972 and went back to private practice. He returned to the courts as a judicial hearing officer.
        He is survived by his son, Guy P. DePhillips of Woodside, Queens, the presiding judge of Queens Family Court; two daughters, Cecilia, of Greenwich Village, and Barbara Bannon of Wantaugh, L.I., and two grandchildren.
