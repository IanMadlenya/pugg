        Charles F. Bressler, a tenor who appeared in numerous recital, oratorio and opera performances in New York City and around the world, died on Thursday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Bressler was a favorite soloist with many local choruses, including the New York Pro Musica Antiqua, the Cantata Singers, the Collegiate Chorale and Musica Sacra. In a 1986 review of Musica Sacra's performance of Bach's ''St. John Passion,'' Bernard Holland wrote in The New York Times, ''Charles Bressler's Evangelist was splendid, expressive musically and leaping fearlessly into Bach's intricate shifts in key.''
        He was born in Kingston, Pa., and studied organ, piano and voice at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. He sang with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic and performed for the openings of both the Kennedy Center in Washington and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. He also sang with the Chicago Symphony, the Atlanta Symphony and the Orchestre de Paris, as well as the Santa Fe and San Francisco operas.
        He earned the Best Male Singer Award from the Theatre des Nations Festival in Paris for the title role in New York Pro Musica's production of ''The Play of Daniel.''
        Mr. Bressler taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts, Brooklyn College, the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and recorded for several labels.
        He is survived by two sisters, Norine Germick of Dallas, Pa. and Phalm Price of Kingston, and a brother, Monroe, of Millville, N.J.
