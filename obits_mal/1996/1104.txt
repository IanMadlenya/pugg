        James Elward, a writer who enjoyed an unusual publishing success when he finished a half-written novel after the death of its better-known original author, Helen Van Slyke, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his brother, Paul.
        The book went on to be a best seller bearing both their names. Mrs. Van Slyke died at 59 in 1979, leaving behind an outline and the unfinished manuscript of what was to have been her 10th novel. Her editor at Harper & Row, Lawrence P. Ashmead, recalled in a 1982 interview: ''It was a book that was very close to Helen, very autobiographical. I thought it deserved finishing if I could find the right writer.''
        He interviewed many candidates and turned them all down because he did not think they could capture the style and spirit of Mrs. Van Slyke, a Helena Rubenstein vice president. ''Then I thought of James Elward, who had written some gothic novels under a pseudonym at Doubleday,'' Mr. Ashmead recalled. ''He studied all Helen's novels and then sat down and wrote the second half of the manuscript. It was letter-perfect.''
        The book, ''Public Smiles, Private Tears,'' was about a woman's rise in the world of retail fashion. One reviewer wrote, ''James Elward has done his assigned (and subservient) job commendably -- perhaps even with a bit more style and vitality than the author who was dying as she wrote.'' The novel was on the New York Times hard-cover fiction best-seller list for 14 weeks in 1982, rising to seventh place. In 1983 its paperback edition reached fifth place on the Times best-seller list of mass-market paperback books.
        Mr. Elward's many other writings included a back-street romance novel, a mystery novel, plays, television scripts and a one-act opera.
        A native of Chicago, he received a bachelor's degree in 1950 from Catholic University in Washington.
        He is survived by his brother, of Chicago.
