        Kenneth H. Lavey, a founder of Lavey/Wolff/Swift Inc., an advertising agency  specializing in pharmaceuticals, died on April 26 at his home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 72. The cause was heart failure, said a spokeswoman for BBDO Worldwide, the agency's parent company.
        Mr. Lavey worked for 46 years as an art director and creative director in advertising, and in 1972 he co-founded Lavey/Wolff/Swift. He was behind several  large drug introductions, including AZT, taken by people infected with the virus that causes AIDS; the antibiotic Cipro, and Tenormin, a hypertension medication.
        As a member of the Riverdale-Yonkers Society for Ethical Culture, Mr. Lavey  frequently did design work for the society, and he lectured on art and design at his alma mater, Pratt Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, Joann; a son, Neil, of Tarrytown, N.Y., and a grandson, Kenneth Wade.
