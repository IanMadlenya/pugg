        Jack Mognaz, the senior vice president of Marlborough Gallery in Manhattan, died last Sunday in Queens. He was 70 and had homes in Manhattan and at La Garde-Freinet on the French Riviera.
        He suffered a heart attack while playing tennis in Long Island City and was pronounced dead at a hospital in Queens.
        Mr. Mognaz was born in Brussels and came to the United States with his family as a teen-ager.
        Before joining Marlborough in 1972, Mr. Mognaz worked in the art department at Vogue magazine and was an executive at several luxury jewelry stores in Manhattan, including Tiffany's, Cartier and Bucherer of Switzerland.
        At Marlborough, he organized exhibitions of the works of Francis Bacon, Magdalena Abakanowicz, John Alexander and Arnaldo Pomodoro. He was in charge of a 1990's traveling exhibition of the works of Fernando Botero that opened in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Ann Fenton; a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, and a sister, Barbara Moore of London.
