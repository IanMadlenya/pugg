        David E. Thompson, a book artist and member of the Fluxus art movement who was better known as Davi Det Hompson, died on Dec. 8 at Chippenham Hospital in Richmond, Va. He was 57 and lived in Richmond.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Nancy.
        Mr. Thompson was born in Sharon, Pa., and raised in Warren, Ohio. He graduated from Anderson College in Anderson, Ind., and received a master's degree from Indiana University at Bloomington in 1967. In graduate school, he gravitated toward Fluxus, an association of artists influenced by Dada, Marcel Duchamp and others, and -- drawing on its playful, language-oriented spirit -- he redistributed the letters of his name.
        As an artist, Mr. Thompson worked in performance, video, installation and painting, but he was best known for his book art, which combined images and typographical invention with writing that bordered on poetry and was spiced with political awareness.
        He had more than 30 solo shows, including an exhibition at the Alexandre Iolas Gallery in Manhattan in 1972.
        Starting in 1979, he frequently collaborated with the artist Cliff Baldwin. Baldwin+Hompson, as they were known, published ''Aqui!,'' a poster periodical featuring their own work as well as that of the artists Gilbert and George, General Idea, Les Levine and Barbara Kruger. In 1989, Mr. Thompson was artist in residence at the Franklin Furnace, an alternative space in TriBeCa, where he organized an exhibition based on the many works of printed art in its collection.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Nathan Guy; his mother, Martha, of Xenia, Ohio, and his brothers Mark, also of Xenia, Tim, of Chicago, and Evan, of Marysville, Wash.
