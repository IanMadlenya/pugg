        Carl Adam Beam, a professor of biology at Brooklyn College for 25 years, died on Aug. 2 at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 76 and lived in Brooklyn. The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Beam, who retired from the college in 1988, taught courses in microbiology and conducted research on the biological factors affecting radiation sensitivity. Later his research focused on the genetics of dinoflagellates, a group of marine protozoa that can produce red tides.
        Over 20 years, he and his wife, Dr. Marion Himes of Brooklyn College's biology department, investigated the chromosome behavior, mutation and genetic variations of the organisms. The couple isolated different strains of flagellates, single-celled algae so called for their whiplike appearance.
        Dr. Beam was born in Olympia, Wash. He graduated from Brown University and received an M.S. and a Ph.D. from Yale. Before he joined the Brooklyn College faculty in 1963, he taught at the University of California at Berkeley and at Yale.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Beam is survived by a stepson, Steven Himes of Brooklyn; a stepdaughter, Pat Himes-Ferris of Portland, Ore., and two step-grandchildren.
