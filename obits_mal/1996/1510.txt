        Arnold B. Elkind, a New York lawyer who headed the National Commission on Product Safety, whose work helped lead to a landmark public-interest law, the Consumer Product Safety Act of 1972, died on Thursday at his home in San Diego. He was 80 and had lived in retirement in San Diego for eight years.
        The cause was cancer, his son, Victor, said.
        Mr. Elkind's commission issued a report that was considered a significant step toward greater protection of consumers from hazardous or substandard goods and services and from dishonest and unfair sales methods.
        He was a prominent trial lawyer who had handled many product liability cases and was active in consumer activities of the American Trial Lawyers Association when he named chairman of the seven-member commission by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968.
        In 1970, the commission called for the passage of what became the Consumer Product Safety Act and the creation of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which was established in 1973.
        In the foreword to the panel's report, Mr. Elkind wrote: ''We believe that, without effective governmental intervention, the abundance and variety of unreasonable hazards associated with consumer products cannot be reduced to a level befitting a just and civilized society.''
        Mr. Elkind was born in Yonkers and lived there for many years. He received a bachelor's degree in 1937 and a law degree in 1939 from New York University and practiced law in Manhattan for almost five decades. The firm of Elkind, Flynn & Maurer, which now has offices in Scarsdale, N.Y., and in Garden City, L.I., still bears his name.
        He was a co-editor of the textbook ''Federal Courtroom Evidence'' (3d edition 1994, Michie).
        In addition to his son, Victor, of San Diego, Arnold Elkind is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Joan Spiegel; a sister, Rhoda Greenwald of Tarrytown, N.Y.; two granddaughters and a great-grandson.
