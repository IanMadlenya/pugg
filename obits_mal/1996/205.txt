        Malcolm T. Wordell, a World War II fighter pilot who won three Distinguished  Flying Cross medals and graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis without a blemish on his record, died here on Monday. He was 84.
        Mr. Wordell, a retired Navy captain, led a flight of Navy fighters in an attack on French vessels in North Africa. He was captured by French forces aligned with the Axis powers, and was interned until the Vichy regime surrendered on Nov. 11, 1942. He went on to fight again and won several other medals, including the Purple Heart.
        Mr. Wordell's exploits were documented in a 1992 book, "Wildcats Over Casablanca."
        He was born in Dartmouth, Mass., the son and grandson of whaling captains, and enlisted in the Navy as a teen-ager in 1929. After two years of sea duty he  was appointed to the Naval Academy, and graduated without receiving a single demerit. An Arts and Entertainment cable channel documentary said Mr. Wordell was the only midshipman to graduate with that distinction.
        "People go through the Academy garnering all sorts of demerits," his son, Stephen, said in a newspaper interview. "Dad just never got caught. He was a perfectionist."
        In his civilian career Mr. Wordell managed airports, then went on to become a planning and beautification activist in La Mesa, Calif., where he settled in 1966.
        Besides his son, Stephen, Mr. Wordell is survived by his wife, Rush; a daughter, Susan Santini of Santa Barbara, Calif., four grandsons and a great-grandson.
