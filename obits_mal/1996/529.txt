        Howard Chandross, one of America's top-ranked bridge players, died yesterday  in Long Beach, L.I., where he lived. He was 50 years old.
        Mr. Chandross suffered a heart attack while driving to a bridge tournament, said his brother, Jeffrey Chandross of Oceanside, L.I.
        Mr. Chandross ranked 29th in master points among all American players, and was first among New York experts with about 18,000 career points. This made him  a Grand Life Master of the American Contract Bridge League, and he was a World Master in the rankings of the World Bridge Federation.
        The highlights of his playing career were second-place finishes in the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in 1987, the Life Master Men's Pairs in 1984 and the Master Mixed Teams in 1990. He won about 130 regional titles, 35 of them in 1991. That year he won 2,443 points, finishing third nationwide. His partnership with the late Jim Becker was one of the strongest in the country.
        At his death, Mr. Chandross was president of the Nassau-Suffolk Bridge Association.
        Mr. Chandross was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Hofstra University in 1968. Serious injuries from an auto accident in 1988 forced him to retire as a tax accountant, but did not stop him from pursuing his bridge career while in a  wheelchair.
        Besides his brother, Mr. Chandross is survived by his mother, Ruth Chandross, and a sister, Thea Garfinkle, both of Long Beach.
