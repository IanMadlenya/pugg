        Francisco M. Garcia, leader of the 1960's pop quartet Cannibal and the Headhunters, died on Jan. 21 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center. He was 49.
        His brother Albert said he had died after a long illness but provided no further details.
        Mr. Garcia and his group were best known for their hit recording "Land of 1,000 Dances," which reached No. 30 on Billboard's pop charts in 1965. The group, which stopped performing in the 1970's, was the opening act for the Beatles' 1965 United States tour. It also opened for the Temptations, the Miracles and the Supremes in the 1960's.
        In addition to his brother Albert, he is survived by his parents, three other siblings and his companion, Craig Duncan of Long Beach, Calif.
