        Brian Daley, the author of "The Doomfarers of Coramonde" and other works of fantasy and science fiction, including three "Star Wars" novels, died on Sunday  at his home in Arnold, Md., near Annapolis. He was 48.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Lucia St. Clair Robson.
        Mr. Daley was born in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. After serving in the Army in Vietnam and Germany from 1965 to 1969, he earned a bachelor's degree at Jersey City State College in 1974. He worked as a house painter, waiter and welfare case worker before publishing "The Doomfarers of Coramonde" (1977), about an Army unit that is transported from Vietnam to an alternate universe, where it must slay a dragon. The book's success led to a sequel, "The Starfollowers of Coramonde" (1979).
        Mr. Daley wrote three novels based on the film "Star Wars": "Han Solo at Stars' End" (1979), "Han Solo's Revenge" (1979) and "Han Solo and the Lost Legacy" (1980). The three titles were collected in "The Exploits of Han Solo" (1982). He also wrote radio versions of "Star Wars" and "The Empire Strikes Back" for National Public Radio.
        His other novels included "Tron" (1982), "A Tapestry of Magics" (1983) and three novels with the recurring characters Alacrity Fitzhugh and Hobart Floyt: "Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds" (1985), "Jinx on a Terran Inheritance" (1985) and "Fall of the White Ship Avatar" (1986).
        Under the name Jack McKinney, he wrote several novels in the Robotech and Sentinel series, as well as "Tales of the Black Hole Travel Agency," with James  Luceno. At the time of his death he was at work on a long science-fiction novel, "Gamma L.A.W.," and had completed a radio play for "Return of the Jedi."
        In addition to his wife, who is also a novelist, he is survived by his mother, Myra A. Daley of Rockleigh, N.J.; a sister, Myra DiBlasio of Norwood, N.J., and a brother, David, of Lacona, N.Y.
