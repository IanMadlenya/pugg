        Yoshinari Yamashiro, the chairman of the NKK Corporation, Japan's second-largest steelmaker, died Tuesday evening at the Keio University hospital  in Tokyo. He was 72.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, a company spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Yamashiro, a native of Niigata in northwestern Japan, joined NKK in 1947 after graduating from the faculty of law at the University of Tokyo.
        He became NKK's president in 1985 and held that post until 1992, when he became chairman. NKK, set up in 1912, holds a 70 percent stake in the National Steel Corporation of the United States.
        Mr. Yamashiro is survived by his wife, Tsune.
