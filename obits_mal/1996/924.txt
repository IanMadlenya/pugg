        John Panozzo, a co-founder and drummer of the rock group Styx, was found dead of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage in his home here on Tuesday, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said. He also suffered from cirrhosis of the liver as  a result of chronic alcoholism. He was 47.
        Mr. Panozzo, his brother Chuck, a bassist, and the vocalist and keyboardist Dennis DeYoung formed Styx in 1971 and released their first hit, "Lady," in 1975. The band then rode a wave of success that included four consecutive triple-platinum albums, "Grand Illusion," "Pieces of Eight," "Cornerstone" and "Paradise Theater," from 1977 to 1980. Platinum signifies more than a million copies sold.
        The band's biggest successes came with songs like "Babe," "Come Sail Away" and "Renegade."
        Styx faded after the release of its 1983 album "Kilroy Was Here." Mr. DeYoung and the guitarists Tommy Shaw and James Young left to pursue solo careers.
        All the band members except Mr. Shaw got back together in 1990 and made a comeback with the release of "Edge of the Century," followed by a successful 1991 tour.
        The band is on a 77-date tour this year, but Mr. Panozzo had been unable to join the tour because of poor health. He was replaced by Todd Sucherman.
