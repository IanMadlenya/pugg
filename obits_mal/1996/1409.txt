        Narciso Cardinal Jubany Arnau, who as Archbishop of Barcelona sought to keep his archdiocese at arm's length from the Franco Government during the 1970's, died Thursday at his home in Barcelona. He was 83.
        He became Archbishop of Barcelona in December 1971 and was elevated to Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in February 1973. In the waning years of Franco's right-wing dictatorship, Cardinal Jubany rarely took part in political acts at a time when it was still common for military, civilian and religious leaders to appear together in solidarity with Franco.
        In a noted case after Franco's death in 1975, Cardinal Jubany did not seek to excommunicate a priest who joined the Communist Party and won election as mayor of an industrial suburb of Barcelona. He simply asked the priest to give up his post as spiritual leader of his parish.
        Born Aug. 12, 1913, to a working-class family in the town of Santa Coloma de Farnes, Mr. Jubany moved to Barcelona at age 13 and undertook religious studies. He earned a doctorate in canon law from Gregorian University in Rome.
        He worked as a young priest in Barcelona, becoming an auxiliary bishop in Barcelona in 1956 and then Bishop of Gerona in 1964. He retired in 1990.
