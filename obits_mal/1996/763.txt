        Elsbeary Hobbs, the bass singer with the rhythm-and-blues vocal group the Drifters, died on May 31 at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. He was 59.
        The cause was throat and lung cancer, said Larry Marshak, his manager.
        Mr. Hobbs was born in Manhattan, where he joined the vocal group the Five Crowns, led by Ben E. King, in 1956.
        When the original lineup of the Drifters disbanded after five years, their manager, George Treadwell, recruited the Five Crowns to be the new Drifters and  started their career by teaming them with the songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike  Stoller.
        It was Mr. Hobbs's smooth bass that opened the band's first big hit, "There Goes My Baby," and powered subsequent hits establishing the band as a soul standard-bearer. These included "Save the Last Dance for Me" and "This Magic Moment."
        In 1960 Mr. Hobbs was drafted; he was in the Army for two years. Afterward, he returned to Manhattan, where he worked as a therapist at the Knickerbocker Hospital until the Drifters reassembled in 1969, led by the baritone Charles Thomas. Mr. Hobbs toured with them from that time on. (Another former Drifters member, Johnny Moore, led a rival lineup of the band in Britain simultaneously.)
        Mr. Hobbs was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame along with the Drifters in 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Odessa; a son, Gregory; a daughter, Evelyn, and a grandson, Lamar, all of Manhattan.
