        Pinhas Menachem Alter, one of Israel's rigorously Orthodox rabbis, died today in Jerusalem. He was 69.
        Rabbi Alter was found dead at his home. He was not known to be ill, and no cause of death was immediately announced.
        Born in Poland, he headed the Gerrer or Gur community, one of the most influential Hasidic groups in Israel. The Gur dynasty of rabbis was founded at Gora Kalwaria, near Warsaw, in 1859.
        Rabbi Alter was instrumental in preventing the entry of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism bloc into Israel's present Labor-led Government.
        Menachem Friedman, an expert on Hasidic Jewry at Bar-Ilan University, said Rabbi Alter never forgave Prime Minister Shimon Peres for forming a coalition with the left-wing secular Meretz bloc.
        "For him, the name of Shulamit Aloni was like a red rag to a bull," Mr. Friedman said, referring to the Meretz leader.
        Rabbi Alter is survived by a wife, four sons and a daughter.
