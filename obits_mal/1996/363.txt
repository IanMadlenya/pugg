        Harrison Smith, a retired New York banker long active in community affairs, died last Monday in a car accident in Surry, Me. He was 76 and lived in nearby Brooklin, Me., where he moved from Manhattan in 1986.
        His family said he lost control of his car when it swerved on an icy road.
        Mr. Smith, a graduate of Yale College, held senior executive positions at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company for almost 40 years. He retired in 1982 as an executive vice president. At his death, he was a member of the advisory board of Train, Smith Counsel, a New York investment advisory firm.
        A volunteer with educational organizations and social services groups, Mr. Smith also was a trustee of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Marlis Greve Smith; three daughters, Elizabeth S. Crow and Sarah H. Smith, both of Manhattan, and Anne S.  Tucker of Berwyn, Pa.; two sons, Oliver C., of Maplewood, N.J., and H. Spencer,  of Lee, N.H., and six grandchildren.
