        Robert J. McNulty, an original owner of the Minnesota North Stars and developer of the Metropolitan Sports Center, died on Sunday. He was 74.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        In 1966, Mr. McNulty was one of eight men who purchased a National Hockey League expansion franchise for the Twin Cities and set it up at the Met Center in Bloomington, which he designed and built.
        That building was demolished last year, two years after the franchise moved to Dallas.
        Mr. McNulty later helped develop the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit and the Cincinnati Coliseum.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen; three daughters, Marran Ruth McNulty, Jane McNulty Nestor and Cynthia McNulty Coughlin; two sons, R. James McNulty Jr. and  Timothy Patrick McNulty, a brother, two sisters and seven grandchildren.
