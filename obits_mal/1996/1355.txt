        Elmo Langley, a former race-car driver who achieved his greatest fame by circling race tracks at speeds more suitable to public roads, died yesterday in Suzuka General Hospital in Suzuka City, Japan, apparently of heart failure. He was 68.
        Mr. Langley, who was born in Maryland and lived in Harrisburg, N.C., was in Japan for a Nascar race to be run Sunday in Suzuka City. Although Mr. Langley won two major races before retiring in the early 1970's, he became more familiar to followers of the sport in the job he held for the last six years: pace-car driver for Nascar's Winston Cup series, the top division of stock car racing.
        Mr. Langley was responsible for making sure the drivers were properly lined up for the start of each race and for guiding them around speedways each time an accident required the track to be cleared.
        To do so, Mr. Langley would pull out in front of drivers such as Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty, who travel at speeds over 180 miles an hour, and drive at a leisurely 45 to 60 m.p.h.
        Mr. Langley is survived by his wife, Nancy, and four sons, Elmo Jr., Raymond, William and Steven.
