        Arnold E. Safer, an economist who was an expert in the world energy markets,  died on Jan. 13 in his home in Rockville, Md. He was 59.
        The cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Safer founded a consulting firm, the Energy Futures Group, which in collaboration with Benjamin Schlesinger & Associates of Bethesda, Md., helped many clients to understand how the gradual deregulation of the natural gas industry in the 1980's would lead to much freer trading of gas and how the emerging spot and futures markets for gas would work.
        Benjamin Schlesinger said Mr. Safer had also played a crucial role as adviser to the New York Mercantile Exchange in setting up the trading of futures in heating oil in the late 1970's. Mr. Schlesinger recalled that Mr. Safer predicted as far back as the 1960's that market forces would prevail over rigid  cartel pricing in world oil markets. And in the 1970's, he concluded that growing production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would weaken the cartel's ability to set prices, which eventually proved to be true.
        Mr. Safer was born in Boston, graduated from Brandeis University and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Rochester. He taught at Rice University and was at one time the chief economist with the Irving Trust Company in New York.
        He founded his consulting firm in 1981 and helped put together an analysis of how the natural gas industry would change after its planned deregulation in 1985. His clients included the World Bank, the Energy Department and numerous corporations.
        He is survived by his wife Roberta and three daughters, Karen of Silver Spring, Md., and Jocelyn and Adina, both of San Francisco.
