        Lewis J. Perl, an analyst for the regulated sector of the economy and a senior vice president of National Economic Research Associates of White Plains, died on Saturday while vacationing in Bethany Beach, Del. He was 55 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Perl was in charge of the New York City office of NERA, a company dealing in economic consulting and investigative services. He joined the company in 1972 and specialized in industries like telephone companies and investor-owned utilities.
        He graduated from the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1963. He received a master's degree in 1968 and a Ph.D. in economics in 1970 from the University of California at Berkeley and taught economics at Cornell until 1972.
        His analyses provided the basis for reports to NERA clients and for testimony before regulatory agencies. He assessed matters like the economic efficiency of pricing policies, and advised on privatization and the value of the assets to be privatized.
        He often dealt with environmental economics, helping to determine the social costs and benefits of legislation like the Clean Air Act or the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. He testified on such matters before Congressional committees, regulatory agencies and in court. He also prepared wage studies.
        Dr. Perl is survived by his wife, Terry, and two daughters, Lina and Joanna, all of Scarsdale, and a sister, Joan Guryan of South Orange, N.J.
