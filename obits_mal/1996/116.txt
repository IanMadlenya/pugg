        Bienvenido N. Santos, a novelist who grew up in Manila's slums and then moved to the United States and wrote about the pain of Filipino exiles there, died Sunday at his family home in Legaspi near the Mount Mayon volcano in the northern Philippines. He was 84.
        Mr. Santos, who wrote in English, was a Rockefeller Foundation fellow and Fulbright professor at the University of Iowa and later received a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship, the American Book Award and the Philippine Republic Cultural Heritage Award.
        From 1961 to 1966 he was dean and vice president of the University of Nueva  Caceres in the Philippines.
        In the 1970's, his novel "The Praying Man," about political corruption, was banned by the Government of Ferdinand E. Marcos. Mr. Santos went into voluntary  exile in the United States.
        He was writer in residence from 1973 to 1982 at Wichita State University and  became an American citizen in 1976. He made his first visit home from exile after the lifting of martial law in 1981.
        He was born on March 22, 1911, and grew up in the notorious Tondo slum district of Manila. He went to the United States in 1941 on a Philippine Government scholarship and studied English at the University of Illinois, Columbia and Harvard.
        When the Philippines were invaded by Japan in World War II, Mr. Santos began  working for the Philippine Government in exile in Washington and gave lectures on the spirit of Philippine resistance. After the war, his novel "The Volcano" examined an emerging anti-Americanism in the Philippines.
        He is survived by a son, Tomas, and three daughters, Arme Tan, Lina Cortes and Lily Anona.
