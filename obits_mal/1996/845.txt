        John Thomas Lenox, who was executive producer of the movie "Splash" and director of several popular television shows, died on Tuesday at his home in Van Nuys, Calif.
        He died on his 50th birthday, apparently of a heart attack.
        Mr. Lenox worked as an assistant director on such television series as "The  Odd Couple" and "Happy Days" and was nominated for an Emmy for the NBC mini-series "The Long Hot Summer."
        A graduate of Southern Methodist University, he is survived by his wife, Marsha, and a daughter, Skyler.
