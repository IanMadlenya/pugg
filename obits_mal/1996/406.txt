        Dr. Raja N. Khuri, a former acting president and dean of medicine at the American University in Beirut, died on Wednesday at his home in Greenville, N.C. He was 61.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Khuri moved from Beirut to Greenville in 1987 to accept an appointment as professor of medicine and physiology at the University of East Carolina. He retired two years ago.
        A native of Beirut, he graduated from American University and its medical school, where he began as an instructor in 1964. He was named chairman of the physiology department in 1968 and dean of medicine in 1979. He served as acting  president of American University in 1984-85 after the president, Dr. Malcolm Kerr, was assassinated during the Lebanese civil war.
        Dr. Khuri is survived by his wife, Soumaya Khuri-Makdisi-Khuri; two sons, Fadlo, of Houston, and Ramzi, of Geneva; a daughter, Jannane Khuri of Manhattan; two brothers, Nicola, of Riverdale, the Bronx, and Tony, of London; a sister, Salwa Awad, of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.
