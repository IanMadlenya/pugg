        Heiner Muller, one of East Germany's most prominent and debated playwrights,  died today at a Berlin hospital, a spokesman for his theater company said. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, the spokesman said.
        Mr. Muller was the artistic director of the Buhne am Schiffbauerdamm theater company, which was founded by Bertolt Brecht, and the author of some 30 plays. "Germania, Death in Berlin" was one of his best-known works.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Muller fell out with East Germany's rulers, who harshly criticized two of his plays. But the state later made peace with him, awarding him many literary prizes and allowing him to travel freely to the West.
        After unification in 1990, Mr. Muller worked mainly as a director.
