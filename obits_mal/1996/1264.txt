        Lewis H. Weinstein, a retired lawyer and advocate of Jewish causes, died on Wednesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
        He was 91 and lived in Canton, Mass., and in Newton, Mass.
        A prominent litigator and senior partner, he retired from Foley, Hoag & Eliot in 1993 after nearly 50 years with the firm. He often took part in continuing legal-education programs and formerly taught trial practice at Harvard Law School as well as a graduate course in the laws of land-use planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Mr. Weinstein, who was born in Lithuania, was brought to this country as an infant. He graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard College and, in 1930, from Harvard Law School. In the 1930's he was in private practice in Boston and served as assistant city corporation counsel and general counsel of the Boston Housing Authority. In the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, he served on the White House Executive Committee on Equal Opportunity in Housing.
        Mr. Weinstein was a past president of Hebrew College, now in Brookline, Mass., and a backer of groups like the National Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the Council of Jewish Federations.
        He is survived by a daughter, Louise Dozois of Belmont, Mass.; a son, David of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J.; a brother, Dr. Sidney Weinstein of West Orange, N.J.; a sister, Anne Tavalin of Clinton, N.Y., and one granddaughter. His wife of 54 years, Selma Yesley Weinstein, died in 1986.
