        William J. Flanagan, the longest-serving executive director of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, died on Wednesday at his home here. He was 76.
        No cause of death was given.
        Mr. Flanagan became the authority's executive director in 1962 and served until his retirement in 1988. He was responsible for several improvements, including widening the heavily industrialized northern section of the turnpike to 12 lanes from 6, separating trucks and cars on some sections, and prohibiting buses and trucks in the fast lanes. He also instituted an electronic surveillance system that balances traffic flow and detects emergencies.
        Turnpike workers remember him for going after foreign envoys who would race along the highway and invoke diplomatic immunity when caught. Because he could not punish them, he would make them leave the road. The bold policy was applauded across the country.
        During the years he served, yearly traffic jumped to 183 million vehicles from 55 million and toll revenues rose to $180 million from $39 million.
        Mr. Flanagan was born in Jersey City, where he became a reporter with The Jersey Journal and wrote a column called "A Voice in the Crowd."
        He was Deputy Mayor of Jersey City from 1949 to 1952, when he was elected Hudson County sheriff for the first of three terms. He held that post from 1952  to 1962.
        He was a graduate of Seton Hall and Fordham universities.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann Marie; two sons, William, of Shreveport, La., and John Peter of Wall Township, N.J.; three daughters, Kathleen Rochon of Prince Edward Island, Canada, Patricia Stefanile of Brick Township, N.J., and Eileen Roper of Allenhurst, and 12 grandchildren.
