        Dominic Quinn, a talk-show host in Philadelphia who cherished opera, the printed word and, very pointedly, the proper use of the English language, died on Friday at his home in Wayne, Pa. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Quinn, who was previously associated with broadcasters in Chicago, joined WWDB-FM talk radio in 1977 as the host of its drive-time program on weekday mornings. He took over as weekend morning host in 1991.
        His broadcasting career began in 1948 in Battle Creek and Flint, Mich., where he worked until he joined WIND in Chicago as a disk jockey in 1953. In the 1960's, he held programming positions at WINS in New York and CBS Radio in Boston and New York before he became a talk-show host on WMCA in New York in 1969.
        He worked afternoons at WCAU-AM Philadelphia for several years before making  his debut on WWDB in 1977. On his show, he kept an open microphone for listeners to call in, gave his opinions about anything that came to mind and sternly upheld his reputation as a stickler for proper American-English usage and pronunciation. In his heyday in the 1980's, some quarter-million listeners tuned in to his program every week.
        He was born in Chicago, and studied philosophy at Loyola University. He served as a radio operator for the Army Air Forces in the China-Burma-India theater in World War II, flying 150 cargo missions over the Himalayas and earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia Conley Quinn; three daughters, Marie G.  Quinn of Malvern, Pa., Kathleen Q. Zimmerman of Wilton, Conn., and Sheila Q. Bonham of Reston, Va.; a brother, Francis H. Jr. of Rockford, Ill., and four granddaughters.
