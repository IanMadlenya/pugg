        Dr. Henry Siegel, an eclectic medical sleuth who was a deputy chief medical examiner in New York City in the 1960's and chief medical examiner for Westchester County in the 1970's, died on Nov. 16 at his home in Plantation, Fla. He was 86.
        His daughter, Marian Siegel, said the cause was cancer.
        In his career, Dr. Siegel, a New York native who studied at City College and got a medical degree from New York University, was involved in many well-publicized cases.
        As Westchester's medical examiner in 1971, he helped verify that the nine hostages killed at the Attica Correctional Facility had been shot to death by the police who assaulted the prison after an inmate takeover.
        Three years later, he headed the grim task of identifying the 24 young victims of a fire that swept through Gulliver's nightclub in Port Chester.
        Dr. Siegel was also an author of more than 50 technical papers, among them a 1973 study that linked heavy cigarette smoking among women to fatal heart attacks at a young age.
        One of his most significant medical findings did not involve extensive research but the almost casual observation in 1953 of a sudden upsurge in the number of derelicts dying after drinking wood alcohol.
        Dr. Siegel notified the police after detecting 10 such deaths within a week in May 1953, but before the epidemic subsided a few weeks later the death toll had reached 51.
        After an investigation, two Bowery store clerks were charged with knowingly selling a solvent to derelicts as an intoxicant. Federal investigators traced the epidemic to the store's decision to change brands of solvents, from one with less than 5 percent of wood alcohol, which derelicts had drunk without serious ill effect, to one with 80 percent of the deadly alcohol.
        In addition to his daughter of Owings Mills, Md., Dr. Siegel is survived by his wife, Lillian, and a son, Edward, of New York.
