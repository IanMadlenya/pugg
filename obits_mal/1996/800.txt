        William Alan Bales, who contributed to NBC News coverage on radio and television during more than 32 years as a writer, editor and documentary maker,  died on June 6 at his home in Locust Valley, L.I. He was 79.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Bales, known as Bill, retired in 1982 as a writer for NBC's "Nightly News," where he had prepared copy for many of its most familiar faces on the air.
        Since joining the news staff in 1950, he had helped cover every Presidential  election until 1980, and he produced or directed radio documentaries on the Roosevelt-Truman years and in celebration of Winston Churchill's 80th birthday.
        On television, he worked as a writer, editor and field producer for the "Weekend" and "Sunday" programs. Another notable documentary bearing his credit  was a 1963 historical recreation of the Battle of Lexington and Concord.
        Mr. Bales was a native of Louisville, Ky., and graduated from Columbia College in 1946 after serving in Army counterintelligence in World War II. He studied political science at Columbia and worked for The Long Island Press before joining NBC.
        He was the author of "Tiger in the Streets" (1962), a history of Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall and the New York newspapermen who fought political corruption.
        He also wrote a novel, "The Seeker" (1976), a history of mankind reflected in the tale of a latter-day Robinson Crusoe, the lone survivor of a plane crash.
        Mr. Bales is survived by his wife, Sydney Holmes Bales; two sons, Dr. Peter Bales of Northport, L.I., and William A. Bales Jr. of Locust Valley; a sister, Mary A. Preston of Truro, Mass., and five grandchildren.
