        William Sloane Jelin, a roofing-material maker who was a prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser, died on Wednesday at his home in Cape Elizabeth, Me. He was 44 and also lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        The cause was complications from malignant melanoma, his family said.
        Mr. Jelin had a national reputation as an active party member and fund-raiser for Democratic candidates and was associated with many former and current members of Congress and other Democratic office-holders. He was a director and member of the executive committee of the National Jewish Democratic Committee.
        Mr. Jelin grew up in South Orange, N.J., and attended the Georgetown University Foreign Service School in Washington. At his death he was president of the Karnak Corporation of Clark, N.J., and Fort Lauderdale.
        He is survived by his mother, Sima Jelin of South Orange, chairman of Karnak; two brothers, Dr. Abraham Jelin of Manhattan and Frederick Jelin of Kennebunkport, Me.; and three sisters, Anne Jelin of Portland, Me., Sarah Jane Jelin of South Orange, and Deborah Newmyer of Bel Air, Calif.
