        Matthew Bailey Miles, a psychologist and theorist on the educational process, died on Oct. 24 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Tappan, N.Y.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Dr. Miles, a former professor of psychology and education at Teachers College of Columbia University, was a senior research associate at the Policy Research Center of New York and Washington.
        He studied what he called the ''social architecture'' of schools. His investigations of group dynamics, organizational development, school reforms and qualitative data analyses charted the field of educational change. He provided educators with guideposts for observing, evaluating and making constructive adjustments in the classroom.
        He was the co-author, editor and author of some 20 books on such subjects as parent-teacher dynamics, networking, innovation and lasting school improvement. Over the years he conducted research projects for the Office of Education in Washington, the New York City school system, the World Bank and the Carnegie and Ford Foundations, among others.
        Born to missionary parents in Burma, he graduated from Antioch College in Ohio and earned a doctorate in education at Teachers College, where he taught from 1954 to 1970.
        Dr. Miles is survived by his wife of 47 years, Betty Baker Miles; two daughters, Sara Miles of San Francisco, and Ellen Miles of Montpelier, Vt.; a son, David, also of Montpelier; a brother, Paul R. of North Scituate, Mass.; a sister, Josephine M. Schuman of Phippsburg, Me., and three granddaughters.
