        James W. Near, the chairman of the restaurant chain Wendy's International Inc., died on Monday in Atlanta, where he was attending the Olympic Games. He was 58 and lived in Bonita Springs, Fla.
        The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the company's headquarters in Dublin, Ohio.
        Mr. Near, a native of Columbus, Ohio, where Wendy's is based, spent his entire career in the restaurant business, starting at age 15 as a short-order cook. He worked more than 21 years at Wendy's, first as a franchisee and later as president, chief executive and finally chairman. He turned over the posts of  president, chief executive and chief operating officer to Gordon F. Teter in January 1995.
        Mr. Near is credited with leading Wendy's turnaround in the late 1980's by refocusing the company on restaurant operations, introducing specialty sandwiches and encouraging Dave Thomas, the company's founder, to become the advertising spokesman. He was an executive of Borden Inc. before becoming president and chief operating officer of Wendy's in 1986.
        Mr. Near is survived by his wife, Nancy; his mother, Helen; two sons, David and Jason, and two brothers.
