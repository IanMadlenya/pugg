        Harley Morton Jones, a community-minded architect who was a former chairman of the Department of Interior Design at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, died on Sunday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 60.
        The cause was pneumonia, Janet Fisher, a Pratt spokeswoman, said.
        Mr. Jones taught graduate and undergraduate courses at Pratt's School of Art and Design for almost 30 years before retiring last year. He was a department chairman in the 1970's and was particularly dedicated to helping African-American students shape successful careers in the arts.
        He grew up in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, where his family had deep roots. His grandfather built an apartment house on Bergen Street, off Schenectady Avenue, and Mr. Jones was committed to the revival of the neighborhood and its brownstones.
        He was a board member of the Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History, and forged a link between Pratt and that part of historic Brooklyn. He was the supervising architect for the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, which was founded by Senators Robert F. Kennedyand Jacob K. Javits of New York.
        As a trustee of the Studio Museum in Harlem from 1973 to 1993, Mr. Jones was active on its acquisitions, building, finance and personnel committees. He was also the project director for the renovation of the gallery's quarters on West 125th Street, which it acquired in 1979.
        His architectural work has been exhibited both in this nation and abroad, and he was a juror for the annual design competition of Interior Design magazine. He was a past president of the Jones Street Block Association and a board member of the Girls Club of New York.
        He was a graduate of Brooklyn College and received a master's degree in architecture from Yale University.
