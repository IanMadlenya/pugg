        Bernard Glaser, a retired public relations executive and former lawyer for the Department of the Treasury who investigated war crimes in Germany after World War II, died on Dec. 21 at John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek, Calif., where he had a winter home. He was 81 and lived in Chalfont, Pa.
        The cause was complications after surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Glaser, a native of Trenton, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Fordham Law School. He started a career as a floor trader at the New York Stock Exchange before joining the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        After serving in the Army, he was assigned to a Treasury team that looked into the wartime activities of I. G. Farben, the German industrial giant. The investigation helped convict 13 company officials on charges involving the use of slave labor at a plant in Auschwitz and drug experiments on inmates.
        He then became managing editor of The Evening Press in Levittown, Pa., before heading a public relations firm in Newtown, Pa., for 20 years. He later was vice president for public relations at the Trevose Savings and Loan Association in Bucks County until his retirement several years later.
        Mr. Glaser is survived by his wife of 42 years, Harriet Treiber Glaser; three sons, Michael and David, of Berkeley, Calif., and Charles, of Chicago, and three grandchildren.
