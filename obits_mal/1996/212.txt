        Ward Byron, a producer and director of some of the radio programs that featured the Big Band sounds of the 1930's and 40's, died on Sunday at the Sunharbour Manor nursing home in Roslyn, L.I. He was 89 and lived in Riverdale in the Bronx.
        Working for the Music Corporation of America from 1938 to 1944, Mr. Byron produced its "Fitch Bandwagon" network programs with leading bands and their singers, including Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Bennie Goodman, Woody Herman and Harry James.
        Mr. Byron, a native of Flushing, Queens, was hired in 1928 by the fledgling  National Broadcasting Company, for which he produced and wrote in New York and San Francisco. After a stint at MCA, he was associated with Perry Como's "Chesterfield Supper Club" program.
        His television credits included the "Paul Whiteman Goodyear Review," the Frances Langford-Don Ameche show and the "General Electric Hollywood Theater."
        He produced and directed commercials as a freelancer into the 1960's, when he joined International Co-Productions of New York, a company that bought B-movies  from independent European producers and sold them to distributors in the United  States. He retired as a partner in 1980.
        He is survived by a son, Christopher, of East Norwich, L.I.; a daughter, Kathy McCusker of Queens Village, Queens, and three granddaughters.
