        Hubert Opperman, one of the world's leading cyclists in the 1920's and 1930's and later a member of the Australian Parliament and Cabinet, collapsed and died  in Melbourne on Thursday night while riding his exercise bicycle. He was 91.
        After winning the Australian road-racing championship in 1924, he raced for 10 years in Europe and consistently beat the best Europeans in distance races. In 1928, although his bicycle had been sabotaged, he won the Bol d'Or race in France. In 1931, he won the Paris-Brest-Paris race, a 726-mile marathon of two days and nights of continuous cycling.
        In 1991, Opperman and his wife were invited to France for the centenary celebrations of the first Paris-Brest-Paris race. He was presented with the gold medal of the city of Paris.
        He set world records on concrete oval tracks, steeply banked and some almost  a third of a mile around. One record came when he cycled 1,000 miles on a track  in 28 hours 55 minutes. Others came for 24-hour performances of 489 miles unpaced and 860 miles motor-paced. In motor-paced races or record attempts, the  cyclist rides around the track behind a motorcycle. To stay in the draft of the  motorcycle and thus save energy, the cyclist rides only 6 to 12 inches behind, which is highly dangerous if he falls asleep or his mind wanders.
        Opperman retired from competitive cycling in 1940 and joined the Royal Australian Air Force. During World War II, he rose to the rank of flight lieutenant. After the war, he entered politics and became Australia's Minister of Shipping and Transportation and later its Minister of Immigration. From 1967  to 1992, he was Australia's High Commissioner to Malta.
        He is survived by his wife of 68 years, Mavys.
