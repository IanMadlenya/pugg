        Lou Eisenstein, a National Basketball Association referee from the league's beginnings in 1946 until his retirement in 1976, died on Friday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 83.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son-in-law, Steve Shapiro.
        Eisenstein was the only referee to handle the finals for the N.B.A., the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the National Invitation Tournament in the same year. For 18 consecutive years, he refereed the N.B.A. quarterfinals, semifinals and finals, and for 14 years in a row he refereed the N.I.T. final.
        He was a founder and, in 1953, the president of the Collegiate Basketball Officials Association. Until two weeks ago, he critiqued college referees for their conferences.
        Eisenstein graduated from New York University in 1934, where he won 12 letters as a basketball, baseball and football team manager. For more than 40 years, he ran a sporting-goods business in Brooklyn with Bernie Sarachuk, who was then the basketball coach and athletic director at Yeshiva University.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Esther Skitolsky; four daughters, Nancy Steinberg of Brooklyn, Judith Marwell of University Park, Md., Robin Shapiro of Neponsit, Queens, and Laurie Boerboom of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.
