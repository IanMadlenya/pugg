        Gordon S. Brown, a former dean of engineering and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on Aug. 23 at his retirement home in Tucson, Ariz. He was 88 and formerly lived in Concord, Mass., and Grantham, N.H.
        Dr. Brown made his mark in World War II when he and his colleagues developed automatic fire-control and aiming systems for guns used by the military on land, at sea and in the air. He later introduced innovations in automatic feedback controls, computer technology and the production of machine tools. As dean of the M.I.T. School of Engineering from 1959 to 1968, he led the modernization of engineering education there and influenced the way electrical and other engineering disciplines were taught at M.I.T. and elsewhere.
        Dr. Brown was born in Australia and, by age 18, held three diplomas, in mechanical, electrical and civil engineering, from what is now the Royal Melbourne Technical College. He graduated from M.I.T. in electrical engineering in 1931, earned his advanced degrees by 1938 and was appointed an assistant professor the next year.
        As head of the Department of Electrical Engineering in the early 1950's he moved to restructure and revise the department's entire curriculum. Later, when he became dean, he brought the same type of change to the rest of the School of Engineering. Another dimension of his tenure was his approach to interdepartmental and interdisciplinary research and cooperation with sister schools overseas, among them institutions in India and Singapore and the Technical University of Berlin.
        He retired in 1974 as Institute Professor emeritus and Professor of Electrical Engineering emeritus. After that he introduced computer science in a Tucson public school district.
        Dr. Brown is survived by his wife of 61 years, Jean Alfred Brown; a daughter, Sydney B. DeVore of Tucson; a son, Stanley A. of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.
