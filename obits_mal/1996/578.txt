        Dr. Katsuma Dan, a Japanese developmental biologist who made fundamental discoveries in studies of marine organisms, died on May 18 at the home of his eldest daughter in Osaka. A former resident of Tokyo, he was 91.
        In the United States, his association with the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., stretched back to the 1930's.
        Dr. Dan was credited with original studies of marine organisms, their cell division, fertilization, early development, cell differentiation and lunar-influenced spawning cycles. His measurements of the expansion and shrinkage of cell surfaces made possible the quantititive study of this ephemeral cell activity.
        By microscopic observation, he and his laboratory trainees discovered fundamental traits of cell behavior that underlie fertilization, organismal development and morphogenesis, the structural changes occurring as an organism grows. Working with his American wife, Jean, also a marine biologist, he used sea urchins to probe the mechanisms of cell division.
        Dr. Dan was born in Tokyo, the younger son of Baron Takuma Dan, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and managing director of Mitsui Commercial Interests who was assassinated by a Japanese nationalist in 1932. Katsuma Dan graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1929 and received a Ph.D.  from the University of Pennsylvania in 1934.
        At that time he began his many summers of research at the Woods Hole laboratory, of which he became a corporation member in 1936.
        In Japan, he and his wife worked at the Misaki Marine Station outside Tokyo.  A professor of biology at Tokyo Metropolitan University, he served as its president from 1965 until 1972.
        Jean Dan died in 1978. Dr. Dan is survived by three daughters, Mika Takamiya  and Marina Shokawa of Osaka, and Amy Tanaka of Sendai, Japan; two sons, Teruki of Tokyo and Chicago, and Harumi, a resident of Brazil, and 12 grandchildren.
