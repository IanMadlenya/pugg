        Dr. Daniel Mazia, a biologist who carried out pioneering work on cell division, structure and regulation, died on June 9 in Monterey, Calif. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure and complications of cancer, said Stanford University, where he had been a professor.
        Dr. Mazia is best known for his seminal studies on mitosis, which he described as "the problem of the origin of twoness." Mitosis is the process of doubling and dividing chromosomes so the genes can be passed on to a new cell.
        After joining the University of California at Berkeley in 1951, he and a colleague, Katsuma Dan, the Japanese biologist, isolated the mitotic apparatus,  a protein-based structure that controls cell division. Their work provided the basis for subsequent research in cell division.
        Dr. Mazia was also involved in early studies on the role of DNA in chromosomes.
        The son of a jeweler who had emigrated from Russia, Daniel Mazia was born on  Dec. 18, 1912, in Scranton, Pa. He studied zoology at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1933 and his doctorate in 1937.
        Dr. Mazia was a research fellow at Princeton University and at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Mass., before joining the University of Missouri, serving as an assistant and an associate professor of zoology from 1938 to 1950, with time out for military service.
        From 1951 to 1979, he was a professor of zoology at Berkeley. After retiring  from that post, he joined Stanford University.
        He is survived by his companion, Ruth Gilbert; two daughters, Rebecca Mazia of Olympia, Wash., and Judith Mazia of Piedmont, Calif., and a brother, Joseph Mazia, of Chevy Chase, Md. His wife, the former Gertrude Greenblatt, died in 1990.
