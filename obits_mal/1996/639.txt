        Saichiro Uesugi, who headed an organization that champions the rights of an outcast class in Japan, died on Friday, Japanese news organizations reported. He was 77.
        Mr. Uesugi died of liver failure in Fukuoka, in western Japan.
        He was chairman of the Buraku Liberation League, which sought to improve the lives of the burakumin. During feudal times, burakumin were considered unclean because they worked as butchers and tanners, professions that violated Buddhism's celebration of life.
        Although physically indistinguishable from other Japanese, many of their more than 1 million descendants continue to live in separate communities and suffer prejudice.
        Mr. Uesugi, a former labor union leader, headed the league since 1982. In 1988 he led 35 Japanese and foreign human rights organizations in creating the International Movement Against All Forms of Discrimination and Racism.
