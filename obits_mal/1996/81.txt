        Richard Hornung, a costume designer whose work on the film "Barton Fink" brought him an Academy Award nomination in 1992, died on Saturday at Sherman Oaks Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 45.
        The cause was AIDS, said Michael Singer, a friend.
        Mr. Hornung's career as a costume designer for films began in 1986 with "Raising Arizona," directed by Joel Coen and written by Mr. Coen and his brother, Ethan. He worked with the Coen brothers on several other films, including "Miller's Crossing," "The Hudsucker Proxy" and "Barton Fink."
        His film credits also included "The Grifters," "Doc Hollywood," "This Boy's Life," "Patty Hearst," "Natural Born Killers" and, most recently, "Nixon."
        Mr. Hornung was born in Bethlehem, Pa., and attended the University of Illinois. After moving to New York City he worked on and off Broadway and for regional theaters. He designed several productions for the Juilliard School of Drama. His Broadway credits included a revival of Shaw's "Candida" at Circle in  the Square in 1981 and the 1985 musical "The News."
        He is survived by his father, Jacob, and a brother, David, both of Bethlehem, and two sisters, Penelope Koach of Denver and Susan Killian of Bethlehem.
