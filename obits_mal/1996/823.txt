        Benson Carlin, an engineer and inventor whose expertise lay in ultrasonics -- vibrations too fast for the human ear to hear -- died on June 22 at St. Mary's Hospital in Langhorne, Pa. He was 80 and had lived in Langhorne since moving from Princeton, N.J., in the early 1990's.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Carlin was the author of many articles on ultrasonic applications as well as a 1949 textbook, "Ultrasonics" (McGraw-Hill; second edition, 1960). He held more than 50 patents for his work on ultrasonic circuitry.
        His work on high-frequency sound imaging contributed to the development of medical imaging equipment like ultrasonic brain scanners and devices for obtaining images of fetuses. He designed medical equipment through the 1960's and, in 1969, became president and co-owner of OEM Medical Inc. in Edison, N.J., a maker of oxygen-therapy equipment. He retired in 1980 when the company was sold.
        A native of Brooklyn, he graduated from Brooklyn College and received a master's degree from the State University of New York at Albany. He worked as a  radio engineer and teacher for the Signal Corps in Fort Monmouth, N.J., and specialized in ultrasonics in the 1940's.
        Mr. Carlin is survived by his wife of 52 years, Vivian F. Carlin, an author of books on aging; two sons, Robert M., of Lexington, N.C., and Richard P., of Glen Ridge, N.J., and three sisters, Grace Wile of Princeton, Rita Fremont of Monsey, N.Y., and Estelle Kalstein of Ventura, Calif.
