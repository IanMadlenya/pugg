        Dev Kanta Borooah, a former president of the governing Congress Party in India, died today after suffering a heart attack, United News of India said. He  was 82.
        Mr. Borooah, the party's leader from 1973 to 1977, is best known for coining  the slogan, "India is Indira, and Indira is India." It was part of an attempt to generate public support in 1975 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi imposed two years of emergency rule by suspending all fundamental rights.
        Mr. Borooah, a veteran of India's struggle for independence, also served in  Mrs. Gandhi's Cabinet.
