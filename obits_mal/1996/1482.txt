        Donald J. Mercer, who was hired in 1933 as a page for NBC and retired in 1981 as a senior vice president for the television network, died on Dec. 5 at his home in Summit, N.J. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from heart disease, a family member said.
        During the 1950's, Mr. Mercer was part of the executive team that helped build NBC's nationwide network of affiliated television stations. In 1967, he was named senior vice president for affiliate relations, a position he held until his retirement.
        Mr. Mercer was born in Detroit and was raised in Roselle Park, N.J.
        At NBC, he worked in various departments from 1933 to early January 1942, when he enlisted in the United States Army. During World War II, he served with the Eighth Division Field Artillery in Europe, and he was discharged in 1945 with the rank of captain.
        He returned to NBC after the war. During his career and in retirement, he was a frequent speaker at industry conferences and was a president of the Broadcast Pioneers.
        Mr. Mercer was married to Isabel Wilson Mercer, who died in 1988. He is survived by two brothers, Robert E. Mercer of Palm Coast, Fla., and Nantucket, Mass., and Richard J. Mercer of Nantucket; a son, David Mercer of Seattle; two daughters, Margaret Mercer of Manhattan and Cynthia M. Thompson of Short Hills, N.J., and four grandchildren.
