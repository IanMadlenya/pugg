        Charles A. Agemian, a former Chase Manhattan executive whose banking career covered two thirds of a century, died on Friday at a hospital in Neptune, N.J. He was 86 and a resident of Spring Lake.
        A native of Syria who came to the United States with his family in 1914, Mr.  Agemian got his first taste of banking as a 17-year-old messenger for the old Bank of Manhattan. He remained in banking until 1994, when he stepped down as a  director of the Sterling National Bank.
        In the intervening 67 years, he rose to become executive vice president for  operations at Chase Manhattan before resigning in 1969 to run the Garden State National Bank in New Jersey.
        Mr. Agemian was known for his ready wit, a fund of stories and the inclination to share them.
        "Never lend money to anyone who doesn't haggle over the interest," he liked to say. "They won't pay it back."
        Poking fun at banking's proliferation of inflated titles, for example, Mr. Agemian would tell about the newly minted vice president whose unimpressed wife  sniffed that the A. & P. had a "vice president for prunes." Not quite believing  her, the man phoned the supermarket, asked for the vice president for prunes and was told, "Which one? Dried or bulk?"
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two daughters, Sandra Borg of Englewood, N.J., and Mary Louise Heath of Houston; a sister, Isabel Wilson of Palm Beach, Fla., and six grandchildren.
