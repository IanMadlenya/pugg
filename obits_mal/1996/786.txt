        Hugh Burnton Mitchell, a New Deal Democrat who served Washington State in both houses of Congress half a century ago, died on Monday night at a nursing home here. He was 89.
        Mr. Mitchell was still in his mid-20's when, in the early 1930's, he became chief of staff to Monrad Wallgren, who represented the state for a dozen years in the Senate after two years in the House. When Mr. Wallgren was elected Governor in 1944, he chose Mr. Mitchell to fill his unexpired Senate term.
        Running for the seat in his own right in 1946, Mr. Mitchell was defeated. But he won election to the House in 1948 and represented the Seattle area there  for the next four years. During his career in the capital, Mr. Mitchell made his mark as a reformer who helped expose a scandal surrounding the sale of World War II surplus property, although back in his home state he was best known for his unsuccessful proposal to create a Columbia River Valley Authority.
        After two terms in the House, Mr. Mitchell ran for governor in 1952, when anti-Communist hysteria was at fever pitch. Opponents suggested that he was soft on communism, and he was defeated.
        He is survived by a son, Bruce, and a daughter, Elizabeth, both of Seattle, and two grandchildren.
