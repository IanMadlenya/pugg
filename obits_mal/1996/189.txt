        Tom Costello, an actor who was a founding member of Andre Gregory's Manhattan Project and a frequent performer in the puppet plays of Theodora Skipitares, died on Feb. 18 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 58.
        His wife, Abigail, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.
        Mr. Costello, who began his career as a comic character actor in the experimental theater, was in the original cast of the Manhattan Project's freewheeling 1970 version of "Alice in Wonderland." Subsequently, he was in Mr. Gregory's productions of Beckett's "Endgame," Wallace Shawn's "Our Late Night" and Chekhov's "Seagull."
        During the last 12 years, Mr. Costello often collaborated with Ms. Skipitares, acting as narrator and as a panoply of voices in her exploratory musical plays, including "Micropolis," "The Age of Invention," "Empires and Appetites," "Underground" and "Under the Knife." He also appeared in Mr. Shawn's "Hotel Play," Sam Shepard's "Angel City" and Mac Wellman's "Harm's Way."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Rose and Joan, of Fullerton, Calif.
