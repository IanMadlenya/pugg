        George Russell, a former vice chairman of General Motors Corporation, died on Wednesday at the Palm Beach Gardens Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 90.
        As vice chairman of the corporation from 1967 until he retired in 1970, Mr. Russell directed the company's finance and insurance group and its public relations and industry-government relations staffs.
        Mr. Russell, who was born near Glasgow, Scotland, graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1927 with a degree in business administration. He then joined General Motors's powerful finance staff, which was based in New York, as a clerk in the treasurer's office.
        By 1944 he was assistant treasurer of the corporation and in 1949 was named to manage the financial affairs of the company's network of factories outside the United States. He was instrumental in rebuilding the bomb-damaged Opel factories in Germany before returning to the finance staff as treasurer in 1951. He was made vice president of the corporation in 1956, with responsibility for the finance staff.
        Mr. Russell was made an executive vice president in 1958. He was also a director of what is now known as the American Automobile Manufacturers Association and the Highway Users Federation for Safety and Mobility.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Love Rose of North Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Mary Love Rose Harman of Manhattan; a son, George Jr. of Rye,  N.Y., and five grandchildren.
