        Thomas H. Dawson, an early television industry executive who was president of the CBS network in the late 1960's, died on Sunday at a medical center in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 82.
        Mr. Dawson, who had homes in La Quinta, Calif., and Greenwich, Conn., joined  the Columbia Broadcasting System's radio network in 1938 as an advertising salesman with radio station WCCO in Minneapolis. In 1951, he shifted to CBS Television in New York as general sales manager for spot advertising.
        Shortly after being named to the presidency in 1966, Mr. Dawson amused a gathering of colleagues by introducing himself as "your network president -- for the moment." His caveat reflected the turmoil that governed the network's top ranks in those years as CBS's legendary chairman, William S. Paley, began a series of executive suite shuffles aimed at developing a management team to succeed him and the CBS corporate president, Frank Stanton.
        By 1969, Mr. Dawson was moved into a corporate vice presidency to make way for another network president, the fifth for the network in five years. Rather than stay on in his new post, Mr. Dawson left CBS to become director of radio and television in the commissioner's office of Major League Baseball, a position he held until his retirement in 1974.
        Mr. Dawson is survived by his wife, Marjorie Kastberg Dawson; two sons, Thomas H. Dawson Jr. of Nuevo, Calif., and David Dawson of Valencia, Calif.; a daughter, Deborah D. Radecki of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and three grandchildren.
