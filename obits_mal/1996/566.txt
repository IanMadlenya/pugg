        Albert Beich, a screenwriter and playwright who was a co-writer of the 1958 Broadway play "The Man in the Dog Suit," died on March 30 in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 77 and lived in Scottsdale.
        The cause was an embolism, said his sister, Mary Beich McCarthy.
        Mr. Beich was born in Bloomington, Ill. and grew up in Laguna Beach, Calif., where as a teen-ager he wrote for radio. After receiving a bachelor's degree from McGill University in Montreal, he found work as a screenwriter at Republic Pictures, where he helped write "West Side Kid" (1943) before serving in the Army during World War II. After the war, he returned to Hollywood.
        He was the sole writer on "Gangs of the Waterfront" (1945) and "The Perils of Pauline" (1967) and a co-writer on "The Bride Goes Wild" (1948), "The Milkman" (1950), "The Yellow Cab Man" (1950), "The Lieutenant Wore Skirts" (1956) and "A  Distant Trumpet" (1964). The Clark Gable film "Key to the City" (1950) was based on a story by Mr. Beich.
        In addition to his sister, of Scottsdale, he is survived by another sister, Elizabeth White of Chicago.
