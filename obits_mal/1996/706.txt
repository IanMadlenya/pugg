        Jack Lacy, a New York radio personality and disk jockey who was heard on WINS-AM from the late 1940's through 1965, died on June 9 at San Juan de Dios Hospital in San Sebastian, Spain. He was 79 and had lived in San Sebastian since 1989.
        He suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Lacy was a contemporary of such veterans of the airwaves as Murray (the K) Kaufman and Bruce (Cousin Brucie) Morrow. His "Listen to Lacy" program on WINS treated his audience to "easy listening" music and live interviews. He left WINS when it changed to all news, after which he worked for stations in Baltimore and Los Angeles.
        Mr. Lacy, who grew up in the Hartford area, was in the Army in World War II  and worked as an English teacher before going into radio.
        His wife, Agnes Code Lacy, died in February. He is survived by a daughter, Maree-Lee Lacy de Echeveste, of Oyarzun, Spain, outside San Sebastian, and two grandchildren.
