        Haskell L. Lazere, who was executive director of the New York chapter of the  American Jewish Committee from 1969 to 1989 and helped found various human rights coalitions in New York City, died on Saturday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, said Francesco P. Cantarella, a friend.
        During his tenure at the A.J.C. and continuing into his retirement, Mr. Lazere helped build coalitions that dealt with social and racial issues, including the New York Community Relations Council and Black-Jewish Dialogue. Many years ago, he organized community relations programs to overcome housing disputes in Forest Hills, Queens, where he worked with Mario M. Cuomo, a lawyer  and future New York Governor.
        Mr. Cuomo appointed him chairman of the New York State Human Rights Advisory  Committee in 1984, a post he held until two years ago.
        Mr. Lazere was a trustee of Audrey Cohen College, a director of the Catholic  Interracial Council and chairman of the advisory committee of the Congress of Italian American Organizations, among other things.
        He was a native of Omaha, and attended Creighton University in Omaha and the  University of Chicago Law School. Before his appointment at the American Jewish  Committee, he was assistant national director of the Interracial Council for Business Opportunity.
        Mr. Lazere is survived by his wife of 24 years, Bernice Bravman Lazere; two daughters, Arian Lazere of Boulder, Colo., and Leora Azoulay of Los Angeles; a son, Richard, of Denver; three stepchildren, Jay Gottlieb and Laurie Richter, both of Miami, and Joan Kitner of Dallas; a brother, Robert, of Kansas City, Mo.; two half-brothers, Joel Lazere of Las Vegas, Nev., and Alan Lazere of San Francisco, and four grandchildren.
