        John Phillips, a photographer for Life magazine from the 1930's to the 1950's who was known for his war photographs, died on Thursday at his home in midtown Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was not immediately certain, but he had been bedridden for three weeks with congestion of the lungs, said a friend, the photographer Cornell Capa, who was the founding director of the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, where Mr. Phillips lectured.
        Mr. Phillips was born in Bouira, Algeria, to a Welsh emigre father and an American mother. He was also a writer, and his work included books with text and photographs about Italy, Israel and Yugoslavia. At his death, he had almost finished writing his autobiography.
        Mr. Phillips's wife of 36 years, the former Anna Maria Borletti, died in January.
        He is survived by a great-nephew, Andrea Cairone of Manhattan.
