        Edwin Birger Olsen, an architect whose assignments took him to the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian Institution and the Kennedy White House, died on Tuesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 94 and lived in Blauvelt, N.Y.
        He was born in New York City, and graduated from Harvard University with a degree in architecture in 1923. In a career that spanned six decades, he worked  for such prominent firms as John Russell Pope, Eggers & Higgins and McKim, Mead  & White.
        He worked on the design of the National Gallery and the Museum of History and Technology at the Smithsonian. He also helped to restore the White House dining room at the behest of Jacqueline Kennedy when she was First Lady.
        After retiring in 1984, he turned to watercolors, particularly of architectural reproductions, which he exhibited throughout Westchester and Rockland Counties.
        He is survived by his sons Edwin S., of Upper Montclair, N.J., Birger F., of  Kalamazoo, Mich., and Geoffrey S., of Blauvelt, and five grandchildren.
