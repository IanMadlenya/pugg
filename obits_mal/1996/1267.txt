        Dr. Stanley S. Lamm, the founder and director emeritus of the Lamm Institute for Child Neurology and Developmental Medicine at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, died on Oct. 18 at the Judson Retirement Community in Cleveland. He was 95 and lived in Brooklyn Heights until five years ago, when he retired from practice.
        Dr. Lamm was a retired clinical professor of pediatrics at the SUNY Health Sciences Center and attending physician at Long Island College Hospital. He had also served the city's Health Department and public school system as medical director of classes for neurologically impaired children in Brooklyn.
        He was instrumental in developing the medical services of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. He became a board member and set up its first clinic five decades ago.
        In 1951, at Long Island College Hospital, he established the clinic that would eventually be dedicated in his name. He also was an attending physician and pediatric neurologist at Kings County Medical Center.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated in 1921 from City College and received his medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine.
        In addition to many articles on pediatric neurology, he published two books on the subject.
        He is survived by a son, Dr. Michael Lamm of Cleveland, and two granddaughters.
