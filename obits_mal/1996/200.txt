        Vehbi Koc, who left school as a teen-ager to open a small grocery store and in eight decades amassed Turkey's most formidable financial empire, died on Sunday. He was 94.
        Mr. Koc suffered a heart attack while vacationing at his hotel in the Mediterranean coastal city of Antalya.
        Mr. Koc was chairman of Koc Holding A.S., the country's largest conglomerate. The company's holdings include businesses from banking to insurance to tourism, and joint ventures with large foreign companies. Last year, his companies, which employ a total of 40,000 people, exported $1 billion  in goods and services.
        In 1917, at the age of 15, Mr. Koc quit school and with $25 started a small grocery store in his native Ankara. When Ankara became the capital after 1923, he entered the construction business and rode a building boom.
        He remained a tradesman, as well as an importer and distributor of foreign goods until the end of World War II. He then began his lifelong association with companies like Ford Motor, Fiat, Siemens, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Mobil, American Express, General Electric, Hitachi and Casio.
        His first manufacturing project was a light bulb plant in Istanbul, a joint venture with General Electric. Later, his companies introduced appliances into Turkish homes, starting with refrigerators in the 1960's.
        A philanthropist, Mr. Koc spent billions on schools and medical research. Mr. Koc also campaigned for family planning, attributing Turkey's social and financial problems to the growth of its population.
