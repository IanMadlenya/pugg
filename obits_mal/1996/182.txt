        Roger Bowen, a writer and actor who played the high-living, foggy-minded Col. Henry Blake in the movie "M*A*S*H" and who was a founder of the Second City Theater in Chicago, died on Feb. 16 while vacationing in Marathon, Fla. He was 63 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Ann.
        Mr. Bowen, who frequently acted in movies and on television, also wrote 11 novels, including "Inga" (1979) and "The Silent Fifties" (1995), as well satiric sketches for theater and television. But his widest fame came through "M*A*S*H" (1970), Robert Altman's irreverent, ground-breaking look at the Korean War.
        Mr. Bowen, born in Providence, R.I., was a graduate of Brown University. After serving in Army Intelligence during the Korean War, he moved to Chicago, where he helped found the improvisational theater troupe the Compass as well as  the legendary Second City.
        In addition to his wife, the founder and director of the Theater Gym in Manhattan, Mr. Bowen is survived by a daughter, Katie Bowen Kosh, and two sons,  Michael and Daniel, all of Manhattan.
