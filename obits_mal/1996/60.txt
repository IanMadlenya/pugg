        Herbert Henry Dow 2d, the president of the Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation and a former executive of the chemical company founded by his grandfather, died on Friday in Houston. He was 68 and lived in Midland, Mich.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery, Elyse M. Rogers, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said.
        Mr. Dow was a grandson of Herbert H. Dow, the founder of the Dow Chemical Company, a fact that bestowed great wealth on him and prescribed much of his life's work. He worked for the company for 40 years, including 18 years as its secretary and 6 years as vice president, before retiring in 1992. He began a 39-year tenure on the board of directors in 1953, at age 25, and also served as  a director of several other corporations.
        Mr. Dow was president of the Dow Foundation, named for his grandparents, from 1970 until his death. The foundation, which has assets of $311 million, has made grants to colleges and universities, arts institutions, medical centers and other institutions, many of them in Michigan.
        Born Aug. 6, 1927, in Midland, Mr. Dow graduated from the Hotchkiss School, attended Yale University and received a bachelor of science degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also served in the Navy.
        He is survived by his wife of 44 years, Barbara, and his children, Dana Schuler of Cincinnati, Willard Dow 2d of Dallas and Pamela Dow of Scottsdale, Ariz.
