        Jason Bernard, an actor who performed in several television series and had recently been nominated for a Cable Ace acting award, died on Friday at Providence St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was 58.
        He died, apparently of a heart attack suffered while he was driving in Hollywood, where his car was involved in a rear-end accident on Cahuenga Boulevard, reported the City News Service of Los Angeles. Mr. Bernard was nominated for one of the 18th Annual Cable Ace awards,  for a supporting actor in a movie or miniseries. The nominations were announced last month by the National Academy of Cable Programming. His was for his acting in the movie ''Sophie and the Moonhanger,'' shown on the Lifetime cable channel in January.
        The New York Times critic Janet Maslin said that Mr. Bernard was ''especially solid'' in the supporting role of the heroine's ever-patient boss in the 1995 romantic comedy film ''While You Were Sleeping,'' starring Sandra Bullock and Bill Pullman.
        Another critic said that Mr. Bernard was ''soft looking, even stuffy, yet immovable in his faith'' in the role of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in ''The Meeting,'' an American Playhouse adaptation of a 1987 one-act play about a fictional meeting between Dr. King and Malcolm X. The adaptation was broadcast on PBS stations in 1989.
        Mr. Bernard had the parts of Deputy Inspector Marquette on the police-drama television series ''Cagney and Lacey'' in 1982 and 1983 and of Fletch in a 1983 adventure series, ''High Performance.''
        He also acted in ''Wilma'' -- starring Cicely Tyson as the Olympic athlete Wilma Rudolph, a 1977 made-for-TV movie.
        No information on surviving family members was available.
