        Jerrold G. Van Cise, an early advocate of continuing legal education and a retired senior antitrust partner in the Manhattan firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, died on July 21 at the New London Hospital in New Hampshire. He was 86 and had moved to New London from Garden City, L.I., in 1980.
        The cause was pneumonia that developed after a fall, his family said.

        He also lectured for the Practicing Law Institute of New York and was the author of its textbook ''Understanding the Antitrust Laws.''
        A native of Roseville, N.J., Mr. Van Cise graduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School.
        He joined the Cahill firm in 1935 and retired in 1980.
        He is survived by two daughters, Dorothea V. Worthen of Springfield, N.H., and Elizabeth V. C. Harnisch of Darien, Conn.; a son, Randolph G., of Metuchen, N.J.; a brother, Oliver, of Basking Ridge, N.J.; two sisters, Gladys Holman of Mount Vernon, N.H., and Marydith DeGolyer of Castile, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
