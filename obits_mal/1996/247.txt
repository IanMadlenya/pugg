        Mercer Ellington, a trumpet player, arranger, composer and band leader who had led the Duke Ellington Orchestra since his father's death in 1974, died Thursday in Denmark. He was 76.
        Mr. Ellington's daughter, Mercedes, said that her father died of heart failure in a Copenhagen hospital.
        The only child of Edward Kennedy (Duke) Ellington and his wife, Edna, Mercer Ellington studied at Columbia University and the Juilliard School of Music.
        Before taking over his father's orchestra, Mr. Ellington led small groups including a band that featured Carmen McRae as vocalist. She made her recording  debut with that band. He also worked as a salesman, disk jockey and record company executive.
        Ellington worked on and off as trumpeter and band manager with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. He took over in 1974, when his father died.
        One evening in 1941, his father told him that the band needed a new tune to record the next day. That night, he wrote "Things Ain't What They Used to Be" and presented it at a recording session the next morning.
        He helped his father compose "The Three Black Kings" in a hospital during the last five months of Duke Ellington's life.
        Other compositions by Mercer Ellington include "Blue Serge," "Moon Mist," "The Girl in My Dreams" and "John Hardy's Wife." He was music director and conductor of "Sophisticated Ladies," a revue based on music by his father, from 1981 to 1983. He also conducted his father's only opera, "Queenie Pie," in  Philadelphia and at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
        Mr. Ellington received a Grammy Award in 1988, in the big-band jazz instrumental performance category, for "Digital Duke."
        He wrote a biography of his father in 1978, "Duke Ellington in Person."
        He lived in Copenhagen and New York. He is survived by his wife, Lena, who is Danish, and four children, Edward Kennedy, Mercedes, Gaye and Paul.
