        Alfredo Vicente Cardinal Scherer, one of the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church's conservative wing in the 1960's and 70's, died on Saturday in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. He was 93.
        He became a Roman Catholic priest in Rome in 1926 and a Bishop in 1946 and was nominated a Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1969. Cardinal Scherer retired as leader of the Porto Alegre archdiocese in 1981.
        A fervent anti-Communist, Cardinal Scherer was famous for his denunciations of liberation theology -- a school of thought that says the church should concentrate on lifting people out of oppression and poverty. The hierarchy of the Brazilian church was a stronghold of such thinking.
        Despite his political views, in 1963 Bishop Scherer appealed, over the opposition of the Brazilian military, for adherence to constitutional rules of succession that mandated that Vice President Joao Goulart, a leftist, be allowed to replace President Janio Quadros, who was resigning.  Mr. Goulart assumed power but was ousted in a military coup in 1964 that ushered in two decades of military rule in Brazil.
