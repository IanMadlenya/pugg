        David A. McCabe, a lawyer who represented governments and large corporations, died on Sunday in Manhattan at the age of 56.
        The cause was leukemia, said Peter McCabe, his brother.
        Mr. McCabe, who lived in Greenwich, Conn., was also a prominent dealer and collector of late 19th century American paintings, largely from the Luminist school. He began dealing in art in 1960, while covering the Rome Olympics for United Press International: he bought a few paintings and sold them upon return to New York.
        Mr. McCabe joined Shearman & Sterling, a large New York law firm, in 1966, after receiving a law degree from Columbia University. He became a partner in that firm in 1974 and most recently was a senior partner and the firm's international coordinator.
        He represented the Government of Kazakhstan in negotiations related to oil exploration and defended Continental A.G., the tire company, from a hostile takeover bid by Pirelli S.p.A.
        He served as a director of General Timer, the Kanthal Corporation and the National Forge Corporation.
        In addition to his brother Peter, who lives in Greenwich, Mr. McCabe is survived by his wife, Caroline, and a son, Nicholas, both of Greenwich, a daughter, Caroline of Boston, and four stepchildren: Miranda Riede of Greenwich and Susannah, Peter, and Katrina, all of Richmond, Surrey, England. He is also survived by his mother, Ruth, of New York and two other brothers, Charles of New York and Robert of Vienna.
