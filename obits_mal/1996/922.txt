        Dr. Robert Alan Manners, professor emeritus and founding chairman of the Department of Anthropology at Brandeis University, died on Friday at his home in Newton Center, Mass. He was 82.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Manner was editor-in-chief of The American Anthropologist, the journal of the American Anthropological Association, from 1973 to 1974.
        Born in Manhattan, he graduated from Columbia College in 1935. He worked as a writer for the Works Progress Administration and earned his Ph.D. in anthropology at Columbia in 1950 after wartime service as a captain in the Army.
        Dr. Manners taught briefly at the University of Rochester before arriving on  the campus in Waltham, Mass., in 1952 as an assitant professor on the social-science faculty. Brandeis did not have a separate anthropology department and it was left to him to build one. As its chairman, he brought it to national  prominence by the time he retired in 1979.
        Dr. Manners did his primary field work in western Kenya, northern Arizona and the Caribbean. He was the author, with David Kaplan, of the textbook "Culture Theory" (Prentice Hall, 1972; repr. Waveland, 1986).
        He was a co-author of "Contemporary Change in Traditional Societies" (U. of Ill., 1967). He also wrote the monograph "Havasupai Indians", "Hualapai Indians  of Arizona", and "Southern Paiute and Chemehuevi" (Garland Publ., 1974).
        Dr. Manners is survived by his wife of 45 years, Jean Hall Manners; two daughters, Karen M. Smith of Emporia, Kan., and Katherine Manners of Newton Center; two sons, John of Montclair, N.J., and Stephen of Hong Kong; a brother, Bernard Rosen of Grass Valley, Calif.; and nine grandchildren. His first marriage, to Margaret Hall, later Margaret Sydney, ended in divorce; she died in 1990.
