        Maxwell Evarts Cox, a lawyer, novelist and community leader, died on Thursday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 73 years old.
        The cause of death was choking, his daughter Ann Cox Halkett of Cherryfield, Me., said.
        Mr. Cox was born in Plainfield, N.J., and attended Harvard and Harvard Law School. During World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Force. After law school, he joined the firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett in Manhattan and then  Davis & Cox in Manhattan, where he represented the billionaire industrialist Howard Hughes. For the last 15 years, he was associated with Jacobs, Persinger & Parker.
        He served as the chairman of the board of governors at St. Ann's Episcopal School in Brooklyn Heights and later as president of the board of trustees. He was also the senior warden of the school's sponsoring parish, St. Ann and the Holy Trinity.
        Mr. Cox wrote a novel, ''The Point of the Game,'' which was published by Dodd Mead in 1969.
        Besides Ms. Halkett, Mr. Cox is survived by his wife, Mary, of Brooklyn; two other daughters, Rachel, of Washington, and Elizabeth Avedon of Manhattan; a son, Robert, of Manhattan; two brothers, Archibald, of Wayland, Mass., who was the special prosecutor dismissed by President Nixon during the Watergate scandal, and Louis, of Martinsburg, W.Va., and a sister, Elizabeth Bigelow of Stamford, Conn.
