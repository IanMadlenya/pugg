        Churchill P. Lathrop, emeritus professor of art history at Dartmouth College, died on Dec. 21 at the home of a niece, Diana B. Little, in Bloomfield, N.J. He  was 95.
        Professor Lathrop joined the art department at Dartmouth in 1928 and served as chairman of the department for 10 years before his retirement in 1966. He was also director of the college's art galleries, custodian of the college art collections and art library officer. The Lathrop Gallery in the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College is named in honor of the professor and his wife, Dorothy.
        He also transformed the teaching of art history at Dartmouth by introducing  the study of contemporary art, photography and applied arts. With Artemas Packard, who held the art history chair, he set up an artist-in-residence program in 1932.
        The first artist invited was Jose Clemente Orozco, who reciprocated by painting a mural, "The Epic of American Civilization," in the college's Baker Library. Since then, participating artists have included Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and Jim Dine.
        In 1928, with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation, Professor Lathrop founded what later became the college's highly regarded Sherman Art Library. He  was also instrumental in building the college's art collection.
