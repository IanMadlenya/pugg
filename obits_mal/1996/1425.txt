        Dr. Herbert L. Rothbart, the regional director of research for the United States Department of Agriculture, died on Nov. 18 at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 59 and lived in Flourtown, Pa.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery, family members said.
        Dr. Rothbart managed research for the North Atlantic region on topics like cranberries and blueberries in New Jersey, vineyards in New York State and an endangered potato crop in Maine, said Dr. Virginia Holsinger of the Eastern Regional Research Center in Wyndmoor, Pa., which Dr. Rothbart had directed.
        Under his direction, Agriculture Department laboratories found a product to allow milk to be digested by people who had been unable to do so. In Massachusetts, one of Dr. Rothbart's regional laboratories at Tufts University made strides in nutrition for the elderly, Dr. Holsinger said. Dr. Rothbart also worked on projects in Europe and in Taiwan, Israel, New Zealand and Australia.
        He received the Presidential Rank Award for his research management.
        Dr. Rothbart was born in Brooklyn and received a degree in chemistry from Brooklyn College. His doctoral work at Rutgers was also in chemistry, and he taught in that department from 1961 to 1966, when he joined the Agriculture Department.
        He is survived by his wife, Marian; a son, Bradley, of Manhattan; his mother, Doris, of Brooklyn; a brother, Robert, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and a sister, Barbara Rothbart Curry of Brooklyn.
