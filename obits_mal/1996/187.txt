        Glenn Parker, a pianist who accompanied singers and directed the accompanying and coaching program at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., died on Feb. 15 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 40 and lived in Manhattan.
        Anne Sears, the director of external affairs at Westminster Choir College at  Rider University, said the cause was AIDS.
        Among the singers Mr. Parker accompanied in concert were the soprano Kathleen Battle, the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne and the baritone Christopher Trakas. He was also the artistic director of the Westminster Opera Theater, for  which he staged 13 productions, including the United States premiere of Handel's "Flavio."
        Mr. Parker was born in Rantoul, Ill., on April 18, 1955. He was a graduate of the Oberlin Conservatory and earned a doctorate at the University of Michigan. He held faculty posts at the University of Michigan, Oberlin and the State University of New York at Purchase before joining the accompanying department at the Westminster Choir College in 1981. He accompanied the choir in more than 500 concerts, as well as on a recent recording of choral works by Brahms.
        He is survived by a sister, Rhoda Parker-Sachs of Rolla, Mo., and by Mr. Trakas, his companion.
