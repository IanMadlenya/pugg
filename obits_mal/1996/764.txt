        Harold E. Emerson, a former vice president for development and alumni relations at Columbia University, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in  Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was emphysema, his family said.
        Mr. Emerson, himself a Columbia graduate, in 1950, was credited with fund-raising innovations. As assistant to Dr. Grayson Kirk, Columbia University's president, in 1962, he accompanied groups of prominent faculty members to cities throughout the world, where they conducted symposiums for alumni.
        In 1968, he was made vice president for development and alumni relations. He  left Columbia in 1972 to become vice president of the Freedom Train Foundation and later founded the Association of American Achievements, an organization devoted to promoting "the system of free enterprise in a free society."
        His marriage to the former Nancy Percy ended in divorce. He is survived by a  son, Paul, of Washington.
