        Allan B. (Scotty) Connal, a leading figure in the growth of cable televised sports and winner of an Emmy award as an executive producer at NBC for coverage of the 1975 World Series, died on Tuesday in Atlanta. He was 68.
        Mr. Connal, who resided in Old Greenwich, Conn., was in Atlanta helping produce the Olympic Games for foreign markets. He had been hospitalized since Sunday after suffering a heart attack.
        Beginning in 1947, he worked his way from a page at NBC to a senior vice president of sports. In August 1979, he left the network to help create ESPN, where he rose to executive vice president and chief operating officer.
        After leaving ESPN, Mr. Connal formed ConCom Inc., a production and consulting company he started with his family, in January 1987.
        In nearly five decades in TV production, he was involved in some of televised sports' more famous moments. On Nov. 17, 1968, Mr. Connal, then NBC's manager of sports programs, unsuccessfully tried from his home to persuade the technicians on duty not to switch from the final minutes of a late-running Jets-Oakland Raiders game to a movie for children. After fans flooded the network with calls as the Raiders rallied to win, the incident gained fame as the ''Heidi'' game.
        Mr. Connal is survived by his wife, Mathilde; his mother, Catherine; a brother, Peter; eight children, and 11 grandchildren.
