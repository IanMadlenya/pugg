        Michio Hoshino, a photographer known for his pictures of bears and other wildlife, was mauled to death by a brown bear last month on the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Russia. He was in his mid-40's and lived in Fairbanks, Alaska.
        The Japanese newspaper Mainichi reported that Mr. Hoshino -- who moved to Alaska from his native Japan in 1978 -- was on the peninsula as part of a team making a documentary film about brown bears when he was attacked and killed on Aug. 8. The documentary was for a Japanese television network.
        ''Hoshino was attacked by the bear in his tent on the bank of a lake at about 4 A.M.,'' the newspaper said. The other team members ''heard Hoshino's screams and came running, but the bear dashed into the woods dragging Hoshino,'' Mainichi said. Searchers later found his body in the woods.
        Mr. Hoshino's book ''Moose,'' published by Chronicle in 1988, was praised by Forbes magazine for its ''startling shots of bulls in battle for their own breeding territory.'' The Chicago Tribune called his 1987 book, ''Grizzly'' (Chronicle), a ''bold and beautiful saga'' in which he followed ''a family of Alaskan grizzlies meandering through the seasons.''
        He was also the author of a work for children, ''The Grizzly Bear Family Book'' (North-South, 1994).
        He is survived by his wife, Naoko, and a son, Homa, both of Fairbanks.
