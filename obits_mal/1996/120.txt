        Michael Pollon, a former executive director of the Westchester Conservatory of Music in White Plains, N.Y., died on Tuesday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 82.
        Mr. Pollon's long association with the school began in 1938, when he joined the staff shortly after coming to the United States. He taught piano and music theory for 26 years before becoming director in 1964. At that point, there were  47 students; when he retired in 1985, enrollment stood at 745. The school now serves some 2,500 students and is affiliated with Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. Among its graduates are the pianist Garrick Ohlsson and the composer Todd Machover.
        Mr. Pollon was born in Vienna, studied piano and musicology in Berlin and was a graduate of the Music Academy in Prague, where he studied composition and  conducting under George Szell.
        He helped found the Westchester Arts Council in 1965 and founded the Music Educators League of Westchester in the 1970's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eve Frankl; a daughter, Ann Caroline,  of Manhattan, and a brother, Heinz Pollak of Vienna.
