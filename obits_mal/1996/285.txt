        Sheldon K. Beren, an oil executive who championed Orthodox Jewish education,  died on Monday at the Texas Medical Center in Houston, where he was being treated for cancer. He was 73 and lived in Denver.
        At his death he owned the Berenenergy Corporation of Denver, a family business engaged in oil exploration and production.
        He was born in Marietta, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University and worked as a researcher for the Army before starting  his business career.
        Like other members of his family, Mr. Beren supported numerous Jewish causes  in the United States and Israel. His beneficiaries included Yeshiva University and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Eichanan Theological Seminary, the American Committee for Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem, Boys Town of Jerusalem and several Orthodox rabbinical seminaries on the East Coast.
        Mr. Beren was most widely known for his work on behalf of Jewish education. Since 1984 he had served as president of the National Society of Hebrew Day Schools, an umbrella organization for more than 550 Orthodox Jewish schools in the United States. He also was chairman of the regional vice presidents of Agudath Israel of America, the national Orthodox Jewish coalition.
        In Denver he was president and treasurer of Yeshiva Toras Chaim for boys and  Beth Jacob High School for Girls, both of which attract students from far beyond Colorado.
        Mr. Beren is survived by his wife, Miriam; five sons, Rabbi Zev Beren and Jonathan, David and Daniel, all of Denver, and Shea, of Lakewood, N.J.; two daughters, Dena Grossman of Lakewood and Cheryl Feldberger of Denver; a brother, Robert M. Beren of Wichita, Kan.; a sister, Lela Gae Jacoby of Los Angeles, and  many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
