        Robert Holloway, the wardrobe master at American Ballet Theater, died on Monday after collapsing on a street in Brooklyn, where he lived. He was 62. The cause was cardiac arrest, said his brother Wayne.
        Born in West Plains, Mo., Mr. Holloway began his professional career dancing in ''The Song of Norway'' at Jones Beach and appeared at Radio City Music Hall. He went on to perform with the American Festival Ballet in Europe, with the Jose Limon Dance Company in South America and with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet. He joined Ballet Theater as a dancer in 1964 and became wardrobe master in 1965.
        In addition to Wayne, of Denver, he is survived by two other brothers, Ron, of Snohomish, Wash., and Richard, of Hampstead, Md.
