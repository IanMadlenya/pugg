        Joseph Milton Glasco, an artist and sculptor, died on May 31 at the University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital in Galveston. He was 71 and lived in Galveston.
        The cause was heart failure, said David Jones, the trustee of the Joseph Glasco Charitable Foundation.
        Mr. Glasco's paintings and sculpture were widely shown at New York museums and galleries from the 1950's to the 1970's and ranged from stylized figures to completely abstract imagery.
        His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum  of Modern Art, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City; the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston.
        Mr. Glasco, who was born in Pauls Valley, Okla., attended the University of Texas and was in the Army during World War II. After the war, he studied at the  Portsmouth Art School in Bristol, England, and at the School of Painting and Sculpture, in San Miguel d'Allende, Mexico. He came to New York City in the late 1940's and enrolled at the Art Students League.
        He is survived by a brother, Michael, and a sister, Anne Brawley, both of Dallas.
