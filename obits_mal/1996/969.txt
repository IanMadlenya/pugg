        Frank Kuenstler, a poet and film maker, died on Aug. 11 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was esophageal cancer,  said his daughter, Emily.
        Mr. Kuenstler's first poems appeared in the 1960's in ''The Eventorium Muse,'' a quarterly journal. During this time he also began creating the first of his many wall sculptures, wood assemblages that included found objects. In the late 60's, Mr. Kuenstler made three films, ''Color Idioms,'' ''Two Plays by Serge Gavronsky'' and ''Our Magazine No. 1.''
        His books of poetry include ''Lens,'' ''Paradise News,'' ''Fugitives'' and ''Miscellany.'' His final work, ''The Seafarer, B.Q.E. and Other Poems,'' is to be published in the fall by Cairn Editions.
        In addition to his daughter, of Santa Fe, N.M., he is survived by his mother, Rose, of Manhattan.
