        Dr. Roy Craig Swan, a retired chairman of anatomy at Cornell University Medical College noted for his research in kidney and skeletal muscle physiology, died on April 26 at an extended-care center in Camden, Me. A Camden resident, he was 75.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        He was an author, with his brother, Dr. Kenneth G. Swan, of "Gunshot Wounds: Pathophysiology and Management" (Yearbook Medical Publishers; second edition, 1989). A standard textbook, it is used by medical schools, emergency services workers and medical examiners.
        Dr. Swan, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University in 1941 and received his M.D. from Cornell in 1947. He joined the Cornell faculty in 1953.
        In 1959, he was appointed full professor and department chairman, which he remained for 18 years. In 1970, he was named the Joseph C. Hinsey Professor of Anatomy.
        In addition to his brother Kenneth, of South Orange, N.J., Dr. Swan is survived by his wife, Beatrice Gremaud Swan; their children, Chantal and Malcolm; three sons by a previous marriage, R. Craig 3d, of Waukegan, Ill., Brian MacD., of Rockport, Me., and Kyle MacK., of Irvington, N.Y.; a sister, Barbara Christiansen of San Diego; another brother, Bruce, of Weston, Conn., and a granddaughter. His earlier marriage, to the former Marian Morse of Philadelphia, ended in divorce.
