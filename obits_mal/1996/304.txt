        David Durand, a former professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a pioneer in applying statistical tools to problems in financial markets, died on Monday at the M.I.T. Infirmary in Cambridge, Mass. He was 83 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        The cause was aplastic anemia, a blood disorder, his family said.
        As a professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., Mr. Durand applied sampling analysis to subjects like consumer loan defaults and farm mortgages.
        He Durand developed the statistical explanation for why long-term bonds usually have a higher yield than those with shorter terms. "Everyone understands that today, but he was the first to document it," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and fellow M.I.T. professor. said.
        Working in the 1950's, when computers were still primitive, Mr. Durand used punched-card equipment for statistical tabulation. As eagerly as he constructed  mathematical models, colleagues and former students said, Mr. Durand used the results as an aid to judgment rather than the final answer. "Frequently this did not endear him to those enamored of a model," said Don Lewin, a former doctoral  student of Mr. Durand and now a consultant in York, Pa.
        Mr. Durand wrote a textbook on statistical techniques, "Stable Chaos" (General Learning Press) and was for many years an associate editor of Financial Management.
        He was reared in Ithaca, N.Y., and received a bachelor of arts degree from Cornell University in 1934. He received his master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University.
        Before joining M.I.T. in 1953, he was associated with the National Bureau of  Economic Research and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, Edith Durand of Lexington, and a daughter, Marie  Durand of Princeton.
