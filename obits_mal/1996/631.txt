        C. Speed Veal, who helped plant the advertising slogan "Get a Piece of the Rock" in American consciousness, died May 4 at the Florence Nightingale Nursing  Home in New York. He was 78.
        Mr. Veal died of Parkinson's disease, his wife, Charlotte Kelly Veal, said.
        Mr. Veal was the vice president of advertising for the Prudential Insurance  Company of America from 1978 until 1981, and during his tenure the company's slogan, "Get a Piece of the Rock," hit television. The campaign was run by Ted Bates Worldwide, which in 1987 was merged with Backer & Spielvogel.
        Mr. Veal, who joined Prudential in 1954, had a long career at the company. Before becoming director of advertising, he was director of the company's community affairs and of its public relations office.
        His penchant for catchy tunes helped to propel his career. He began in 1940,  after graduating from Duke University as a member of Phi Beta Kappa, as the manager of WJHP Radio in Jacksonville, Fla., and was host of a daily program, "Speed Veal, Your Morning Man About Music." He was a longtime member of the University Glee Club, which gives annual concerts at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and was a founder of the Jacksonville Symphony. At Duke he was concertmaster of the university's orchestra.
        Mr. Veal was born in Landing, Ky.  He is survived by his wife, who lives in New York, and two brothers, Norvin of Ponte Vedra, Fla., and Holliday, of Pensacola, Fla.
