        Charles S. Gelber, a New York interior designer-contractor who volunteered his services to homeless people with H.I.V. and AIDS, died on Dec. 7 at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said Charles Ching, his companion.
        Mr. Gelber was the founder and president emeritus of the Institute of Business Designers, representing contract designers for nonresidential interiors. It has since merged into the wider International Interior Design Association, based in Chicago.
        Mr. Gelber, a native of Brooklyn, flew missions as a bomber-navigator out of Britain in World War II. He then trained for his profession at the Parsons School of Design and the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris.
        He worked as a contract designer with W. B. Wood & Co. and then on his own as Charles S. Gelber Design Group. His clients included the Law Library and Graduate Business School of New York University, the United States Mission to the United Nations and the United States Military Academy.
        In later years, he led volunteer teams that outfitted hundreds of apartments for homeless people. He worked with community service agencies like Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services.
        Most recently he helped the Actors Fund turn the Aurora, a long-vacant building at 57th Street and 10th Avenue, into a haven for people with AIDS and for elderly and low-income residents of the neighborhood.
        Other than Mr. Ching, there are no immediate survivors.
