        Sandor Iharos of Hungary, a middle-distance and distance runner who broke seven world records in 14 months in 1955 and 1956, has died in Budapest. He was  65 years old.
        The announcement was made yesterday by the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world governing body of track and field, from its offices in Monte Carlo. It said Mr. Iharos died Tuesday or yesterday. No cause of death was given.
        For a minimally muscled man of 5 feet 11 inches and 132 pounds who never ran until his late teens, Mr. Iharos progressed quickly. He set 11 world records, and he ranked with compatriots Laszlo Tabori and Istvan Rozsavolgyi among the world's elite runners. All three were coached by Mihaly Igloi.
        From May 14, 1955, to July 16, 1956, Mr. Iharos set world records for 1,500 meters (3 minutes 40.8 seconds), 3,000 meters (7:55.6), two miles (8:33.4), three miles (13:14.2), 5,000 meters (13:40.6), six mil's (27:43.8) and 10,000 meters (28:42.8). The 10,000-meter record came in his first race at that distance.
        He was a favorite for the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne, Australia, but on  Nov. 3, three weeks before the Olympics began, he withdpew, saying a dislocated  ankle had not fully healed. That was also the time of the Hungarian rebellion against Soviet occupying troops. Mr. Iharos, an army captain, left Hungary, ostensibly for treatment on his ankle.
