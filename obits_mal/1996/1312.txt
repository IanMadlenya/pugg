        Charles E. Woodruff, a former vice chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust, died on Nov. 2 in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 80 years old and lived in Key Largo, Fla., and Linville, N.C.
        He died of leukemia, said a spokesman for the Chase Manhattan Bank, the successor to Manufacturers Hanover, after mergers with Chemical Bank and Chase.
        Mr. Woodruff began his career in 1947 when the bank was called the Hanover Bank. After working in many posts, including executive vice president, he retired in 1976. His work brought him into frequent contact with oil and gas companies, and he was a member of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the American Petroleum Institute and the Petroleum Club of Houston.
        Along with the post at Manufacturers Hanover, he was on many corporate boards, including Barnett Banks, West Point-Pepperell and the LTV Corporation.
        Born in Bayonne, N.J., Mr. Woodruff received undergraduate and master's degrees from New York University. In World War II, he served nearly four years in the Navy, being discharged as a lieutenant senior grade.
        Surviving him are his wife, Caroline Marie, of Key Largo; a daughter, Caroline May; a sister, Betty Earl; a brother, Richard Woodruff, and a grandson.
