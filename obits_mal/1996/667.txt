        William Howard Quasha, a lawyer who fought under Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines and stayed behind to form one of the country's leading law firms, died last Sunday in St. Luke's Hospital in Manila. He was 83 and lived in Manila.
        He was a member of the Manila-based firm of Quasha Asperilla Ancheta Pena & Nolasco. He formed the law office in 1946 as William H. Quasha & Associates.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Quasha earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering in 1933 and 1935. A year later he received his law degree at St. John's University and practiced in New York until he joined the Army in 1942.
        He served on the staff of General MacArthur in the Pacific and reached the rank of lieutenant colonel. He won a Bronze Star, and the Philippine Legion of Honor and Liberation Medal.
        At his death he was chairman and president of St. Luke's Medical Center in Manila. He also served as chairman of the Republicans Abroad Committee in the Philippines.
        Mr. Quasha's survivors include his wife, Isabel Abad Santos Quasha; two sons, Wayne of London and Alan of Manhattan; and two daughters, Jill, also of Manhattan, and Angelina of Manila.
