        Ernest Dale, an academic, author and management consultant to leading corporations, died on Aug. 16 in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was a cerebral aneurysm, his son, Dorian, said.
        Among Mr. Dale's many books were ''The Great Organizers'' (1960) and ''Management: Theory and Practice'' (1965), which was used as a text in college management courses.
        He was a consultant in the 1950's and 1960's with Du Pont, I.B.M. and Unilever. He was on the boards of Olivetti, Upjohn and Renault.
        Born in Hamburg, Germany, he received a doctorate in economics from Yale in 1950 and taught business administration at Columbia University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.
        In addition to his son, Dorian, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Heddy, also of Manhattan, a brother, Charles, of Wilmington, Del., and two grandchildren.
