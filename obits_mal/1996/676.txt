        The Rev. Robert Hearn, a priest who was wounded twice in World War II, died on Thursday at the St. Patrick's Manor nursing home in Framingham, Mass. He was  92.
        Father Hearn was born and reared in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston and began studying for the priesthood at age 14, entering the Redemptorist Preparatory College in Pennsylvania. He was ordained in 1930. He worked first as a priest in Pennsylvania mining towns and a missionary in Brazil before becoming a civilian chaplain in 1940. He applied for an Army commission the following year so he could minister to front-line troops.
        In 1941, after jungle training in Panama, he went to New Guinea. He was wounded there while taking communion to soldiers in a lull in the fighting.
        Father Hearn was later sent to the Philippines, where he was wounded in the leg while carrying wounded soldiers.
        He served two tours in Korea before retiring as a colonel in 1957. He was assigned for many years to the Holy Rosary Parish in Greenwood Lake, N.Y.
