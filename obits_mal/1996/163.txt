        Mr. Gillette published several trade newsletters about the wine industry and  was regarded as an expert on the wine-making business. In 1974 he was the host of a public television show on wine appreciation, "Enjoying Wine With Paul Gillette."
        "Play Misty for Me," about a woman who becomes homicidally obsessed with a disk jockey, was published in 1971 and was made into a movie starring Clint Eastwood and Jessica Walter. The movie, which some critics compared to Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," was Mr. Eastwood's debut as a director.

        His other books included "Carmela," "The Chinese Godfather," "Cat-o'-Nine-Tails," "One of the Crowd," "The Lopison Case" and "Inside the Ku Klux Klan."
