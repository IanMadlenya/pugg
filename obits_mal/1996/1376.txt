        William H. Bowen, a lawyer and venture capitalist, died last Thursday at his Dallas home. He was 80.
        He was a graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard Law School
        and first practiced law at the firm Chapman & Cutler in Chicago. He was soon named the firm's youngest partner.
        While at Chapman & Cutler, Mr. Bowen came to the attention of Clinton Murchison Sr., the Texas wildcatter who, along with Sid Richardson,  made a fortune in oil in the 1920's.
        Mr. Murchison persuaded Mr. Bowen to move to Dallas to work with his businesses, and in 1951 Mr. Bowen co-founded the Dallas firm Jenkens & Bowen, which later became Jenkens & Gilchrist.
        After a few years Mr. Bowen left the firm to become a vice president  for investments for Mr. Murchison.
        In the late 1950's Mr. Bowen went on his own, using an enterprise he established while in Chicago, Business Capital of Chicago, as an umbrella for his own investments.
        The company, later renamed Dallas Business Capital, made scores of investments in businesses across the country, but mostly in the Dallas area. When he died, the bulk of Mr. Bowen's interests were concentrated in oil and gas, real estate, securities and Bag and Baggage, a retail luggage chain whose 67 outlets are concentrated in Texas and California.
        Outside of Dallas Business Capital, Mr. Bowen was also a large shareholder in Greiner Engineering, a public company that was bought by the URS Corporation in March for $73.5 million in cash and stock. He joined the company's board in 1982, was named chairman shortly thereafter and stepped down in 1995.
        Mr. Bowen is survived by his wife, Bebe Dean Bowen, of Dallas and Palm Springs, Calif.; three daughters, Meredith Bowen Phillips of Palo Alto, Calif., Patricia Bowen Sullivan of Aptos, Calif., and Linda Bowen Lewis of Dallas; a sister, Susan Gibney of San Diego, and eight grandchildren.
