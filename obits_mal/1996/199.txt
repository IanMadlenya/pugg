        Stanley (Skippy) Shapoff, a longtime horse trainer who ran second with his colt Hudson County in the 1974 Kentucky Derby, died Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, N.Y. He was 78 years old and had suffered in recent years from a heart condition.
        Mr. Shapoff was born in Louisville, where his father, Mose, was training horses at Churchill Downs. He attended the Kentucky Military Academy and won an  appointment to the United States Military Academy, but had to pass it up because he tested color-blind. He then studied at Harvard for a short time before taking up the life of a horse trainer.
        He conditioned a number of star horses, including Forever Silver, who won the Brooklyn Handicap, the Excelsior and the Nassau County Handicap in 1989; Perfect Spy, who won the Bay Shore in 1988; Silver of Silver, who won the Remsen and the In Reality Division of the Florida Stallion Stakes in 1992; Expensive Decision, winner of the Saranac in 1989 and the Kelso Handicap the next year; and Stately Wager, who won the Whirlaway and the Bay Shore in 1991.
        But his most dramatic finish probably came in the 100th anniversary Kentucky  Derby in 1974, when Hudson County ran second to Woody Stephens's Cannonade at Churchill Downs.
        Mr. Shapoff was also one of the pioneers who formed the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation for people who worked in the stable areas of race tracks.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Louise, and twin sons, Edward and Cary.
