        William Richard Geiler, a retired New York State Supreme Court justice and former Republican leader of Huntington, L.I., died on Saturday in a nursing home in Dallas. A longtime Huntington resident, he was 79.
        Justice Geiler was elected to the State Supreme Court in Suffolk County in 1966 and won re-election in 1980. He retired in 1993.
        For a good part of his tenure, his docket was crowded with cases involving the Long Island Lighting Company as a defendant or complainant. Litigants were legion, including Suffolk County, town boards and residents who did not like what the company had done, was doing or was planning to do.
        He was born in the Bronx and graduated from Fordham University. In World War  II, he commanded combat engineers in the Third Army under Gen. George S. Patton  and won battlefield promotions to lieutenant colonel, along with two Silver Stars, a Bronze Star, the Legion of Merit and the Croix de Guerre.
        He graduated from Fordham Law School in 1946 and practiced in Huntington for  20 years. He served as Republican town leader from 1962 until his election to the bench.
        Justice Geiler is survived by two sons, William R. Jr., of Dallas and Mark, of Huntington; a daughter, Joan G. Alexander, also of Huntington, and four grandchildren.
