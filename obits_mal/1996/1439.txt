        Kermit Gamaliel Bailer, a Detroit lawyer who spent most of his career working on behalf of rights groups and in public service, including civil rights assignments in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, died on Nov. 30 at his home in Detroit. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He was born in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan.
        In 1949, he earned a law degree at Wayne State University and went into private practice, taking time out in the 1950's for a stint as assistant prosecutor for Wayne County.
        He also worked for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and took part in campaigns to register voters and to integrate the Detroit Police Department.
        President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 1961 to work on urban renewal and public housing. In the following years, he handled legal matters for what became the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
        He left Washington in 1967 to handle the Model Cities Program for Berkeley, Calif. Returning to Detroit in 1975, he was corporation counsel for Mayor Coleman A. Young.
        He also worked at the Ford Motor Company, from 1977 to 1992. He remained active in the firm Hylton & Hylton until his illness forced him to curtail his practice two months ago.
        He is survived by his wife of 29 years, Penny Naylor Bailer; two daughters, Mary Margaret Hill of Washington and Kelly Gabrielle Bailer of Detroit; two sons, Byron C., of Rockville, Md., and Ryan K., of Chicago; a brother, Harold, of Detroit, and four grandsons. His first marriage, to Maryann Clemon Bailer, of Washington, ended in divorce.
