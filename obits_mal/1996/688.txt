        Dr. Percy Klingenstein, who was associated with the Mount Sinai Hospital and  Medical Center for more than 75 years, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan.  The Mount Sinai Alumni Association commemorated his 100th birthday -- along with its own centennial -- in January.
        Dr. Klingenstein, a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai Medical School, graduated from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He started his career at Mount Sinai as a resident in pathology in 1919 and completed his surgical internship in 1922.
        Until his formal retirement in 1971, Dr. Klingenstein saw patients and taught.
        He was born and raised in New York City and served in World War II as chief of surgery of the Third General Hospital of the United States Army. The unit cared for the wounded in North Africa and Europe, and Dr. Klingenstein went home as a lieutenant colonel.
        Dr. Klingenstein supported programs that enhanced Mount Sinai's twin functions as a hospital and teaching institution, including the establishment of the Percy Klingenstein Medical Student Aid Fund.
        Dr. Klingenstein is survived by a daughter, Jean Klingenstein of Chicago; two sons, William, of Purchase, N.Y., and Richard, of Denver; his companion, Ruth M. Blumenthal, and three grandchildren. His wife, Carroll Sheridan Klingenstein, died in 1976.
