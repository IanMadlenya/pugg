        Samuel Eisenstein, a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist in Los Angeles and past president of the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, died on Oct. 14 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Eisenstein, who also helped found the San Diego Psychoanalytic Institute, was credited with devising an innovative program for training research psychoanalysts. It educates academicians in clinical and theoretical psychoanalysis through interdisciplinary instruction. His purpose was to broaden the participants' perceptions of their own metiers and in turn enhance psychoanalysis through such interactions.
        Dr. Eisenstein was the dean of the Training School of the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute, in Beverly Hills, from 1969 to 1977 and was the institute's president from 1980 to 1982. He was the first psychiatric resident and then a member of the attending and teaching staff at Cedars-Sinai, as well as an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Southern California School of Medicine.
        Samuel Eisenstein was born in Bacau, Romania, and studied in Italy, where he received his medical degree at the University of Pavia in 1946. He came to the United States in 1948 and started his private practice in Los Angeles two years later.
        He was co-editor of ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers,'' a history of psychoanalysis published by Basic Books in 1966 and reissued last year. He was also co-author of ''The Dyadic Transaction: An Investigation Into the Nature of the Psychotherapeutic Process'' (Transaction, 1994).
        Dr. Eisenstein is survived by his wife, Grace; a daughter, Helen Zukin, of Los Angeles; two sons, Dan, of Los Angeles, and Lee, of Oahu, Hawaii; two brothers, Edward Steele and Dr. David Eisenstein; a sister, Judith Black, all of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.
