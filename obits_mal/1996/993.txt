        William Zaro, a founder and former co-president of the Zaro's Bread Basket shops dotting New York City and its environs, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. A former resident of Bergenfield, N.J., he was 81 and lived in Boca Raton, Fla.
        The cause was a heart ailment, his family said.
        Mr. Zaro, who was born in Lublin, Poland, was brought to New Jersey as a teen-ager and in the midst of the Depression, was put to work in the small bakery his father had opened in Newark. He and his younger brother Philip went to build Zaro Bakeshop Inc., which has since grown to 12 stores selling baked goods in New York City, Westchester County and northern New Jersey.
        The chain includes the flagship location in Grand Central Terminal. A more recent addition is a 40,000-square-foot factory on Bruckner Boulevard in the South Bronx that keeps stores stocked.
        William Zaro retired as co-president in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ruth Imberman Zaro; his brother Philip, of Harrison, N.Y., the chairman of Zaro's, whose sons Stuart and Joseph are now the company's co-presidents. Also surviving are two daughters, Maxine Peckar of Tenafly, N.J., and Beth Green of Scarsdale, N.Y.; another brother, Sam D., and a sister, Claire Shostak, both of Fort Lee, N.J., three grandchildren and two stepgrandchildren.
