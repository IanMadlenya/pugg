        Robert C. Alberts, a writer and biographer, died on Tuesday at St. Clair Memorial Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 89 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        Mr. Alberts was a student of 18th-century American history and chose as his first subject a daring colonist who played a role in the British capture of Quebec during the French and Indian War. The book, ''The Most Extraordinary Adventures of Major Robert Stobo'' (1965), was hailed as an exciting true-life tale.
        His other books included ''The Golden Voyage: The Life and Times of William Bingham, 1752-1804'' (1970), the story of a wealthy Philadelphia merchant who played a prominent role in the Revolutionary War; ''The Good Provider: H. J. Heinz and His 57 Varieties'' (1973), about the founder of the company that bears his name, and ''Benjamin West: A Biography'' (1978), a highly regarded portrait of the first American painter to gain international recognition.
        He is survived by his wife, Zita.
