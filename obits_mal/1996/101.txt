        Bill Nyrop, a defenseman with three Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadien teams, died of cancer on Sunday. He was 43.
        Mr. Nyrop, a college star at Notre Dame, played with the Canadien title winners of 1976, 1977 and 1978 and was a member of the 1978 National Hockey League All-Star team.
        He left the Canadiens before the 1978-79 season to enter private business and did not play again until the 1981-82 season when he joined the Minnesota North Stars. A year later, he retired again and went to law school. He had a law practice in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.
        Mr. Nyrop is survived by his wife, Mandy; two daughters, Jessica and Hannah;  his father, Donald Nyrop of Edina, Minn., a former chief executive officer of Northwest Airlines; and three sisters, Nancy Scherer of Edina, Kathryn Nyrop of  San Francisco and Karen Nyrop of Phoenix.
