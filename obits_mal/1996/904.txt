        Fred Hift, a journalist and former film executive, died on July 6 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Hift, who was born in Vienna, settled in Chicago, where he wrote for The Chicago Sun, and then moved to New York City in 1941. He joined The New York Times in 1946 and wrote a number of articles about film before moving to Variety in 1950. In the 1960's, the 20th Century-Fox studio appointed him director of advertising and publicity for Europe and the Middle East.
        He is survived by his wife, Bernice; two daughters, Dr. Christina Hift-Demar  and Dr. Kathe Hift-Stern, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
