        Dr. Edward David Lustbader, an expert in biostatistics at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, died last Thursday at Abington Memorial Hospital. He was 49 and lived in Maple Glen, Pa.
        The cause was cancer, according to the Fox Chase center, where he was being treated.
        Dr. Lustbader, the author or co-author of more than 100 scientific papers, focused on the development and application of statistical methods for detecting the causes of cancer. He investigated the genetic basis of cancer and  the relationship between diet and cancer.
        He belonged to a team led by Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg, winner of a Nobel Prize  in 1976, that identified the hepatitis B virus and its role in liver cancer.
        Born in Baltimore, he graduated from Case Institute of Technology in 1967 and earned a doctorate in statistics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1972. He joined Fox Chase that year as a statistician.
        Dr. Lustbader is survived by his wife of 26 years, Susan Loeb Lustbader; their 18-year-old twins, Beth and Joshua; his parents, William and Evelyn Lustbader of Baltimore and Delray Beach, Fla; two brothers, Philip, of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Jay, of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Sara Lustbader-Tucker of Highland, Md.
