        Msgr. James F. Kelley, who became president of Seton Hall College at age 33 and guided its transformation from a tiny liberal arts college to a large university, died on Tuesday at the Medical Center of Ocean County in Brick, N.J. He was 94.
        Monsignor Kelley was pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Ridgewood, N.J., after leaving Seton Hall. He served the Ridgewood parish until retiring 20 years ago and moving to Rumson.
        He was named president of Seton Hall on July 9, 1936, becoming the youngest college president in the United States. Eighteen days later, he turned 34.
        The college in South Orange, N.J., then had two departments, liberals arts and sciences, and about 300 students. When he completed his presidency in 1949, after opening the doors to thousands of returning veterans, it had 11 undergraduate departments, 2 graduate divisions and more than 13,000 students. It now has about 9,500 students.
        ''He turned it into a university,'' Msgr. Walter Jarvis, who is 92 and taught at Seton Hall for 29 years, said yesterday, ''and his door was always open.''
        Seton Hall gained university status in 1950, a year after Monsignor Kelley stepped down.
        ''Monsignor Kelley has left a valuable legacy to generations of Seton Hall University students,'' said Msgr. Robert Sheeran, Seton Hall's current president.
        In the first year of his presidency, Father Kelley ordered the creation of a division for female students, offering classes in late afternoons and evenings and on weekends. Before long, women were admitted as full-time students.
        While Monsignor Kelley was president, Seton Hall's Walsh Gymnasium was built and the campus radio station, WSOU, was founded.
        Born in Kearny, N.J., Monsignor Kelley attended Seton Hall Preparatory School and graduated from the college in 1924. He studied at the American College in Belgium from 1924 until 1928, when he was ordained in Louvain, Belgium. He received a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Louvain in 1935.
        On April 20, 1941, he was named a monsignor by Pope Pius XII, whom he had taught English in Belgium.
        From 1947 to 1949, he was president of the New Jersey Association of Colleges and Universities. From 1951 to 1968, he was chaplain for the Ridgewood police and fire departments and the Ridgewood Knights of Columbus.
        From 1960 to 1968, Monsignor Kelley was a member of the Ridgewood Juvenile Delinquency Committee. He was vice president of the Bergen County Narcotics and Drug Abuse Council from 1966 to 1967 and president from 1967 to 1968. He was also president of the Association of Bergen County Priests from 1966 to 1968.
