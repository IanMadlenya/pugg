        Petro Y. Shelest, a former Communist Party chief here who was ousted for defending the Ukrainian language and culture against Russian influence in the 1960's, died in Moscow this week, the Ukrainian Embassy there said today. He was 87.
        Mr. Shelest headed Soviet Ukraine's Communist Party from 1963 to 1972 and was a doctrinaire Marxist-Leninist. But he encouraged the people of the second-most-populous Soviet republic to use the language repressed by czars and  Communist-era leaders in Moscow and promoted its use in schools and universities.
        Shelest was one of the first in the Soviet era to lay the cornerstone for Ukrainian statehood," said Petro Tolochko, vice president of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. "He was a party man in the Soviet mold, but in his heart he felt where Ukraine's interests lay and acted in favor of national development, as much as this was permitted."
        Mr. Shelest, whose first name has also been rendered as Pyotr, was removed as party chief in 1972 after he was accused of encouraging Ukrainian nationalism and economic "localism" instead of promoting the interests of the Soviet Union as a whole.
        Sent to Moscow after his removal, he was a Soviet Deputy Prime Minister for a year under Prime Minister Aleksei N. Kosygin. But historians say he got along badly with Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, and wound up as director of a  military factory outside Moscow, where he remained until his retirement.
