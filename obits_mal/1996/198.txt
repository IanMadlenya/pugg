        Ralph Quattrociocchi, a four-term Democratic state senator who lost a bitter  comeback race after joining the Republican Party, died on Saturday at his home in the suburb of Greece. He was 66.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to a spokeswoman at the Park Ridge Hospital, where he was taken.
        Mr. Quattrociocchi served five terms in the Monroe County Legislature before running successfully for the State Senate in 1984. He was re-elected in 1986, 1988 and 1990 to represent the 55th District, but lost the Democratic primary to Richard A. Dollinger in 1992 after the district was redrawn.
        With the backing of the Republican and Conservative Parties, Mr. Quattrociocchi challenged Mr. Dollinger again in 1994 in the largely Democratic  54th District and lost with 45 percent of the vote.
        Mr. Quattrociocchi had taken a conservative line, pushing for the restoration of the death penalty, opposing abortion and calling the state's gun laws adequate.
        He is survived by his wife, Sharon, and four children, Stephen, of Washington, Sue-Ellen, of Rochester, Aimee, of Pittsburgh and Andrew, who is stationed with the U.S. Navy in Japan.
