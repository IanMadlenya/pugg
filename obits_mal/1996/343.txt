        Doc Tate Nevaquaya, a Comanche artist and flutist who was named an Oklahoma Treasure last fall, died on Tuesday in Comanche County Memorial Hospital in Lawton. He was 63.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Mary Pewo, a family friend.
        Mr. Nevaquaya was only the second person designated an Oklahoma Treasure, an award that recognized his preservation and sharing of the Comanche Nation's culture. In his art, he preferred to paint traditional dancers in the traditional style, depicting one-dimensional, highly detailed figures. He and his wife, Charlotte, began working with local missions in the 1960's and encouraged Indians to improve their craftsmanship and learn the meaning of their designs.
        He acquired his first flute in the 1940's, while a student at the Fort Sill Indian School. Over the years he began to make flutes from cedar and researched  Comanche music for the instrument. In 1982, he performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington with Loretta Lynn, Wayne Newton and Sammy Davis Jr. in "A Night of First Americans."
        He released two recordings, "Indian Flute Songs From Comanche Land" and "Comanche Flute Music."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by five sons and four daughters.
