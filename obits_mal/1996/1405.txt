        Harry H. Rains, a New York labor relations lawyer who represented management in the private and public sectors for nearly five decades, died on Tuesday at his home in Fort Myers, Fla. A former resident of Lattingtown Harbor, L.I., he was 87.
        Mr. Rains founded the firm of Rains & Pogrebin, with offices in Manhattan and Mineola, L.I. He started it in 1947 as a one-man practice and built it into a firm that has represented business giants like Federated Department Stores and public agencies like the New York City Board of Education.
        He was chief negotiator for a wide variety of employers, including the Fulton Fish Market, the New York fur industry, commercial construction companies and building suppliers.
        He handled cases that helped define the law governing jurisdictional disputes in the construction industry. In 1967 he served Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller as a fact finder when the Taylor Law was enacted concerning collective bargaining rights for public employees.
        Mr. Rains, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1934 and received a master's degree in labor law from New York University in 1954. He was a faculty member for a time at Hofstra University, where he endowed a chair at the law school in alternative dispute resolution.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Faslove; a daughter, Peggy Goodman of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
