        Dr. N. Bruce Hannay, a retired vice president for research and patents at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., died on June 2 at Harrison Memorial Hospital in Bremerton, Wash. He was 75 and had lived in Port Ludlow, Wash., since leaving New Jersey in 1989.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        A chemist and physicist, Dr. Hannay had a 38-year-career with Bell Labs, the systems and technology arm of AT&T and now part of Lucent Technologies. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Norman Bruce Hannay was born in Mount Vernon, Wash., and graduated from Swarthmore College in 1942. He had received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in physical chemistry by 1944, when he was associated with the Manhattan Project, which built the atomic bomb.
        He joined Bell Labs shortly before the transistor was developed there. He later led experiments with semiconductors, superconductors, lasers and related electronics. He was vice president of Bell Labs from 1973 until his retirement in 1982.
        Dr. Hannay is survived by his wife, Joan; two daughters, Robin Nelson of McLean, Va., and Brooke Beecher of Olympia, Wash., and three grandchildren.
