        Americo Alberi, an aerospace engineer who played a role in the ill-starred Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970, died on April 9 at his home in Southold, L.I. He was 82.
        Before his retirement in 1981, he was supervisor of structural analysis on the Apollo lunar module and space shuttle projects of the Grumman Aerospace Corporation in Bethpage, L.I., where he had worked for 16 years. He was a member of the team that designed the Apollo lunar module.
        An exploding oxygen tank in the service module two days into the Apollo 13 mission caused a rapid loss of electric power. The only solution was to turn the lunar module into a lifeboat, something it was never intended for, and Mr. Alberi was among the experts on the ground who feverishly worked to make that possible.
        He and his colleagues worked out serious structural problems for ground control in Houston. The three astronauts crammed into the lunar module, looped around the moon and made it precariously back to Earth.
        A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Mr. Alberi is survived by his wife, Helen; a  son, Dr. James Alberi of Summit, N.J.; a daughter, Dr. Mary A. Pinker of Ramsey, N.J.; two brothers, Albert and Dante Alberi, and two grandchildren.
