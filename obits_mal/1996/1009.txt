        David Previant, a labor lawyer who was a top adviser to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for more than three decades, died on Saturday at his home in Milwaukee. He was 85.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, the family said.
        When the teamsters came under investigation in the 1950's, Mr. Previant was often at the side of James R. Hoffa, who was a vice president of the union and became president after the teamsters' leader, Dave Beck, went to prison.
        Mr. Hoffa went to prison for jury-tampering and mail fraud in 1967 and was behind bars until being pardoned by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971. In the last days of Mr. Hoffa's prison term, the union's executive board sent Mr. Previant to ask Mr. Hoffa whether he intended to seek the presidency again. Mr. Hoffa asked for more time to decide. He did try to regain the office four years later, but he disappeared in 1975 and is believed to have been killed.
        Mr. Previant was born in Milwaukee. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin and the university's law school. For many years he was head of the American Bar Association's labor section.
        Surviving are his wife of 54 years, Lois; a son, Jonathan, of Iowa City; a daughter, Susan Lee, of Manhattan; a sister, Reva Schwartz of Milwaukee, and three grandchildren.
