        Frank H. Kenan, who founded several oil and transportation concerns and became a major benefactor of his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, as well as many other American colleges and universities, died at his home in Durham on Tuesday. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer.
        Mr. Kenan, whose family history in North Carolina spans two and one-half centuries, founded the Tops Petroleum Corporation, the Westfield Company, the Kenan Oil Company and the Kenan Transport Company. He was also the chief executive of Flagler System Companies in Florida.
        He was a director of the original Research Triangle Park and numerous other institutions in the area.
        He donated $10 million to the university, which erected the Kenan-Flagler Business School in 1991.
        He also served as a trustee for charitable trusts and foundations, including  the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust, named for a cousin. The trust has provided $312 million in grants in its 30-year history, including endowments for 95 professorships at 56 American colleges and universities.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth P. Kenan; two sons, Thomas S. 3d and Owen G., both of Chapel Hill; two daughters, Elizabeth K. Howell and Annice H. Kenan, both of Chapel Hill; a stepson, Owen Gwyn, also of Chapel Hill; four grandchildren, and two step-grandchildren.
