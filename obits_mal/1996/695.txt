        Robert Carmel, a New York real estate executive who contributed to Jewish and medical causes, died last Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59 and also  kept homes in Quogue, L.I., and Palm Beach, Fla.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Mr. Carmel, who specialized in the leasing and sales of commercial properties and office space, was a vice chairman, executive committee member and a principal of the Williams Real Estate Company. He joined the company in 1959 and helped expand the assets it owned and managed.
        With his partners, he developed 979 Third Avenue, at 58th Street; 150 East 58th Street; and 1700 Broadway, between 53d and 54th Streets, among others. Another prestigious address in the portfolio was One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, near the United Nations headquarters.
        Mr. Carmel established a chair at the New Jersey School of Medicine and Dentistry and aided the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He supported Temple Israel of the City of New York and the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale.
        Mr. Carmel is survived by his wife, Susan Johnson Carmel; a son, Bradley; a daughter, Candace C. Barasch, and two brothers, Franklin and Kenneth, all of Manhattan; his mother, Miriam, of Riverdale, the Bronx, and a grandson.
