        Jose Cuatrecasas, a research botanist at the Smithsonian Institution and the  National Science Foundation, and an expert on the flora and ecology of South and Central America, died on May 23 in Bethesda, Md. He was 93 and had lived in Washington.
        Dr. Cuatrecasas worked as a research associate for the Smithsonian's department of botany from 1955 until earlier this year, and as an investigator for the Science Foundation from 1952 until last year. The New York Botanical Garden, which published some of his books, cited him for his "outstanding contribution to the advancement of botany" in 1963.
        His taxonomic studies and explorations in tropical America, particularly Colombia, brought to light new species and aided in their classification. He had just completed a book on the flora of the northern tier of the tropical Andes.
        Dr. Cuatrecasas, born in Spain, graduated with a major in pharmacy from the University of Barcelona and earned a doctorate in pharmacy and systematic botany at the University of Madrid.
        He fled Spain after the Civil War of the 1930's and worked in Colombia and then in Chicago, where he became curator of Colombian Botany at the Natural History Museum.
        Survivors include a daughter, Teresa C. Rivera, of Mill Valley, Calif.; two sons, Gil of Barcelona, and Pedro of San Diego and Ann Arbor, Mich.; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
