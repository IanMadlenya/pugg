        The trainer Rodney Rash, who was to saddle last year's winner, Urgent Request, in the Santa Anita Handicap today, died on Friday. He was 36.
        The cause was complications from a rare blood disorder, a Santa Anita spokesman said.
        Rash entered Los Angeles Midway Hospital on Tuesday with what appeared to be severe flu. His death there Friday morning was attributed to a rare blood disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which affects the central nervous  system. Its cause is unknown.
        Rash, a native of Frederick, Md., was 16 when he went to work for the Hall of Fame trainer Charlie Whittingham. Rash struck out on his own in 1991 and saddled 143 winners out of 1,061 mounts. His horses had earnings of $8.7 million in his  five years as a trainer.
        He is survived by his mother, Doris, and two sisters, Rachelle Skinner and Susan Scardapane.
