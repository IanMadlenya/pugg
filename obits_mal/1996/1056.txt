        Leonard A. Gentine, who turned a mail-order cheese business behind his funeral home into the Sargento Cheese Company, one of the country's largest cheese makers, died on Monday at the Valley View Medical Center in his hometown, Plymouth, Wis. He was 81.
        Mr. Gentine did not begin his working life in the food business. Rather, after graduating from the Wisconsin Institute of Mortuary Sciences in 1936, he started his own funeral home in Plymouth, about 50 miles north of Milwaukee.
        But during the 1940's he began  capitalizing on the growing popularity of cheeses from his home state. First he founded the Plymouth Cheese Counter, a delicatessen and mail-order gift business, in a carriage house behind the funeral home. Two years later he created a modest specialty-processes cheese business with two partners.
        Then, in 1953, Mr. Gentine joined in  a partnership to form Sargento Cheese, now Sargento Foods Inc., based in Plymouth. He later become the company's sole owner.
        Although he remained chairman until his death, Mr. Gentine stepped down as chief executive in 1984. He was succeeded by his son Louis, and the company remains a family concern. Its annual sales of $354 million place it second only to the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies among the nation's cheese makers.
        Mr. Gentine is survived by his wife, Dolores; three sons, Lawrence and Lee, both of Plymouth, and Louis, of Elkhart Lake, Wis; a daughter, Ann Marie, of Plymouth, and 15 grandchildren.
