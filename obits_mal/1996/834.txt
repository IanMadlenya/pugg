        Leo Martinuzzi, a former executive of R. H. Macy & Company and an exporting consultant, died at his home in Garden City, L.I., on Tuesday. He was 99.
        Mr. Martinuzzi was born in Venice and educated in Switzerland and later at the University of Padua in Italy.
        He began his career at the United States Consulate in Venice during World War I and came to the United States after the war, working as an agent for the Treasury Department.
        Mr. Martinuzzi soon moved to Rome, and in the 1920's met Percy Straus, whose  family owned Macy's, the department store chain based in New York. Mr. Straus offered Mr. Martinuzzi a job running the company's Florence office.
        For 36 years, Mr. Martinuzzi was involved in foreign buying for the company.  In 1931, he moved to England, and until the outbreak of World War II headed Macy's London office.
        Mr. Martinuzzi moved back to the United States after the war began and became an American citizen.
        Mr. Martinuzzi continued his foreign buying operations for Macy's after the war, and in December 1950 was named a corporate vice president in charge of the  company's foreign offices. For a time, he had similar duties for the May Company.
        He was also a consultant on export promotion programs for the United States Government and foreign governments, including Britain, Italy, Japan and India.
        During the Eisenhower Administration, he advised on the construction of a model house to be shown at a trade show in Moscow. It was in the kitchen of that house that a famous debate between Vice President Richard M. Nixon and Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev took place.
        He is survived by two sons, Leo Jr., of Naples, Fla., and Charles S. of Ayr,  Scotland; three-grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
