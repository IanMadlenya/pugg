        Irwin R. Brownstein, a Manhattan lawyer and former Brooklyn Democratic leader, state legislator and State Supreme Court Justice, died on March 24 in Miami Beach, while on a family visit. He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Brownstein was practicing matrimonial and real estate law. He opened his office after retiring from the bench in 1980.
        He moved to the State Supreme Court in 1969 from Civil Court.
        By 1972 he was one of the judicial system's most vocal critics and was often  quoted as saying that the system was in a state of "total collapse." It was "the stepchild of the Government financially," he said, undersized, understaffed and  overwhelmed by mounting caseloads.
        For the last 30 years -- and continuing throughout his time in private practice -- he did volunteer work with drug-abuse and rehabilitation programs.
        Mr. Brownstein was born on Manhattan's Lower East Side and grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1950 and from Brooklyn Law School in 1953.
        He became an Assistant Corporation Counsel for the city and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1959. He served in the State Senate in Albany from 1964 to 1966 and moved on to Civil Court the next year.
        Mr. Brownstein is survived by a daughter, Amy, of Tucson, Ariz.; three sons,  David, of Los Angeles, Adam, of Brooklyn, and Marc, of Philadelphia, and two grandchildren.
