        Earle Swensen, who founded an ice cream chain that once boasted 400 shops around the world carrying his name, died on Saturday at California Pacific Hospital. He was 83.
        Mr. Swensen, who opened his first store here in 1948, died of heart failure.  He was earlier stricken with flu and pneumonia.
        Mr. Swensen recalled that he learned to make ice cream while serving on a troop transport in the South Pacific in World War II. He said the place where the ice cream was made was the coolest spot on the vessel.
        Mr. Swensen, who moved to Novato, in Marin County, in 1965, developed 150 flavors for his Swensen's Ice Cream Company but said his favorite was vanilla.
        The San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote of seeing Mr. Swensen at work in his original store. "Shy, unassuming Earle seems to be working 24 hours a day," Mr. Caen wrote, and he was already "on his way to becoming a shy,  unassuming multimillionaire by franchising stores."
        Mr. Swensen's survivors include three daughters, Dorothy Varellas of San Francisco, Linda Burdusis of Pleasanton, Calif., and Patti Pedroli of Novato; a  brother, Clarence, of Sonoma, Calif., and seven grandchildren. His wife, Nora, died in 1995, after 53 years of marriage.
