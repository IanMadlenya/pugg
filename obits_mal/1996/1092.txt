        John Lawrence Burns, the former chairman and chief volunteer officer of the Boys Clubs of America, died on Sunday at the Greenwich Woods Health Care Center in Greenwich, Conn. He was 87.
        Mr. Burns was elected to the board of the Boys Clubs of America, a nonprofit youth group, in 1954 and held that post for 34 years. When Mr. Burns became president of the Boys Clubs in 1968, there were 700 local clubs nationwide. He led a campaign to expand the organization to ''a thousand clubs serving one million boys'' in 10 years. The drive reached its goal in 1972, two years ahead of schedule.
        Mr. Burns also worked, always in volunteer positions, to broaden the organization's mandate, expanding its centers from being neighborhood places for sports and recreation to becoming sites that promote education, leadership training and career planning, especially for disadvantaged youth in urban areas. He donated money to the organization on several occasions and was an active fund-raiser.
        After serving as president from 1968 to 1981, Mr. Burns was named chairman, and he held that position until he retired in 1988. In the last few years of his tenure, the movement to provide services to girls as well as boys was gaining momentum.
        ''He knew something needed to be done,'' said James Caufield, the vice president for administrative services at the Boys and Girls Clubs, ''and he was open to having a dialogue with local clubs about involving girls.''
        When Mr. Burns retired in 1988, more than 80 percent of the local clubs served both girls and boys. The organization changed its name to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America in 1990.
        Mr. Burns was trained as an engineer and received a doctorate in metallurgy from Harvard University in 1934, and he worked in various industries. He ran his private investment firm in his name from 1962 to 1991, taking a hiatus from 1965 to 1968 to serve as chief executive officer of Cities Service Company, an oil company. He disbanded his investment company in 1991 and retired to Connecticut. He was also president of the RCA Corporation from 1957 through 1962, a job he was tapped for from a partnership at Booz, Allen & Hamilton, a management consulting company that had RCA as a client.
        John Burns was born in Watertown, Mass., in 1908. He graduated with a degree in engineering in 1930 from Northeastern University, received a master's degree in engineering from the Harvard University Graduate College of Engineering in 1931 and got his doctorate in 1934. Mr. Burns taught metallurgy at Harvard and at Lehigh University, but he left academia in 1934 to work on an assembly line at the Republic Steel Corporation because he wanted practical experience. He rose to head the wire division of the company by 1936. He switched careers again in 1941, to work at Booz, Allen & Hamilton.
        Mr. Burns's wife, Beryl, died in 1993; he is survived by his son, John Spinney, of California; his daughter, Lara Burns Cunningham, of Old Greenwich, Conn., and two grandchildren.
