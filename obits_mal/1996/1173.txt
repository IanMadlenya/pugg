        Dr. Gilbert Horton Mudge, a professor emeritus of medicine and pharmacology who was a former dean of Dartmouth Medical School, died on Monday at his home in Lyme, N.H. He was 81.
        He had suffered a long illness, complicated by Parkinson's disease, the school said.
        Dr. Mudge was associated with Dartmouth from 1962, when he became dean, until he retired as a teacher and researcher in 1980. His work in kidney and electrolyte physiology was widely known through his contributions to medical journals.
        He was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Amherst College and received his medical degree as well as a doctorate in medical science at Columbia University. While at Dartmouth, he was on the staff of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, having previously been associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Vanderbilt Clinic in New York and Johns Hopkins Hospital.
        He served as medical dean until 1965. After that, he devoted his time  to teaching and research.
        Dr. Mudge is survived by his wife of 55 years, Eleanor Mackenzie Mudge; three sons, George A., of Manhattan, Gilbert H. Jr., of Sherborn, Mass., and John T. B., of Etna, N.H.; a daughter, Eleanor M. Cares, of Boulder, Colo., and five grandchildren.
