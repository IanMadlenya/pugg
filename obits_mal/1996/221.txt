        Ranald Purcell Hobbs, a book publisher who developed the Rinehart Editions Series that is used widely in colleges, died last Saturday in Naples Community Hospital in Florida. He was 88 and lived in Naples.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Ranald D. Hobbs.
        Mr. Hobbs began his career in publishing in 1935 when he joined the Macmillan Company. He made his mark at Rinehart & Company, which he joined in 1943, by helping build the company's college textbook department. While there, he put together the Rinehart editions of the classics with introductions written by leading authors and experts.
        He served as executive vice president at Rinehart from 1955 to 1960, after which he became an executive vice president at the Bobbs-Merrill Company, a publisher based in Indianapolis.
        For 12 years, he also served as a consultant, vice president and treasurer with Moseley Associates, a worldwide publishing consulting firm. There, he helped set up the first indigenous publishing company in Nigeria.
        Mr. Hobbs, who graduated from Dartmouth College in 1930 with a B.A. degree in English literature, lived for 40 years in Darien, Conn., but also maintained an  apartment in Indianapolis during his tenure with Bobbs-Merrill.
        He was a member of the American Publishers Textbook Institute, serving as chairman of the college section and as a member of the board.
        In addition to his son in San Francisco, he is survived by his wife, Vera, of Naples, and his daughter Linda Hobbs Young of Scottsdale, Ariz.
