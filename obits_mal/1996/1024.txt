        George Andrew Kolstad, who launched and managed Federal research programs in nuclear physics, applied mathematics and geosciences, died on Aug. 7 at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore. He was 76 and lived in Laytonsville, Md.
        The cause was complications from surgery on an aortic aneurysm, his family said.
        Dr. Kolstad joined the fledgling Atomic Energy Commission in 1950 to work on physics and mathematics programs in its research division. He was promoted to division chief two years later.
        At the commission, he was instrumental in research and development for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. As an assistant director for physics and mathematics programs he played a leading role in projects involving high-energy physics, controlled thermonuclear fusion and work being done at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University and the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility.
        He became a senior scientist at the Energy Research and Development Administration. He later headed Department of Energy geosciences research programs designed to learn more about the earth's crust and structure. He retired in 1990.
        Born in Elmira, N.Y., he graduated from Bates College in 1943 and earned a doctorate in physics at Yale University in 1948.
        Dr. Kolstad is survived by his wife of 52 years, Christine Stillman Kolstad; a daughter, Martha R. K. Wilhelm of Grinnell, Iowa; two sons, Charles D., of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Peter K., of Los Angeles; three brothers, Kenneth, of Colorado Springs, John, of Wichita, Kan., and Edward, of Rochester; a sister, Marjorie Malm, also of Rochester, and four grandchildren.
