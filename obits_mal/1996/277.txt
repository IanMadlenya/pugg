        Del Ennis, a slugging outfielder for the Philadelphia Phillies and a star on  the 1950 National League pennant-winning team dubbed the Whiz Kids, died last Thursday at his home in Huntingdon Valley, Pa. He was 70.
        The cause of death was complications from diabetes, the Phillies said.
        A native of Philadelphia, Ennis broke into the major leagues with the Phillies in 1946 after one season of low minor league ball and then naval service in the South Pacific. Eleven weeks after his debut, he became the first  Phillies rookie ever to be selected to an All-Star team, and he finished his first season with a .313 average. He was also named an All-Star in 1951 and 1955.
        He spent 14 seasons in the major leagues, 11 of them with Philadelphia, and had a career batting average of .284 with 2,063 hits and 288 home runs.
        But he played in an era when batting prowess meant only small change by today's salary standards.
        "I had it put in my contract that I'd get paid an extra $5,000 for 105 r.b.i.'s, $10,000 for 110 r.b.i.'s, $15,000 for 115 r.b.i.'s and $20,000 for 120 or more r.b.i.'s," he once recalled. "Three times I would collect the biggest bonus."
        His best season was 1950, when he hit .311, led the National League in runs batted in with 126 and hit 31 homers. That year, teaming up with Robin Roberts,  Curt Simmons, Jim Konstanty, Granny Hamner and Richie Ashburn, he helped bring the Phillies their first pennant since 1915 in an exciting finish that saq Philadelphia beat out the Brooklyn Dodgers. But the team was swept in the World  Series by the Yankees.
        After his retirement, he operated a bowling alley and bred greyhound race dogs. He remembered his old teammates on the '50 Phillies in his sports enterprise, calling three dogs scheduled to run in Florida this spring Whiz Kid  Ennis, Whiz Kid Ashburn and Whiz Kid Roberts.
        He is survived by his wife, Liz; two sons, Del Jr. and David; four daughters, Debbie Anthony, Darlene McCullough, Lisa Malone and Donna Robinson; 13 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild.
