        William S. Lee, former chairman and chief executive of the Duke Power Company and a strong supporter of nuclear power, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center while visiting New York City from his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 67.
        The cause was heart disease, said a spokesman for Duke Power, one of the nation's largest utilities, based in Charlotte.
        After the accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania in March 1979 raised widespread concern about the future of nuclear power, Mr. Lee  argued that the United States continue to support it. While the staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended that all power plants using the same kind of reactor as at Three Mile Island be closed for a time, he maintained that much had been learned about the reactors from the accident and that the plants should be allowed to keep operating.
        Mr. Lee, a native of Charlotte, graduated from Princeton University with a degree in civil engineering and joined Duke Power in 1955 as a junior engineer.  He became president and chief operating officer in 1978.
        By then, Duke had largely completed construction of its nuclear plants, which were built at low cost and have since been a source of big profits for the utility.
        Mr. Lee was named chairman and chief executive in 1982. Under his leadership, the company continued to expand its nuclear generating capacity in the 1980's and created a division that helped other utilities build and run their own nuclear plants.
        He also led the effort to form the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations in 1979 and the World Association of Nuclear Operators in 1987. The groups were created to improve the safety and operation of nuclear plants throughout the world.
        Mr. Lee, who retired in 1994, is survived by his wife, Jan; a son, States Lee of Charlotte, and two daughters, Lisa Lee-Morgan of Charlotte and Helen Lee of Raleigh, N.C.
