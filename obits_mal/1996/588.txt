        George S. Boolos, a professor of linguistics and philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the president of the Association for Symbolic Knowledge, died on Monday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 55.
        The cause was cancer of the pancreas, said his wife, Sally Sedgwick, a professor of philosophy at Dartmouth College.
        Professor Boolos, a prominent logician and philosopher, was known internationally as one of the originators of provability logic, the study of the logic of statements and what can and cannot be proved within mathematical systems.
        He was recently appointed Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy at M.I.T.
        Professor Boolos, an authority on the work of the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege, widely regarded as the founder of modern logic, was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1996 to complete a book on Frege.
        In January 1995, he was elected president of the Association for Symbolic Logic, a multinational society of mathematicians, computer scientists, linguists and philosophers interested in formal or mathematical logic and related fields.
        He was the author of two books published by Cambridge University Press: "The  Logic of Provability," (1993), and with Richard C. Jeffrey, "Computability and Logic," first published in 1974.
        Professor Boolos, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Princeton in 1961 with a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics. He attended Oxford University as  a Fulbright scholar, earning a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in 1963. In 1966, he received the first Ph.D. in philosophy ever given by M.I.T. For the next three years, he taught at Columbia University before returning to M.I.T.
        Besides his wife, of Thetford, Vt., Professor Boolos is survived by his mother, Blanche, of Manhattan, and a son, Peter, by a previous marriage.
