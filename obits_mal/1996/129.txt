        Broadus Nathaniel Butler, a retired college administrator, Federal education  official and current president of the East Coast chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen, died on Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. A Washington resident, he was 75.
        Dr. Butler was president of Dillard University in New Orleans from 1969 to 1973, and then served for three years as director of the office of leadership development at the American Council on Education in Washington.
        After his retirement as vice president of the University of the District of  Columbia in 1985, he was named a distinguished scholar at large in a program operated by the United Negro College Fund under a $2.5 million grant from the MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
        He was born in Mobile, Ala., graduated from Talladega College in Alabama in 1941 and joined a group of volunteers who became the first black fighter pilots  in World War II. The group, called the Tuskegee Airmen after the segregated Army Air Forces base near Tuskegee, Ala., where it trained, destroyed or damaged 400  enemy aircraft in North Africa and Europe while escorting bomber crews that were primarily white. The group's heroism is credited with helping to remove racial barriers in the military.
        After the war, he received a master's degree and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Michigan. He was an assistant dean at Wayne State University in Detroit in 1964 when the United States Commissioner of Education named him his assistant for special education.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Lillian Rutherford Butler; a son, Dr. Bruce N., of Silver Spring, Md.; a daughter, Dr. Janet B. Reid of Cincinnati; two sisters, Rose Marie Nathan and Caster Butler, both of Mobile; a brother, Edgar, of Detroit, and four grandchildren.
