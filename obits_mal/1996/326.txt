        Mohammed Sidqi Suleiman, a former Prime Minister of Egypt who played an instrumental role in the building of the Aswan High Dam, died Thursday in Cairo. He was 77.
        Mr. Suleiman, an engineer, served on economic planning boards and then as minister for the Aswan High Dam from 1962 to 1967. He was Prime Minister under President Gamal Abdel Nasser from September 1966 to June 1967, but was demoted after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
        His work on the dam, which was opened in 1970, was well-regarded, but his close relationship with the Soviet Union, which provided the money for the dam,  led to the end of his political career after the Egytian Government's pro-Soviet faction was ousted by President Anwar el-Sadat in 1971.
