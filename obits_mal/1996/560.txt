        Irving Moskovitz, a lawyer practicing in Manhattan for more than six decades  and a supporter of the arts, died on April 12 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 83 and a resident of the Upper East Side.
        The cause was complications from prostate cancer and heart disease, his family said.

        He was a trustee of the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont for more than 25 years and was board chairman for five. He encouraged and sponsored  many young pianists entering the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition in England.
        When he lived in Scarsdale, N.Y., in the 1950's and 1960's, he was chairman of the Orchestral Society of Westchester.
        Mr. Moskovitz is survived by his wife of 58 years, Adele Reisner Moskovitz; a daughter, Anne Davis of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Peter Moskovitz of Washington; a sister, Clara Moskovitz of Manhattan; a brother, Abraham, of Baltimore, and three grandchildren.
