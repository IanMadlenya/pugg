        Edward Gordon, the director of the Ravinia Festival, summer home of the Chicago Symphany, from 1968 to 1990, and director emeritus since then, died on April 19 at Evanston Hospital in Evanston, Ill. He was 65 and lived in Chicago.
        Jack Zimmerman, the news media coordinator for Ravinia, said the cause was complications after pancreas surgery.
        Mr. Gordon, who was born in Chicago on May 5, 1930, was a child prodigy as a pianist. He appeared with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra when he was 8. He studied at Chicago Musical College, and made his New York debut at Town Hall in  1954.
        In 1958, he turned his attention to the administrative side of the music business and took a job as manager and later general manager of the Grant Park Concerts in Chicago. Ten years later, he was appointed executive director of the Ravinia Festival, in Highland Park, Ill.
        In a tenure that lasted 22 years, Mr. Gordon brought Ravinia into the international spotlight, making it a major summer festival. In 1972, he appointed James Levine as the festival's music director; he held the post for two decades. Mr. Gordon's years at Ravinia also included the renovation of the festival's open-air amphitheater, the Pavilion, and the construction of the John D. Harza Building, which includes a 450-seat concert hall and is the home of the Steans Institute for Young Artists, a program that Mr. Gordon established.
        After his retirement in 1990, Mr. Gordon was a judge at several major piano competitions, and was to have returned to the stage to play a Mozart Concerto with the Chacago Symphony at Ravinia this summer. He was also a director of the  Arts Club of Chicago and the chairman of its music panel.
        He is survived by a brother, Theodore, of Northbrook, Ill.
