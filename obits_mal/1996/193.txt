        Norman L. Harvey, a former New York State Supreme Court justice in Plattsburgh, died on Feb. 18 at Florida Hospital in Haines City, Fla. He was 77  and had lived in Haines City since moving from his native Canisteo, N.Y., a year ago.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his sister, Marion G. Miller, said.
        Justice Harvey, a former mayor of Canisteo, was first elected to the State Supreme Court in 1967 and took office the following January as a trial judge in the Fourth Judicial District. In 1975, he was appointed administrative judge  for the Fourth Judicial circuit.
        Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named him to the Appellate Division in the Third Department in 1984. He retired in 1993.
        Justice Harvey received a law degree from the Syracuse University College of  Law and was admitted to the bar in 1948.
        Besides his sister, a resident of Canisteo, Justice Harvey is survived by his companion, Sally Howard.
