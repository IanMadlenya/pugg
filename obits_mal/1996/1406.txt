        Herbert Sucoff, a founder and director of the Sea Cliff Chamber Players on Long Island, died on Dec. 17 at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 58 and lived in Sea Cliff.
        The cause was the rupture of a blood vessel in the pancreas, according to a statement from the chamber group.
        Mr. Sucoff, a clarinetist, and his wife, Barbara Speer, a pianist, founded the chamber players in 1975, after moving to Long Island from New York City. The group survived budget cuts and struggled for several years to build a subscription base, but it eventually gained a following and now performs for audiences of 25,000 annually at Tilles Center in Sea Cliff and at the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay, L.I.
        Mr. Sucoff was born in Brooklyn and earned degrees from the High School of Performing Arts, the Juilliard School and Queens College. A friend and student of the composer Stefan Wolpe, he compiled and published a catalogue and evaluation of his works. He was also a clarinetist, composer in residence and educational director of the Craftsbury Chamber Players in Vermont for 13 years. He performed with the Sea Cliff players until 1983.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Rebecca, of Athens, N.Y., and Katrina.
