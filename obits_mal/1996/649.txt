        Samuel Talmadge Ragan, the poet laureate of North Carolina and a veteran newspaper executive, died on Saturday at his home in Southern Pines, N.C. He was 80.
        He had been ill for some time, said Brent Hackney, a reporter at The Pilot, the newspaper in Southern Pines of which Mr. Ragan was publisher.
        Mr. Ragan, known as Sam, was named his state's poet laureate for life by Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. in 1982. At his death, he had been publisher of The Pilot for 27 years.
        Mr. Ragan, a tall man with flowing white hair, had a fondness for wide-brimmed fedoras and a voice that had been called a whisky baritone. Mr. Hackney described him as "kind of a throwback" and "a Southern gentleman who looked and behaved every inch the part."
        Though Mr. Ragan was courtly, his poetry could be terse and wry. His poem "The Election," which is included in the book "Collected Poems of Sam Ragan" (St. Andrews, 1990), consists of these nine lines:
        "He didn't get drunk
        But once every four years,
        On Election Day.
        He would rise early and go
        To the polls, drinking hard
        All day. By the time
        The polls were closed
        He would be passed out.
        It was his way of expressing an opinion."
        "Poetry is first about feelings," Mr. Ragan observed, adding, "I say in 20 words what it takes a novelist 100,000 words to say."
        He was born in Berea, N.C., and graduated from Atlantic Christian College in  Wilson, N.C., in 1936. He was Secretary of his state's Art, Culture and History  Department in 1972 and 1973. He wrote five other books of poetry, including "Listen for the Wind" (1996, St. Andrews), and was the author or co-author of several books of prose.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Usher; two daughters, Talmadge Ragan Keeter of Los Angeles and Nancy Ragan Smith of Vancouver, B.C.; two grandchildren; a brother, Melvin, and a sister, Dorothy Jones.
