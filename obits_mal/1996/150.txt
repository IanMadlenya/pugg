        Dr. Richard N. Reuben, a professor of clinical neurology at the New York University School of Medicine, died on Sunday at White Plains Hospital. He was 75 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, his wife, Dr. Rita S. Reuben, said.
        Dr. Reuben was also in private practice in Manhattan and on Long Island until about a year ago and was an attending neurologist in pediatrics at Bellevue Hospital Center and Tisch Hospital.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children, Eric, of Stamford, Conn., Nancy Reuben-Selwyn of Milford, Conn., and Mitchell, of Armonk, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and a sister, Marjorie Ruderfer of White Plains.
