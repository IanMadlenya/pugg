        Edwin Kennebeck, a longtime editor at Viking Press, died on May 2 at Calvary  Hospital in the Bronx. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer of the esophagus, said a friend, Jim Tamulis.
        In his 28 years at Viking, Mr. Kennebeck helped to ease the labor pains of a  diverse group of writers. He worked on Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" and on books by Marianne Moore, Arthur Miller, Saul Bellow, John Steinbeck and Iris Murdoch,  among others. He retired from Viking in 1983.
        In 1970, Mr. Kennebeck was a juror in the lengthy trial of members of the Black Panthers who were accused of plotting to bomb public places. He later wrote about the trial in "Juror No. 4: The Trial of 13 Black Panthers as Seen From the Jury Box" (W. W. Norton, 1973).
        He also reviewed books for Commonweal magazine and wrote articles and reviews for other publications, including The Nation.
        Mr. Kennebeck was born in Denver and graduated from the Marquette University  College of Journalism. He also received a master's degree in English from Marquette.
        He is survived by two sisters, Rita de Bey and Ruth Ann Zook, and a brother,  Paul, all of Denver, and a brother, Joseph, of Potomac, Md.
