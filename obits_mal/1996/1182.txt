        Forrest Carlisle Pogue, a historian and the author of a monumental four-volume biography of George C. Marshall, Army Chief of Staff in World War II and later Secretary of State, died on Sunday at Murray-Calloway County Hospital in Murray, Ky. He was 84 and lived in Murray.
        Mr. Pogue completed his epic study in 1987 after 30 years of labor and the review of 3.5 million pages of research material. Viking Press published ''George C. Marshall, Volume I: Education of a General, 1880-1939'' in 1963, followed by ''Ordeal and Hope, 1939-1942,'' ''Organizer of Victory, 1942-1945'' and, finally, ''Statesman, 1945-1959.''
        A pioneer of oral-history techniques, Mr. Pogue recorded some 40 hours of interviews with Marshall himself and encounters with more than 300 people who had known him, many of them prominent figures themselves.
        Born in Eddyville, Ky., Mr. Pogue graduated from Murray State University at the age of 19 and earned a master's degree at the University of Kentucky and a Ph.D. from Clark University. He joined the Murray State history faculty in 1933.
        In World War II, he served in the Army as a combat historian and accompanied the troops at the D-Day invasion and across much of Europe.
        Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower assigned him to write the official chronicle of the Eisenhower command in Europe, which prompted Mr. Pogue's first book, ''The Supreme Command'' (1954). He wrote numerous articles and essays and contributed to several books, including ''The Meaning of Yalta'' (1956), a collection of essays on that wartime conference.
        He returned to Murray State after the war and in 1956 accepted the post of director of the George C. Marshall Research Foundation in Lexington, Va., which asked him to write a full-length biography of Marshall.
        In 1991, the foundation published a 650-page book of transcriptions from his interviews with Marshall in 1956-57.
        He left the foundation in 1974 when he became director of the Eisenhower Institute for Historical Research, affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution. He retired in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, Christine Brown Pogue, and a sister, Mary Frances Stevens of Dawson Springs, Ky.
