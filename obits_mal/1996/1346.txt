        The Rev. Bernard George Holmes, a Benedictine educator who was credited with doubling the size of St. Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., died on Oct. 24 at Catholic Medical Center in Manchester. A monk at St. Anselm Abbey, he was 82.
        He suffered a brief illness, the college announced.
        Father Bernard was a leader of the trustees and administrators who oversaw the college's growth starting in the late 1950's, adding six major buildings on campus and doubling enrollment to more than 1,200 students. He served as president from 1960 to 1964 and as fund raiser and vice president for development before that, overseeing one of the most ambitious such programs ever undertaken by a Catholic college.
        Born in Lowell, Mass., he pronounced his vows at St. Anselm, where he graduated in mathematics and philosophy in 1936. He then pursued seminary studies in Toronto and at the Sant' Angelo Benedictine university in Rome. He was ordained a priest at the Abbey of Monte Cassino in Italy in 1939.
        As an educator, he concentrated on mathematics and philosophy. He served as chairman of the philosophy department, academic dean and dean at St. Anselm before being named vice president in 1958.
        He was college treasurer until his retirement in 1980 and at his death was a consultant to the college treasurer. In keeping with his priestly ministry, he was a weekend assistant at parishes in New Hampshire.
