        Sir George Trevelyan, a British baronet who was prominent in the New Age movement, died on Feb. 7 at 89. He had a home in Badminton, near Bristol, in western England.
        Sir George, who inherited his title in 1958 from his father, Sir Charles Trevelyan, the third baronet, inspired differing views.
        The liberal Guardian, in reporting his death, called him "a furniture maker, educationalist, visionary and dreamer who defined an apocalyptic Utopia" and "became the elder statesman of Britain's late 20th-century alternative society,  a founding father of the New Age."
        Earlier this month, the conservative Daily Telegraph said that he had been "dubbed 'the Hippies' Champion' for his promotion of 'alternative spirituality'  in the 1960's" and that he was an early enthusiast for such practices as holistic healing, harnessing the power of crystals, meditative chanting, communal living and organic farming.
        George Lowthian Trevelyan was born into an intellectual family; his father was a senior education official in Labor Governments during the 1920's. Young George went to Sidcot School, studied at Cambridge University and was in the military during World War II.
        But along the way he also went into designing and making furniture and became a teacher at Gordonstoun School in Scotland, which was attended by Prince Philip and Prince Charles. He also founded the Wrekin Trust in 1971 to promote spiritual knowledge.
        Sir George married Editha Helen Lindsay-Smith in 1940; she died in 1994. His  survivors include a daughter and his brother, Geoffrey Trevelyan, who is heir to the baronetcy.
