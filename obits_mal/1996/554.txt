        Edward J. Keating, a sports agent who negotiated the contract that made Frank Robinson the first black manager in major league baseball, died of cancer Thursday in Sagamore Hills, Ohio. He was 59.
        His clients included Arnold Palmer in golf, Gary Matthews and Dennis Eckersley in baseball and Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick, Paul Warfield and Dick Butkus in football.
        Mr. Keating grew up in Atlantic City and played football and basketball at Villanova and the University of Scranton. After eight years with Arnold Palmer Enterprises, he joined International Management Group in Cleveland in 1967.
        In 1974, with a $3.86 million package, he persuaded Csonka, Kiick and Warfield to leave the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League to play in  the short-lived World Football League. Then, without telling Robinson until the  last moment that the Cleveland Indians wanted him to manage them, he worked out  that contract.
        "You never tell a client what you're thinking," he said, "until you think you can do a deal because if you blow it, he'll lose confidence in you."
        In 1975, the agent was unhappy with his own contract, and he left his job and went into business for himself. The next year, in the first round of baseball's  big free-agent contracts, he got Matthews a five-year, $1.875 million package with the Atlanta Braves. The year before, the outfielder earned $46,000 with the San Francisco Giants.
