        Richard H. Granelli, an architectural designer who helped draft prestigious projects like Rockefeller Center and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington,  died on Sunday at his home in Brewster, N.Y. He was 90.
        He retired in the 1970's from the Manhattan-based Eggers Partnership, which engaged him in the planning for the new gymnasium at Columbia University and the Nestle Company offices in White Plains, among other things. Over the years, he was also associated with other prominent firms like Edward Durell Stone, and McKim, Mead & White.
        The designs he worked on ranged from private residences to airports in Pakistan, from office buildings to an apartment complex in the Caribbean. In the New York area, he was involved with the construction of Prudential Life Insurance offices, the lobby of the Helmsley-Spear Building and Nassau Community College on Long Island.
        Mr. Granelli, who was born in Manhattan, won a Paris Prize and a scholarship  to the Beaux Arts Institute in Paris. The prize was a nationwide competition in  which aspiring architects were given 72 hours to draw and design a National Opera House in Washington. He later won another scholarship to the Fountainebleau Art School in Paris.
        Mr. Granelli is survived by his wife of 45 years, Mildred Nowak Granelli; four daughters, Lucille Powell of Wolcott, N.Y., Jane Kessler of Danbury, Conn., Gail Quirin of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Laura D'Erricoof Roswell, Ga.; a son, Richard H. Jr., of Atlanta, a sister, Margaret Barsotti of White Plains, and 12  grandchildren.
