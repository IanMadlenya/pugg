        Arthur Lee Bass, a mountain herbalist in the southern Appalachians who was widely known for his knowledge of medicinal plants, died on Wednesday in Redman Park Hospital in Rome, Ga. He was 88 and lived in Leesburg.
        Mr. Bass, who was known as Tommie, was the subject of several newspaper and television features in the past few years, including two public television programs. His herbal remedies have also been studied and written about by experts.
        He began studying herbs about 1916, learning what he knew in the woods. He spent much of his life treating the people of Cherokee County and surrounding areas without taking payment. Among his treatments was a salve he marketed for rashes, chicken pox and other ailments. It was a mixture of alum, boric acid, camphor gum, tincture of iodine, aqueous extract of yellow dock root, white oak bark, honey, golden seal root and animal fat.
        His knowledge was the subject of the book ''Plain Southern Eating: From the Reminiscences of A. L. Tommie Bass, Herbalist,'' edited by John K. Crellin (Duke University, 1988).
        He is survived by a sister, Nellie D. Bass of Rome, and a brother, Ben C., of Summerville, Ga.
