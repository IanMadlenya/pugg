        Terrel H. Bell, who served as President Ronald Reagan's Education Secretary and who was credited with starting a national school reform movement, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 74.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said his wife, Betty.
        Mr. Bell led the Education Department from 1981 to 1985. During that time the department published the influential "A Nation at Risk Report," which in 1983 prompted a movement to overhaul education to make it meet the demands of a  modern-day market. The report found serious flaws in the education system and concluded that schools were drowning in mediocrity.
        Thomas C. Anderson, who was Mr. Bell's chief of staff for two years, said Mr. Bell was instrumental in helping President Reagan understand the importance of education. Mr. Bell was originally appointed Secretary to phase out the Education Department, which was created by President Jimmy Carter.
        "Ted Bell really was Ronald Reagan's master teacher as far as education," said Mr. Anderson, an Assistant Attorney General for Utah and counsel to the Utah Board of Regents.
        Mr. Bell served as Commissioner of Education under President Richard M. Nixon, President Gerald R. Ford and Mr. Reagan before being appointed Education  Secretary.
        After leaving the Government, Mr. Bell remained active in promoting education and learning, founding the educational consulting firm T. H. Bell and Associates and writing "How to Shape Up Our Nation's Schools" in 1991.
        He was born in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, and received a master's degree from the University of Idaho and a doctorate in education from the University of Utah.
        In addition his his wife, Mr. Bell is survived by four sons, Mark F., Warren  T., Glenn M. and Peter F.
