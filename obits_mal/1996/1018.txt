        Dr. John Sells Graettinger, a Chicago physician and medical educator, died on Tuesday at Rush Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. He was 75 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Graettinger was born in Ontario, Calif., and graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School. After doing cardiac research for the Navy, he joined the staff of Presbyterian Hospital of the City of Chicago in 1953 and established its section of cardiovascular diseases.
        After Presbyterian and St. Luke's merged in 1956, he was chairman of the department of medicine until 1970, when he became a professor at Rush Medical College. He retired in 1992, having filled several positions, including dean of student and faculty affairs, dean of graduate and continuing education and university marshall.
        From 1975 to 1989, Dr. Graettinger was also the executive vice president of the National Resident Matching Program, which places medical school graduates into their first year of residency training. He helped revise the matching process and create the record-keeping and tracking systems now in use.
        Dr. Graettinger is survived by his wife of 50 years, Elizabeth Shorey Graettinger; four sons, John Jr., of Wilmette, Ill., Dr. William F., of Reno, Robert S., of Chicago, and George D., of Gurnee, Ill., and eight grandchildren.
