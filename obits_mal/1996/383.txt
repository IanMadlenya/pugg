        Jack Weprin, a real estate lawyer who was prominent in New York Jewish organizations and a benefactor of many, died on Sunday at Kutscher's Country Club in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y. He was 65 and lived in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Andy Albstein, a friend and law partner.
        Mr. Weprin was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. He received a degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1955 and was admitted to the bar the same year.
        He was a partner in the firm of Goldberg, Weprin & Ustin, which specializes  in real estate law.
        Mr. Weprin was a member of the board of the American Friends of the Israel Museum, as well as of the museum in Jerusalem, and a longtime supporter of the UJA-Federation's Real Estate Division. He also was a past president of the B'nai B'rith Real Estate Unit.
        He was a board member of the National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership and a founder and benefactor of the West End Synagogue, which recently moved to Amsterdam Avenue at 69th Street.
        Mr. Weprin's brother, Saul, who had been the New York Assembly Speaker since  1991, died in February 1994 after suffering a stroke.
        Mr. Weprin is survived by his wife, Jane Abraham Weprin; a daughter, Julia Abedin of Manhattan; three sons, Michael, of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Andrew and Adam, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
