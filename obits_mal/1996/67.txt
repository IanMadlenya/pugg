        Emanuel Gordon, a nuclear engineer who worked on the Manhattan Project and held many patents on nuclear fuel, died on Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. Mr. Gordon, who lived in Rockville, Md., was 76.
        His son, Robert, of Manhattan, said the cause was heart and lung ailments.
        Mr. Gordon, who was born in Boston, was not long out of Northeastern University, from which he graduated in 1941, when he began work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the development of the first atomic bombs.
        For most of the rest of his life, he devoted himself to the peaceful uses of  atomic energy. With United Nuclear Corporation in Uncasville, Conn., he concerned himself during the 1960's with the development of nuclear fuel.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Gordon worked in Washington and in Bethesda, Md., as an expert in uranium and fuel for the Atomic Industrial Forum, which later became the United States Council for Energy Awareness, the nuclear industry's public relations arm. He wrote the annual report on the state of the uranium industry for the organization.
        After his retirement in 1990, Mr. Gordon served as a consultant for the Government and private industry on nuclear fuel and its disposal.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Pauline Marcus; his daughter, Wendy Jane Gordon of Cohasset, Mass., and a grandchild.
