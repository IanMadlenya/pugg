        Dr. Arthur Dock Fon Toy, an industrial chemist whose research in phosphorus chemistry earned him more than 80 patents, died on July 31 at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 80. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Toy, a native of Guangzhou, China, received his doctorate in chemistry from the University of Illinois. His expertise lay in inorganic and organic phosphorus chemistry and the invention of pest controls in cotton, rice and other crops.
        He originally worked at Victor Chemical Works in Illinois. After its merger with the Stauffer Chemical Company in Westport, Conn., he assumed increasingly higher positions, retiring from Stauffer in 1981 as the company's director of research.
        Dr. Toy is survived by his wife of 54 years, Hui-I; three sons, Larry, of Orinda, Calif., Alan, of Stamford, and Howard, of Tulsa, Okla.; a brother, Choy Chung Wor, and a sister, Lee Yan Qiao, both of Guangzhou, and six grandchildren.
