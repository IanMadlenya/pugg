        Representative Bill Emerson, a Missouri Republican who was the vice chairman  of the House Agriculture Committee, died on Saturday at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. He was 58.
        The cause was lung cancer, said a spokesman in Mr. Emerson's Congressional office in Washington.
        Mr. Emerson had been running for re-election to a ninth term representing Missouri's Eighth District. He had expressed pride at not missing a single vote  this year and was confident that his illness, detected in November, would not stop his re-election.
        "I have not faltered," he said in a recent interview. "I expect I'm going to  continue doing the job.".
        William Emerson, who was born in St. Louis, graduated from Westminster College and received a law degree from the University of Baltimore.
        His Congressional career goes back to 1954, when he was a page on the floor of the House when five members of Congress were wounded by four Puerto Rican nationalists shooting from the spectators gallery on March 1 of that year.
        During the 1960's Mr. Emerson served as an aide to Representative Robert F. Ellsworth, Republican of Kansas, and to Representative and later Senator Charles McC. Mathias Jr., Republican of Maryland. Mr. Emerson then became a lobbyist in Washington before winning election to Congress in 1980.
        He is survived his wife, Jo Ann; their two daughters, Victoria Marie and Katharine, and two daughters from a previous marriage, Elizabeth and Abigail.
