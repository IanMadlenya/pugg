        Frederick T. Rope, a retired diplomat who was a spokesman for the American Mission to the United Nations in the 1950's, died on Thursday in Burlington, Vt. He was 81 and lived in Westford, Vt.
        A native of Buffalo who graduated from Cornell and later received a doctorate in education from Columbia, Mr. Rope seemed an ideal choice to explain the workings of a new international organization to a sometimes skeptical American public.
        The work, after all, was not much different from that of his first job, as a high-school teacher in Orchard Park, outside Buffalo.
        By the time he was hired in 1948 to organize public affairs programs to publicize the work of the United Nations, Mr. Rope had gained considerable experience in public affairs -- as a state education official, as director of the Public Education Association in New York City, as executive director of the New York State Citizens Council and as a Navy officer who worked for Gen. Douglas MacArthur in revamping the Japanese education system after World War II.
        At the United Nations, Mr. Rope was a spokesman for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge from 1953 to 1958, a turbulent time.
        After his work at the United Nations, Mr. Rope remained with the State Department as a diplomat, serving as executive secretary to the United States Mission to NATO in Paris and as American Consul in Montreal and Melbourne.
        He is survived by a son, William of Washington; a daughter, Sandra Tamburri of Westford, Vt., and three grandchildren.

        An obituary on Saturday about Frederick T. Rope, a retired diplomat, misstated his age. He was 87, not 81.
