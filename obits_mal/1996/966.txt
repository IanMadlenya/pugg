        Chase Patterson Kimball, professor emeritus of medicine and psychiatry at the University of Chicago, who was prominent in the new field of biopsychosocial medicine, died on Aug. 24 at a Chicago nursing home. He was 64.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Kimball, a crusader for medical ethics, wrote extensively on the subject, including a standard textbook in his field, ''The Biopsychosocial Approach to the Patient,'' published in 1981.
        He helped shape the movement in American medicine in the 1960's that urged doctors to treat the patient as well as the disease. The movement emphasized the importance of the patient's social and emotional circumstances.
        Dr. Kimball's conviction grew out of his early studies of psychological responses to open-heart surgery. He found that many of the patients experienced psychological complications, like severe depression, serious enough to hamper their recovery. He developed and taught a course for first-year medical students about how to talk to patients and learn their personal concerns.
        He was born in Ware, Mass., graduated from Brown University and received his medical degree from Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York. He joined the medical faculty in Chicago in 1972 and was promoted to professor two years later. He was granted emeritus status in 1989.
        Dr. Kimball is survived by his wife, Anne Giddings Kimball; four children, Lisa G. Kimball of Charlottesville, Va., and Allison E. Kimball, Susan C. Martinez and James G., all of Chicago; six siblings, Arthur of Swansea, Mass., Starelle King of Brewster, Mass., Helen Jordan of Auburn, Ky., Marjory Stickler of Carlisle, Mass., William of Fall River, Mass., and Nancy Peacock of Boothbay, Me., and one grandson.
