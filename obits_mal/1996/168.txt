        Burne Hogarth, creator of the "Tarzan of the Apes" comic strip, died on Sunday at the Cochin Hospital in Paris. He was 84.
        Mr. Hogarth had been the guest of honor at a comic-strip festival in Angouleme in France and was headed back to the United States, hospital officials said.
        He drew the Tarzan strip from 1937 until 1950, basing it on the series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs about the adventures of the mythical Lord of the Jungle. In an introductory essay to "The Golden Age of Tarzan" (1978), a collection of his work, Mr. Hogarth described the comic-book hero as a prototype of the noble savage, uncorrupted by society.

        An obituary by Reuters on Feb. 1 about the illustrator Burne Hogarth misstated his role in the history of the "Tarzan of the Apes" comic strip. He drew it from 1937 to 1950; he did not create it.
