        Julius Raskin, a retired educator in New York City public schools who worked on programs designed to widen students' horizons, died on Oct. 9 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in the Bronx. A former resident of Manhattan, he was 90 and lived in the Bronx.
        At his retirement in 1971, he was principal of Tri Community Junior High School in Springfield Gardens, Queens. A graduate of City College, he had joined the school system 40 years earlier as a teacher at New Utrecht High School and later led the Physical Education department at Midwood High School in Brookyn.
        During a leave of absence in Washington, he helped organize the National Teacher Corps, a creation of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations akin to the Peace Corps and Job Corps. It meant to motivate college graduates to volunteer their time to tutor children of the poor and improve their job skills. Mr. Raskin helped devise programs for it and recruit volunteers.
        Earlier, Mr. Raskin established a Teen Tours project in which he and his wife, Millie, took students on trips. Teens Tours lasted from the late 1940's through the 1960's.
        In addition to his wife of 64 years, Mr. Raskin is survived by a son, Dr. David Raskin of Rock Hall, Md.; a daughter, Evelyn Keating of Lynbrook, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
