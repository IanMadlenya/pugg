        Vincent R. Balletta Jr., a former Associate Justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, died on Friday at his home in Port Washington, L.I. He was 69.
        His family said the cause was cancer, the disease that led him to resign two weeks ago after 17 years on the bench, including eight as an appellate judge for the second department.
        A native of Brooklyn, Justice Balletta grew up on Long Island. He graduated from Columbia and received his law degree from St. John's in Brooklyn. A Republican, he was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1967. He was defeated after two terms. In 1971, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller named him chairman of the New York State Lottery Advisory Board. He was elected to the Supreme Court in 1978. In 1988, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named him to the appellate division.
        Justice Balletta is survived by his wife, Maria; two sons, Stephen, of Mineola, L.I., and Richard, of Floral Park, Queens; two daughters, Michele Butterfield of Portland, Me., and Andrea Gullickson of Seattle; a sister, Amelia Balletta of Great Neck, L.I., and four grandchildren.
