        Willard R. Simmons, a founding partner of W. R. Simmons and Associates Research, the New York marketing research firm, died on Monday at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. He was 84 and had been a longtime resident of Mamaroneck, N.Y., before retiring to Whitestone, Va.
        In a career that spanned the better part of four decades, Mr. Simmons is credited with creating sophisticated  surveys, mostly of readers.
        ''He was a pioneer in commercializing what at the time was considered the most valid methodology for determining what the total audience of a magazine was,'' said Michael J. Naples, who recently stepped down as president of the Advertising Research Foundation, the research arm of the advertising industry.
        The information gleaned from such studies is seen today as almost a prerequisite for advertisers and their agencies.
        Mr. Simmons was born in Petersburg, Va., and graduated from the University of Richmond and Duke University. After working as a statistician for the Virginia State Department, and for the Office of Price Administration during World War II, Mr. Simmons moved to New York City in 1946 to join Alfred Politz, a market research firm.
        About three years later, he co-founded his own company, which he headed until 1975, when he sold the business to National Student Marketing. In 1977 he started a new company, Three Sigma Research, in Larchmont, N.Y. After a few years in business, he sold the company, which did important early work in random digit dialing, another marketing research technique.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara C. Simmons of Whitestone; three sons, Steven D., of Whitestone, Peter C., of Richmond and William R., of Larchmont; two daughters, Barbara Smith of Manchester, Mass., and Patricia S. Iorillo of Newark, Calif., and five granchildren.
