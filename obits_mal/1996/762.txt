        Dr. Alvin E. Strock, a retired oral surgeon who advanced the art of tooth implants while in his residency in Boston, died on May 31 at the Alice-Peck Day  Hospital in Lebanon, N.H. He was 85 and lived in Lebanon and formerly in Newton, Mass.
        The cause of death was stomach cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Strock, who grew into an inveterate tinkerer and biomedical inventor, graduated from Boston Latin School, Dartmouth College and the Harvard School of  Dental Medicine.
        In the 1930's, replacing a front tooth was a cumbersome challenge the dentists met by fitting the patient with a removable -- and often uncomfortable  -- bridge or by paring adjacent teeth to anchor a permanent bridge.
        Dr. Strock was completing his surgical residency at Peter Brent Brigham Hospital, now part of Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston when he tackled the problem at the surgical research laboratory at Harvard Medical School.
        He learned about a cobalt-chromium alloy called vitallium, which had been used to repair hip fractures, and adapted it for tooth implantation. He inserted a vitallium screw into the socket of the extracted tooth and, after the bone tissue tightened around the screw, cemented a porcelain crown to its head to give the patient a functional, natural-looking new tooth.
        Working for the Public Health Service in World War II, Dr. Strock pioneered the use of antibiotics for shipboard treatment of periodontal infections like trench mouth, which previously would have kept a sailor in a hospital ashore.
        Besides his service on the staff at Brigham, he was in private practice in Boston and Martha's Vineyard.
        Dr. Strock is survived by his wife of 57 years, Ann Feldman Strock; a son, Douglas, of San Diego; a daughter, Bonnie S. Steinberg, of Ruxton, Md.; two sisters, Ruth Friedman of Miami and Gertrude Daitch of Sarasota, Fla., and two grandchildren.
