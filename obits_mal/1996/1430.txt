        Cliff Mapes, whose five-year major league career is remembered chiefly for his links to Yankee uniforms worn by Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle, died on Thursday in Pryor, Okla. He was 74.
        Mapes, an outfielder with a career batting average of .242, reached the majors leagues with the Yankees in 1948 and was given No. 3, which Ruth had worn. When Ruth's number was retired that season, Mapes switched to No. 13 and then to No. 7. When Mapes was traded to the St. Louis Browns in 1951, Mantle, who had worn No. 6, took No. 7.
        Mapes is survived by his wife, Betty.
