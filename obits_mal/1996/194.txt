        Serge Sabarsky, an internationally known art dealer and leading authority on  German and Austrian Expressionist art, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Sabarsky organized museum exhibitions in cities around the world, from Tokyo to Tel Aviv, Paris to Palermo. He put together the first exhibition of the work of Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt in Japan in 1979 and 1981. He also published many catalogues and books on German and Austrian Expressionist art and was a member of the faculty of the New York University School of Continuing Education in addition to teaching at the New School for Social Research in New York.
        He was born in Vienna and came to New York in 1939. After World War II he began working as an architectural designer. By the 1950's Mr. Sabarsky had begun seriously collecting art and by 1968 he had opened a gallery on Madison Avenue and 77th Street that specialized in German and Austrian Expressionist artists.
        In 1985 he closed his gallery and worked as a private curator, organizing museum shows. For a year, in 1990, he was director of the Nassau County Museum of Fine art.
        Over the years Mr. Sabarsky amassed an important body of art by such artists  as Schiele, Klimt, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Erich Heckel, Oskar Kokoschka, Max Beckmann and Ernst Kirchner. Three years ago he bought a five-story building at  1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, where he started a foundation that was also to become a museum of Austrian and German Expressionist art.
        In addition to his wife, Vally, he is survived by a brother, David, of New York.
