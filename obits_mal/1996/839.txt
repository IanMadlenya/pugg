        Dr. E. Lloyd DuBrul, an authority on dental anatomy and a noted author on the subject, died on Wednesday in Chicago. He was 87 and lived in Chicago.
        He was professor emeritus of oral anatomy at the College of Dentistry at the  University of Illinois at Chicago.
        Dr. DuBrul was the most recent author to update "Sicher and DuBrul's Oral Anatomy," the definitive textbook on the subject used in dental education in this country and abroad in several translations. It derived from a classic German text of 1923, and Dr. DuBrul rewrote the eighth edition published in 1988 by Ishiyaku EuroAmerican. Until two years ago he was working on a revised ninth  edition.
        He was wrote four other books and many articles, abstracts, book reviews and  a chapter of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. An accomplished artist, he drew many  of the illustrations that appeared in his books and other publications.
        Born in New York City, he studied at Long Island University and Columbia University before earning his D.D.S. degree in 1937 at New York University. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1955.
        He served as a major with a plastic-surgery team in Europe in World War II and joined the faculty of the departments of medicine and dentistry in Chicago in 1946. He founded the university's department of oral anatomy and served as its chairman from 1964 to 1977.
        Dr. DuBrul is survived by his wife, Florence Kirsch DuBrul, a concert pianist.
