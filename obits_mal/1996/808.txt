        David Mourao Ferreira, a leading Portuguese writer of essays, fiction and poetry, died of cancer Sunday, his family said. He was 69.
        The son of a historian, Mr. Mourao Ferreira began his prolific career while a literature student in the late 1940's. He won a series of literary prizes during his long career and saw his works translated into English and nine other  languages.
        Among his best-known works were "Gaivotas em Terra" ("Seagulls on Land"), "Hospital de Letras" ("Literary Hospital") and "As Quatro Estacoes" ("The Four Seasons").
        His leading role among the Portuguese intellectuals led him to become Secretary of Culture in three governments in the difficult transition that followed the 1974 leftist revolt that ended 48 years of rightist dictatorship. He described his 32 months in government as "the most frustrating and consuming" time of his life.
        He is survived by his wife, Pilar.
