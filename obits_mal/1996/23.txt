        William O. Aydelotte, a retired University of Iowa professor who was one of the first historians elected to the National Academy of Sciences, died on Wednesday at University Hospitals in Iowa City. He was 85 and lived in Iowa City.
        Professor Aydelotte was a pioneer in applying the statistical techniques of sociology and psychology to historical research, using information like parliamentary voting records and data on income distribution that other historians had ignored for "reasons of conservatism, inertia and snobbism," said Prof. David Schoenbaum, a colleague at the University of Iowa.
        He was an authority on British history, particularly voting patterns in the  House of Commons in the 1840's, and was awarded the Order of the British Empire  in 1961. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1974.
        Professor Aydelotte published four books, including two still in print: "Bismarck and British Colonial Policy: The Problem of South West Africa, 1883-1885" (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1937; 2d edition, Russell & Russell, 1970) and "The History of Parliamentary Behavior" (Princeton University Press, 1977.) He also wrote "Quantification in History" (Addison-Wesley, 1971) and edited "The Dimensions of Quantitative Research in History" with Allan G. Bogue and Robert William Fogel (Princeton University Press, 1972).
        Professor Aydelotte was born in Bloomington, Ind., and received a bachelor's  degree from Harvard College in 1931 and a doctoral degree from Cambridge University in 1934.  He served on the faculties of Trinity College, Smith College, Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton  before joining the University of Iowa in 1947. He was the chairman of the Iowa history department from 1947 to 1959 and from 1965 to 1968, and he taught until  his retirement in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, Myrtle Elizabeth Kitchell, a former dean of the University of Iowa College of Nursing; two daughters, Marie Elizabeth Aydelotte  of Rochester and Jeannette Farley Burr of Los Angeles, and one grandchild.
