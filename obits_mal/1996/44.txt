        Norman MacCaig, whose spare and disciplined verse made him one of Scotland's  most esteemed poets, died on Tuesday in Astley Ainslie Hospital, where he was being treated for injuries from a fall this month. He was 85.
        Mr. MacCaig said he wrote his first poem at Royal High School in Edinburgh for a class assignment, figuring that a poem wouldn't take as many words as an essay.
        From 1967-69 he held the post of fellow in creative writing at Edinburgh University and from 1972-77 held a readership in poetry at the University of Stirling.
        Many of Mr. MacCaig's images came from the natural world, and he was especially fond of the mountainous country around Loch Assynt in northwestern Scotland. Seamus Heaney, the Irish poet who won the Nobel Prize in Literature last year, once said that Mr. MacCaig's verse "sees the world anew; it rinses it out and hangs it out clean and bright again."
        He is survived by a son and a daughter.
