        Dankwart A. Rustow, an expert on the Middle East who taught at the City University of New York, died on Saturday in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 71 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said his son Timothy.
        Professor Rustow retired in June 1995 as distinguished professor of political science and sociology at CUNY's Graduate Center, where he taught for 25 years after serving on the faculties of Princeton and Columbia.
        Professor Rustow was born in Berlin, grew up partly in Turkey, graduated from Queens College and received a doctorate in political science in 1951 from Yale.
        He was a visiting professor at Harvard and other institutions, a vice president of the Middle East Studies Association of North America and the recipient of a Guggenheim fellowship.
        His marriages to Rachel Aubrey Rustow and Tamar Gottlieb Rustow ended in divorce.
        In addition to his son Timothy of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 18 years, Dr. Margrit Wreschner, a psychoanalyst; another son, Stephen of Manhattan; two daughters, Janet of Cambridge, Mass., and Marina of Manhattan; three grandchildren; two sisters, Maria Funk of Cologne, Germany, and Friedburg Lorenz of Heppenheim, Germany; a half-brother, Helmut of Frankfurt, Germany; and his step-mother, Lorena of Heidelberg, Germany.
