        Thomas A. Frank, a mutual fund manager for the Dreyfus Corporation who specialized in buying stocks of small, fast-growing companies, died Sunday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 55.
        Mr. Frank died of pneumonia, his wife, Juliet, said. He had been undergoing treatments for cancer.
        As portfolio manager of three Dreyfus mutual funds, the New Leaders fund, the Emerging Leaders fund and the Variable Investment fund small cap portfolio, Mr. Frank was part of a team that oversaw investments of $2 billion.
        In 1994, he was selected the variable fund manager of the year by Morningstar Inc., a Chicago fund-tracking company. Over the last 10 years, the Dreyfus New Leaders fund, which he had managed since 1985, produced an average annual total return of 14.2 percent, ranking in the top 20 percent of all mutual funds tracked by Morningstar.
        After beginning his investment career in 1969 as a securities analyst at A. G. Becker, Mr. Frank joined the Chase Investors Management Corporation, a division of the Chase Manhattan Bank, in 1981. In 1984, he moved to Neuberger & Berman; he joined Dreyfus one year later, where he served as director of equity research until 1995.
        Mr. Frank, born in Youngstown, Ohio, received a bachelor of arts degree from Williams College.
        He is survived by his wife, Juliet, of Manhattan; a daughter, Marisa, of Los Angeles; two stepsons, Alston Boyd 4th, of Austin, Tex., and Kenneth Norris of Lake Forest, Ill.; a stepdaughter, Karri Norris, of Manhattan; two sisters, Mary Frank and Kathryn Frank, both of Berkeley, Calif.; his mother, Mrs. Thomas W. Frank of Manhattan, and one step-granddaughter. Mr. Frank's first wife, Vesla, died in 1993.
