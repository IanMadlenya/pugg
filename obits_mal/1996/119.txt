        Father James E. Royce, a professor emeritus of psychology and addiction studies at Seattle University who spent decades counseling people in books and lecture halls about alcoholism and other substance abuse, died last Saturday at  Providence Hospital in Seattle. A resident of Jesuit House in Seattle, he was 81.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, the university said.
        Father Royce arrived at the Seattle campus in 1948 and, as a priest who specialized in psychology, was from the start almost overwhelmed by requests for help. This led to a career in the field of addiction studies.
        Knowing that in the classroom he might speak to 50 listeners at a time, he concluded early on that he had to publish to reach a much larger audience. Among his books were "Personality and Mental Health" (Glencoe), which was revised in 1964, and "Alcohol Problems and Alcoholism: A Comprehensive Survey" (Free Press), which was revised in 1989 and remains in print.
        He was born in Spokane, Wash., graduated from Gonzaga University and earned a doctorate in psychology at Loyola University in Chicago in 1945. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1947. He received emeritus status in 1980 but continued to publish and direct the Seattle University Symposium on Alcoholism until 1988.
        Father Royce is survived by two brothers, William, of Redwood City, Calif., and Father Thomas, of Yakima, Wash., and a sister, Marjorie DeWeese of Mount Angel, Ore.
