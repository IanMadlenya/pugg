        Hans Peter Busch, a stage director of opera who was associated with the Indiana University Opera Theater  for 32 years, died on Sept. 17 at Bloomington Hospital in Indiana. He was 82.
        Mr. Busch, born in Aachen, Germany, in 1914, was the son of the conductor Fritz Busch. His family, which was not Jewish, left Germany in 1933 in a protest against the Nazis.
        In the next few years, Mr. Busch studied music in Geneva and Vienna and worked during the summers at Glyndebourne, the festival in Sussex, England, founded and directed by his father.
        Mr. Busch became a United States citizen in 1942, then served in the Army, taking part in the Italian campaign. After the war, he became one of the first directors of the NBC-TV opera theater.
        In 1948, he joined the faculty of Indiana University, where he directed productions that attracted considerable attention.
        Reviewing Mr. Busch's 1974 production of Busoni's rarely heard ''Doktor Faust,'' Harold Schonberg wrote in The New York Times that it was ''an object lesson in how to use a minimum of means with sheer artistry.''
        During this period, Mr. Busch worked regularly in professional companies, most notably at the Metropolitan Opera. He was the stage director for the Met debut of the tenor Nicolai Gedda in ''Faust'' in 1957 and for the debut of the soprano Inge Borkh in ''Salome'' the next year.
        In 1964, he directed a 200-member  cast from Indiana University in a production of ''Turandot'' at the New York World's Fair. Mr. Busch retired from the university in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Carolyn; two sons, John A., of Singapore, and Frederick, of Sacramento, Calif.,  and two sisters, Eta Singher of Atlanta and Gisela von Moltke of Argentina.
