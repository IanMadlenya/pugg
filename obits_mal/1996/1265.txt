        William Carroll Bark, professor emeritus of medieval history at Stanford University, died on Oct. 11 at a convalescent home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 87 and lived on the Stanford campus.
        Dr. Bark was the author of a standard text, ''Origins of the Medieval World'' (Stanford University Press, 1958). It bolstered the proposition that the early Middle Ages were an era of innovation, discovery and technical advance. Indeed, he argues that the Middle Ages opened a path to ''eventual freedom and individualism and dignity'' that was unknown in antiquity to all but minuscule ruling elites. The book remains in print.
        William Bark was born in Tacoma, Wash., received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford and a Ph.D. in ancient history from Cornell University in 1936, when he joined the Stanford faculty. After teaching elsewhere, he returned to Stanford in 1947 to direct its ''History of Western Civilization'' program.
        Dr. Bark retired from active teaching in 1974, but he continued to contribute articles to historical and philosophical journals. At his death he was still working on a book on the development of Western civilization, ''Dionysius Exiguus and the Founding of the Middle Ages.''
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Eleanor Carlton Bark; two sons, Jared C., of Warwick, N.Y., and Dennis L., of Stanford, and five grandchildren.
