        The Rev. Dr. Louis Coleman Gerstein, minister emeritus of Congregation Shearith Israel, one of the city's oldest congregations, died last  Sunday while visiting relatives in Israel. He was 78 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        He died after a brief illness, family members said.
        Shearith Israel, a Spanish and Portuguese Orthodox congregation, now on 70th Street at Central Park West, was founded in 1654. ''They didn't have ordained rabbis in New York in those days,'' said Marc D. Angel, the present rabbi. Using the prevailing language of the day, the synagogue's leaders were called ministers, a pattern that continues, he said.
        Dr. Gerstein joined the congregation as assistant minister in 1942 and was minister from 1956 to 1988.
        Born in Brooklyn, he held bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in philosophy from New York University and a degree in Hebrew letters from the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he was ordained in 1942.
        His ''Conception of God in Maimonides and Thomas Aquinas'' was published by N.Y.U. Press in 1947 and ''Faith in Our Times'' in 1948.
        Dr. Gerstein's wife of 41 years, Amy Levinson Gerstein, died in 1991. He is survived by a daughter, Abby G. Chill, and a son, Dr. Jared Gerstein, both of Kiryat Ono, Israel; a sister, Betty Lentneck of New York; four grandsons, and a great-granddaughter.
