        Kemp R. Niver, a cinematographer and film historian, died on Oct. 15 at the Country Villa Nursing Center in Los Angeles. He was 84.
        Mr. Niver wrote a number of books and articles about film history and was instrumental in helping to preserve the work of turn-of-the-century film makers in the collection of the Library of Congress. He designed a printer that made it possible to preserve some 3,000 of those early films, some dating to 1894, by transferring the library's perishable paper prints onto conventional 16-millimeter film stock. The project, which he led, took more than 15 years. In 1954, Mr. Niver was awarded an honorary Oscar for his work on the project.
        He is survived by his granddaughter, Tara Candoli of Los Angeles.
