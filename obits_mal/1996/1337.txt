        Edwin Howard Friedman, a family therapist and consultant on leadership who wrote and conducted workshops on those subjects, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 64.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Friedman, an ordained Reform rabbi, taught and practiced for more than 30 years, combining his theories about religion, politics and psychotherapy.
        He lectured across the country and oversaw leadership training programs at his Center for Family Process in Bethesda.
        Over the past 10 years he presented workshops for groups of Episcopal bishops, Trappist abbots and abbesses, state governors and their staffs and the General Staff of the United States Army in Europe and the executive committee of the Chief of Naval Operations. His center trained people from the medical and psychotherapy professions as well as government and business leaders.
        He was the author of ''Generation to Generation: Family Process in Church and Synagogue'' (Guilford Press, 1985) and ''Friedman's Fables'' (Guilford, 1990).
        He was reared on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and graduated from Bucknell University. He earned a doctorate of divinity at Hebrew Union College, were he was ordained in 1959.
        He was a rabbi at Temple Shalom in Chevy Chase, Md., when he joined the Johnson White House as a community-relations specialist.
        In 1964 he became the founding rabbi of the Bethesda Jewish Congregation.
        He is survived by his wife of 36 years, Carlyn Beckman Friedman; a daughter, Shira Friedman of San Francisco, and a son, Ari, of Rochester.
