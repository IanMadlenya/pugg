        Robert A. Hendrickson, a New York City tax lawyer who was one of the first to draw up wills for people with homes in several countries and who wrote a two-volume biography of Alexander Hamilton, died on Sunday. He was 73 and had lived for several decades in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Working on tax issues for people with residences in more than one state led Mr. Hendrickson in the 1960's to work on the more complex tax problems of international executives. His research led to his 1971 book, ''Estate Planning for the Migrant Executive.''
        When international business was still an emerging concept, Mr. Hendrickson published articles in legal and tax journals explaining how people with property in several countries could take advantage of the jurisdiction with the lowest taxes, said a colleague, Bernard J. Reverdin of Eaton & Van Winkle.
        Mr. Hendrickson had been a partner at that law firm until recently, when he became its counsel, said his wife, Zita Davisson, a portrait artist.
        In his two-volume biography of Alexander Hamilton, ''Hamilton I'' and ''Hamilton II,'' published in 1976, Mr. Hendrickson put forth the provocative new thesis that Hamilton's fatal duel with Aaron Burr in 1804 was prompted by Burr's claim that Hamilton had had an illicit love affair.
        Among Mr. Hendrickson's other books were ''The Future of Money''  and ''The Cashless Society.''
        Robert Augustus Hendrickson attended Yale University and graduated from Harvard Law School. He was an infantry lieutenant in World War II, receiving a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hendrickson is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Kirk of Budapest, and a son, Robert A. Hendrickson 3d of Tallahassee, Fla.
