        The Rev. James John Shanahan, a Jesuit priest who, as its 15th president, led St. Peter's College in Jersey City through a period of robust growth, died on Monday at the Murray-Weigel Home at Fordham University in the Bronx. He was 88.
        He was president from 1949 to 1961, years that brought the addition of several new buildings on the campus. He also oversaw innovations like centralized admissions and registrar's offices, counseling services for students and the establishment of an academic senate.
        He then served as the first provincial of the Buffalo Province of the Society of Jesus. He returned to St. Peter's in 1984 to form the Shanahan Society, an organization that arranged for donations for the college. The group  more than doubled the college's endowment.
        Father Shanahan was born in Sonyea, N.Y., and studied at the Christian Brothers Academy in Syracuse, Fordham and Woodstock College in Maryland. He arrived at St. Peter's in 1933 to teach Latin and English.
        Back at Woodstock, he studied theology and, having belonged to the Society of Jesus since 1926, was ordained a priest in 1939. In World War II, he was a chaplain in the Army Air Force. After that, he taught ethics and sociology at Canisius College in Buffalo until he was named president of St. Peter's in 1949.
        Before his health failed him, he was doing archival work at Canisius.
        He is survived by a brother, Daniel, and three sisters, Katherine, Mary and Gertrude Shanahan, all of South Yarmouth, Mass.
