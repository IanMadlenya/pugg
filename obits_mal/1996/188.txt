        Rabbi Marvin Fox, a scholar of Jewish thought and former director of the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., died on Feb. 8 at his home in Newton, Mass. He was 73.
        The cause was lung cancer, the university reported.
        Dr. Fox came to Brandeis in 1974 as the Philip W. Lown Professor of Jewish Philosophy. He was department chairman from 1975 to 1982 and again from 1984 to  1987. He concurrently served as director of the Lown School of Near Eastern and  Judaic Studies until his retirement three years ago.
        Dr. Fox was born in Chicago and studied there at the Hebrew Theological College. He was ordained in 1941. That year he also graduated from Northwestern  University. He served four years as a chaplain in the Army Air Forces and returned to Chicago to complete work on his master's degree at Northwestern. He  earned a Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago in 1950.
        He taught philosophy for 26 years at Ohio State University, where he helped develop its Jewish studies program. Later, at Brandeis, he was largely responsible for building up the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies. After he retired from Brandeis he taught religion and philosophy at Boston University.
        Dr. Fox wrote a book summing up the work of one of Judaism's great philosophers, "Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Metaphysics and Moral Philosophy" (University of Chicago Press, 1990). He also edited "Modern Jewish Ethics: Theory and Practice" (Ohio State University Press, 1975). Both books remain in print.
        Dr. Fox is survived by his wife, Dr. June Trachtenberg Fox; two sons, Avron and Daniel, both of Chicago; a daughter, Sherry Begner of London, and 11 grandchildren.
