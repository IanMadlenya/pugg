        Guillaume Gallozzi, a New York art dealer who promoted graffiti during the 1980's and 20th-century British art during the early 1990's, died on Dec. 25 at  the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. He was 37 and had returned to Paris in July for medical treatment.
        He died after a five-year battle with brain cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Gallozzi was born in Aix-en-Provence, France in 1958 and came to New York City in 1977. From 1983 to 1987 he and a partner, Joe LaPlaca, ran a gallery on Greenwich Street in TriBeCa where they exhibited the works of several graffiti artists, including Ramelzee, Delta, Phase 2 and Sharp.
        In 1989 he turned to restrained works by 20th-century British artists, displaying them in a small Federal house on West Houston Street that was also his home. He concentrated on little-known or forgotten British Surrealists and Neo-Romantics from the 1930's and 40's and mounted an exhibition of British war  artists, as well as solo shows of work by Graham Sutherland, Bryan Gysin and Charles Henri Ford.
        He is survived by his mother, Susan Wise; his father, Jean Pierre Gallozzi, and a half-sister, Pyra Wise, all of Paris; and his sister, Siane Gallozzi, of Seattle.
