        Msgr. Edmund F. Fogarty, a child care specialist who spent two decades with the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, died yesterday in the rectory of the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton parish in Shrub Oak, N.Y., where he had been pastor for 14 years. He was 76.
        The parish administrator, Msgr. James McCarthy, said the cause was cancer.
        Until he went to northern Westchester County in 1982 as the Seton parish's second pastor, Monsignor Fogarty had devoted almost his entire career to the cause of children.
        Monsignor Fogarty, a native of Manhattan who attended Cathedral College and St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, was ordained in 1945. He spent only two years at a church before becoming one of several promising young priests, including his friend Terence Cooke, the future Cardinal, to be assigned to graduate training in social work.
        After obtaining a master's degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1949, he served 20 years with a variety of child care agencies operated by Catholic Charities. As director of the Archdiocese of New York's child care department, he was named by Mayor Robert F. Wagner as one of the first chairmen of the city's Head Start organizing committee in the mid 1960's.
        He left his post in 1969, and spent 13 years as executive director of the archdiocese's flagship foster care agency, the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin at Mount Loretto on Staten Island.
        Monsignor Fogarty is survived by a brother, Donald X. Fogarty of Ridgewood, Conn., and a sister, Mary Crego of White Plains.
