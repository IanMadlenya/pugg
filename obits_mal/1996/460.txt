        John Lee Hubby, a geneticist and retired professor of zoology and biology at  the University of Chicago, died on March 28 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 64.
        He had suffered a brief illness, the university said.
        Dr. Hubby contributed to the understanding scientists now have of the relationship between evolution and genetic variation. In the early 1960's he began a series of electrophoresis studies, which can trace the migration of charged particles or of molecules through a fluid or gel subjected to an electric field.
        His objective was to chart the extent of genetic variation among the same genes in different species. The difference he found served as a measure of the evolutionary distance between those organisms.
        He worked with the geneticist Richard Lewontin, then at Chicago and now at Harvard University, to determine that in natural populations of fruit flies there was much more genetic variation between individual flies than had previously been thought.
        Dr. Hubby's survivors include his second wife, Marion Monroe Hubby; and a daughter and two sons from his previous marriage, Donya Corry, Allen and John Clifton, all of Manhattan.
