        Paul A. Schaefer, a founder or co-founder of several organizations for the preservation of the Adirondack wilderness, died on July 13 after knee surgery at St. Clare's Hospital in Schenectady. He was 87 and lived in the Schenectady suburb of Niskayuna and in an Adirondack cabin.
        Mr. Schaefer began working to preserve the Adirondack back country in the 1930's, organizing coalitions to campaign for laws to protect the state's northern wilderness areas from development.
        His work is credited with playing a role in the development of the six million-acre Adirondack State Park, a huge land mass of private and public properties governed by strict regulations limiting construction.
        Mr. Schaefer's wife, Carolyn, died in 1985. He is survived by three daughters, Mary of Halifax, Nova Scotia; Evelyn Greene of North Creek, and Monica Wiitanen, of Paonia, Colo.; a son, Francis of Jackson, Wyo.; a brother, Carl of Niskayuna and North Creek; two sisters, Margaret Allen of Colonie, N.Y., and Gertrude Fogarty of Albany, and six grandchildren.
