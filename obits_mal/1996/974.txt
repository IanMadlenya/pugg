        Dr. John Floyd Holt, a groundbreaking pediatric radiologist, died on July 22 at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich., where he was professor emeritus of radiology at the University of Michigan Medical Center. He was 81.
        Dr. Holt spent 45 years on the faculty of the university's medical school, retiring in 1984. He helped plan the medical center's C. S. Mott Children's Hospital, which opened in 1969, and was its first director of pediatric radiology.
        He was a co-author of ''Radiology for Medical Students,'' a textbook widely used after it first appeared in 1947. A fourth edition was published in 1965.
        He was a radiologic authority on neurofibromatosis, or Recklinghausen disease, a serious genetic condition characterized by discolored skin lesions and sometimes accompanied by physical deformity. The National Neurofibromatosis Foundation honored him in 1986 for his ''invaluable contributions'' to the field.
        He was born in Pittsburgh and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, where he also received his medical degree. He was a charter member and past president of the Society for Pediatric Radiology.
        Dr. Holt is survived by his wife of 54 years, Mary Helen Holt; two daughters, Susan and Jane Holt of Ann Arbor; a son, John C., of Salt Lake City; a sister, Dorothy Dunkle of Emlenton, Pa.; and two grandsons.
