        Tommy Rettig, the first boy to play Lassie's master on television, was found  dead in his home in Marina del Rey on Thursday. He was 54.
        The cause of death was not known, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said.
        Mr. Rettig was already a child star with movie and stage credits when he was picked from among 500 applicants in 1954 to play Lassie's owner, Jeff Miller. He was on the program until 1958, when he was replaced by Jon Provost, who played Timmy.
        The popular series continued to run for another 16 years, featuring Lassie with various owners.
        Born Thomas Noel Rettig, he began his acting career at age 6 in a touring production of "Annie Get Your Gun." He landed his first movie role at age 9 and  made 17 films in all. Among them was "River of No Return" with Robert Mitchum and Marilyn Monroe and "The Last Wagon" with Richard Widmark.
        During the 1980's, Mr. Rettig founded Tom Rettig Associates, a computer software company. He also published three computer books.
        Mr. Rettig was arrested several times in the 1970's on drug charges, including an accusation that he was growing marijuana on his farm near San Luis  Obispo. Despite his troubles with the law, Mr. Rettig remained an advocate of drug use, and in 1983 he supported a proposed state initiative to legalize marijuana.
