        Dr. James Francis Brady, a classics professor, writer and translator whose 46-year tenure made him one of the longest-serving educators in the history of Fordham University, died on Friday at his home in Hartsdale, N.Y. He was 86.
        Dr. Brady started as a classroom instructor in Latin and Greek shortly after having graduated magna cum laude from Fordham in 1933. He also attended the Fordham Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and received an M.A. degree in classics in 1938.
        Dr. Brady was born in New York City. After serving in World War II as an officer in the Adjutant General's office, he returned to Fordham and completed his doctoral studies at Columbia University.
        He became a full professor in 1971 and retired in 1980 with emeritus rank.
        His more than 6,000 students included two future university presidents, Dr. William J. McGill of Columbia and the Rev. James C. Finlay of Fordham.
        Dr. Brady published many translations from the classics, as well as book reviews. He was co-author, with Gabriel M. Liegey and Joseph M. Murphy, of ''Cicero's Pro Archia'' (Fordham University Press, 1940)  and, with John C. Olin, of ''The Collected Works of Erasmus'' (University of Toronto Press, 1992).
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Ryan Brady; three sons, James, of Hartsdale, Peter, of Taiwan, and Thomas, of Larchmont, N.Y., and a grandson.
