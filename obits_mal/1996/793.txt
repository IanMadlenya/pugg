        Alan Booth, a pianist who accompanied the singer Paul Robeson in concerts and on recordings and who was one of the first black musicians to tour the United States as a member of integrated chamber ensembles and orchestras, died on June  4 at the Heathwood Nursing Home in Newton, Mass., where he lived. He was 71.
        The cause was brain cancer, said a spokesman for the Blackington, Conroy and  Hayes Funeral Home in Newton.
        Mr. Booth graduated from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio in 1946,  and he began working with Robeson soon after. He accompanied Robeson until his farewell concert in 1958.
        Mr. Booth also toured widely as a soloist. He was a founding member of the Symphony of the New World, an ensemble that was said to have been the first integrated orchestra in the United States. He performed as a soloist with the New York-based orchestra at Carnegie Hall and at what was then Philharmonic (now Avery Fisher) Hall in the 1960's.
        He is survived by two sons, Douglas and Alan Jr., and a daughter, Donna Brindel-Eliscu, all of New York City; two brothers, Beverly and Wendell, both of Newton, and five grandchildren.
