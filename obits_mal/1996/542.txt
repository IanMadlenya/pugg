        Dr. Leroy Elsworth Doggett, an astronomer who headed the nautical almanac office at the United States Naval Observatory, died on Tuesday at George Washington University Hospital. He was 54 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was cancer, the observatory said.
        Dr. Doggett was an expert in calendars, astronomical phenomena, planetary theory and the evolution of astronomy. For the last 20 years he compiled and edited The Astronomical Almanac, a world standard for the precise determination of astronomical events and the positions of celestial objects.
        Dr. Doggett, a native of Waterloo, Iowa, graduated from the University of Michigan and earned a Ph.D. from North Carolina State University. He joined the  Naval Observatory in 1965 as an astronomer in the nautical almanac office and was head of that office from 1991 until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Ozenberger, and his stepdaughter, Maia Whang. An earlier marriage, to Rachel Doggett, ended in divorce.
