        Lum Harris, a former major league pitcher who managed the Atlanta Braves to their first division title in 1969, died Monday in Pell City, Ala. He was 81 and had been ill with diabetes for a long period.
        As a pitcher from 1941 to 1947, he compiled a rather undistinguished record of 35-63 with some rather undistinguished Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators teams. As a manager, however, Harris distinguished himself in 1969 by taking Atlanta to the National League West Division title with a 93-69 record.
        In the playoffs, the upstart New York Mets swept the Braves in three games, won the pennant and then captured the World Series.
        Harris served as manager of Houston late in 1964, when the team was the Colt 45s, and he was the full-time skipper of the team in 1965, when it was renamed the Astros.  Harris got his first major league managing job in 1961, when he was hired by the Baltimore Orioles on an interim basis.
        His career record of 460-498 as a manager included 379 victories with Atlanta over five years.
        Harris retired from the Braves in 1972 and moved back to his native Alabama.
