        James D. Hopkins, a former New York State appeals judge and Westchester County Executive, died Friday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 84 and a lifelong resident of Armonk, N.Y.
        Judge Hopkins retired in 1981 after 19 years as an associate justice of the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court, Second Department, sitting in Brooklyn. He then was acting dean of the Pace University School of Law and, in 1984, returned to court as a judicial hearing officer. He formally retired in 1994.
        A Republican, he was Westchester County Executive from 1954 to 1957 after several years as majority leader and chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. In 1957, he became a county judge. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him to the State Supreme Court in 1960, and he subsequently was confirmed in the position at the polls.
        He graduated from Columbia College and, in 1933, from the Columbia University School of Law.
        Judge Hopkins was also an author, with Robert MacCrate and Maurice Rosenberg, of "Appellate Justice in New York," published in 1982 by the American Judicature Society.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Bertha Bower Hopkins; a son, David, of Mohegan Lake, N.Y.; a daughter, Cynthia Smith of Toms River, N.J.; a sister,  Marguerite Lewis of Armonk, and two grandchildren.
