        Jim Reid, the men's basketball coach at Georgetown College for the last 23 seasons and this year's National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics coach  of the year, died today after a two-year battle with lung cancer. He was 48.
        Reid earned the coaching honor by leading the Tigers to a 36-3 record and the No. 1 ranking, but he was too ill to travel with the team when the N.A.I.A. tournament began. Georgetown reached the championship game but lost.
        Reid had a 529-199 record and ranked seventh in victories among active coaches in the N.A.I.A. He was inducted into the N.A.I.A. Basketball Hall of Fame in Tulsa, Okla., on March 11.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy, and two children, Shannon and Jack.
