        Hamilton B. Mitchell, a former chairman and chief executive of the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, died at his home in Tucson, Ariz., last Tuesday. He was 80.
        The cause of death has not yet been determined, David M. Monfried, a Dun & Bradstreet spokesman, said.
        A 1938 graduate of Dartmouth College, Mr. Mitchell began his career with the Reuben H. Donnelly Corporation, the nation's largest independent marketer of Yellow Pages advertising.
        In 1961, Mr. Mitchell was named president at Donnelly, and a director of Dun & Bradstreet when Donnelly became a subsidiary of D.& B.
        In 1968, he was elected president and chief executive of Dun & Bradstreet, which today is the world's largest provider of business-to-business credit, financial and marketing information. In 1972, he was elected chairman, a position he retained until his retirement in 1975. Mr. Mitchell was credited with integrating Donnelly into Dun & Bradstreet.
        He is survived by his wife, Betty Ward Mitchell, of Tucson and Castine, Me.; a brother, Marshall W. Mitchell of Atlanta; two sons, John H. Mitchell of Scarborough, Me., and Thomas W. Mitchell of Tucson, and four grandchildren.
