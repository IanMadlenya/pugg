        A. Martin Macy, a retired pilot, aviation consultant and executive with regional airline associations in Washington, died on Thursday at his home in Houston, where he had moved last year. He was 70 and also kept homes in Washington and Antigua.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Macy was a former president and chief executive of Horizon Aviation of Charlottesville, Va., which managed airports and provided air taxis and commuter airline service in central Virginia.
        Later, in the 1970's, he held management positions in Washington. He was executive director and a vice president for the National Air Transportation Association and retired in 1980 as vice president for operations of the Commuter Airline Association. For the next five years he was an aviation consultant in Washington.
        Archer Martin Macy was born in Manhattan, a descendant of a Nantucket family of whalers. One, Rowland Hussey Macy, opened the dry-goods store in Manhattan in 1858 that became R. H. Macy & Company.
        He was attending the University of Virginia but left to join the Seventh Cavalry Division and serve in the Pacific in World War II. He graduated from Cornell University in 1951 with a degree in agronomy and started a dairy farm in Orange, Va.
        He is survived by his wife of 18 years, Bona Comel di Socebran Macy; five sons from a previous marriage, Archer M. Jr., of Norfolk, Va., Robert D., of Boston, William M., of San Jose, Calif., John N., of San Diego, and Eugene E., of Simsbury, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Cristiana H. Anderson of Houston and Isabella Hutchinson of Manhattan; a stepson, William N. L. Hutchinson of Hong Kong; his stepmother, Elena Aldcroft Macy of Washington; seven grandchildren, and two stepgrandchildren. His first marriage, to Cathrine Donnelly Macy of Scotia, N.Y., ended in divorce.
