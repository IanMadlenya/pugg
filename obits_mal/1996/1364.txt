        Terence Donovan, a London truck driver's son who became an eminent fashion and society photographer whose subjects included Margaret Thatcher and the Princess of Wales, was found dead at his studio in West London on Friday. He was 60 and lived in London.
        His wife, Diana, said in a statement that he ''took his own life as a result of a severe reaction to medication,'' Reuters reported. Mrs. Donovan gave no details about his health. A post-mortem is to be performed today, followed by an inquest.
        Mr. Donovan's photographs appeared in Vogue, Elle, Harpers & Queen, Marie-Claire and other magazines. His work also included directing music videos and a 1972 feature film, ''Yellow Dog.'' He once said: ''I was always more interested in doing the thing than being the thing. I was much more interested in photography than being a photographer.''
        A native of London's East End, Mr. Donovan dropped out of school when he was 11, worked as a lithographer, took up photography as a teen-ager and made it his profession when he was 22. He became known for photographing celebrities like Jean Shrimpton and Julie Christie.
        His books included ''Fighting Judo'' (1985). He was a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society and of the Royal Society of Arts.
        His 1961 marriage to Janet Cohen ended in divorce. In addition to his wife of 26 years, the former Diana St. Felix Dare, he is survived by two sons and a daughter.
