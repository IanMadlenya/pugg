        Cecil Head, one of the nation's leading bridge players half a century ago, died in his hometown, Fort Branch, Ind., last Wednesday. He was 85 and died of congestive heart failure, said his wife, Olivia.
        Mr. Head set records in winning the National Life Master Pair Championship in 1948. He and his partner, S. Garton Churchill, scored 65 percent over four sessions, and 77.4 percent in a single session. He also won more than 14 regional championships and contributed to his partner's theoretical ideas, some  of which became standard practice.
        Mr. Head was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from Harvard University  and then Yale Law School. He then practiced as a lawyer in Manhattan.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, Charles, of North Miami Shores, Fla., and two grandchildren.
