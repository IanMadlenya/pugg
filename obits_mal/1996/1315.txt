        David S. Lifson, a businessman, teacher, author and playwright, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        He ran a paint manufacturing business while earning a master's degree and a doctorate in education from New York University. He left business in the 1960's and taught English and theater at Jersey City State College, Pratt Institute and Monmouth College of New Jersey.

        He is survived by a son, Hugh Anthony Lifson of Mount Vernon, Iowa; a brother, Jerome, of Douglaston, Queens; a sister, Mae Lifson of Flushing, Queens; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
