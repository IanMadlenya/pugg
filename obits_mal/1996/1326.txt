        David Alvra Wood, who headed the Cancer Research Institute at the University of California at San Francisco from 1951 to 1972, died on Nov. 6 at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 91 and lived in San Francisco.
        Dr. Wood spent his life in the forefront of the fight against cancer, both as a researcher and a strong national voice for that work. He was a past president of the American Cancer Society and continued as a consultant and historian for the society after retiring from the university in 1975 as professor emeritus of pathology.
        Born in Flora Vista, N.M., he graduated from Stanford University, where he earned his M.D. in 1930. He taught at Stanford for 20 years before joining the San Francisco faculty in 1951 to direct the research institute. In his honor, the university established a David A. Wood Chair of Tumor Biology and Cancer Research in 1983.
        His many publications dealt with topics as diverse as hospital-physician relations, cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, the clinical classification of cancer and epidemiology. He was an adviser to the National Cancer Center in the drafting of the 1971 National Cancer Act.
        Dr. Wood is survived by his wife of 59 years, Orabelle Bomberger Wood; a daughter, Kate Lord; four sons, David A. 3d, John A., William A. and Charles E.; 16 grandchildren and a great-grandson.
