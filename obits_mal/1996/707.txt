        Jerome Melvin Edelstein, a former staff member of the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica, Calif., died on June 12 at a  hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 71 and lived in Bristol, R.I.
        The cause was cancer, said Norman Fiering, director and librarian of the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University in Providence.
        Mr. Edelstein went to the Getty Center in 1986 as senior bibliographer and resource coordinator and was promoted to assistant director of collection development, a position he held until his retirement in 1994.
        Among his acquisitions for the center were major collections of books on Islamic and Byzantine art and architecture, books and graphics by Max Ernst and  the papers of the Italian Futurist F. T. Marinetti.
        He was born in Baltimore in 1924 and was a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. After World War II he returned to Florence, where he had been stationed by the Army, to study Italian  history and literature as a Fulbright Fellow at the University of Florence.
        He taught history, literature and rare-book librarianship at Johns Hopkins, the University of California and Brown University. Mr. Edelstein published "Wallace Stevens: A Descriptive Bibliography" in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; two sons, Paul, of Kansas City, Mo., and Nathaniel, of Bristol and Tucson, Ariz.; a sister, Nadine E. Goldstein of Yardley, Pa., and four grandchildren.
