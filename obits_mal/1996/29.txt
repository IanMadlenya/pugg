        J. Moe Newman, co-founder of a New York clothing chain that at its peak had some 150 outlets nationwide, died on Jan. 13 at his home on the Upper West Side  of Manhattan. He was 87.
        Mr. Newman, who was also a benefactor of Jewish causes and philanthropies, joined his brother, Samuel O. Newman, to form Ripley Clothes in 1936. The company eventually combined with Howard Stores. It dissolved about 15 years ago  when Mr. Newman retired as president of Ripley and treasurer of Howard.
        He was a supporter of B'nai B'rith, and he and his brother helped establish  an elementary school in Israel.
        Mr. Newman is survived by his wife of 63 years, Frieda Orenzow Newman; two daughters, Phyllis Charash of Woodbury, L.I., and Toni Sachs of Wantagh, L.I.; two sons, Herbert, of Syosset, L.I., and Martin, of Manhattan; a brother, Samuel, who also lives in Manhattan; a sister, Rebecca Sassower of Rego Park, Queens, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
