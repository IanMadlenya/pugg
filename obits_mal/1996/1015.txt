        Philip B. Yampolsky, a scholar of Zen Buddhism, died on Sunday at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 75 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, his wife, Yuiko, said.
        Mr. Yampolsky, an expert in Chinese and Japanese religions, taught at Columbia University for 32 years. He produced analytical translations of Zen classics for use as texts. He also was head of Columbia's C. V. Starr East Asian Library from 1968 to 1981.
        The titles of his works include ''Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch'' (1967), ''The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected Writings'' (1971), ''Selected Writings of Nichiren'' (1990) and ''Letters of Nichiren'' (1996), which translated and explained the works of the 13th century Buddhist reformer. All were published by Columbia University Press.
        Mr. Yampolsky graduated from Columbia College in 1942. He served in the Navy in World War II and later studied Buddhism in Japan.
        In 1962, he returned to teach at Columbia, where he received his Ph.D. He retired as a professor in 1990 but continued as a special lecturer until 1994.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Susan Niland of Saddle Brook, N.J., and Ruri Yampolsky of Seattle; a son, Robert, of New York City; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
