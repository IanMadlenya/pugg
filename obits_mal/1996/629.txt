        William Blackie, a Scottish-born accountant who presided over Caterpillar Inc. as chairman and chief executive during booming years of growth for the manufacturer of tractors and other earth-moving equipment, died on Thursday in San Rafael, Calif., where he lived after retiring from Caterpillar. He was 90.
        During Mr. Blackie's tenure as chief executive, from 1966 to 1972, Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., grew from a company with $827 million a year in sales, most of them within the United States, into a multinational powerhouse with manufacturing plants abroad. Worldwide annual revenue reached $2.6 billion  by the time of Mr. Blackie's retirement.
        Mr. Blackie was born in Glasgow on May 1, 1906, and studied at the University of Glasgow. Becoming an accountant in 1930, after a five-year apprenticeship, he came to the United States that year, joining Price Waterhouse in its Chicago office, where he worked on the Caterpillar account. He joined Caterpillar in 1939 as controller.
        A few months later the war in Europe began, and for the next few years Mr. Blackie played an important role in producing engines for the American military. He became a vice president of Caterpillar in 1944, an executive vice president in 1954, president of the company in 1962 and chairman in 1966.
        Two years after his retirement, Mr. Blackie joined the investment banking firm of Lehman Brothers as a senior partner and director in its San Francisco office. He remained until his second retirement, in 1984.
        Mr. Blackie is survived by his wife, Florence; a son, Bruce, of Hillsborough, Calif.; a sister, Jessie Hyne Hamilton of Glasgow, and three grandchildren.
