        Arthur Getz, a painter and illustrator who created more than 200 covers for The New Yorker, died on Friday in Sharon Hospital in Sharon, Conn. He was 82 and lived in Sharon.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Sarah.
        Mr. Getz's first cover for The New Yorker appeared on July 23, 1938. It was  a map of Larchmont, N.Y., with tiny yachts sailing on Long Island Sound. Over the next half century, the magazine ran 210 of his covers, more than any other artist's. His most recent cover, for the issue of Aug. 29, 1988, was a night scene on the lawn of a small country hotel. Many of his covers captured the changing light of New York City.
        Mr. Getz was born in Passaic, N.J., and studied art and design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, graduating with honors in 1935. During World War II he was a surveyor with the Army in the Philippines.
        His illustrations also appeared in The Nation, The New Republic, Cue, P.M. and Audubon. He taught at the School of Visual Art in Manhattan, the University  of Connecticut and the Washington Art Association in Washington, Conn. He wrote  and illustrated several children's books, including "Humphrey the Dancing Pig" and a series featuring Hamilton Duck. He also illustrated "Mr. Goat's Bad Good Idea" and "Jennifer's Walk," which was written by his wife, Anne Carriere.
        He is survived by his daughter, of Aptos, Calif.
