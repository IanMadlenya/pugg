        Victor Crawford, a former tobacco lobbyist who became a crusader against smoking after his throat cancer was diagnosed, died on March 2 at Johns Hopkins  Hospital here. He was 63 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        Mr. Crawford, a former Maryland legislator, was a lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute for six years until his cancer was diagnosed in 1991. He then began speaking out against smoking, was featured on the CBS News program "60 Minutes"  and spoke on President Clinton's weekly radio address.
        I told politicians that there was no evidence that smoking causes cancer,"  he said in a 1995 interview. "If that's not lying, I don't know what is. I'm just trying to undo some of the damage I've done."
        Mr. Crawford, a Democrat, was elected to the House of Delegates in 1966 and appointed to the State Senate in 1969 to fill a term. He retired from the Senate in 1983.
        Mr. Crawford is survived by his wife, Linda; a daughter, Charlene, and a son, Victor Jr.
