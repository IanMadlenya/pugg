        Michael F. O'Keefe Sr., a retired Sunday picture editor of The New York Times who also handled pictorials for several illustrated books, died on Dec. 6 at Hackensack University Medical Center in Hackensack, N.J. He was 73 and lived in Rutherford, N.J. The cause was kidney failure, his family said.
        Born in Hoboken, N.J., Mr. O'Keefe spent 46 years working for The Times Sunday department, with three years out for Army service in World War II. He started as an office boy at the magazine in 1941 and retired in 1986 after being in charge of the magazine's photographic contents for 12 years.
        He was picture editor and consultant on a number of books involving domestic and world affairs. They included a four-volume pictorial record of World War II, a sample summary of the battlefield photojournalism made famous by photographers including Robert Capra. ''Eyewitness History of World War II,'' with a narrative by Abraham Rothberg, was published by Bantam Books in 1963.
        Mr. O'Keefe's other picture credits included two books on the Kennedy era, ''R.F.K.'' by Dick Schaap (New American Library, 1967), and ''Ted Kennedy: Profile of a Survivor'' by William H. Honan (Quadrangle, 1972).
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Mary Williams O'Keefe; two sons, Brian M., of Rutherford, and Michael F. Jr., of East Hanover, N.J.; a daughter, Deborah O'Keefe Moran, also of Rutherford, and five grandchildren.
