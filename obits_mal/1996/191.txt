        Warren Philip Chernock, a nuclear and metallurgical engineer whose career took him from the Argonne National Laboratory to Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, died on Saturday at his home in Fairfax Station, Va. He was 70.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        At his death he was senior adviser for engineering and science applications  at the National Science Foundation.
        Mr. Chernock was born in Fall River, Mass., graduated from Columbia College in 1949, then worked at the Argonne laboratory, in Illinois.
        He joined Combustion Engineering in 1956 and rose to vice president for advanced nuclear systems by the time he retired in 1991.
        He directed programs for developing fuel cells and reactors, started foreign  technical exchanges, took part in the investigation of the nuclear incident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania and worked on the planned decommissioning of the nuclear plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine, after the 1986 reactor explosion.
        Mr. Chernock is survived by his wife, Carol, whom he married in 1989; a son,  Dr. Richard Chernock of Newtown, Conn.; three daughters, Karen Loscher of West Hartford, Conn., Linda C. Gordon of Southington, Conn., and Nancy Philo of Hudson, Ohio, and nine grandchildren. His 40-year marriage to Joan Dubilet Chernock, of West Hartford, ended in divorce.
