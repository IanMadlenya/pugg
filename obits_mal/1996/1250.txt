        J. Lyndon Shanley, a professor emeritus of English at Northwestern University and a specialist in the writings of Henry David Thoreau, died on Tuesday at the Wagner Health Center in Evanston, Ill. He was 86.
        Mr. Shanley's landmark work of scholarship was his examination in the 1950's of the manuscript of Thoreau's ''Walden.'' This showed that the work had been written in eight different drafts over a period of nearly a decade. Mr. Shanley published the results of his research into Thoreau's painstaking labors in ''The Making of Walden'' (1957). He was also the author of another study, ''The Writings of Henry D. Thoreau: Walden'' (1971). And he was president of the Thoreau Society of Concord, Mass., in 1958-59.
        Mr. Shanley was born on July 3, 1910, in Allenhurst, N.J. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and received a bachelor's degree and a doctorate in English from Princeton University, concentrating on English Renaissance literature. He joined the Northwestern faculty in 1936 and taught there until retiring in 1978. From 1946 to 1976, he was first assistant, then associate dean of the  College of Arts and Sciences.
        He is survived by a daughter, Mary Lyndon Chromey of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; a son, F. Sheppard, of Evanston; a brother, Richard, of Oceanport, N.J., and two grandchildren.
