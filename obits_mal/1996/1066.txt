        Ben Joelson, an Emmy-winning television writer and producer, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 70.
        The cause was complications of lung disease, said his son, Marko.
        Mr. Joelson began his career writing for ''Candid Camera'' and the Robert Q. Lewis show on CBS, where he met Art Baer, who became his partner. The two wrote more than 100 scripts for shows that included ''Gomer Pyle,'' ''Get Smart,'' ''The Odd Couple,'' ''The Jeffersons'' and ''Hogan's Heroes.''
        From 1977 to 1985, the Joelson-Baer team was associated with Aaron Spelling Productions as writers and producers of ''The Love Boat.'' Mr. Joelson also wrote variety shows for a number of stars, including Victor Borge, Perry Como, Jim Nabors and Carol Burnett. The shows he wrote for Ms. Burnett earned him an Emmy Award in 1972.
        In addition to his son, of Studio City, Calif., he is survived by his wife, Rhoda; a daughter, Melissa, of Paris; a sister, Norma Hayman, of Rumson, N.J., and a brother, George of Ocean, N.J.
