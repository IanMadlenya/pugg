        Eugene Polyakov, a Russian-trained balletmaster who was Rudolf Nureyev's chief assistant when Nureyev was director of the Paris Opera Ballet in the 1980's, died on Oct. 24 in Paris.
        No cause of death was given in a report by the newspaper Le Monde.
        Mr. Polyakov, who was 53, was born in Moscow and trained at the Bolshoi Ballet before leaving Russia for Venice in 1976.
        He formed his own troupe, Viva la Danza, there in 1977 and was the dance director of the Teatro Communale in Florence from 1978 to 1983, when Nureyev appointed him balletmaster. Nureyev died in January 1993.
        Mr. Polyakov worked again in Florence from 1992 to 1995, when he returned to the Paris Opera Ballet.
