        Philip B. Healey, a New York State Assemblyman who espoused the cause of the  elderly, died yesterday, apparently of a heart attack, at Massapequa General Hospital on Long Island, moments after he finished marching in the town's Memorial Day parade. He was 72.
        Mr. Healey, a Republican from Massapequa, was elected to the Assembly in 1970 and turned back every political challenger. A business consultant, Mr. Healey was a supporter of reducing the state budget and a leading advocate for the elderly. He helped bring a veterans nursing home to Long Island.
        Last year, during a debate on Gov. George E. Pataki's budget that cut business taxes and imposed new restrictions on welfare recipients, Mr. Healey said: "We're trying to encourage people to have jobs. Don't leave New York State. If you want to quote the Bible, that's what St. Paul said. 'Everyone must work, and then we'll have a great future.' "
        He was responding to a colleague, who had invoked God in the debate.
        Mr. Healey was born in Brooklyn in 1921 and moved to Massapequa shortly after his marriage in 1953. An Air Force veteran, he graduated from St. John's University with a bachelor's degree in business administration in 1951, and received a master's of business administration from C. W. Post college in 1968.
        Mr. Healey was elected to three terms on the Oyster Bay Town Board before being elected to the Assembly.  Patricia Lynch, a spokeswoman for the New York State Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, said the Democratic Speaker had served with Mr. Healey for 20 years. "There was a great deal of respect, even though he was a member from the other aisle," Ms. Lynch said.
        Today the Assembly will observe a moment of silence and then adjourn in Mr. Healey's memory.
        He is survived by his wife, Geneva Healey; three children, Laurette, Philip Michael and Ralph Patrick, and two grandchildren, Corinne Healey and Philip Frank Healey.
