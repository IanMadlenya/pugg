        E. Jack Beatus, who managed the financial interests of the Tisch family for more than a decade and was a former controller of United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, died on Sunday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 58 and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        The cause was complications after surgery for cancer, according to his wife,  Dr. Helena R. Beatus.
        The multibillion-dollar Tisch family fortune, which included the holdings of brothers Lawrence and Preston Robert Tisch and their seven children, is one of the nation's largest fortunes. The Tisch holdings include the Loews hotel chain, Lorillard Tobacco Company and CNA insurance.
        Before joining the Tisch organization, Mr. Beatus was controller of the U.J.A.-Federation for seven years and before that he worked for the accounting firm of S. D. Leidesdorf.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Neal, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Stacy Pucillo of Eastchester, N.Y., and his parents, Zigmund and Ania Beatus of  Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.
