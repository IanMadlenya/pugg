        John Abbott, an actor in films, theater and television, died on May 24 at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 90.
        Mr. Abbott, who was born in England, began his long career in show business in 1934, when he made his professional stage debut in a revival of Dryden's "Aureng-Zebe" with Sybil Thorndike.
        He then joined the Old Vic Company and appeared in Shakespearean roles, including Claudius in a production of "Hamlet" at Elsinore Castle in Denmark with Laurence Olivier, Vivian Leigh and Alec Guinness.
        His first Broadway role was that of Count Mancini in "He Who Gets Slapped" in 1946. He also appeared on Broadway in "Monserrat" and "The Waltz of the Toreadors."
        He made his film debut in "Mademoiselle Docteur" (1937) and went on to act in scores of films in the next 30 years. Among his film credits are "Mission to Moscow," "Jane Eyre," "A Thousand and One Nights," "Humoresque" and "The Greatest Story Ever Told."
        Mr. Abbott's television appearances in that time were even more numerous, beginning with pioneering broadcasts by the BBC before World War II. On American television during the 1950's, 60's and 70's, he had roles in a wide variety of shows, from "Gunsmoke" to "Washington Square" to "Tender Is the Night" to "Star  Trek."
        He is survived by a sister, Ivy Skeates of Cambridge, England.
