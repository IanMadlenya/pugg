        Ryotaro Shiba, a writer known for his long historical novels, died on Monday  after suffering from internal bleeding and lapsing into a coma two days earlier. He was 72.
        Mr. Shiba started writing historical novels after World War II and won the prestigious Naoki Prize for his 1959 novel, "Fukuro no Shiro" ("The Castle of an Owl").
        His best-selling books include "Ryoma ga Yuku" ("Ryoma Is Going"), about the life of Ryoma Sakamoto, a major figure in Japan's transformation from feudal military rule in the 1860's.
        For the last quarter-century, Mr. Shiba's articles on his travels around Japan were printed weekly in the magazine Shukan Asahi in a series that reached  1,146 installments. He received the Government's Order of Cultural Merit in 1993.
