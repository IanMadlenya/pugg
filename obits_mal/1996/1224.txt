        Dr. Arne Barkhuus, a retired senior public health official for the World Health Organization and a former professor at Columbia University, died on Sept. 28 at the Ingleside Nursing Home in Old Tappan, N.J. He was 90 and a longtime resident of Bronxville, N.Y.
        Dr. Barkhuus, a native of Copenhagen, received his B.A. and M.D. degrees at the University of Copenhagen and his Ph.D. in public health at Johns Hopkins University in 1938. He worked for the British Red Cross and governments in Africa and South America.
        After stints as a lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley, a public health official in Ethiopia and a consultant to the Department of Defense in World War II, he joined the World Health Organization as the United Nations was being formed.  Serving with the United Nations Department of Trusteeship, he was the chief medical officer for Arab refugees in 1948.
        He retired from the health agency  in 1968, though his subsequent role as a consultant sent him to many places, including Cambodia, the Philippines, Haiti and West Africa.
        He was a professor of public health practices in the School of Public Health at Columbia University from 1969 to 1973. He was co-author of ''National Health Planning'' (1972).
        Dr. Barkhuus is survived by a stepdaughter, Anya Taylor of South Nyack, N.Y., a sister, Barbara Wurgler-Hansen of Copenhagen; two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His wife of 44 years, Prof. Adda Bozeman Barkhuus, died in 1994.
