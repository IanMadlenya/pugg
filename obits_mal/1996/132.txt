        Roger D. Foley, a former Federal judge who occasionally castigated prosecutors from the bench, died on Sunday at his home in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 78.
        Judge Foley took senior status in 1982 after 20 years on the Federal District Court in Las Vegas but continued to hear cases until his health forced him to stop about three years ago.
        He was a scion of an old Las Vegas family of lawyers and judges. When President John F. Kennedy named him to the Federal bench in 1962, he was sworn in by his father, Roger T. Foley, whom he succeeded as a judge in the lone Federal District in Nevada. The family's prominence in the law and in Las Vegas  was such that the courthouse in which he and his father worked now bears his name.
        He was chief judge in 1980 when he startled organized-crime prosecutors by accusing them of arrogance, misconduct and trying to mislead a grand jury in an  investigation of the gambling industry. In 1983 he declared that he would stop hearing criminal cases altogether because he objected to the way the prosecutors pursued petty cases like food-stamp offenses.
        Judge Foley was born in Goldfield, Nev., and studied for the priesthood until he decided to follow his father's steps and became a lawyer. He was Clark County District Attorney and Nevada Attorney General before being appointed to the Federal bench.
        Judge Foley is survived by his wife, Anne; two daughters, Mary Lou Foley and  Judy Van Cleve; a son, Mark; three brothers, George, Joseph and John, and four grandchildren, all of Las Vegas.
