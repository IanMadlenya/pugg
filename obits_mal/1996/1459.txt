        James Nevins Hyde, a retired international lawyer who served as a United States delegate in the early years of the United Nations, died on Monday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. A former resident of Manhattan's Upper East Side, he was 87 and lived in Newtown, Conn.
        Most recently Mr. Hyde served as a consultant on international matters for the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropic arm of the family's activities.
        Born in Chicago, he graduated from Yale University in 1931 and received his law degree at Columbia in 1935.
        After several years in private practice in New York, he served as a Navy officer in World War II.
        By war's end he was a lieutenant commander and international-law adviser to the commander of the Pacific Fleet, Adm. Chester W. Nimitz.
        He became a political adviser to the United States Mission at the fledgling United Nations in 1948. He was named deputy representative to the General Assembly in 1951.
        As Truman appointees, he and the chief representative, Ernest A. Gross, resigned at the advent of the Eisenhower Administration in 1953 and formed an international law firm, Gross & Hyde.
        The United Nations became a client, seeking advice on a variety of matters, including American legislation and executive orders as they affected visa, passport and related personnel issues.
        He started working for Rockefeller Brothers Fund in 1959. He also taught, acted as a consultant and contributed articles on international law to professional journals, retiring in 1980.
        He is survived by four daughters, Mary H. Ottaway of New Paltz, N.Y.; Margaret H. Scott of Providence, R.I., and Andrea H. Hagaman and Elizabeth H. Littlefield, both of Princeton, N.J.; a son, James N. Jr. of Newton, Mass., and 11 grandchildren. His wife of 53 years, Mary Wells Hyde, died in 1988.
