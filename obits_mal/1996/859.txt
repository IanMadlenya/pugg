        William J. Alley, the former chairman and chief executive of American Brands  Inc., died Friday at his home in New Canaan. He was 66.
        The cause was suicide, the New Canaan police said.
        Mr. Alley was appointed chairman and chief executive of American Brands in 1987, a large consumer products company based in Old Greenwich. He retired at the end of 1994 but continued to serve as a member of the company's board.
        Mr. Alley joined American Brands in 1979 when it acquired the Franklin Life Insurance Company, where he had been the chief executive officer.
        In his last year at American Brands, the company, which was in the tobacco, distilled spirits and household products businesses, sold its United States tobacco operations to concentrate on its consumer products businesses.
        Mr. Alley was born in Vernon, Tex., in 1929. He was raised in Oklahoma.
        He received undergraduate degrees at Northeastern Oklahoma A.& M. College and the University of Oklahoma School of Business. He also received a law degree from the University of Oklahoma School of Law.
        He is survived by his wife, Deborah; his mother, a brother, four daughters, a son and six grandchildren.
