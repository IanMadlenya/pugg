        Ben Tobin, a hotel and real-estate investor who over the years held stakes in the Empire State Building, Broadway shows and the Hollywood Beach Hotel in Florida, died on June 7 at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was 92.
        Mr. Tobin was brought to Boston from Russia as a child and moved to Detroit in the 1920's. He was able to buy buildings in the Depression, laying the foundation for what became a far-flung chain of properties.
        In the 1930's, he bought the Hollenden Hotel in Cleveland. In 1945, he bought the Hollywood Beach Hotel, which operated as an international resort, with 800 rooms and a payroll of 1,000, until it closed in 1971.
        Together with Alfred R. Glancy and Roger L. Stevens, the founding chairman of Lincoln Center, he headed a Detroit investment syndicate that acquired a controlling interest in the Empire State Building in 1951. It was then the world's tallest structure, and its rentals also made it a particularly lucrative piece of real estate. The partnership sold it to Chicago interests a few years later.
        Mr. Tobin developed Hillcrest, a country club in Hollywood. Ben Tobin Companies Ltd., of which he was chairman, also developed shopping centers in five states. Though semi-retired, he retained an active interest in the company  until recently. The shows in which he invested included "West Side Story."
        Among other philanthropies, he was a supporter of Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, the Lowe Art Museum in Miami and the State of Israel Bond Organizations, and he was a founder of the Jewish Federation of South Broward.
        Mr. Tobin is survived by two sons, Herbert, of Golden Beach, Fla., and Steven, of Hollywood; a daughter, Benita Tobin of Portland, Ore.; a sister, Bessie Ganek of Miami Beach; a brother, Morris Tobb of Kansas City, Mo., and seven grandchildren.
