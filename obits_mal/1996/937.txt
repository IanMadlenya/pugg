        William Heyden Easton, a University of Southern California paleontologist and an authority on fossil corals, died at his home in Westlake Village on July 7. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer.
        Dr. Easton was the writer of the widely used textbook "Invertebrate Paleontology," published in 1960, and of more than 100 journal articles. He also was a consultant for oil companies.
        A faculty member at the University of Southern California since 1946, he was  chairman of the geological sciences department from 1964 to 1967. He was also acting chairman of the university's French and Italian department from 1975 to 1976 and came out of retirement to serve in the post again from 1986 to 1987.
        A paleobiologist at the university, David J. Bottjer, said Dr. Easton was "as much at home at a Baroque recital or in the French department as he was on a desert field trip or working in the geological sciences."
        Dr. Easton was a past president of the Paleontological Society and a fellow of the Geological Society of America.
        He was born Jan. 14, 1916, and grew up in Bedford, Ind., before attending Bard College in New York and studying at the Corcoran Art Institute in Washington. He earned two degrees from George Washington University and a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife, Phoebe Jane; a son, Robert, of Westlake Village,  and a daughter, Katherine, of Kailua, Hawaii.
