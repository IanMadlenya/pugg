        Irving J. Lewis, an expert in public health policy who became a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 78.
        His family said the cause was a cerebral hemorrhage.
        Mr. Lewis, who was a native of Boston, graduated from Harvard University and received a master's degree in political science from the University of Chicago, went to Washington in 1941 to prepare his doctoral thesis on agricultual policy. But when World War II intervened, he put his thesis aside and joined the Army.
        Mr. Lewis never did get back to his Ph.D. thesis, but when he returned to Washington after the war, his education began in earnest, at the old Bureau of the Budget, a forerunner of the Office of Management and Budget, whose staff members were expected to become experts in virtually every facet of the Federal Government.
        After working with a variety of agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, Mr. Lewis was named the bureau's deputy assistant director for human resources. He become such an expert on mental health policy that in 1968, he moved to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare as Deputy Administrator of the Health Services and Mental Health Administration.
        In what amounted to a purge of Federal health services officials during the Nixon Administration, Mr. Lewis turned down an offer to follow his former boss, Joseph T. English, to New York as deputy director of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. Instead, he became a professor of public policy and community health at Einstein.
        He retired in 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose; two daughters, Deborah Lewis-Idema of Laurel, Md., and Amy Gieske of Casper, Wyo.; a son, William, of Grand Rapids, Mich.; two sisters, Miriam Kouffman of Los Angeles and Bernice Ravin of Chestnut Hill, Mass., and three grandsons.
