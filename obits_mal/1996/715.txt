        Albert (Pud) Brown, a Dixieland jazz clarinetist and saxophone player who created the "Johnson Rag," died of a heart attack on Monday. He was 79.
        Mr. Brown, who was born in Wilmington, Del., began playing the saxophone at 5, touring state fairs with his family band before joining the vaudeville circuit, where he played in theater orchestras in the early 1930's. He took up Dixieland jazz, which he is best known for, in Phil Lavant's orchestra in Chicago in 1938.
        He recorded with Louis Armstrong and the Les Brown band in the late 1940's,  and recorded his "Johnson Rag" in the 1950's. He also recorded with Doc Cheatham, Danny Barker, Kid Ory and Percy Humphrey, and he played in Lawrence Welk's orchestra.
        In the 1980's, he performed with Clive Wilson's Original Camellia Jazz Band in New Orleans.
