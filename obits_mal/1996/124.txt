        Roger Crozier, a former goaltender who was the National Hockey League rookie  of the year with the Detroit Red Wings in 1964, died Wednesday night in Christiana Hospital. He was 53.
        Crozier, who lived in nearby Landenberg, Pa., died of cancer, a hospital spokesman said.
        Crozier's last hockey job was as general manager for the Washington Capitals in 1981-82. As a player, he was in the N.H.L. for 14 seasons, tending goal for Detroit, Buffalo and Washington, appearing in 518 games and compiling a 206-196-70 won-lost-tied record with 30 shutouts and a goals-against average of  3.04.
        In 1983, he joined MBNA America Bank, a local credit card company, and was the executive vice president and director of facility management when he died.
        He is survived by his wife, Janice, and two daughters, Katie and Brooke.
