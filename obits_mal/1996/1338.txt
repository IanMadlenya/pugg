        Frank Morrell, Armour Presidential Professor of Neurological Sciences at Rush Medical College in Chicago and founder of the Rush Epilepsy Center, died on Oct. 22 at his home in Chicago. He was 70.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        At his death Dr. Morrell was director of the center he organized in 1972 when he joined the medical faculty at Rush University. He was also a founder of the Society for Neuroscience in 1969.
        Dr. Morrell's work involved a direct relationship between the treatment of patients and the work done in the laboratory. Among other things, he demonstrated that normal brain cells anatomically linked with cells showing epileptic activity may become epileptic as well.
        In recent years he concentrated on a novel surgical procedure to cure seizures stemming from the outer layer of gray matter controlling language or motor function. Previous techniques risked serious functional impairments; the new procedure, known as subpial transection, spares the function while blocking seizures.
        Dr. Morrell received his undergraduate training and medical degree from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife and research collaborator, Dr. Leyla deToledo-Morrell; three sons, Seth, of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Paul and Michael, of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Suzanna Morrell of Los Angeles; a sister, Barbara Leeds of New York, and two grandchildren.
