        Robert J. Joedicke, an airline industry analyst at Lehman Brothers for 30 years who was known for his yearly seminars, died on May 18. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Joedicke died of a heart attack while he was shopping in Cohasset, Mass., near his home in Scituate.
        A large man with a direct manner, Mr. Joedicke was widely quoted in the financial press and followed the many wrenching changes that the airline industry underwent after it was deregulated in 1979.
        He liked to hobnob with the top airline executives who came to his seminars,  which ran for 15 years in Palm Beach, Fla., where they were able to talk frankly without the presence of reporters.
        But he also enjoyed the attention of the press, being readily accessible to discuss industry developments.
        He lived in Manhattan during most of his career. He built a house on the shore in Scituate for his retirement.
        Mr. Joedicke was born in Montreal and graduated from McGill University there. His interest in the airlines dated to the 1940's, when he joined the Royal Air Force Transport Command as a station manager.
        Mr. Joedicke joined Lehman Brothers in 1965 and became its senior airline analyst. He was ranked among the top three airline industry analysts for 12 years by Institutional Investor magazine.
        He retired from Lehman Brothers last year but continued to be a consultant to various airlines.
        His marriage to Geraldine McCallum in 1953 ended in divorce in 1957. He is survived by his former wife, who lives in Toronto, and his nephew, Mark S. McCaw of Scituate, Mass.
