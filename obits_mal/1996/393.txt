        John A. (Jack) Berrill, a cartoonist who produced the comic strip "Gil Thorp," died on Thursday at his home. He was 72.
        His comic strip, which runs in more than 65 newspapers nationwide, chronicles the life of a high school coach, Gil Thorp, and his efforts to deal with the off-the-court troubles of his athletes.
        From the time he created "Gil Thorp" in 1958, Mr. Berrill used the strip to  tackle such issues as teen-age pregnancy, divorce, peer pressure, depression, mental retardation and drinking problems.
        Mr. Berrill was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn Technical High School, he got a job as a copy boy with The New York Daily News. It was there that he met Martin Branner, the creator of the "Winnie Winkle" comic strip. He became a Branner assistant and worked with the cartoonist for the next 17 years. Mr. Berrill left in 1958, shortly after he created "Gil Thorp."
        He is survived by his wife, Veronica, and six children.
