        Dr. James Alfred Field Jr., a former history professor at Swarthmore College  and author on American naval history and foreign relations, died on Monday at his home in Newton Square, Pa. He was 80.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Field joined Swarthmore in 1947 and retired in 1986 as Isaac H. Clothier Professor Emeritus of History and International Relations.
        His first book, "The Japanese at Leyte Gulf" (Princeton, 1947), traced the events leading up to one of the epic battles at sea and the destruction of Japan's naval might. The book's perspective derived largely from the accounts of Japanese fleet officers who had taken part in the battle against American forces.
        Dr. Field, who served in the Navy from 1942 to 1946, fought in that clash as  a gunnery officer on an American carrier.
        His other books included "History of U.S. Naval Operations: Korea" (Government Printing Office, 1962) and, reprinted from a Princeton title, "From  Gibraltar to the Middle East: America and the Mediterranean World, 1776-1882" (Imprint Publications, 1991).
        Dr. Field, who was born in Chicago, graduated from Harvard in 1937 and received his master's degree and doctorate from there.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Lila Breckenridge Field; a son, Charles W., of Philadelphia; a daughter, Mary B. Field of Chicago, and four grandchildren.
