        Jack Wyrtzen, an evangelist and founder of the Word of Life Christian organization, died on Tuesday at Glens Falls Hospital.
        Mr. Wyrtzen, who lived in Schroon Lake, N.Y., was 82. A spokesman for the organization said Mr. Wyrtzen had never fully recovered from emergency surgery to repair an aneurysm last month.
        According to a story Mr. Wyrtzen used to tell, he was a trombonist in a dance orchestra in the 1930's when he read the Bible and decided to dedicate his life to Christian fundamentalism. He started preaching on a weekly radio show a  few years later and in 1942 created the Word of Life organization.
        The group sponsored religious rallies and services in the late 40's, including several at Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall in New York that drew 20,000 people.
        By 1949, Word of Life broadcasts began appearing on television. Around the same time, Mr. Wyrtzen purchased land in the town of Schroon Lake, in the Adirondacks about 85 miles north of Albany, to start a youth camp. The organization also started a Bible college and several camps for people of all ages. It now operates in 32 countries.
        Mr. Wyrtzen is survived by his wife, Joan, and their eight children, Mary Ann Cox of Sao Paulo, Brazil; Don of Brentwood, Tenn.; Betsy Oris of Schroon Lake; David, of Midlothian, Texas; Ron, of Milford, Ohio; Kathy Hahn of Claremore, Okla.; Don Steiner of Lakeland, Fla., and Dave Steiner of Rochester.
