        Dr. Russell C. Smart, a retired educator who teamed with his wife to write 10 books on child rearing and family relations, died on Jan. 13 at his home in San  Diego. He was 82.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Prof. Mollie Stevens Smart.
        Among the couple's books, published by Macmillan from 1967 to 1973, were four volumes subtitled "Development and Relationships." Each focused on a particular age group: infancy, preschoolers, school age and adolescence.
        Earlier, their collaboration produced "It's a Wise Parent" (Scribner, 1944),  "Living and Learning with Children" (Houghton, 1949) and "An Introduction to Family Relationships" (Saunders, 1953).
        Mr. Smart was born in Greenfield, Mass., and graduated from Dartmouth College. He earned his master's and doctorate degrees at the University of Minnesota.
        A former Fulbright Fellow, he taught at various times at the Merrill-Palmer Institute in Detroit, Cornell University and the University of Rhode Island. In  the mid-1960's he served the Federal Government as a consultant in the early stages of the Head Start program for disadvantaged youngsters.
        Beside his wife of 56 years, Dr. Smart is survived by three daughters, Ellen  Smart of San Diego, Susan Smith of Harrisonburg, Va., and Laura Smart of DeKalb, Ill.; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
