        Peter Haden-Guest, a retired editorial director at the United Nations and a British peer, died on April 8 at U.C.L.A. Hospital in Westwood, Calif. He was 73 and lived in East Hampton, L.I., though he made frequent visits to London to attend sessions of the House of Lords.
        Mr. Haden-Guest had gone to California in December for treatment of cancer.
        A graduate of New College, Oxford, he began a career as a dancer with the Markova-Dolin Ballet Company in 1935. In World War II, he served as an intelligence officer with the Royal Canadian Navy.
        After the war he joined the Secretariat of the United Nations and retired in  1972.
        In 1987 he acceded to a hereditary Labor peerage created in 1950 by Prime Minister Clement Attley for his father, Leslie Haden-Guest, a former Member of Parliament.
        Lord Haden-Guest is survived by his wife of 50 years, Lady Jean Hindes Haden-Guest; two sons, the actor-director Christopher Guest, who lives in of Santa Monica, Calif., and succeeds to the title, and Nicholas Guest of Los Angeles, who is also an actor; a daughter, Elissa Smith of San Francisco, who writes as Elissa Haden Guest; a son from a previous marriage, the writer Anthony Haden-Guest of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
        The obituary also misspelled the surname of the Prime Minister who created the hereditary Labor peerage to which Lord Haden-Guest acceded in 1987. He was Clement Attlee, not Attley.
        Correction:  May 1, 1996, Wednesday
        An obituary on Sunday about Peter Haden-Guest, a former editorial director at the United Nations and a British peer, misstated his age. Lord Haden-Guest, who  died on April 8, was 82, not 73.
