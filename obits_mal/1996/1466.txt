        Benedict I. Lubell, a retired oil executive and a patron of the arts in Tulsa, Okla., died yesterday at his home in Milwaukee. He was 87.
        The cause was emphysema, said his son, John Lubell of Philadelphia.
        Mr. Lubell grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and graduated from Columbia University and Columbia Law School. He practiced law at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in New York, until his father, Samuel, asked him in 1936 to join the family oil business in Tulsa.
        For three decades, Mr. Lubell worked at the Bell Oil and Gas Company, a Tulsa independent refiner.  He was also a founding trustee of the Tulsa Performing Arts Center, president of the Tulsa Arts Council and  head of the city's Municipal Arts Commission, which selected art for civic buildings.
        Mr. Lubell was also a director of the National Bank of Tulsa. In recognition of Mr. Lubell's contributions to the arts, the city of Tulsa named a park after him and, in 1982, he was presented with the Oklahoma Governor's Arts Award.
        In 1965, Mr. Lubell sold Bell Oil and formed a new company, Lubell Oil Company, an oil production company. He worked at Lubell Oil until moving to Milwaukee last year.
        Mr. Lubell's wife of 57 years, the former Norma Rubenstein of New York, died in 1994.
        Besides his son, John, Mr. Lubell is survived by a daughter, Ann Margolis of Milwaukee; two sisters, Grace Borgenicht Brandt of New York and Shirley Black Kash of Westport, Conn.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
