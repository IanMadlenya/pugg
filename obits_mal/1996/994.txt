        Stanley B. Sussman, principal conductor for the Martha Graham Dance Company and the Cleveland-San Jose Ballet, was found dead on July 29 in his apartment in the Ansonia Hotel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 58.
        The cause has not been determined, said Ellen Borakove of the New York City Medical Examiner's Office.
        Mr. Sussman conducted symphony and dance orchestras over his three decades in music, but he was best known for his work with dance companies and was often cited for his sensitive balancing of the needs of dancers with purely musical values. He was also a composer, and wrote the scores for three ballets in the Cleveland-San Jose repertory.
        He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in music from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. He was a music instructor in the dance division at the Juilliard School and also performed as a piano soloist. He began to conduct for the Graham company in 1966 and joined the staff of the Cleveland-San Jose Ballet in 1980 as associate music director and conductor and composer in residence.
        Mr. Sussman conducted for the Jose Limon Dance Company and Rudolf Nureyev and Friends with the Royal Danish Ballet. He also conducted the Ballet Orchestra of Ireland, the 1980 Spoleto Festival U.S.A. Orchestra and symphony orchestras throughout the United States.
        He is survived by a brother, Arthur, of Albuquerque, N.M., and a sister, Dorothy Cohen of West Palm Beach, Fla.
