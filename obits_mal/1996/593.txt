        Leon-Etienne Cardinal Duval, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Algiers who denounced the torture of Arab nationalists by the French Army in the 1954-1962 war of independence, died today in Algiers. He was 92 and had been retired since 1988.
        Pope John Paul II praised Cardinal Duval in a telegram to the current Archbishop, Henri Teissier.
        He will remain a light and an encouragement on a long and difficult road at a moment in which the Christian community in Algeria is facing testing times," the Pope said.
        Cardinal Duval was best known for his denunciations of French colonial policy and repression in the last years of French rule in Algeria.
        Although he had the support of many intellectuals and many in the church hierarchy in France, he was increasingly rejected by his own parishioners, Algeria's French settlers.
        Cardinal Duval, who was sent to Algeria in 1946, remained there after independence.
