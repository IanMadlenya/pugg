        Delmar Dennis, a former Ku Klux Klansman whose testimony helped convict Byron De La Beckwith in the 1963 slaying of the civil rights leader Medgar Evers, died on Saturday at Fort Sanders Sevier Medical Center in Sevierville. He was 56 and  lived in Sevierville.
        The cause was a heart attack.
        Described as an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Dennis testified in the 1994 trial that he had overheard Mr. Beckwith brag at a Ku Klux Klan rally in Mississippi about shooting the civil rights leader. Mr. Dennis's testimony was sought after his comments on Mr. Beckwith appeared in a book on the Ku Klux Klan.
        Mr. Evers, who was the Mississippi field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was gunned down in the driveway of his house in Jackson on June 12, 1963. Two all-white juries failed to reach verdicts in two separate trials.
        Mr. Dennis, a native of Scott County, Miss., testified that he heard Mr. Beckwith speak to a meeting of Klan leaders in rural Byram, Miss., on Aug. 8, 1965.
        Mississippi prosecutors attributed the ultimate success of the prosecution to the testimony and the discovery of the murder weapon.
        Mr. Dennis is survived by his wife, Nancy; three daughters, Becky Cook of Carthage, Miss., Suellen Gunn of Walnut Grove, Miss., and Melanie Christian of Sevierville; two sons, D. Andrew and Stephen, both of Sevierville; two brothers, Willie, of Hillsboro, Miss., who also testified in the case, and Hulen, of Morton, Miss.; two sisters, Kathleen Moore and Grace Jones, both of Forest, Miss., and seven grandchildren.
