        David Shipman, a British film historian, died on April 22 at his country home in Hampshire, England. He was 63.
        The cause was a heart attack, said James Watters, a friend.
        In his encyclopedic trilogy and in "The Great Movie Stars," "Judy Garland: The Secret Life of an American Legend" and other books, Mr. Shipman showed himself to be an assiduous researcher with a voluminous knowledge of Hollywood fact and lore. The books became authoritative sources for others writing about film. Because of his expertise, Mr. Shipman was often called on to write obituaries of movie stars and to arrange programs of films at the National Film  Theater in London.
        He was born in Norwich, England, and educated at Oxford University. After working for several publishing companies, he devoted himself to writing about film. "The Golden Years," the first part of his trilogy, was published in 1970,  followed by "The International Years" and "The Independent Years." His other books included a biography of Marlon Brando; a history of sex in cinema; "Movie  Talk: Who Said What About Whom," and "Cinema: the First 100 Years." He was working on a biography of Fred Astaire.
        For the last 30 years, Mr. Shipman lived in the Chelsea section of London with Felix Brenner, his companion and editor. His library held 42 books of notes on the 8,000 films he had seen. The Times of London said that Mr. Shipman had an "elephantine memory" for movies.
        He is survived by Mr. Brenner.
