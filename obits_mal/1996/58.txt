        Bob Pastor, a Manhattan-born boxer who achieved brief glory by entering the ring twice against the famed heavyweight champion Joe Louis, died of pneumonia Friday at a nursing home in Saratoga Springs, Fla. He was 82.
        Mr. Pastor was raised in the Inwood section of Manhattan and enrolled in New  York University, but gave up college to pursue his career as a fighter. In 65 bouts from 1935 to 1942, he had a record of 53-7-5, with 17 knockouts.
        He had one fight for the heavyweight title, when he challenged Louis in Detroit on Sept. 20, 1939.
        After retiring from boxing, he joined the Army, where he trained ski troops.  He later started a variety of businesses.
        Mr. Pastor is survived by a daughter, Roberta Sanseveri, of North Providence, R.I., and two grandchildren.
