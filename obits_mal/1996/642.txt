        Frank Hercules, whose novels dealt with racial and colonial oppression, died  last Monday at his home on Roosevelt Island. He was 85.
        Mr. Hercules was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad. He went to London to study  law at the Inns of Court. In the early 1940's, he left for the United States, where his father, an anticolonial revolutionary, had found asylum after being forced out of Trinidad.
        Mr. Hercules settled in Harlem, where he started a clothing manufacturing business, without success, and worked in the insurance industry. He also became  involved in the nascent black nationalist movement. After falling under the spell of Lewis Michaux, the bookstore owner and orator, he resolved to write.
        His first novel, "Where the Hummingbird Flies" (1961), dealt with colonial oppression in Trinidad. "I Want a Black Doll" (1967), his next novel, took interracial marriage as its subject. His third, "On Leaving Paradise" (1980), was a picaresque tale of a young man who leaves Trinidad for England. He also wrote a work of history, "American Society and the Black Revolution" (1972).
        At his death, he had completed "Sunrise at Midnight," a novel about Germans and Jews. He left unfinished a novel about the slave trade, "The Portuguese Earrings."
        He is survived by his wife, Dellora; a son, Eric, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
