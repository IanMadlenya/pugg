        Mahonri Sharp Young, an art historian, writer and former museum director, died last Sunday at his home in Bridgehampton, L.I. He was 84.
        Mr. Young was for many years the North American correspondent of Apollo, the  English art magazine. He wrote one novel, "Old George" (1940), but otherwise concentrated on late 19th- and 20th-century American art. His art books included "George Bellows" (1973), "The Eight" (1973), "Early American Moderns" (1974), "American Realists: Homer to Hopper" (1977) and "The Golden Eye" (1983).
        He was born in New York City on July 23, 1911, the son of the sculptor Mahonri M. Young -- a grandson of Brigham Young -- and Cecilia Sharp Young.
        Mr. Young taught at Sarah Lawrence College in the 1940's. He was acting director of the Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute in Utica, N.Y. from 1951 to 1953, then became director of the Columbus Gallery of Fine Art in Ohio. He retired in 1976.
        He is survived by a son, Mahonri M. Young 2d of Ottawa.
