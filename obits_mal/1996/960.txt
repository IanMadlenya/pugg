        John T. Garrity, a former managing director of McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, and a founder of the Advanced Management Institute, died on Saturday at his home on Gibson Island, Md. He was 72.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Garrity worked at McKinsey for 28 years, and was the managing director of the firm's Washington office when he retired in 1978. He later taught management at Yale and Georgetown Universities and in 1991 founded the Advanced Management Institute, which provided management training for executives from Eastern Europe, particularly the Czech Republic.
        Mr. Garrity is survived by his wife, Rachael; three daughters, Katherine Potter of Baltimore, Barbara Garrity of Houston and Claire Sinn of Watertown, N.Y., two sons, John T. Jr., of Wynnnewood, Pa., and David, of Brooklyn; two step-sons, Jon Lowder of Dumfries, Va., and Russell Lowder of Alexandria, Va.; two brothers, W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of Wellesley, Mass., and James L. Garrity of Rye, N.Y., and a sister, Margaret Shea of Worcester, Mass., and 10 grandchildren.
