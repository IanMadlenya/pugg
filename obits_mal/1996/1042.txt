        Alexander R. Hammer, a financial reporter whose career at The New York Times spanned more than 40 years, died on Saturday. He was 79 and lived in Melville, L.I.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his daughter Loretta Nudelman said.
        A financial writer with wide interests, Mr. Hammer wrote about topics ranging from the hotel industry to car exhaust devices to Wall Street.
        Mr. Hammer, who was born in New York City, graduated from the High School of Commerce and studied journalism at New York University. He joined The Times as a messenger in the advertising department in 1939 and transferred to the business news department in 1942.
        In 1943, Mr. Hammer left The Times to serve in the Army during World War II. He later became an agent with the counterintelligence corps in Munich, Germany.
        Mr. Hammer returned to The Times in 1946 and became a financial reporter in 1950. He retired in 1984. His second wife, Kaethe, died earlier this year. His first marriage ended in divorce.
        In addition to Ms. Nudelman, of Coram, L.I., Mr. Hammer is survived by two other daughters, Susan Karan of Deer Park, L.I., and Monica Rahilly of Nashua, N.H., and a son, Alexander, of Deer Park.
