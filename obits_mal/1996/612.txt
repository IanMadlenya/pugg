        Aurand Harris, a prolific and much-performed playwright who wrote for young audiences, died on Monday at Beth-Israel Hospice in Manhattan. He was 80 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was cancer, said Nellie McCaslin, a colleague at New York University, where Mr. Harris taught playwriting for the last 10 years.
        Over four decades he wrote more than 50 plays, many of which became classics in the children's repertory. They include "Androcles and the Lion," a commedia dell'arte farce first performed in 1963 and translated into 10 languages since.
        Mr. Harris's publisher, Anchorage Press, estimated that by the early 1990's his plays had been given more than 30,000 performances. After its publication in 1964, "Androcles" was televised and soon became standard fare for school, community and college theaters. The play remains Anchorage's top seller.
        Among Mr. Harris's other favorites were "Steel Away Home" (1972), "Yankee Doodle" (1975), "A Toby Show" (1978) and "The Arkansaw Bear" (1980). The last, an original story, confronts the subject of death, considered a controversial topic for a children's audience. His most recent play, "The Orphan Train," is currently making its debut at Northwestern University.
        Mr. Harris also edited several anthologies of plays adapted for chidren to perform. One volume of 15 plays is to be published by Anchorage next month. In 1976, Mr. Harris was the first playwright for children to receive a Creative Writing Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.
        Mr. Harris was born in Jamesport, Mo. He graduated from the University of Kansas City, now the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He earned a master's degree in theater at Northwestern University in 1939, by which time he had switched from acting to writing.
        No immediate family members survive.
