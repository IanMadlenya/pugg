        C. Brett Boocock Jr., a former headmaster of the Buckley School in Manhattan, died on Oct. 22 at his home in Basking Ridge, N.J. He was 66 and also had a home in Mantoloking, N.J.
        The cause was a massive pulmonary embolism, his family said.

        He was a graduate of Williams College and received a master's degree in English from Rutgers University.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Beatty Boocock; a son, Paul M., of Manhattan; two sisters, Trina Kerr of Mantoloking and Margaret Hurley of Alexandria, Va.; three stepchildren, Richard Sanford of Upper Montclair, N.J., Andrew Sanford of Manhattan and Linda Sanford of Telluride, Colo, and two stepgrandchildren.
