        Dr. Channing Liem, a retired professor of political science, former South Korean delegate to the United Nations and longtime campaigner for the peaceful reunification of a democratic Korea, died on Jan. 24 at the Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. A Berkeley resident, he was 86.
        A scholar of international relations and Far East Asian affairs, he retired in 1980 from the State University of New York at New Paltz. He taught at New Paltz for nearly 20 years and served as chairman of the department of Asian studies.
        He was born in northern Korea and came to this country in 1930 to study at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania. He also lobbied for Korea's liberation from Japan and enlisted the support of liberal intellectuals like Albert Einstein while earning his Ph.D. at Princeton.
        As a teacher at Chatham College in Pittsburgh, he was an outspoken opponent of the Syngman Rhee dictatorship in South Korea. After its collapse in 1960, an  elected reform Government named him its representative at the United Nations, but he left that post when the military seized power in Seoul the next year.
        Starting in the 1970's, his hope for peaceful reunification led him to undertake several trips to North Korea. His final visit there was in December.
        Dr. Liem is survived by his wife of 58 years, Popai Lee Liem; a daughter, Edith Sul of Cambridge, Mass.; two sons, Ramsey of Brookline, Mass., and Paul of Berkeley, and five grandchildren.
