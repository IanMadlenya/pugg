        Bill MacPhail, a self-effacing sports television executive who hired Pat Summerall, Jack Whitaker, Frank Gifford and Jim McKay for CBS and created the CNN sports department, died yesterday. He was 76.
        The cause was complications from heart surgery he underwent last week at St. Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta, according to CNN.
        William Curtis MacPhail came from a renowned baseball family. His father, Larry, was an innovative, garrulous and brawling executive who ran the Cincinnati Reds, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees. His brother, Lee, is a former president of the American League and general manager of the Yankees.
        In 18 years at CBS that began in 1956, as sports director, then as vice president of sports, Mr. MacPhail oversaw the development of the first network sports anthology, ''CBS Sunday Sports Spectacular,'' and of instant replay.
        ''We did instant replay for the Army-Navy game in 1963,'' Mr. MacPhail said last year before he retired as senior vice president of CNN Sports. ''We didn't know what it would be. So I said: 'Use it sparingly. Do it five times.' ''
        In 1960, with the help of National Football League Commissioner Pete Rozelle, Mr. MacPhail ended an era when teams were paid individually for their television rights in favor of a network deal in which all clubs would share equally.
        ''College football was the thing then,'' Mr. MacPhail recalled. ''Until we got the N.F.L., people in Texas and Nebraska had never seen it.''
        Mr. MacPhail led CBS to purchase television rights to the 1960 Winter and Summer Olympics, the National Basketball Association, the Masters golf tournament and major league baseball, for which the former pitcher Dizzy Dean called weekly games.
        ''Dizzy'd say things like, 'I don't care much for variety shows, but Dinah Shore's the best!' '' Mr. MacPhail recalled. ''Of course, she was on NBC.''
        Mr. MacPhail had the whimsical idea for a college football game -- the Santa Claus Bowl -- where St. Nick would parachute into the stadium. ''Coca-Cola was set to go, but the N.C.A.A. said no network could own a bowl game,'' he said.
        He pointed to Mr. Summerall, the former Giants place-kicker, as his best hire. ''I told him, 'I'll never criticize you for speaking too much.' '' The broadcaster, now at Fox Sports, has followed that advice to this day.
        ''I thought of him as a friend, not a boss,'' said Mr. Gifford, who has been with ABC since 1971. ''He had no airs and no ego. It was a different era and a different time, and Bill was the crown prince. But others crowned him.''
        He remembered when Mr. MacPhail released Don Meredith, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, from a handshake agreement to join CBS in 1970, so he could sign with ABC Sports to announce ''Monday Night Football.''
        ''And nobody was happier for Don than Bill,'' Mr. Gifford said.
        After working for William Paley at CBS, Mr. MacPhail spent 16 years with Ted Turner at CNN, creating a sports division for the cable service.
        ''Bill was a pioneer in the world of sports television and his contributions were invaluable to the launch and success of CNN,'' Mr. Turner, the chairman and president of the Turner Broadcasting System Inc., the parent of CNN, said in a statement.
        Since his retirement in June 1995, he had been a consultant to CNN on creating CNN/SI, a 24-hour sports news cable channel that is a joint venture with Sports Illustrated; it is set to start in December.
        Mr. MacPhail was born in Columbus, Ohio. After graduating from Swarthmore College and serving in the Navy, Mr. MacPhail followed his father's path into baseball, although the elder MacPhail discouraged his career choice. After spending 1946 as the Yankees' road secretary, Mr. MacPhail worked for eight years in front-office posts for three minor league teams.
        His final baseball job came as director of publicity for the major league Kansas City Athletics in 1955 before CBS hired him the next year.
        In addition to his brother, Mr. MacPhail is survived by three nephews, Andy, the president of the Chicago Cubs, Bruce and Allen.
