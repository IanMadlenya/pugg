        Endicott Peabody Davison, a securities lawyer who was active in nonprofit organizations, serving on the boards of the Union Theological Seminary and the American Museum of Natural History and as a fund-raiser for Yale, died on Friday at his home in Lyme, Conn. He was 73.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Davison was a partner in the law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts in New York and Connecticut from 1959 to 1980 and later was of counsel to the firm.
        Over the years, he was also president of the National Parks and Recreation Association, a trustee of the Groton School in Groton, Mass., and a member of the boards of the Seaport at Mystic, the Stamford Museum and Nature Center in Connecticut and other institutions.
        From 1971 to 1976, he was Yale University's director of institutional development and capital support, overseeing a fund-raising campaign that exceeded its goal of $375 million.
        A native New Yorker, he was a grandson of the Rev. Endicott Peabody, who founded Groton School. Mr. Davison grew up in Locust Valley, L.I., graduated from Groton and was a pilot in the United States Army Air Force in World War II.
        In 1948, he graduated from Yale College, where he was captain of the 1947 football team and belonged to the secret Skull and Bones society in the same era as George Bush, the future President. He received a law degree in 1951 from the University of Virginia.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Jane Ingalls; three sons, Endicott Peabody Jr. of Boothbay Harbor, Maine, David I. of Bainbridge Island, Wash., and Malcolm Peabody of Kansas City, Mo.; a daughter, Jane of Geneva, N.Y.; seven grandchildren, and a brother, Daniel P. of Manhattan.
