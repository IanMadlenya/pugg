        S. Heagan Bayles, a founder of SSC&B, a major New York advertising agency, died of cancer on Jan. 30 at his retirement home in Fort Lauderdale. He was 85.
        In 1946, Mr. Bayles founded SSC&B with three colleagues: Raymond Sullivan, Donald Stauffer and Robert Colwell. Aware that the advertising business was becoming increasingly global, SSC&B bought a major interest in Lintas, an agency that had offices in 34 countries. He continued as chairman of SSC&B-Lintas until its sale in 1979.
        Richard Uhl, who worked for decades with Mr. Bayles at SSC&B and elsewhere,  said that Mr. Bayles "realized early that all business was going to go global, and you could not become a very important force in U.S. advertising if you didn't have that very necessary capacity overseas."
        Mr. Bayles graduated from Dartmouth College in 1933 and joined the advertising agency Ruthrauff & Ryan, whose expertise was in print. As the agency moved into radio, he helped build a staff that focused on writing for the ear, rather than the eye.
        Among the campaigns for which Mr. Bayles was credited was a jingle for Rinso  White, and a campaign for Pall Mall that included a jingle heavily dependent on  sound effects: "On the land, on the sea and in the air."
        His first wife, Gladys, died in 1980. He is survived by his second wife, Jane; three children, S. Heagan Bayles Jr. of Great Neck, L.I., Elizabeth Wheeler of Sarasota, Fla., and Christina B. Callahan of Glen Cove, L.I.; two brothers, Allison Larch Bayles of Atlanta and Charles Barnett Bayles of Severna  Park, Md.; several grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
