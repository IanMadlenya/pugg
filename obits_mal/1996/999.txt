        Dr. Arthur E. Bisson, an expert in antisubmarine warfare who had been director of science and technology in the Office of Naval Research since 1992, died on Aug. 3 at his home in McLean, Va. He was 55.
        The cause was colon cancer.
        Dr. Bisson, who had been appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for antisubmarine warfare in 1989, specialized in underwater acoustics. A graduate of the University of Massachusetts and Michigan State University, he earned a doctorate in nuclear physics at Florida State University in 1969.
        After joining the Naval Ship Warfare Center in Maryland, he became a researcher and supervisor in a program to define the acoustic signatures of American submarines and make them run as silently as possible. He also worked on the detection and surveillance of Soviet submarines and helped develop a long-range sonar.
        He is survived by his wife, Lillian; two sons, Eric, of Washington, and Jeff, of McLean, and a daughter, Lee, also of McLean.
