        George Nikolas Perazich, a retired engineer and industrial economist who directed United Nations' relief efforts in Yugoslavia after World War II, died on Wednesday at the Hospice of Washington. He was 94 and lived in Washington.
        In a career spanning nearly 50 years in this country and abroad, Mr. Perazich served as a consultant on wide variety of subjects, like urban renewal, the applications of nuclear power and the development of ocean resources.
        Mr. Perazich was born in Montenegro and attended the Yugoslav naval academy before coming to the United States in 1927.
        He graduated in engineering from the University of California at Berkeley in 1931 and then worked at Berkeley as an economic research assistant, concentrating on statistics. In 1935 he joined the Works Progress Administration as an economist and engineer, also working for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
        He moved to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in 1944 and until 1947 served as director of industrial rehabilitation in Yugoslavia. He then taught at the University of Chicago and researched industrial uses of energy and the economic viability of atomic power generation.
        In later years he was a consultant for the National Science Foundation, the World Bank and several governments, including those of Algeria, Mexico and New Zealand. Until the late 1970's he was a partner and an associate of an economic consulting firm in Washington.
        Mr. Perazich is survived by his wife of 66 years, Amelia; two sons, John G. and Michael G. both of Washington, and three grandchildren.
