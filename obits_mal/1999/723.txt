        Everett Greenbaum, an award-winning film and television comedy writer for programs like ''Mr. Peepers,'' ''The George Gobel Show,'' ''The Andy Griffith Show'' and ''M*A*S*H,'' died on July 11 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, Calif. He was 79 and lived in Encino, Calif.
        The cause was brain cancer, said Lois Gibson, a friend.
        In 1952, after moving from Buffalo to New York in the early 1950's and writing radio shows, Mr. Greenbaum was teamed with Jim Fritzell by Talent Associates to write ''Mr. Peepers,'' a gently humorous sitcom featuring Wally Cox as a Midwestern science teacher whose efforts to do the right thing often backfired.
        The Greenbaum-Fritzell collaboration, which earned a Peabody Award, four Emmy nominations and three Writers Guild Comedy Awards, lasted until Mr. Fritzell's death in 1979.
        Together Mr. Greenbaum and Mr. Fritzell wrote 150 half-hour episodes, including 32 for ''The Real McCoys''  and 35 for ''M*A*S*H.''
        He is survived by his wife, Deane Ward Greenbaum; a daughter, Billie, of Hollywood, and two sisters, Sylvia Barlow of Buffalo and Doris Holberg of Detroit.
