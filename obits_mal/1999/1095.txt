        Haskel Frankel, a prolific author and theater critic, died last Wednesday in Chester, Conn. He was 73.
        Mr. Frankel, who had suffered several strokes over the last decade, died after a short illness, said his nephew, Seth Wolk.
        A theater buff who pursued acting early in life, Mr. Frankel abandoned the stage for the pen shortly after World War II, during which he had worked on an Army base newspaper. His first job was writing synopses of submissions to the office of Harold Freedman, a New York literary agent, a job that eventually led to Mr. Frankel's writing fiction himself.
        During the 1960's, he wrote what he described as ''trashy paperbacks'' under the pseudonym Frank Haskel, turning out pulpy prose with titles like ''Backstage Doctor.'' He also wrote a series of books for young readers for Doubleday's Signal Books on everything from championship football games to rodeos. He wrote, with Basil Davidson, ''A Guide to African History'' (1965).
        Mr. Frankel worked as a freelance book and theater critic for publications including The New York Times, The Saturday Evening Post, The Saturday Review, Show magazine and Playbill. Between 1974 and 1982, he  served as theater critic for the Westchester and Connecticut Weekly sections of The Times.
        Mr. Frankel also helped write several works credited to prominent performers, including ''Respect for Acting'' (1973) by Uta Hagen.
        He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth E. Frankel of Essex, Conn., and a sister, Fredda Frankel Wolk of Baldwin, N.Y.
