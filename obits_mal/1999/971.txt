        Weldon W. Case, the former chairman and chief executive of the Alltel Corporation, died on Sept. 30 at Boca Raton Community Hospital in Florida. He was 78 and lived in Boca Raton.
        The cause was heart failure, an Alltel spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Case was born in Hudson, Ohio, where his family owned the local telephone company. In 1910, his grandfather, Weldon C. Wood, was among the first telephone company executives to bury phone cables underground rather than hang them on poles.
        Mr. Case joined the company, the Hudson Underground Telephone Company, at 14 as a member of the line crew and worked his way up to general manager and president. Hudson Underground eventually became known as the Western Reserve Telephone Company.
        The days of the independent small- town operator, however, were numbered. In 1960, Mr. Case combined five small Ohio telephone companies into a holding company called Mid-Continent Telephone.
        ''I expect the attrition of smaller companies to continue at an even smarter pace,'' he told the New York Society of Security Analysts in 1963. At that point, Mid-Continent owned nine Ohio companies that served 95,000 homes.
        In 1983, it merged with the Allied Telephone Company of Little Rock, Ark., forming Alltel. Mr. Case was chairman and chief executive until he retired in 1991. At that point, the company had a million customers in 19 states.
        Mr. Case attended Case Institute of Technology and Ohio Wesleyan University.
        He is survived by his wife, Beatrice Kuhn Case; two brothers, Nelson H. Case and Theodore H. Case, both of Carmel, Calif.; two sons, Thomas W. Case of Little Rock and William R. Case of Columbus, Ohio; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
