        Martin J. Norris, a retired Coast Guard administrative law judge who wrote widely cited books on maritime law, died Monday at Sound Shore Hospital in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 91 and lived in Eastchester, N.Y.
        Judge Norris held his post from 1956 until he retired in 1970, said his wife, Helen. He sat mostly in the courthouse in Manhattan and heard cases involving the Coast Guard.
        In 1987, Judge Norris applied his maritime expertise to the issue of salvaging material from the wreck of the Titanic, which had been located two years earlier. The discoverers had proposed that the wreck site remain undisturbed as a memorial. Judge Norris, however, disagreed. ''The president of the French salvaging company recovering artifacts and equipment from the luxury liner Titanic,'' he wrote in a letter published in The New York Times, ''feels aggrieved that there are critics who call the salvors pirates and plunderers. He stands on firm ground.
        ''The modern laws of all maritime countries encourage the activities of salvors who turn what might be a total loss of property into a partial loss, or perhaps complete recovery for the benefit of the owner,'' he wrote. ''While recognizing the sentimental aspect of the Titanic disaster, I submit that the Titanic is commercial maritime property and a proper subject of salvage efforts.''
        His writings include the two-volume work ''The Law of Maritime Personal Injuries'' (West Group) and the three-volume work ''The Law of Seamen'' (West Group).
        A native New Yorker, Judge Norris received his law degree in 1930 from Brooklyn Law School and worked in Government in Washington and New York from 1936 to 1956.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Barbara, of Wyckoff, N.J., three grandchildren and a great-grandson.
