        Chester Herwitz, who with his wife, Davida, amassed one of the world's largest collections of modern art from India, died on June 17 in a three-car collision in Petersham, Mass. Mr. Herwitz, who lived in Worcester, Mass., was 72.
        His wife was injured in the crash.
        Mr. Herwitz, owner of a leather company, first visited India with his wife in 1961, and they returned often.  In the mid-1960's, they began buying paintings by M. F. Husain, who introduced them to other artists. Their varied collection grew to include 3,000 works.
        The Herwitzes also maintained the Chester and Davida Herwitz Charitable Trust to support Indian art in the United States. In 1997, a former President of India, Ramaswamy Venkataraman, presented Mr. Herwitz with an Indo-American Society award.
        Works from the Herwitz collection have been exhibited at the Tate Gallery in London, the Pompidou Center in Paris, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Worcester Art Museum and the Grey Gallery in Manhattan. Two exhibitions from the collection are on view: ''Timeless Visions: Contemporary Art of India,'' at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., and ''Kalighat Painting: Images from a Changing World,'' at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
        Mr. Herwitz is survived by his wife; three sons, Daniel, of South Africa, Thomas, of Silver Spring, Md., and Peter, of New York; a brother, David, of Swampscott, Mass.; two sisters, Phyllis Kline and Eunice Holsberg, both of Washington, and four grandchildren.
