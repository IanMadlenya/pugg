        Sam Leve, a scenic and lighting designer, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 91 and lived in Manhattan.
        His work set the mood for more than 100 Broadway and Metropolitan Opera productions, as well as events for five presidential administrations, beginning with Harry S. Truman's.
        Born in Russia, Mr. Leve moved to New York City with his family in 1920. He began his career with the Mercury Theater, where he designed Orson Welles's 1937 production of ''Julius Caesar.''
        Perhaps his most famous, although unintentional, touch was the lighting he designed for Marilyn Monroe's birthday serenade to Kennedy at Madison Square Garden, which caused her dress to become see-through.
        Mr. Leve and his wife, Shirley Book Leve of Manhattan, had been separated for 42 years. He is survived by a daughter, Teri Leve of Manhattan, and a sister, Lottie Weiss of Monsey, N.Y.
