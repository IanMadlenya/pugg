        Dr. Alfred Hassig, who was convicted last year of letting H.I.V.-infected blood be distributed to hemophiliacs in Switzerland, died here on Sunday. He was 78.
        Dr. Hassig presided over an inglorious chapter in public medicine as director of the Swiss Red Cross blood-transfusion service in Bern. A court here found that starting in 1982, Dr. Hassig knew of the risk that blood products could transmit the virus that causes AIDS, but refused to allow the use of safeguards like heat treatment.
        Eight infected Swiss hemophiliacs who received blood from the Red Cross laboratory sued. Four died before the case went to trial.
        Dr. Hassig, who denied wrongdoing, testified that he had banned the heat treatment because he believed that it made treating hemophilia less efficient.
        In the 1980's, the lab supplied 80 percent of the blood for Swiss hemophiliacs. ''He was so powerful,'' an AIDS specialist at Geneva Cantonal Hospital, Dr. Luc Perrin, said. ''He was really head of a small industry. But he thought more operationally than scientifically.''
        Dr. Hassig, who earned a medical degree in 1945 from the University of Zurich, was given a one-year suspended sentence. The case was on appeal when he died.
        Dr. Hassig, who was in the Swiss Army Medical Corps, was a professor of immunology on the medical faculty of the University of Bern starting in 1966. He was also an adviser on transfusion to the World Health Organization and the League of Red Cross Societies.
        Surviving are two daughters, Marietta Kaser and Leena Ramming of Hinterkappelen, and a son, Hans, of Dielsdorf.
