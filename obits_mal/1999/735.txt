From 1950 to 1969 he was on the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, and was chairman of the department of psychiatry and director of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinics.
        Dr. Brosin served in Europe in World War II as a colonel in the Army Medical Corps, interviewing prisoners and compiling a profile of the typical battlefield deserter.
        He retired from the University of Arizona in 1994.
        Dr. Brosin is survived by a son, Lloyd Wisdom of Tucson; two sisters, Dorothy Brosin and Margaret Bahr, both of Wisconsin, and two granddaughters.
