        Philip Sterling, an actor whose long career embraced theater, films, television and radio, died on Nov. 30 at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 76.
        The cause was complications from myelofibrosis, a bone disease, his publicist said.
        Mr. Sterling made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the Cole Porter musical ''Silk Stockings.'' His most prominent role on Broadway was that of the adulterous father in Neil Simon's 1986 comedy ''Broadway Bound.'' He also appeared in Ron Cowen's ''Summertree'' and in Gore Vidal's ''An Evening With Richard Nixon and . . .'' playing Dwight D. Eisenhower to George S. Irving's Richard Nixon. Off Broadway, he appeared in ''Brecht on Brecht,'' ''In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer,'' ''The Trojan Women'' and ''Victim of Duty.'' His most recent stage appearance was in ''Out of Purgatory'' at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego.
        A serious student of music, he also was narrator of several concert works, including Schoenberg's ''Survivor from Warsaw'' with the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Boulez at Lincoln Center.
        Among his films were ''Backfire,'' ''The Competition,'' ''The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight'' and ''Me, Natalie.''
        Mr. Sterling began working in television in the days of live comedy and drama, appearing on ''Studio One'' and ''Kraft Television Theater.'' He also acted in ''City of Angels'' and ''Sisters'' and had recurring roles on ''L.A. Law'' and ''St. Elsewhere.'' His guest appearances were many and various, from ''NYPD Blue'' to ''M*A*S*H.''
        The son of a Philadelphia lawyer, Mr. Sterling was the first president of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School of Business, he started his career as a jazz pianist before turning to acting.
        He is survived by his wife, Rhona; a daughter, Mila of San Francisco, and a sister, Jane Stern of Holland, Pa.
