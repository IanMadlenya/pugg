        Terence H. Benbow, a lawyer and longtime community leader on Staten Island who was also the dean of the Quinnipiac College Law School, died in his sleep on May 4 at his home in Fairfield, Conn. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Benbow was born on June 4, 1929, in Wyandotte, Mich. He earned a bachelor's degree with honors from the University of Michigan in 1951 and was a Fulbright scholar in Brussels from 1951 to 1953.
        He received his law degree from Yale in 1956. That same year he moved to Staten Island, where he became involved in numerous civic causes, including a fight to save the 3,000-acre Staten Island Greenbelt, one of the nation's largest urban nature preserves.
        He also served as chairman of the New York Landmarks Conservancy and the Citizens Union, a watchdog group that has long monitored city and state policies. In 1984, he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in the Democratic primary.
        Mr. Benbow worked as an associate with Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, an international law firm with offices in New York, Stamford, Conn., and abroad. He later became a partner there. He also served on numerous boards, committees and associations, including the Council on Foreign Relations.
        He left the firm in 1986 to become dean of the University of Bridgeport School of Law. In 1992, when the University of Bridgeport was taken over by the Professors World Peace Academy, an affiliate of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church, he left and established the law school at Quinnipiac, in Hamden, Conn.
        After the move, Mr. Benbow, whose specialties were international law, business organization and antitrust law, remained dean of the law school for a year and then became dean emeritus and a professor.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, Christopher Benbow of Staten Island and Jonathan Benbow of Paris; a daughter, Shawn Elizabeth Benbow of Bridgeport, and a brother, Alan Benbow of Las Vegas, Nev.
