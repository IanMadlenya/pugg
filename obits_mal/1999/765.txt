        August Huber, an investment banker and stock market analyst in the 1960's and 1970's, died on Wednesday. He was 87.
        He died at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., near his home in Scarborough, N.Y.
        Mr. Huber spent his entire career at Spencer Trask & Company, which was founded in 1868. He joined the firm in 1931, became head of the stock department and also ran its foreign department. He became a general partner in 1958.
        In 1970, Mr. Huber became president of the firm, and, in 1971, he was made the chief executive. He retired in 1977, when the firm merged with Hornblower & Weeks-Hemphill Noyes, which was later merged into Loeb Rhodes & Company.
        Mr. Huber was perhaps best known for predicting a 23 percent decline in the stock market in 1966, after a three-year climb in prices.
        He was a governor of the New York Stock Exchange and a vice chairman of the American Stock Exchange and a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts from its beginnings in the 1930's.
        Mr. Huber, who was born on Nov. 19, 1911, in Brooklyn, is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, William A. Huber of Chillicothe, Ohio, and Robert H. Huber of San Diego; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
