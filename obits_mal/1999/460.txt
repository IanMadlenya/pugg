        Paul James Henry, a New York lawyer who served as chairman of the New York Health and Hospitals Corporation during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, died Saturday at his home in Grasmere, N.Y. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.

        A native of Topeka, Kan., Mr. Henry received law degrees from Washburn University in 1952 and Harvard  the following year. He was a trial lawyer for the United States Treasury Department in Boston before moving to New York, where he practiced on Staten Island and became active in the Democratic Party.
        Mr. Henry is survived by his wife of 50 years, Frances Haggiag Henry; a son, Michael J., of Bricktown, N.J.; two daughters, Margaret H. Cozzolino of Staten Island, and Pamela Ann Henry of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; a brother, William F., of Overland Park, Kan.; a sister, Mary Alice Hunt of Lansing, Mich., and two grandsons.
