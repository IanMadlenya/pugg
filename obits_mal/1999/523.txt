        James Broughton, a poet and filmmaker, died on Monday at his home in Port Townsend, Wash. He was 85.
        Long a prominent member of the avant-garde artistic community in San Francisco, Mr. Broughton once described himself as ''an Anglican by birth, a Taoist by nature, a Dionysian in spirit, an Apollonian in practice.'' Over the years he collaborated with many other artists, composers and performers and, starting in 1948, turned out a body of work -- much of it highly experimental -- that included some 20 books and 23 films.
        Born in Modesto, Calif., Mr. Broughton lived in San Francisco until 1989. He attended Stanford University and later taught at San Francisco State University and the San Francisco Art Institute. His books include ''Musical Chairs,'' ''Seeing the Light,'' ''Odes for Odd Occasions,'' ''75 Life Lines'' and ''True and False Unicorn.'' In his review of ''True and False Unicorn'' in The New York Times, the poet Kenneth Rexroth described Mr. Broughton as ''a real master of catchy meters and bubbling, twisted cliches, which, after they have caught, bite.''
        A number of Mr. Broughton's films were shown in programs at the Film Forum and at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York during the 1970's, including ''This Is It,'' ''Dreamwood,'' ''Testament'' and ''Nuptiae.'' He received the American Film Institute's lifetime achievement award in 1989.
        During the 1960's Mr. Broughton was married to Suzanna Hart. He is survived by a son, Orion, of Port Townsend; a daughter, Serena DeCastro of Grand Junction, Colo., and his companion and longtime collaborator, Joel Singer.
