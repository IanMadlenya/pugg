        W. Page Keeton, a leading expert on tort law who as longtime dean at the University of Texas Law School brought the school to national prominence, died on Jan. 10 at his home in Austin. He was 89.
        As dean from 1949 to 1974, he presided over the school's growth in size and stature. After stepping down as dean, he continued to teach his specialty until four years ago.
        He was the principal author of a 1,050-page tome, ''Products Liability and Safety, Cases & Materials,'' and a somewhat slimmer companion text, ''Products Liability and Safety, Cases and Materials: Teacher's Manual'' as well as a case and statutory supplement to them. All three, published as the University Casebook Series by Foundation Press in 1989, 1990 and 1993, remain in print and in use at scores of law schools.
        Because of his expertise in torts, the body of civil law dealing with recovery of damages for wrongful acts, he sat on many Government and professional panels. In 1966 he served President Lyndon B. Johnson as a member of the President's Labor-Management Committee.
        Born in Clarksville in northeast Texas, he worked his way through the University of Texas and then its law school, whose faculty he joined in 1932. He worked for the Federal Government during World War II, then taught at the University of Oklahoma School of Law and returned to the University of Texas to stay in 1949.
        Mr. Keeton is survived by his wife, Madge Stewart Keeton; his daughter, Carole Keeton Rylander, a former Austin Mayor who was sworn in this month as Texas Controller; a son, Richard P., of Houston; a sister, Willie R. Keeton Spencer of Dallas; two brothers, Judge Robert E. Keeton of Boston, and Morris T. of Columbia, Md.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
