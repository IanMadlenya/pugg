        Buzz Miller, a dancer who was equally at home on Broadway and in contemporary ballet and modern dance, died on Feb. 23 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
        The cause was emphysema, said his doctor, Dr. Kenneth Unger.
        Mr. Miller was especially associated with the quirky jazz-based choreography of Jack Cole and Bob Fosse. In the 1954 Broadway musical ''Pajama Game,'' choreographed by Fosse, Mr. Miller, Carol Haney and Peter Gennaro regularly stopped the show with the dance number called ''Steam Heat.'' Mr. Miller also appeared in the 1957 film version of the musical. That year on Broadway, he danced Fosse's ''Pickpocket Tango'' with Gwen Verdon in ''Redhead.''
        Born Vernal Miller in 1923 in Snowflake, Ariz., Mr. Miller first appeared on Broadway in ''Magdalena,'' a Brazilian musical choreographed by Cole. Among the other Broadway shows in which he danced were the 1952 revival of ''Pal Joey,'' ''Two's Company'' (1952), ''Me and Juliet'' (1953), ''Bells Are Ringing'' (1956), ''Hot Spot'' (1963) and ''Funny Girl'' (1964).
        In 1955 and 1956 he was a guest artist with Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris, with leading roles in ''La Chambre,'' a detective-story ballet with a scenario by Simenon. He also appeared in works by the modern-dance choreographer John Butler, including ''Portrait of Billie'' (1961), inspired by the life of Billie Holiday.
        In addition to ''Pajama Game,'' Mr. Miller's films include ''Anything Goes,'' ''On the Riviera'' and ''No Business Like Show Business.''
        He is survived by two brothers, Dean and Roy, and a sister, Flora, all of Snowflake.
