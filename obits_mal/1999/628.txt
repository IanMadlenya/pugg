        David Freeman Hawke, professor emeritus of American history at Lehman College of the City University of New York and author of several widely admired books about people and events in the American Revolution, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Madison, Conn. He was 75.
        The cause was heart disease, said a spokeswoman for Lehman College.
        Dr. Hawke's ''Benjamin Rush: Revolutionary Gadfly,'' a biography of the 18th-century physician, was nominated for a National Book Award in 1972. His other books included ''In the Midst of a Revolution'' (1961), ''Paine'' (1974) and ''Franklin'' (1976).
        Dr. Hawke was born in Philadelphia and held degrees from Swarthmore College, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Pennsylvania. He taught at Pace College for 14 years before joining Lehman College in 1972. He retired in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith, and sister, Jane Hawke Warwick of Manhattan.
