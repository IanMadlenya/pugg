        The Rev. Dr. James William Kennedy, a former rector of the Church of the Ascension in Greenwich Village, died April 21 at a retirement community in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 93.
        He served at the historic Episcopal church on Fifth Avenue and 10th Street from 1955 to 1964. During that time he was president of the Manhattan division of the Protestant Council of Churches and chairman of the Ecumenical Committee that brought the charred cross of Coventry Cathedral to the Protestant Center at the New York World's Fair in 1963-64.
        He was a member of Episcopal Church delegations to assemblies of the World Council of Churches in Amsterdam (1948), Evanston, Ill. (1954), New Delhi (1961), and Uppsala, Sweden (1968). A radio broadcaster for many years, he organized the national radio and television division of the Episcopal Church.
        James Kennedy was born in Denison, Texas, and originally looked toward a career as an electrical engineer. He studied at Texas A & M College, the University of Colorado and Northwestern University before graduating from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in Evanston, Ill., in 1934, and the Graduate School of Theology at Sewanee, Tenn., in 1947.
        Ordained a clergyman in the Episcopal Church in 1932, he was rector of parishes in Texas, Georgia, Virginia and Kentucky before coming to New York City. After leaving the Church of the Ascension, he became director and editor of Forward Movement Publications, a national publishing house of the Episcopal Church. He retired in 1978 but still served for several winters as minister-in-residence at the Captiva Chapel-by-the-Sea on Captiva Island, Fla.
        His many books included ''Anglican Partners'' (1978), ''Perspectives: Sacred and Secular'' (1970), ''Minister's Shop Talk'' (1965), and ''The Unknown Worshiper'' (1964). An earlier one, ''Holy Island,'' was selected as the Episcopal Bishop of New York's book for Lent in 1958.
        Dr. Kennedy is survived by his wife of 63 years, Frances Pleasants Campbell Kennedy; a son, Dr. Stephen C. Kennedy of Vancouver, Wash.; a daughter, Jane P. K. Strand of Benton Harbor, Mich.; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
