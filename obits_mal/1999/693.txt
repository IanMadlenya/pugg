        Thomas Aquinas Harnett, a lawyer specializing in insurance who was Superintendent of the State Insurance Department in the 1970's, died on Wednesday at his home in Ridgefield, Conn. He was 75 and had formerly lived in Manhattan and Suffern, N.Y.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Harnett retired last year from the Manhattan firm of Lane & Mittendorf and became a founding partner of Gallagher, Harnett & Lagalante, also in Manhattan. There he continued to deal with commercial litigation, and with insurance regulations pending before governmental bodies.
        Gov. Hugh L. Carey named him State Superintendent of Insurance, a Cabinet-level position, in June 1975. Mr. Harnett resigned after two years to return to the private sector.
        A native of the Bronx, he graduated from Fordham University School of Education with a teacher's certificate in 1943 and received his law degree from Fordham in 1949. In World War II, he served with the Army Air Force in the Pacific and was awarded the Air Medal.
        He taught product liability law as an adjunct professor at Fordham University School of Law and had been a director of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and a regent of the University of Hartford.
        Mr. Harnett is survived by his wife of 48 years, Doris Van Dien Harnett; two daughters, Doris A. Harnett of Dixmont, Me., and Kathleen H. Linger of Fairfield, Conn.; two sons, Thomas A., of Gardiner, Me., and William A., of Toronto; two brothers, William, of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and John, of Virginia, and four grandchildren.
