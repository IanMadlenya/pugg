        Robert V. Cox, a Chambersburg, Pa., newspaper reporter who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1967 for writing about the hunt for a sniper, died on Monday at a health care center in Chambersburg. He was 72 years old.
        The cause was complications from heart bypass surgery, said Jim Hook, a reporter at The Public Opinion, the newspaper where Mr. Cox worked after graduating from the local high school until 1968.
        Mr. Cox lived in Fayetteville, Pa.
