        Daniel Griffiths, a former dean of the New York University School of Education who changed its approach from anecdotal teaching to the use of modern research methods, died Oct. 2. He was 82 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He suffered a heart attack on the golf course at the Scarsdale Golf Club and was pronounced dead at  White Plains Hospital, said John H. Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U.
        Dr. Griffiths, who presented his  ideas in his book ''Administrative Theory'' (Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1959), drew upon techniques developed in the social sciences, and the innovation was widely copied.
        Born on May 8, 1917, in Bridgeport, Conn., he received a bachelor of education from Central Connecticut State College in 1940. He got a master's degree from the University of New Hampshire in 1949 and a doctorate from Yale in 1952.
        In World War II, he served in the Army Air Force.
        After the war, he taught high school mathematics, then taught at Teachers College of Columbia University. In 1961, he moved to N.Y.U. as associate dean of the School of Education. He became dean in 1965 and retired in 1983.
        Dr. Griffiths is survived by his wife, Priscilla Tomlinson of Scarsdale; a daughter, Priscilla Russel of Princeton, N.J.; a son, Michael Griffiths of Tampa, Fla., and three grandchildren.
