        Ernest Leonard Signorelli, a maverick Republican who served Suffolk County as a judge for 35 years before retiring as its surrogate in 1995, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Center Moriches, N.Y. He was 75 and most recently lived in Manorville, N.Y., and St. Petersburg, Fla.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        He won two terms as surrogate judge but had to battle his own party for nominations to the bench. The post is considered the most politically influential judgeship in the county.
        Born in Brooklyn, Judge Signorelli graduated from New York University and its law school in 1948.
        He began public service in Suffolk in the mid-1950's as an assistant district attorney and was elected to the Court of Special Sessions in 1959 in the Town of Babylon.
        In 1969, then a district court judge, he won the county's first contested Republican primary for county judge, defeating the candidate preferred by the party regulars. The party formally endorsed him for surrogate in 1975 after he warned it of another primary fight.
        Yet his independent stance prompted the Republicans to deny him renomination for a second 10-year term in 1985, and he had to fight for it in the primaries that year.
        He won it and the general election and continued to serve until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70.
        Judge Signorelli is survived by two daughters, Nancy Veni of Sacramento, Calif., and Susan Signorelli of Riverhead, N.Y.; a son, Richard E. of Manhattan and Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; a brother, Joseph, of Manorville; a sister, Elvira Randone of Florida; and three grandchildren.
        His marriages to the former Louise D'Auge of Sacramento and Anita Signorelli of Quogue, N.Y., ended in divorce.
