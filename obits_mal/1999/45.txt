        Gilbert M. Haggerty, a skillful and good-humored aide to six metropolitan editors at The New York Times, died on Sunday at his home in Forked River, N.J. He was 79.
        He had leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Haggerty, known as Gil, was the administrative assistant to the metropolitan editor when he retired in 1984 after more than 40 years with The Times.
        For years, he sat near the metropolitan desk's successive chief editors and their lieutenants, where he stayed calm while simultaneously juggling a variety of tasks, from helping new reporters and relaying editors' messages to the staff to sorting through the daily torrent of incoming letters, news releases and phone calls. His specialty was placating readers with a grievance.
        Mr. Haggerty was born in Manhattan, the son of Michael Haggerty, a New York Times police and court reporter who retired in 1947 after 27 years with the newspaper. Gil Haggerty grew up on Staten Island, where he graduated from St. Peter's School and then from Augustinian Academy. Not long afterward, in 1938, he was hired by The Times, initially as an office boy.
        In World War II, he became an Army sergeant and served in a tank destroyer battalion in Europe from six days after the Allied invasion of northern France began in June 1944 until Germany surrendered in May 1945. He earned five battle stars and returned to The Times.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Adrienne R. Haggerty; two sons, Gilbert J., of Forked River and Joseph M., of Middletown, N.J., who is national expansion marketing manager in The Times's circulation department; two daughters, Judith Anne Glieden of Lanoka Harbor, N.J., and Mary Rose Cummings of Staten Island, and eight grandchildren.
