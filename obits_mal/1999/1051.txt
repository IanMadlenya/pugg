        Robert J. Quinn, the longtime director of NBC's ''Tonight'' show when Johnny Carson was host, died on Thursday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 72.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Quinn, known as Bobby, was the director of the show from 1968 to 1992, when Mr. Carson left the show and he retired.
        In 1993 Mr. Quinn won a Directors Guild of America award for his work on Mr. Carson's second-to-last ''Tonight'' show, with Robin Williams and Bette Midler as guests.
        In 1992 Mr. Quinn was nominated for an Emmy for his directing of ''Tonight,'' ''after doing five shows a week for 25 years,'' as Mr. Carson put it at the time.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Quinn graduated from high school there and served in the Marines during World War II and the Korean War. He joined NBC in the 1940's as a mail clerk in Manhattan and rose through its ranks.
        His marriages to Nancy Kyle and Tangley Lloyd ended in divorce.
        Surviving are his wife of 14 years, the former Charlotte Micheli; three daughters, Patricia Hilton, Kathleen Gorlitz and Demarest Quinn; six sons, Douglas, Kevin, Brian, Colin, Robert Jr. and James; 13 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
