        Lewis L. Salton, who built a business selling what he liked to call ''oddball appliances,'' died on Wednesday after a brief illness, his wife, Edith, said last week. He was 87.
        Mr. Salton was born in Krakow, Poland, in 1911 and received a Master of Science degree in engineering in Brno, Czechoslovakia, before escaping the Holocaust via Siberia and Japan.
        He emigrated to the United States in 1940, where he worked for RCA and Fisher Radio. Then in the early 1950's he founded Salton Inc., a household appliance maker best known for its Salton Hotray, an electric serving tray that kept food hot and became a popular wedding gift. But it was not his only invention. There was also the Salton Peanut Butter Machine, which reduced peanuts to smooth or chunky butter, an ice cream maker and a yogurt machine.
        Inventions that never panned out included an automatic bread maker. ''It became a monster,'' he said in an interview in 1975. ''A Rube Goldberg -- too big, too bulky, too expensive to work.''
        Mr. Salton sold his business in 1976, retired and started a new business in 1985, when he was 72, his wife recalled. The new company, Bendow, was formed to represent Elfo Inc., which sold gold coffee filters. In 1995, Mr. Salton retired again.
        In 1996, he was one of the first to join a class action suit on behalf of Holocaust victims and survivors against three major Swiss banks. Recently, he had been working on completing a memoir of his escape from Nazi-occupied Poland.
        He is survived by his wife of 32 years, Edith; a son, William, of Manhattan, and two daughters, Gillian and Justine, both of Manhattan.
