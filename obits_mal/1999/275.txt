        Dr. Jule Eisenbud, a psychiatrist, author and researcher best known for his interest in parapsychology,  died on March 10 in Denver. He was 90.
        Dr. Eisenbud did research in many areas of psychiatry, psychoanalysis, anthropology and hypnosis during his career, but he came to prominence largely through his book ''The World of Ted Serios'' (William Morrow & Company, 1967).
        In the book, he described his work with Mr. Serios, a Chicago bellhop, who claimed to produce ''thoughtographs,'' dream-like images of his thoughts, on film.
        The work brought Dr. Eisenbud wide public attention and some ridicule. It was criticized in a review in The New York Times by H. J. Eysenck, a professor of psychology at the University of London and the author of a dozen books, including ''Sense and Nonsense in Psychology.'' Professor Eysenck wrote, ''Dr. Eisenbud seems to have little notion of what experiments are and less liking for the rigors and methodological niceties of scientific research.''
        Patrice Keane, executive director of the American Society for Psychical Research in New York, said that Dr. Eisenbud's professional standing helped shield him from the sting of such criticism.
        Jule Eisenbud was born in New York on Nov. 20, 1908. He received bachelor's and medical degrees from Columbia University.
        In 1938, he began private practice in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. In 1950, he moved to Denver with his family, where he continued his practice and became associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Medical School.
        Dr. Eisenbud's wife, Molly, died in 1995. He is survived by two sons, John and Dr. Eric Eisenbud, and a daughter, Joanna Moldow, all of Denver, as well as five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
