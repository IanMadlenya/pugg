        Lionel S. Jackson Sr., the former publisher of The New Haven Register and The New Haven Journal-Courier, died on Wednesday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 84.
        Mr. Jackson, who retired in the 1980's, was a son of John Day Jackson, who bought The Journal-Courier, a morning paper, in 1925 to dovetail with The Register, the afternoon paper he already owned.
        Beginning in the late 1950's, when their father retired, Mr. Jackson and his brother Richard controlled the paper together. But Richard fell ill in the early 1970's, and Mr. Jackson became the sole publisher of the two papers from 1972 to 1982, when his son, Lionel Jackson Jr., succeeded him. Mr. Jackson was the company's chairman and chief executive from 1981 to 1986.
        In May 1986, The Register and The Journal-Courier were bought by the Ingersoll Publications Company for  $185 million. The Journal-Courier closed in 1987 and The Register switched to morning publication. The Register is now owned by The Journal Register Company of Trenton.
        A native of New Haven, Mr. Jackson attended Yale, worked at The Register and served in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank of first lieutenant. After the war, he resumed his newspaper career.
        Mr. Jackson was active in Connecticut nonprofit organizations, including Yale-New Haven Hospital and the New Haven Symphony Orchestra.
        His 1938 marriage to Patricia Woolsey ended in divorce.
        Besides his son, who is traveling in Southeast Asia, he is survived by his wife of a dozen years, the former Patricia Hope Johnstone; two daughters, Suzanne Cartier of Manhattan and Sheila Leach of San Francisco; five grandchildren; two great-grandchildren, and a sister, Katherine Reese of Havre de Grace, Md.
