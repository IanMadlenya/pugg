        Dr. Henry Gerard Schwartz, a neurosurgeon and lecturer who trained a new generation of specialists in his field at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, died there on Dec. 24 at St. Mary's Health Center. He was 89 and lived in suburban St. Louis.
        In recognition of his work, 60 former neurosurgery residents at Washington University contributed $1 million in 1996 to establish a chair in neurological surgery in his name. While chairman of the department from 1946 to 1974, Dr. Schwartz developed a training program that produced many academicians and practitioners who went on to full professorships.
        Dr. Schwartz, a native of Brooklyn, entered Princeton University at 15 and graduated in 1928. He earned his medical degree at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
        He interned in surgery at Johns Hopkins and was an instructor in anatomy at Harvard Medical School until moving to the St. Louis campus in 1936. One of his early contributions was a study on the effect of lumbar puncture, in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal, in reducing the pressure inside the skull in severe head injuries.
        Dr. Schwartz's wife, Dr. Edith Robinson Schwartz, a pediatrician and pediatric psychiatrist, died four years ago. He is survived by three sons, Dr. Henry G. Jr. of St. Louis, Michael R. of Birmingham, Mich., and Dr. Richard H. of Salt Lake City; a sister, Jean Grottano of Queens; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
