        Wilbur Louis Pritchard, a telecommunications engineer who became the founding director of the Communications Satellite Corporation's Comsat research laboratories in 1967, died on March 18 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. Mr. Pritchard, who lived in Bethesda, was 75.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Pritchard was an early champion of satellites as a means of beaming information directly into homes. At his death he headed W. L. Pritchard & Company, a consulting firm in Bethesda that does research on telecommunications for private businesses and governments.
        Born in Manhattan, he earned a degree in electrical engineering from City College in 1943 and did postgraduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1946, he joined the Raytheon Company, where he was part of the laboratory team that created the microwave oven, although most of his later work and his dozen patents dealt with microwaves used to transmit data rather than heat soup. Raytheon sent him to Rome in 1960 to set up an engineering department at a new Italian subsidiary. He also developed radar applications for meteorology there.
        He joined the Aerospace Corporation in 1962 as group director of communications satellite systems, and directed the development of the first operational military satellite system. After his time with the Comsat laboratories from 1967 to 1972, he served as president of the Fairchild Space and Electronics Company and, more recently, of the Direct Broadcast Satellite Corporation.
        Mr. Pritchard is survived by his wife of 50 years, Kathleen Moss Pritchard; a son, Hugh, of College Park, Md.; two daughters, Sarah Pritchard of Northampton, Mass., and Ruth Pritchard of Silver Spring, Md.; a brother, Hubert of Matawan, N.J., and four granddaughters.
