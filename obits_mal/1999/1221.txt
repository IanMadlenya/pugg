        Charles Earland, an organist and saxophonist who was a popular exponent of the soul-jazz idiom in the 1970's, died on Saturday at the Holiday Inn hotel in Kansas City, Mo., the morning after playing a concert. He was 58 and lived in Matteson, Ill.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Sheila.
        Mr. Earland's stock in trade was a driving, percussive style on soul-jazz versions of contemporary rhythm-and-blues and pop tunes; his ''Black Talk,'' released in 1969, became a hit.
        After learning to play saxophone in high school, he played with the Temple University band; shortly afterward, he joined the organist Jimmy McGriff's band as a tenorist. In 1963 he switched to the organ when he was having trouble keeping organists in his own band. He found work with the saxophonist Lou Donaldson and then began to make his own records for the Prestige label.
        He made many records for the Prestige, Muse and High Note labels. At the time of his death he was studying to become a minister at the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. His albums were always popular on jazz radio; his latest, ''Cookin' With the Mighty Burner,'' was released on High Note in July and was in the No. 1 position last month on the Gavin chart for national radio air play.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children: Charles Earland III of Pasadena, Calif., Ahmad, of Lake Peekskill, N.Y., and Melissa Earland, of Philadelphia.
