        Arnolds Sturms, a New York-based composer, flutist and music critic, died on Nov. 7 at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Washington Heights. He was 87.
        He was born in Dobele, Latvia, and graduated with honors from the State Conservatory of Music in Riga. He later played with the Latvian National Opera Orchestra and became the chief of the flute department at the state conservatory.
        In 1949 he moved to the United States. He studied composition for four years at George Peabody College in Nashville with Roy Harris and Philip Slates, moving to New York in 1953. It was not until the late 1950's that Mr. Sturms began his active composing career. His catalog of works include orchestra pieces, chamber music, numerous instrumental sonatas and suites and more than 50 songs.
        His profile as a composer increased through a series of six concerts of his works at Carnegie (later Weill) Recital Hall between 1969 and 1989. Reviewing one of these events in 1989, a program of violin music and songs, Will Crutchfield, a critic for The New York Times, praised the music for its skill and elegance while taking note of the composer's ''backward-looking idiom.'' Mr. Crutchfield wrote that Mr. Sturms ''has that sine qua non, an easy flow of coherent musical ideas.''
        Mr. Sturms also wrote reviews for more than 40 years for Laiks, a Latvian newspaper in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleonora.
