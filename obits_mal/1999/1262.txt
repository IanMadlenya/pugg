        Dr. Edward Hartman Reisner Jr., a cancer specialist known for his work with vitamin B12, died Dec. 16 at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. A longtime resident of Tenafly, N.J., he was 84 and lived in a retirement community in Allendale, N.J.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        In addition to his research and a private practice, Dr. Reisner had a 43-year affiliation with St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, where he kept his laboratory and where he was chairman of the department of oncology. He retired in 1987.
        He published more than 85 papers relating to his research in nutrition and cancer. In the 1950's, he and Dr. Randolf West reported results of a study showing that B12 was the element missing from the blood of patients with pernicious anemia, which is often fatal. Their discovery led to a  treatment.
        A native of Manhattan, Kan., Dr. Reisner was reared in New York City and graduated from Columbia College in 1935 and from Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1939.
        He was a captain in the Army Medical Corps in World War II and earned a Bronze Star for bravery in the Battle of the Bulge.
        He was recognized as a diagnostician and teacher who trained generations of future physicians as an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the College of Physicians and Surgeons and New York University Medical Center. He was a past president of the New York Society for the Study of Blood.
        Dr. Reisner's wife, Marguerite Martin Reisner, died in 1988. He is survived by two daughters, Barbara Reisner of Antwerp, Belgium, and Christine Reisner of Manhattan; two sons, Edward M. of Manhattan and Tom of Brattleboro, Vt.; a brother, Dr. David Reisner of Middlebury, Vt.; and two grandsons.
