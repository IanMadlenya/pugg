        Mark Zebrowski, a historian of Islamic art who specialized in Mogul culture of southern India, died on Aug. 22 in London. He was 54.
        The cause was cancer.
        While in the Peace Corps in India in 1967, Mr. Zebrowski became interested in Deccani metalwork and manuscript painting, which had received little scholarly attention.
        On his return to the United States, he entered the doctoral program in art history at Harvard University. In the 1970's he settled in London, dealing in and collecting art. In 1983 he published ''Deccani Painting,'' based on his dissertation; it remains the standard work on the subject. In 1997 his ''Silver, Gold and Bronze From Mughal India'' appeared. His last book, ''Architecture and Art of the Deccan Sultanates,'' written with George Michell, was published earlier this year.
        Mr. Zebrowski is survived by his companion, Robert Alderman.
