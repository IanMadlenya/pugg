        Sam Renick, one of the country's leading jockeys half a century ago and later a pioneer in racing television and one of the founders of the Jockeys' Guild, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        John Giovanni, executive director of the Jockeys' Guild, said that Renick died from complications of a severe stroke that he suffered last winter.
        Renick became a jockey in the late 1920's when he was 16 years old and rode for some of the sport's leading stables for the next 20 years. He was a contract rider for Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt on the East Coast and for Harry Warner on the West Coast, and he won many of the major stakes races on both coasts.
        He was a close friend of Eddie Arcaro and other top riders, as well as an intimate of many leaders in politics and the sporting life, and a brother of the late Joe Renick, who also rode horses in the middle decades of the century. After he retired, he became one of the first television hosts of a racing program, ''Racing With Renick,'' broadcasting from tracks in New York and Florida.
        Jockeys were free agents in those days with no insurance or medical protection, so Renick and Arcaro joined in recent years with another celebrated rider, Johnny Longden, to form the Jockeys' Guild. The idea, he explained, was to provide some basic protection for jockeys and their families in case of injury or death. The three were later honored by their fellow jockeys for their work in organizing the guild.
        Renick, a frequent figure at New York's tracks until he was stricken last winter, left no immediate survivors. The Jockeys' Guild was making plans for a memorial service at Belmont Park, where he rode many of his winners.
