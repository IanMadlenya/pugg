        Shig Kariya, one of the founders of Mikasa Inc., the big tableware company, died on Friday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 84.
        The cause was pneumonia, his son Scott said.
        Mr. Kariya was born in 1915, when the Japanese Government was busily gearing up for World War I, and Mr. Kariya's father, Risaburo, was building a lucrative business selling American scrap metal to Japan for use in the war effort. Although Mr. Kariya's parents had emigrated to California in 1913, his father's business often took them back to Japan, and Mr. Kariya was born there.
        Although Mr. Kariya had lived in the United States since he was 4 years old, his Japanese ancestry nonetheless caused turmoil in his life. During World War II he and his parents were interned in relocation camps by the United States Government.
        That did not prevent him from tuning in to the American zeitgeist, however. Mr. Kariya, who had graduated from Los Angeles Junior College with a business degree in 1934, recognized that many Americans wanted an affordable alternative to the expensive, formal china dinnerware that was the norm in the 1940's. So after his release from the camp, he teamed up with several other Japanese-Americans to form American Commercial Inc. to import inexpensive, mass-market tableware from Japan. The company soon changed its name to Mikasa Inc., and it remains a thriving china importer and retailer.
        In 1988, the Japanese Government conferred the Emperor's Award on Mr. Kariya for promoting good relations between Japan and the United States. He was a president of the Japanese American Association of New York, where he lived for 40 years. He moved his family to Bethesda, Md., in 1991.
        Mr. Kariya is survived by his wife, Jean; three sons, Scott of New York, Kent of Bethesda, and Steven of Potomac, Md., and two grandchildren, Christine and Michael.
