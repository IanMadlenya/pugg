        Bernard Klatzko, a researcher, author and record producer specializing in acoustic blues and early jazz, died on Nov. 15 at North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y. He was 73.
        The cause was complications following lymphoma, said Barbara Dolan, a friend.
        In the mid-1960's Mr. Klatzko and the author Gayle Wardlow traveled to the Mississippi Delta looking for people who knew blues singers like Charley Patton, Son House and Skip James. His interviews and his 78-r.p.m. recordings of early jazz and country blues became source material for archival reissues from the Origin Jazz Library and Yazoo records. His research was an important part of the rediscovery of such musicians during the folk revival of the 1960's.
        In the early 70's Mr. Klatzko started his own label, Herwin Records, to issue rare jazz and blues recordings from his own collection; he even released a few recordings in the 78-r.p.m. format by Willie Brown and Skip James. Mr. Klatzko also wrote biographical articles on blues and jazz musicians for magazines.
        He is survived by a son, Joseph, of Deer Park, N.Y.; a daughter, Rose Ferris of Canada; and four grandchildren.
