        Robert Myhrum, an Emmy-nominated director who worked in children's television, died last Friday while vacationing on his boat in Boca Grande, Fla. He was 72 and had homes in Manhattan and Peru, Vt.
        The cause was a heart attack, his son Chris said.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Myhrum graduated from Harvard College and received a master's degree in fine arts from Yale University. He began his career in broadcasting as a mail room clerk at CBS, eventually becoming a director. He worked on ''Captain Kangaroo'' and other shows, then turned to freelance directing. His credits included soap operas like ''Secret Storm,'' ''Days of Our Lives'' and ''As the World Turns.''
        He joined ''Sesame Street'' after its first season and stayed with the show for 13 years. He received an Emmy nomination in 1972-73 for his work in children's television programming.
        After retiring from television, Mr. Myhrum worked in the theater in Vermont and Florida. He also served as an adviser on television to the National Endowment for the Arts and was a board member of Vermont Public Radio.
        In addition to his son Chris, of Springfield, Mass., he is survived by his wife, Barbara; another son, Barnaby, of Pittsburgh; two daughters, Phoebe Clark of Westford, Vt., and Polly Adams of New Hamburg, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
