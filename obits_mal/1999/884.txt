        Stanley M. Simmons, a costume designer for ballet and theater, died on Sept. 4 in Los Angeles, where he lived. He was 71.
        The cause was heart failure, said Eddie Michaels, who is married to Mr. Simmons's niece.
        Mr. Simmons was known for dance costumes that quietly evoked the mood of a ballet, whether the airy, pretty and free-flowing bucolic dress in Eliot Feld's ''Meadowlark'' or the somber and plain adapted street clothes in Mr. Feld's ''At Midnight.''
        Mr. Simmons also created costumes for ballets in the late 1960's and 70's, including Mr. Feld's ''Harbinger'' and ''Sephardic Song,'' in productions by American Ballet Theater, Mr. Feld's troupes and the Joffrey Ballet.
        Mr. Simmons designed costumes for John Clifford's ''Kodaly Dances,'' presented by the New York City Ballet, and for Michael Smuin's ''Pulcinella Variations'' and ''Catherine Wheel,'' presented by Ballet Theater.
        He also worked with choreographers like Agnes de Mille, Michael Kidd and Jerome Robbins. He designed the sets for ballet and opera productions at the Vienna State Opera and Spoleto Festival.
        His theater credits included the costumes for the original productions of Tennessee Williams's ''Garden District'' and ''Bar of a Tokyo Hotel'' and for the 1966 revival of ''The King and I'' at the New York State Theater. His Broadway productions included ''Rodgers and Hart'' and ''Lena: The Lady and Her Music.''
        He also designed the costumes for the Emmy Award-winning Shirley MacLaine television special, ''Gypsy in My Soul,'' and for the 1978 and 1980 Coty Award shows.
        Mr. Simmons is survived by a sister, Sally Simmons Culliton of Los Angeles.
