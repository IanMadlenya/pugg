        John K. Tabor, a lawyer who was prominent in Republican Party politics in Pennsylvania in the 1960's and was Under Secretary of Commerce in the Nixon Administration, died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. He was 78 and lived in Washington.
        From 1973, when President Richard M. Nixon named him to the commerce post, to 1975, when he returned to his law practice, Mr. Tabor pursued policies intended to promote American exports and stimulate minority business enterprise.
        He first gained experience in this field in 1963, when Gov. William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania appointed him to lead the state's Commerce Department. A few years later, he defeated a popular incumbent and was elected Secretary of Internal Affairs, the No. 3 office in the state.
        John Kaye Tabor was born in Uniontown, Pa., and reared in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Yale University in 1943 and later served in the Navy in World War II as the captain of a mine sweeper.
        After the war, he received a master's degree in history from Cambridge University in England and a law degree from Harvard in 1950, and then worked for law firms in New York City and Pittsburgh.
        In 1981, after a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, he reduced his law practice and began teaching corporate law at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. He also wrote a privately published biography of his father, Edward O. Tabor, a lawyer active in civic affairs in Pittsburgh.
        Besides his wife, Kate Williams Tabor of Washington, he is survived by two sons, John K. Jr., of Portsmouth, N.H., and William H., of Alexandria, and three grandchildren.
