        Martin Bartner, a former high school sports stringer who became publisher of The Star-Ledger of Newark and helped build the newspaper into the largest in the state, died Sunday at his home in Verona, N.J. He was 69.
        The cause of death was prostate cancer, said Donald E. Newhouse, president of the newspaper.
        During his 46-year career, Mr. Bartner, along with the paper's editor, Mort Pye, who died in 1997, saw The Star-Ledger, once a small, weak, local daily, grow into a successful regional publication with a daily circulation of 406,000 and a Sunday circulation of 606,000, up from 200,000 in the late 1950's.
        Mr. Bartner was born April 11, 1930, in Newark. He started his career at The Star-Ledger as a high school student, phoning in sports scores for 10 cents a printed inch, according to the paper's obituary.
        He attended New York University and returned to the newspaper after graduation. In 1955, after two years in the Army, he moved to business posts at The Jersey Journal in Jersey City. In 1965, he returned to The Star-Ledger as classified manager. In 1972, the newspaper's once-vaunted competitor, The Newark News, went out of business. Mr. Bartner and Mr. Pye expanded and improved the newspaper's business and editorial staffs, helping the paper create a statewide identity.
        Mr. Bartner was The Star-Ledger's director of advertising before becoming associate publisher in 1980 and publisher in 1988. He learned he had cancer two years ago, but remained in his job up to his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a son, Douglas Bartner of Manhattan; a daughter, Lisa Coleman of Madison, N.J., and three grandchildren.
