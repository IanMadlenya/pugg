        DeWitt Samuel Copp, a writer whose work often focused on the cold war, died on Nov. 29 in Burlington, Vt., where he lived. He was 80 and also had a home in Manchester, Vt.
        Mr. Copp wrote more than 30 books, fiction and nonfiction, and many articles about the cold war and espionage, as well as another passion, aviation. A flight instructor and pilot, he served in the Army Air Corps during World War II. Later as the international marketing director of the Weather Engineering Corporation, he helped develop equipment that created artificial rain by using airplanes that dropped silver-iodide crystals into clouds.
        Mr. Copp began writing professionally at 19, when his first radio play was broadcast. After the war he wrote radio and television plays for Kraft Theater, the Bell Telephone Hour and the Hallmark Hall of Fame.
        He published his first book, an aviation thriller, ''Radius of Action,'' in 1960. In 1961 he and Marshall Peck Jr., an editor at The New York Herald Tribune, wrote ''Betrayal at the U.N.,'' an investigation into the death of Paul Bang-Jensen, a former Danish diplomat at the United Nations.
        Hoping to increase United States support for the government in Taiwan, their next collaboration, ''The Odd Day'' (1962), told of the Chinese Communist shelling of the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Other works by Mr. Copp include ''Incident at Boris Gleb''; ''Overview,'' a history of aerial photography; and ''Famous Soviet Spies.''
        Mr. Copp also taught history and civics at St. Luke's School in Wilton, Conn., and worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, Wendy Copp Hodgson of South Burlington, Vt.; a son, Peter Campbell Copp of Manchester; three grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
