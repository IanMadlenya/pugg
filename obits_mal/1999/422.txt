        Chester L. Migden, a labor lawyer whose work for the Screen Actors Guild helped to establish the principle of paying actors for repeat showings of the television programs, feature films and commercials they appear in -- a practice that produces nearly $1 billion today -- died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 78.
        Ken Orsatti, the guild's national executive director, said that the contracts negotiated under Mr. Migden, who served as director from 1952 to 1982, ''improved the lot of actors a dozen times over.''
        As recently as the 1970's, when the weekly minimum for actors was about $1,200, they received little or no compensation for multiple usage of their appearances.
        In contract negotiations, Mr. Migden argued that actors should receive a fair share of the revenue generated not only by free television or first-time theatrical usage but by reruns and supplemental markets like video cassettes and disks, and basic and pay cable television.
        When negotiations failed in the fall of 1980, Mr. Migden led 60,000 actors on a 17-week-long strike, virtually shutting down Hollywood. The dispute came close to being settled after a 21-hour day of bargaining 10 weeks into the strike, but the meeting ended when Mr. Migden said he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an after-shave lotion. Some observers suspected a strategem.
        Born in New York on May 21, 1921, Mr. Migden graduated from Columbia Law School in 1947 and became a staff attorney for the National Labor Relations Board in New York. He soon joined the guild in Los Angeles.
        After retiring in 1982, Mr. Migden became executive director of the Association of Talent Agents, a position he held until his retirement in 1996.
        He is survived by his wife, Dina, and three daughters, Barbara Rosenberg of Los Angeles, Amy Olsson of Seattle and Ann Widdifield of Santa Monica, Calif., and a grandchild.
