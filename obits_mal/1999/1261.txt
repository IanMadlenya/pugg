        Dr. Harold Eugene Berson, a prominent neuropsychiatrist associated with Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn for more than 40 years, died on Dec. 14 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75 and had homes in Stuart, Fla., and Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of lymphoma, his family said.
        Dr. Berson, a Brooklyn native,  graduated from New York University in 1945 and from Chicago Medical School in 1949. He trained in psychiatry and neurology at hospitals in Brooklyn and on Long Island and went into private practice in 1957 in Brooklyn.
        Aside from his long affiliation with Maimonides, over the years he was an attending physician at Interfaith Medical Center, Kings Highway Hospital and Gracie Square Hospital. At Maimonides, he was a member of the department of psychiatry until his retirement in 1991.
        He wrote many articles, and was an assembly delegate and life fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and a past president of the Brooklyn Psychiatric and Neurological Societies.
        Dr. Berson is survived by his wife, Florence Selikowitz Berson; two daughters, Dr. Diane Berson and Denise Tanzman, both of Manhattan; two brothers, Seymour Berson of Hewlett Harbor, N.Y., and Dr. Burton Berson of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.
