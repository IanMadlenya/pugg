        Don (Sugarcane) Harris, a violinist, singer and songwriter who played blues, jazz and rock, was found dead on Dec. 1 in his Los Angeles apartment by his landlord, Agence France-Presse reported. He was 61.
        His longtime collaborator, Dewey Terry, said Mr. Harris had suffered from pulmonary disease for the last few years.
        As Don and Dewey, Mr. Harris and Mr. Terry made a string of brash rhythm-and-blues singles for Specialty Records, featuring Mr. Harris on guitar or electric violin. Mr. Harris went on to join Frank Zappa's group in 1970 and was featured on the albums ''Hot Rats'' and ''Weasels Ripped My Flesh.''
        Mr. Harris was born in Pasadena, Calif., and studied classical violin. He also learned guitar, harmonica and piano.
        His first group, the Squires, recorded for Vita Records. But he made more memorable recordings with Mr. Terry as Don and Dewey, rambunctious rhythm-and-blues songs with titles like ''Jungle Hop'' and ''Koko Joe.''
        They toured the West Coast with the Johnny Otis Revue in the late 1950's, and Mr. Otis nicknamed Mr. Harris ''Sugarcane,'' reportedly for his reputation as a ladies' man. Other performers picked up Don and Dewey's songs, including ''Justine'' (the Righteous Brothers), ''Big Boy Pete'' (the Olympics), ''I'm Leavin' It Up to You'' (Dale and Grace) and ''Farmer John'' (the Premiers and, later, Neil Young).
        The duo dissolved in the early 60's, and Mr. Harris toured with Little Richard. He joined Mr. Zappa in 1970 and then toured and recorded with the English blues bandleader John Mayall. In recent years he reunited with Mr. Terry, performing as Don and Dewey in the United States and Europe.
