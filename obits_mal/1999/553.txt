        John Fullerton Neilson, a vice president of the Microsoft Corporation responsible for an array of electronic commercial properties, died on Saturday at his home in Seattle. He was 37.
        The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, his family said.
        Mr. Neilson joined the company in 1987 after two years with Information Resources in Chicago. He started out as product manager for the Microsoft Flight Simulator program and Microsoft Works. He created the company's certified professional program, which trained thousands of people to use personal computers.
        Mr. Neilson also managed a network of hundreds of computer companies called the Microsoft solution provider program. At his death he was vice president for the Interactive Services Division at company headquarters in Redmond, Wash., where he oversaw Microsoft commerce properties, including Expedia, Sidewalk, Carpoint and Home Advisor.
        Mr. Neilson was born in Manhattan and graduated from Kenyon College. In 1987, he received a master's of business administration from the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. Kellogg honored him last year with its Schaffner Award for distinguished alumni.
        Mr. Neilson is survived by his wife, Emily Ward Neilson; their children, Susan, John and Elliott; his parents, John F., of Chicago and Prudence C. Sellars of Amelia Island, Fla.; his sisters, Nina Cobb of Kentfield, Calif., Mandy Kane of Winnetka, Ill., and Sarah Sperry of Chicago, and a brother, Thomas Sperry of Boston.
