        Dr. John J. Conley, a New York surgeon who made important contributions to the treatment of cancers of the head and neck, died on Sept. 21 in a hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        Dr. Conley, an otolaryngologist, developed operations for improving the speech of patients who had lost their voice boxes to cancer and for reconstruction after the loss of the jawbone to cancer.
        He also developed operations for rehabilitating the larynx and for grafting facial nerves. In addition, he developed the idea of single-stage rehabilitation after extensive head and neck surgery -- that is, one-stage reconstruction by moving both skin and muscle to use in the reconstruction.
        Many of Dr. Conley's innovations came in the 1960's and early 1970's. But as an Army surgeon in World War II, he pioneered methods of reconstructing the cheek and the face.
        In the early 1990's, he founded the John Conley Foundation for Ethics and Philosophy in Medicine.
        Dr. Conley was the first president of the American Society of Head and Neck Surgery and president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology and of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.
        Born in Carnegie, Pa., he received his medical degree in 1937 from the University of Pittsburgh.
        His many professional writings include 13 medical textbooks.
        When Dr. Conley was 80, he stopped performing operations and retired from his longstanding professional ties to Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, all in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Monica;  three children from an earlier marriage, John of Honolulu, Mary Conley Downe of Manhattan and Anna of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.
