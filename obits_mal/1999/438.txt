        Jere W. Lord Jr., a retired cardiovascular surgeon, a professor of clinical surgery and a former president of the New York Heart Association, died on April 20 at his home in Bedford, N.Y. He was 88.
        Dr. Lord retired from surgery in 1983. He was a professor at the New York University School of Medicine and the author of 182 research papers in his field.
        As the president of the Heart Association in the late 1950's, he once performed a heart surgery on a 3-year-old child, Mabel Chin, at University Hospital that was shown on television. His purpose was to raise public awareness of the operation and to allay people's fears about it.
        A native of Baltimore, he graduated from Princeton University in 1932 and from Johns Hopkins University Medical School, where his father was a professor of dermatology, in 1937. He trained at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center before joining the medical staff at N.Y.U.
        He was a former president of the Eastern Surgical Society and a longtime officer in the James IV Association of Surgeons.
        Dr. Lord is survived by his wife, Margot Graham Lord; two daughters, Harrah L. Argentine of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Lonna L. Davis of Wheat Ridge, Colo.; a son, Jere W. 3d, of Frisco, Colo., and six grandchildren.
