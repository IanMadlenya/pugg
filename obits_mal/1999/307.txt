        Dr. Morton S. Bryer, an expert in infectious diseases who helped develop antibiotics like Aureomycin as a young researcher, died on March 20 at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. A former resident of Manhattan, he was 82 and lived in Chatham, Mass.
        Dr. Bryer spent more than 30 years on the faculty of Mount Sinai Medical School and in private practice in New York. He was also a police surgeon for the New York City Police Department.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Johns Hopkins University as a chemistry and biology major in 1938 and from its medical school in 1942. In World War II, he was a captain and battalion surgeon in combat with the Seventh Armored Division in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, receiving a Bronze Star and a Silver Star.
        Back at Johns Hopkins as a Rockefeller Fellow, he and a small team of other researchers worked to develop tetracycline, polymyxin agents and other antibiotics. He joined the staff at Mount Sinai in 1952 and retired in 1988 to Chatham on Cape Cod, where he was involved in conservation causes.
        Dr. Bryer is survived by his wife of 44 years, Rella Strauss Bryer; a daughter, Nicole Saginor, of Cornish, N.H.; a son, Lanning G., of Westport, Conn.; a brother, Stanley, of Queens, and five grandchildren.
