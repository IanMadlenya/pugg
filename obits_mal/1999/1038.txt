        Bernie Privin, a big-band trumpeter who performed and recorded with Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Louis Armstrong and others, died on Oct. 8 in White Plains Hospital in White Plains, N.Y. He was 80 and lived in Hartsdale.
        The cause was colon cancer, said Elwyn Walshe, a friend.
        Mr. Privin bought a trumpet the day after hearing Louis Armstrong at the Apollo Theater when he was 13. He taught himself how to play, and six years later he joined the Tommy Dorsey orchestra, replacing Charlie Spivak. In 1938 he joined the Artie Shaw orchestra at the peak of its popularity and was the soloist on ''Traffic Jam,'' among other compositions. In the early 40's he spent two years working with Benny Goodman.
        He spent his military service as trumpet soloist in Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band, and after being discharged he returned to Goodman's band; late in the 40's he was hired by the CBS Staff Orchestra, a job he kept for 25 years, playing behind such shows as Ed Sullivan's and Jackie Gleason's.
        He is survived by his wife, Ethel; two daughters, Beth Ochs of Riverside, Calif., and Amy Privin Schwartz, of Gilbert, Ariz.; three grandchildren, and nine sisters and brothers.
