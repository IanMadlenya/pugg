        Calvin Dodd MacCracken, an inventor and founder of his own creative engineering firm in Englewood, N.J., died Nov. 10 at Kendall at Hanover, a retirement community in New Hampshire. A former resident of Englewood, he was 79 and lived in Hanover and West Cornwall, Conn.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Mary Burnham MacCracken.
        He founded the company, Jet Heat Inc., now Calmac Inc., just after World War II and served as its president for 50 years. During the war he had worked at General Electric to help reduce the size of a British design for a jet engine, work that earned him the first of his more than 80 patents.
        He was born in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., to Henry Noble MacCracken, the president of Vassar College, and  Marjorie Dodd MacCracken. He graduated in 1940 from Princeton University, earned a degree in mechanical engineering at M.I.T. in 1941 and entered G.E.'s program in creative engineering.
        Jet Heat's first product was a residential forced-air furnace, thousands of which found their way into American homes.
        Altogether, Mr. MacCracken was involved in developing several hundred products, ranging from an electric hot-dog cooker to the temperature distribution system used in the Apollo astronauts' space suits.
        He was the author of ''A Handbook for Inventors'' (Scribner, 1983), a guide for entrepreneurial lone wolves, whom he advised to be ready ''to fail repeatedly, to risk scorn and bankruptcy.'' He explained how to patent, finance, develop, manufacture and market ideas.
        Besides his wife of 30 years, Mary, Mr. MacCracken is survived by two sons and two daughters from an earlier marriage, Michael of Bethesda, Md., Dr. Joan MacCracken Holmberg of Orono, Me., Karen MacCahill of Melbourne, Fla., and Mark of Manhattan; two sisters, Maisry MacCracken and Joy Dawson, both of Poughkeepsie; a brother, James, of Brewster, Mass.; two stepdaughters, Susan Thistle of Evanston, Ill., and Nan Livingston of Cazadero, Calif.; a stepson, Stephen Thistle, also of Cazadero; and 13 grandchildren.
