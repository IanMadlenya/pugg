        Eugene Kalbacher, the publisher and editor of Hot House, a small monthly magazine covering the jazz world, died on May 25 at his home in Rockaway Township, N.J. He was 47.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Lynn.
        As a young jazz journalist in the early 1980's, Mr. Kalbacher decided there was room for a new jazz media outlet when the New York-area radio station WRVR changed its format from all jazz to all country. In 1981 he and another jazz journalist, Jeff Levenson, founded Hot House, a free monthly publication that covered  musicians playing in New York and carried complete listings of jazz performances in clubs and concert halls in the region.
        The magazine, available at jazz clubs and record stores, has been published regularly ever since; now it will be run by Mrs. Kalbacher.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Kalbacher is survived by his mother, Gladys Kalbacher, and two brothers, Bruce and Paul, both of Ghent, N.Y.
