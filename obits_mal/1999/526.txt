        Dan Sanders, a former executive vice president of the New York State United Teachers and a principal architect of the teacher labor movement in the state, died on Thursday at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 69 and had lived in Putnam Valley, N.Y.
        He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Elaine.
        During his tenure, Mr. Sanders directed the New York State United Teachers' legislative program in Albany and Washington. He also served as a vice president of the American Federation of Teachers.
        Mr. Sanders was born in the Bronx. He received a bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1951 and a master's degree from the City University of New York in 1954.
        From 1952 to 1962, he taught social studies in New York City and the Lakeland school district, in Yorktown, N.Y. He was a founder of the Northern Westchester Federation of Teachers, a forerunner of the Lakeland Federation of Teachers.
        In the mid-1960's, as regional director of the Empire State Federation of Teachers, he coordinated the negotiations for the first collective bargaining agreements for teachers in New Rochelle, Mount Vernon and Yonkers. In 1971 and 1972, as executive director of the United Teachers of New York, he was a key figure in negotiations leading to the merger of that organization with the New York State Teachers Association, which produced the New York State United Teachers.
        He was elected executive vice president of the organization in 1978. He retired nine years later.
        Mr. Sanders is survived by his wife; his sons, Robert, of Geneva, and William, of Recife, Brazil; a brother, Sidney, of Great Neck, N.Y., and a sister, Ruth Mellet of San Diego.
