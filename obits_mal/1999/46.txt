        Dr. Manfred L. Karnovsky, a biochemist who cast new light on the way white blood cells fight off bacteria, died on Jan. 7 at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. A resident of Cambridge, he was 80 and had worked at Harvard University for 50 years.
        His research showed how white blood cells use oxygen to strengthen their defenses against bacterial intruders. He was also an expert in the biochemistry of sleep. With Prof. John Pappenheimer, he advanced the biochemical study of sleep-inducing substances in the brain.
        At his death he was the Harold T. White Professor Emeritus of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in the department of biochemistry. Dr. Karnovksy twice served as department chairman, held the endowed White chair from 1965 to 1989 and published his final research paper just last year.
        Two years ago, in donating money to create Manfred Karnovsky Fellowships for graduate students in the division of medical sciences, he said: ''I specifically want to support graduate students because they do the research work. They do the investigations that lead to publications.''
        Manfred Leslie Karnovsky, a native of Johannesburg, graduated from the University of Witwatersrand in 1940 and received a master's degree there in 1942. He obtained a doctorate in organic chemistry in 1947 from the University of Cape Town and joined Harvard the next year. He was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Dr. Karnovsky is survived by his wife, Ann Rosenblum Karnovsky; a son, Daniel P., of Boston; a brother, Prof. Morris Karnovsky of Newton, Mass.; a sister, Helene, of Sydney, Australia, and two grandchildren.
