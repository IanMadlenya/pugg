        Gayle Young, a principal dancer with American Ballet Theater who partnered such leading ballerinas as Margot Fonteyn and Cynthia Gregory, died on Jan. 8 at Cottage Hospital in Woodsville, N.H. He was 63 and lived in Haverhill, N.H.
        The cause was emphysema, said Darryl Dodson, his companion.
        Mr. Young was a tall, lean dancer whose quietly sympathetic manner made him a natural lead dancer and partner in Antony Tudor's ballets.
        He performed many of those roles during his 21-year career with Ballet Theater. He also danced lead roles in ''Giselle,'' ''Swan Lake,'' ''Coppelia'' and ''The Nutcracker,'' and in ballets by Agnes de Mille. The ballerinas Mr. Young partnered also included Sallie Wilson, Marcia Haydee, Lupe Serrano and Lynn Seymour.
        Mr. Young studied dance with Dorothy Prince while a student at the University of California at Berkeley. He joined the Joffrey Ballet in 1958 and performed with the New York City Ballet in 1959.
        Mr. Young taught dance at the State University of New York at Purchase for the last 16 years. He also staged ballets for companies throughout the world, most recently Bronislava Nijinska's production of ''Les Noces'' for the National Ballet of Holland, the Paris Opera Ballet, the Vienna State Opera Ballet and the Berlin Opera Ballet.
        In addition to Mr. Dodson, Mr. Young is survived by a brother, Eugene, of Tenafly, N.J.
