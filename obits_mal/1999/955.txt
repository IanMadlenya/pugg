        J. Howard Edgerton, who decades ago built the California Federal Savings and Loan Association into the nation's largest savings institution, died Oct. 14 at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 91.
        Mr. Edgerton, a lawyer, joined the Railway Mutual Building and Loan Association in 1931. Five years later, he took over the institution, and, in 1937, changed its name to California Federal Savings and Loan. Two years later, he became its president and chief executive.
        California Federal grew to have assets of more than $6 billion in the 1970's from $5 million in 1941.
        By the end of the 1950's, California Federal was the largest savings and loan association in the United States, and its 28-story corporate headquarters on Wilshire Boulevard, which was completed in 1965, was for a time the tallest building in Los Angeles.
        After several mergers in recent years, California Federal Savings and Loan became part of the California Federal Bank in San Francisco, now the second-largest savings bank in the country.
        Mr. Edgerton, who retired in 1980, served as president of the United States Savings and Loan League.
        He was also active in Los Angeles civic affairs, raising funds to help abused children, hospitals, museums, political causes and candidates.
        James Howard Edgerton was born on Feb. 12, 1908, in Sulphur Springs, Ark., and grew up in Prescott, Ariz., and Los Angeles. He earned a bachelor's degree and a law degree from the University of Southern California.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine; a daughter, Beverly Adair of Los Angeles; a son, Russell Howard Edgerton of Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.; 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
