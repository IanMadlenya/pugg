        Howard S. Kessler, a Manhattan veterinarian and former president of the board of the Bide-a-Wee Association, died on Thursday at the Southampton Hospital in Southampton, N.Y. He was 56.
        The cause was cancer, said his mother, Gail Kessler of Atlantic City.
        Dr. Kessler, who lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, was the director of the New York Veterinary Hospital.
        He was born on Jan. 12, 1943, in Milville, N.J., and graduated from Michigan State University and the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.
        In 1973, Dr. Kessler founded the New York Veterinary Hospital in Manhattan, which he directed until his death.
        He was also the co-founder and co-director of the Ansonia Veterinary Center in Manhattan and was active in animal charities. He was a sponsor for the Pet Owners with AIDS/ ARC Resource Service.
        Besides his mother, Dr. Kessler is survived by his brother, Dr. Barry Kessler of Egg Harbor, N.J., and a sister, Lois Kessler, also of Manhattan.
