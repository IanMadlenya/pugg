        Louis Ehrenkrantz, who started as a high school English teacher and became a prominent stockbroker and Wall Street commentator, died on Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, his company said. He was a partner and the president of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum Inc., a brokerage house he founded in 1993 with Joan King and Irwin Nussbaum.
        In nearly 40 years on Wall Street, Mr. Ehrenkrantz was a broker, money manager, executive or partner at nearly a dozen firms. But he was best known for his market commentary, which he offered on television and radio, in articles published in Commentary, Forbes and other magazines, in his own newsletter, the Ehrenkrantz Report, and in a weekly column that appeared in The New York Post in the early 1980's.
        Journalists frequently quoted his explanations of why the stock market had gone up or down on a particular day. Even so, he urged people to hold stocks as long-term investments and avoid speculation.
        Mr. Ehrenkrantz was born on June 17, 1934, in Newark. He graduated from New York University in 1952, earned a master's degree in English from Hunter College and taught at Charles Evans Hughes High School on 18th Street in Manhattan.
        He shifted to Wall Street in the early 1960's, joining Merrill Lynch. In those early years, he also was the host of a program on WNYC, the public radio station, in which he interviewed writers and theater people.
        Mr. Ehrenkrantz is survived by his wife, Eleanor; three sons, Gil of Bethesda, Md., David of Sharon, Mass., and Miles of Scarsdale; a daughter, Pam Ehrenkranz Zur, of Stamford, Conn., and nine grandchildren.
