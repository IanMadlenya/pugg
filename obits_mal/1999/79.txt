        Theodore Tannenwald Jr., a senior judge on the United States Tax Court in Washington, a foreign-aid adviser to three Democratic Presidents and a governor of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Manhattan for the last 40 years, died on Sunday at Georgetown University Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Washington.
        Judge Tannenwald was appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, and his colleagues elected him to a two-year term as chief judge in 1981. He took senior status in 1983 but continued to keep a hefty docket and fill in as chief judge.
        Born in Valatie, N.Y., he graduated summa cum laude in political science and mathematics from Brown University in 1936. He earned his law degree magna cum laude at Harvard Law School in 1939 and joined the firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, based in Manhattan. He remained a partner there until his appointment to the court.
        During World War II he counseled the Lend-Lease Administration and the foreign-funds control division of the State Department. He performed advisory functions in the Truman, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, including membership at the President's Task Force on Foreign Assistance.
        He lectured at George Washington University, the University of Miami Law School and, most recently, the University of San Diego Law School, where he was a distinguished adjunct professor until 1991, and at the School of Law of the University of Minnesota since then. Last year, the American Bar Association honored him with a Distinguished Service Award.
        He served on the national executive board and board of governors of the American Jewish Committee. At Hebrew Union he was a former chairman of the board of governors.
        Judge Tannenwald's survivors include his wife of 58 years, Selma (Pete) Peterfreund Tannenwald; two sons, Peter, of Washington, and Robert, of Newton, Mass.; and three grandsons.
