        David C. Adams, a former chairman of NBC and a member of its board, died Sunday at Cedar Manor Nursing Home in Ossining, N.Y. A resident of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., Mr. Adams was 85.
        Known for his dry wit and lack of pretension, Mr. Adams was regarded as one of television's most popular executives.
        He joined NBC's legal staff in 1947 and retired in 1980, serving under seven company presidents.
        In 1969, he took what he described as ''an open-ended sabbatical,'' a year that he said he hoped would give him time to travel, read, walk, garden, attend concerts, and engage in good talk with friends.
        By that time Mr. Adams, then senior executive vice president, had been responsible for the network's legal department, its Washington office, program standards and practices, research and planning, advertising, publicity and promotion, and relations with affiliated stations. But when the problems of a job become too familiar, he once said, he subscribed to the need for ''repotting.''
        After a year of ''repotting'' in Europe, he returned to NBC as a member of its board and as executive vice president of its corporate staff, dealing in planning and policy matters. Less than two years later he was appointed chairman of the company, and from 1975 until retirement he served as vice chairman.
        Born in Buffalo on March 5, 1913, Mr. Adams received undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Buffalo. In 1941 he joined the legal staff of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, to which he returned in 1945 after service in the United States Army. He went to NBC two years later.
        Mr. Adams is survived by his wife, Ilyana, of Croton-on-Hudson; a step-daughter, Kristina Lanin-Stufano of Hamden, Conn.; a daughter-in-law, Audrey Adams of Scarsdale, two grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.
