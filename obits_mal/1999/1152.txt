        Howard Ferguson, a British musician internationally known for his editions of early keyboard music and of Schubert's complete piano works, died on Nov. 1 at his home in Cambridge, England. He was 91.
        Mr. Ferguson was born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and trained in London, where he studied composition with R. O. Morris at the Royal College of Music and had piano lessons privately with Harold Samuel. He then set out on a career playing chamber music, and it was with a chamber piece, his Octet of 1933, that he made his reputation as a composer.
        His music, expertly craftsmanlike, seemed to distill the English essence of Vaughan Williams and Gerald Finzi into forms and textures more characteristic of the classical masters, especially Brahms and Schubert.
        During World War II he was associated with the pianist Myra Hess in organizing daily recitals at the National Gallery. From 1948 to 1963 he taught composition at the Royal Academy of Music, where his pupils included Richard Rodney Bennett, Susan Bradshaw and Cornelius Cardew.
        Throughout this time he continued to compose actively, his major works including a Piano Sonata (1938-40), a Concerto for Piano and Strings (1950-51) and two large-scale cantatas: ''Amore Langueo'' (1955-56) and ''The Dream of the Rood'' (1958-59). He then decided he had said all he had to say as a composer and stopped. Thereafter, he devoted his efforts to editorial work, producing volumes of preclassical music and of Schubert that have become standard texts the world over.
        In later years his creative achievements fell into neglect, partly because of his retirement, partly because he was out of fashion. His violin sonatas, which had been in Jascha Heifetz's repertory, were unknown to younger musicians. But he lived long enough to witness a revival of interest in his work in the 1980's and to see almost his entire output recorded.
