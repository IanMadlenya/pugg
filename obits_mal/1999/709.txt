        Burton Spencer Dreben, a former Harvard dean who brokered some of the most difficult negotiations between the Harvard administration and leaders of the student uprisings there in the late 1960's, died of lymphoma on Sunday at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 71 and lived in Brookline, Mass.
        A professor of philosophy at Harvard when both faculty and students were debating fiercely contentious issues like the Vietnam War, links with the Federal Government and the military, and the student strike of spring 1969, Mr. Dreben, in his capacity as parliamentarian of the faculty, preserved order at faculty meetings by insisting on fair and open procedures.
        From 1973 through 1975, he was dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. One of his policies was cutting graduate school admissions by 25 percent on the principle that only as many students as the school could afford to aid and teach properly should be admitted.
        From 1976 to 1990, he was chairman of the Society of Fellows, overseeing the selection of candidates for Harvard's most prestigious postdoctoral fellowships.
        Trained as a mathematical logician, he focused on the historical study of 20th-century philosophy. He was known for his witty lectures at Harvard and, later, Boston University, where he taught from 1991 to his death.
        Mr. Dreben, born in Boston in 1927,  graduated from Boston Latin School in 1945. He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1949 and a master's from there in 1955.
        He taught at the University of Chicago from 1955 to 1956 and at Harvard from 1956 to 1990.
        Mr. Dreben's first marriage, to Raya Spiegel, ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Juliet Floyd of Brookline; a brother, Arthur, of Marblehead, Mass.; two children from his first marriage, Jon, of Cambridge, Mass., and Elizabeth, of University Heights, Ohio, and two grandsons.
