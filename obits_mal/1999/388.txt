        Robert James Johnston, a naval engineer who became an innovative designer of hydrofoils and other high-speed watercraft, died on April 16 at his home in Daytona Beach, Fla. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Johnston focused on improving hydrofoils, which skim over the water on winglike structures attached to the hull, enabling the craft to go faster than conventional boats and ships. In 1993 the International Hydrofoil Society singled out his lifetime contributions as a ''significant force in the design, development and application of hydrofoils.''
        He graduated from Purdue University in 1940 and received advanced degrees in naval architecture and marine engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1947. His work in the Office of Naval Research in and after World War II led to the construction of the Navy's first hydrofoil missile ships.
        After leaving the Navy with the rank of captain in the mid-1950's, he held executive positions in industry and directed hydrofoil projects for the Grumman Corporation. He returned to the Navy in 1973 as the civilian manager of its Advanced Hydrofoil Program, which built and deployed hydrofoil gunships.
        He is survived by his wife, Marcia McColly Johnston; her daughters, Cynthia Redick of Washington and Alicia Stickel of Toronto; his son, David, also of Washington, and seven grandchildren. His first wife, Dixie Girard Johnston, died in 1976.
