        Donald Stewart, a screenwriter who won an Academy Award for ''Missing,'' the 1982 Constantin Costa-Gavras film, died on April 28 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 69.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Joan.
        Mr. Stewart and Mr. Costa-Gavras were co-writers of the screenplay for ''Missing,'' which starred Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek in a retelling of the 1973 kidnapping and murder in Chile of Charles Horman, a young counterculture journalist. The men shared the 1982 Academy Award for best screenplay based on material from another medium.
        Mr. Stewart was born in Detroit and was a lifelong car buff.
        While still in his 20's he founded and co-published Competition, a car-racing weekly, and was briefly the editor of Motor Life magazine. He eventually moved to New York, where he wrote advertising copy about cars before becoming creative director of the Fletcher-Richards Agency.
        In his mid-40's he went to Hollywood to try screenwriting. His first effort was ''Jackson County Jail,'' the 1976 Roger Corman road movie.
        Mr. Stewart was a writer of the screenplays for the Tom Clancy trilogy ''Hunt for Red October,'' ''Patriot Games'' and ''Clear and Present Danger.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Scott, of Grosse Isle, Mich., and Peter, of Jacksonville, Fla.; a daughter, Sarah Casselman of Pinckney, Mich., and four grandchildren.
