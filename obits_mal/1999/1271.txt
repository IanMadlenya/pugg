        Tommy Atkins, who made a dramatic escape from Poland during the cold war and later became a college librarian in New York, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Boca Raton, Fla., where he had a winter residence. He was 75 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of kidney failure caused by a blood disease, said his wife, Janina.
        Mr. Atkins, a Pole, became an interpreter and assistant to New York Times correspondents in Poland during the 1950's and 60's, among them Sydney Gruson and A. M. Rosenthal.
        In those years, Mr. Atkins was arrested three times and spent two and a half years in detention in or near Warsaw, Mrs. Atkins said. ''He was jailed for refusing to be an informer for the secret police,'' she added. She said the police had been seeking information about Mr. Gruson and Mr. Rosenthal.
        In 1963 Mr. Atkins escaped from Poland, with assistance of The Times's staff. A departing official of the United States Embassy smuggled him out hidden by boxes in a station wagon, Mrs. Atkins recalled.
        Mr. Atkins arrived in Vienna and moved on in 1964 to the United States where he became a clerk at the New York Public Library, won a scholarship to Columbia, earned a master's degree in library science and then a Ph.D. in political science from the New School for Social Research. He eventually became a professor of library and information science systems at Baruch College and director of its Graduate Business Resource Center, an electronic information system that he created. In 1991, he moved to Hunter College as its chief librarian.
        Mr. Atkins discarded his original Polish name and took the Kiplingesque name Thomas V. Atkins while he was in the British Army in World War II.
