        Dr. Paul R. Esserman, an internist who juggled the multiple lives of teacher, corporate physician, private practitioner and occasional medical diplomat, died Saturday at New York University Medical Center. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Esserman, a Brooklyn native who entered New York University at 16 and received his medical degree there at 22, taught for half a century at the New York University School of Medicine while maintaining a private practice that he continued after his academic retirement. He also found time for a number of medical sidelines.
        While serving as staff physician at The New York Times in the early 1970's, Dr. Esserman, a man who knew how to get the most out of his summer vacations, visited Africa and set up a medical exchange program between Ethiopia and N.Y.U. In 1975, after two years as physician to the Chinese Mission to the United Nations, he was invited to China and set up a similar exchange program.
        Dr. Esserman, whose wife, June, died in 1982, is survived by his companion, Dr. Irene Shapiro; a son, Dean, of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter, Lauren, of Portland, Ore.; two brothers, Howard, of Florida, and Jay, of Maryland, and three grandchildren.
