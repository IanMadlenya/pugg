        Ernest Schier, director of the National Critics Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Schier was well equipped for his position at the Critics Institute, having been drama critic of The Philadelphia Bulletin from 1958 to 1982. Starting in the early 1940's, he covered theater and film for several other newspapers, including The Times-Herald in Washington from 1946 to 1954 and The Philadelphia Daily News from 1956 to 1958. He was a founder and first chairman of the American Theater Critics Association.
        He was also the director of the International Young Playwrights Project at the O'Neill center and served as dramaturge for the National Playwrights Conference at the center from 1983 to 1989. He was a consultant for the American College Theater Festival in Washington (1978-89) and the Opera and Music Theater Conference at the O'Neill center (1980-89).
        He was an adjunct professor in playwriting and performance criticism at Villanova University and starting in 1985 he also taught play writing and production at the O'Neill center.
        He is survived by two daughters, Johanna Hall of Saugerties, N.Y., and Jennifer Cole of Langhorne, Pa.; two sons, Harry, of Rapid City, S.D., and William, of Levittown, Pa., and three grandchildren.
