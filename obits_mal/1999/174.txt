        Anthony Francis Shannon, a former reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner, died Tuesday at his home in Warren Township, N.J. He was 69.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Catherine.
        Mr. Shannon and two colleagues at The New York World-Telegram and The Sun, Sylvan Fox and William Longgood, shared a 1963 Pulitzer Prize for their deadline reporting about a plane crash at Idlewild Airport on March 1, 1962. The Pulitzer was awarded for five news articles, including one drawn from eyewitness accounts of the crash in Jamaica Bay, which killed more than 100 people. Idlewild is the former name of Kennedy International Airport.
        Mr. Shannon became assistant city editor at The World-Telegram in 1964. When the newspaper closed two years later, he worked as a spokesman for the New York Health and Hospitals Corporation and Consolidated Edison before joining The  Star-Ledger of Newark in 1980. He retired in 1994.
        Mr. Shannon graduated from the University of Maine in 1950 with a degree in journalism. Before he joined The World-Telegram in 1955, Mr. Shannon worked at small papers in Maine and Rhode Island. He served in the Army during the Korean War.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Shannon is survived by a son, Gregory, of Sea Girt, N.J., and two daughters, Toni-Marie and Maxine, of Warren Township.
