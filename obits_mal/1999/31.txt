        James Holmes, an organist and choir director long associated with the Episcopal Church of St. Matthew and St. Timothy on West 84th Street in Manhattan, and a sometime composer of considerable skill, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59.
        The cause was cancer, which he had had for several years, said his longtime companion, the composer Ned Rorem.
        Mr. Holmes was born on April 2, 1939, in Pittsburg, Kan., and brought up in a musical environment. As a boy he studied violin and piano and later continued his studies at the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill.
        In 1967 he moved to New York City. Late that year he met Mr. Rorem and the next year they moved to the Upper West Side of Manhattan.  Inevitably, he lived in the shadow of his older (by 16 years) and celebrated partner. But he won admiration in his own right for his professional services and achievements.
        His first major post as an organist and choir director was at the Chapel (now Church) of the Intercession in Washington Heights. There, in 1972, he presented a well-received series of organ recitals, each devoted to a modern composer, including Messiaen, Poulenc, Satie and Virgil Thomson.
        In 1973 he became the organist and choir director at the Church of St. Matthew and St. Timothy, where until his illness intervened he never missed a Sunday or feast day service. It was his custom to feature a 20th-century work in his musical selections. His own ''Stabat Mater,'' an unaccompanied choral work of austere beauty, is published by Boosey & Hawkes. In September the church unveiled a plaque honoring him with  ''thanksgiving for 25 years of devoted service.''
        In addition to Mr. Rorem, he is survived by his mother, Lora Eastwood Holmes of Corvallis, Ore., two brothers and two sisters.
