        John Edwin Adams, a California neurosurgeon and pioneer in the use of radioisotopes to study brain functions and disorders, died on May 18 at the medical center of the University of California at San Francisco. He was 85.
        Dr. Adams was the former Guggenheim Professor of Neurological Surgery at the university. He gained an international reputation as an expert on Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy and epilepsy.
        He assembled an interdisciplinary team at the medical center to treat such diseases, as well as intractable pain, with stereotactic surgery, which focuses on specific groups of cells in deep-seated brain structures that control specific functions.
        Dr. Adams, a descendant of the Presidential Adams family, was born in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California there in 1935. He received a master's degree at Harvard University in 1939 and was training at Brigham and Children's Hospital in Boston when war broke out.
        He was a battalion surgeon with the Marines in the Pacific. He was at Guadalcanal and aboard the first American ship to enter Tokyo Harbor after the Japanese surrender.
        He resumed his training at the University of California at San Francisco, joined the staff of the department of neurological surgery in 1948 and rose to chairman in 1970. He retired from teaching in 1984 but remained active as a researcher.
        His wife, Sally Patterson Adams, died in 1995 after 60 years of marriage. He is survived by two daughters, Abigail A. Campbell of Woodside, Calif., and Susan A. Engs of Reno; a son, Henry P., of Camarillo, Calif.; a sister, Cornelia A. Lonnberg of Noce, France; 8 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
