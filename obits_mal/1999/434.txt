        Joao Carlos de Oliveira, a Brazilian sports hero who held the world triple jump record for a decade, died Saturday at Beneficencia Portuguesa Hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was 45.
        De Oliveira, who lived in Pindamonhangaba, in Sao Paulo state, was suffering from pneumonia, hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver that caused internal bleeding, the hospital said.
        De Oliveira won the triple jump at the Pan American Games in Mexico City in 1975 with a distance of 58 feet 8 1/4 inches, beating the previous world record of 57-2 1/2. The record was set at an altitude of 7,550 feet, with reduced air resistance.
        The record stood until Willie Banks of the United States leaped 58-11 1/2 in Indianapolis on June 16, 1985. Banks's mark, at an altitude of 700 feet, also stood for 10 years. It was broken by Jonathan Edwards of Britain, who jumped 59 feet in July 1995 in Salamanca, Spain, and who set the current record of 60-0 1/4 in August 1995 at Goteborg, Sweden..
        De Oliveira won bronze medals at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal and the 1980 Games in Moscow and captured gold at the World Cup in 1981.
        His athletic career came to an end in December 1981, when his right leg was amputated below the knee after his car was hit head-on by a drunken driver being chased by the police going the wrong way at night on a highway in Campinas, Brazil.
        De Oliveira was twice elected a state deputy in 1986 and 1990 but confronted financial problems afterward when business ventures foundered. Unemployed since he left public office, de Oliveira had been living on a monthly pension of about $700, according to local news reports.
        Last year, de Oliveira announced that he would train for the long jump at the Paralympic Games for disabled athletes in Sydney, Australia, in 2000, when he would be aided by an artificial leg. But he abandoned training earlier this year amid illness and depression, friends said. The weekly magazine Epoca said he had been plagued by heavy drinking, which his family denied.
        De Oliveira's body was taken yesterday to Sao Paulo's State Assembly, where he once served.
