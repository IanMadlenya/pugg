        Franklin Keysar, a production stage manager for more than 20 Broadway shows, died on Jan. 25 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was liver cancer, his publicist said.
        Mr. Keysar, who was born in Warren, N.H., graduated from the Boston University School of Fine and Applied Arts. He was stage manager at the Manhattan Theater Club for the Stephen Sondheim revue ''Putting It Together,'' with Julie Andrews, and for Woody Allen's ''Floating Light Bulb'' at Lincoln Center Theater. He also worked at the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.
        Alfred Uhry's ''Last Night of Ballyhoo,'' which won a Tony Award in 1997, was Mr. Keysar's 24th Broadway show as a production stage manager.
        He is survived by his mother, Bertha, of Warren; three sisters, Phyllis Colby-Mudgett and Patti Bartlett, both of Bristol, N.H., and Virginia Keysar of Piermont, N.H.; and three brothers, Philip, of Yarmouthport, Mass., Donald, of Warren, and Gary, of Elizabethton, Tenn.
