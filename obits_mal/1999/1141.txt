        Elliott M. Sanger Jr., a news producer for WQXR, the radio station owned by The New York Times, and a corporate relations executive for The New York Times Company, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said his wife, Joan Sanger.
        In a career that spanned four decades at The Times, Mr. Sanger held a variety of positions at the newspaper and at WQXR, which his father, Elliott M. Sanger Sr., helped begin in 1936. It was bought by The Times eight years later. When The Times was closed by a 114-day strike that began in late 1962, Mr. Sanger directed a project to put nonstriking correspondents on the air. The project won a George Foster Peabody Award, and it proved so popular that it continued after the newspaper resumed publishing. For the next seven years, Mr. Sanger headed a staff of news writers in the Times newsroom who worked with reporters and editors for assignments on the air.
        In 1970, Mr. Sanger became the executive producer of ''Insight,'' a nightly program of news analysis moderated by Clifton Daniel, a former managing editor of The Times, who interviewed correspondents about the top stories of the day.
        In 1973, Mr. Sanger joined the corporate relations department of the Times Company and became manager of corporate relations in 1980. He retired in 1987 but continued working for The New York Times Company Foundation.
        Elliott Maxwell Sanger Jr. was born in Manhattan and graduated from Columbia College in 1943. He served in the Army, landing in Normandy a few days after D-Day.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Sanger is survived by his mother, Eleanor N. Sanger of Manhattan; a brother, Kenneth E. Sanger of White Plains; his daughter, Elizabeth Sanger of Larchmont; and two grandsons.
