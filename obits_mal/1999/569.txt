        Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye, a member of the International Olympic Committee from the Ivory Coast in West Africa, who was censured for inappropriate behavior during the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, died Friday. He was 76.
        Mr. Guirandou-N'Diaye, who had suffered from intestinal problems, died after a reaction to something he ate, according to an I.O.C. spokesman.
        A member of the Olympic committee since 1969, Mr. Guirandou-N'Diaye served as its second-ranking member, or first vice president, from 1980 to 1984.
        Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had just assumed presidency of the organization, relied on Mr. Guirandou-N'Diaye and others to help restore African participation in the Summer Games, after a boycott of the 1976 Montreal Olympics over the issue of apartheid.
        Mr. Guirandou-N'Diaye also served as president of the Ivory Coast Olympic Committee for 31 years and as an ambassador. He was  an influential figure in international judo.
        Ten I.O.C. delegates were expelled or resigned during the bribery scandal linked to Salt Lake City's bid to acquire the 2002 Winter Games. Mr. Guirandou-N'Diaye received a warning for accepting gifts over the allowable limit and for allowing Salt Lake City officials to pay for his wife's flight to Budapest in June 1995 for the vote to award the 2002 Winter Games.
