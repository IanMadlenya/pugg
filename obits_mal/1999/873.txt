        Jan Gorbaty, a stylish, white-maned Polish pianist with a patriot's zeal for the music of Chopin who founded the New York chapter of the National Chopin Foundation, died on Monday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 84.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Susan.
        Mr. Gorbaty was born in Wolochisk, Russia, in 1915, the son of a wealthy supplier of horses and feed to the Czar's troops. But with the revolution the family fled to Lvov, Poland, where Mr. Gorbaty gave his first public performance at the age of 4.
        After graduating from the conservatory there, Mr. Gorbaty became a prominent young teacher and one of the leading pianists in Poland before World War II, which he survived  under false identity papers. In 1945 he moved with his wife, Judith Weiss, a classicist, to Vienna, where he resumed his career and also studied with Paul Weingarten, a pupil of Emil von Sauer, who in turn was a student of Liszt.
        Mr. Gorbaty emigrated to the United States in 1950, making his debut at Town Hall shortly afterward. Besides the standard repertory he played music by living Americans and lesser-known Chopin acolytes like Julius Fontana, a friend and pupil of Chopin's. But he was best known for his Chopin recordings and performances.
        He taught at Rutgers University, New York University and at the City University of New York, and he lectured frequently, particularly on the Chopin mazurkas. In 1983 he founded the New York chapter of the National Chopin Foundation, and in 1995 he received from President Lech Walesa a Cross of Merit of the Republic of Poland for furthering the understanding of Chopin's music.
        Mr. Gorbaty's wife of 59 years died in March. He is survived by his daughter, of Forest Hills.
