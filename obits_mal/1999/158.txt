        Harold A. Felix, a New York City Labor Commissioner under Mayor Robert F. Wagner, died on Jan. 20 at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 93.
        He was Commissioner from 1957 to 1962. Mr. Felix and Mayor Wagner had been close friends since both were young political workers in the Democratic wards of the Yorkville section of Manhattan.
        Mr. Felix was especially proud that in 1958, while he was Commissioner, the city enacted its so-called Little Wagner Act, which gave collective-bargaining rights to city employees. The act had been drafted by Ida Klaus, counsel to the city's Labor Department.
        Mr. Felix was best known for mediating strikes, but the major work of the Labor Department in his day was to set job and salary standards for city employees and to compile statistics on wages and working conditions.
        Mr. Felix was born in Yorkville, the son of a prosperous interior decorator. He graduated in 1927 from Harvard College and in 1930 from Columbia Law School. From 1931 until World War II he practiced general law in New York. In the war he was an Army artillery instructor. Afterward he specialized in labor law, representing both unions and management.
        He was first deputy commissioner for two years before becoming Commissioner. After he stepped down as Commissioner in 1962, Mayor Wagner appointed him a Family Court judge, and he spent more than a decade on the bench.
