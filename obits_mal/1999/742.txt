        Peter A. Bordes, the co-founder, chairman and chief executive of Greater Media Inc., a broadcasting and publishing company based in East Brunswick, N.J., died on July 19 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his administrative assistant, Emily Szestakowski.
        Mr. Bordes and a college friend, Joseph Rosenmiller, started Greater Media in 1956 when they bought a small radio station in Southbridge, Mass.
        The privately held company now owns 14 radio stations in the Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit and New Brunswick, N.J., areas, as well as six community newspapers in central New Jersey and a satellite transmission operation in Detroit. Mr. Bordes acquired Mr. Rosenmiller's interest in General Media in 1994.
        Mr. Bordes, who also lived on Nantucket Island, Mass., and in Annapolis, Md., was born on Aug. 28, 1927, in Bridgeport, Conn. He graduated from Yale University in 1949, attended graduate school at Columbia University and served in the Coast Guard as a lieutenant.
        He was also a four-time national champion of the Thistle class of sailboats and a member of the New York Yacht Club.
        Mr. Bordes is survived by his wife, Lee; two sons, Peter Bordes Jr. and Stephen Bordes, both of Manhattan, and two daughters, Cristina Bordes of Boulder, Colo., and Stephanie Bordes of Longmont, Colo.
