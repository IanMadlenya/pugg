        Lorimer A. Davidson, a former chief executive of the Government Employees Insurance Company, who helped prove that automobile insurance could be sold without an agent, died on Nov. 27 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He lived in Rockville, Md., and was 97.
        Mr. Davidson created the partnership that bought Geico in 1948 and became the company's senior investment officer. After being named chief executive in 1958, he helped expand Geico's customers to include drivers who did not work for the government. By the time he retired as chairman in 1970, premiums had increased to more than $250 million a year from $40 million.
        Mr. Davidson, who brought in new management in the mid-1970's to turn the company around, left the board in 1978. Geico is now owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
        Born in Granby, Quebec, he came to the United States in 1924, working as a Wall Street trader and bond salesman until 1940. There, he met Leo Goodwin, Geico's founder, with whom he would work to develop Geico's strategy of selling insurance directly to the policyholder.
