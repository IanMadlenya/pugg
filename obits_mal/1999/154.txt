        Joe M. Kilgore, a Texas Democrat who was a Congressman from 1955 to 1965 and advised Lyndon B. Johnson, died on Wednesday. He was 80 and a longtime resident of Austin.
        Where he died was not disclosed.
        In later life he was a partner in the Austin law firm of McGinnis, Lochridge & Kilgore.
        He was born in Brown County in Central Texas and grew up in the Rio Grande Valley.
        He attended the University of Texas from 1936 to 1941, a period when he was a campaign worker for Johnson, who was elected to the House of Representatives in 1937.
        ''Joe, as a young man, worked on Lyndon's staff, and his counsel and friendship continued to be valued through the years,'' said Lady Bird Johnson, the former First Lady.
        He served in the Army Air Force  in World War II, becoming a lieutenant colonel. He flew many missions on B-24 bombers in the Mediterranean Theater and won the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross and other medals. He became a major general in the Air Force Reserve.
        From 1946 to 1954, he practiced law in the Rio Grande Valley, and was a state representative.
        On Capitol Hill, he was notably outspoken in 1961 about the Kennedy Administration's proposed $207 million fallout shelter program.
        He warned against repetition of efforts to rouse the nation about civil defense unless the Federal Government was prepared to follow through with a large-scale effort.
        In 1964, he said he would not run for re-election to the House, and it seemed he would enter the Democratic Senate primary against the incumbent, Ralph Yarborough. But then Mr. Kilgore said he would not run.
        Later Mr. Kilgore said Johnson, who did not want to antagonize Senator Yarborough's supporters, had used his influence to keep him from running.
        Mr. Kilgore is survived by his wife, Jane; three sons, Mark and Dean, both of Austin, and William, of Houston, and a daughter, Shannon Kilgore of Austin.
