        Charles F. McErlean, a former vice chairman of United Airlines and president of UAL Inc., its parent, died May 21 at his home in Oak Brook, Ill. He was 87.
        Mr. McErlean was serving on the legal staff of the National Labor Relations Board in 1945 when he was hired by William A. Patterson, United's founder, to help improve the airline's employee relations. He went on to establish the airline's legal department and took on increasing responsibility, rising to become United's No. 2 executive in 1965.
        He was known as an able administrator who led a reorganization of United in 1975. But it was as a labor negotiator and spokesman for United that he made his mark.
        When a strike by machinists threatened United in the early 1970's, Mr. McErlean acted quickly to negotiate a settlement. ''It was kind of going nowhere after a few days,'' recalled James J. Hartigan, who served as United's president and chief executive in the 1980's, ''then he went down and got it solved.''
        Mr. McErlean was also United's principal defender after one of its DC-8's collided with a Trans World Airlines Super Constellation over Brooklyn in 1960, killing 128 passengers on the two airplanes and six people on the ground. At the time, it was the worst aviation accident in history.
        Mr. McErlean grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended Georgetown University, where he studied law. After practicing in Chicago in the late 1930's, he joined the N.L.R.B., working in Detroit, Chicago and, finally, Washington.
        In 1937, Mr. McErlean married the former Theodora E. Emerson. She died last year.
        He is survived by their three children: Charles F. McErlean Jr., of Hoffman Estates, Ill., an assistant general counsel at the UAL Corporation, United's current parent company; Robert E. McErlean of Green Valley, Ariz., and Mollie McErlean of Oak Brook, Ill; five grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
