        Alvin John Rockwell, a prominent San Francisco lawyer who as a Government attorney helped to draft the legal system for a democratic postwar Germany, died yesterday in San Francisco, where he lived. He was 90.
        In 1945 he was posted to Berlin as legal adviser to Gen. Lucius D. Clay and director of the legal division of the Military Government in the American-occupied parts of western Germany and Berlin, where he helped rebuild the legal system as one rooted in both the traditional German code law and democratic principles.
        Working with his French and British counterparts, he helped shape what is now the legal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany. He also reached the German public directly in speeches and on the radio to discuss the distinctions between democratic and totalitarian systems.
        Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., he graduated from DePauw University in 1929 and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He studied for a year at the London School of Economics and received a law degree at Harvard Law School in 1933.
        He briefly practiced in Boston before moving to Washington to serve as a labor lawyer. He worked in the Solicitor General's Office as special counsel to the Attorney General and as a trial examiner and general counsel to the National Labor Relations Board, for which he successfully argued cases before the Supreme Court.
        He moved to San Francisco in 1948 to become a partner in the firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. He specialized in litigation and headed its executive committee in the 1970's; he had been of counsel to the firm since 1979.
        He was a lifetime trustee of DePauw and a past trustee of the San Francisco Law Library.
        Mr. Rockwell's wife, Anna Hayward Rockwell, died in 1983 after 50 years of marriage. He is survived by a son, John S., of Manhattan, editor of the Arts & Leisure section of The New York Times; a sister, Gladys Osborne of Delray Beach, Fla., and a granddaughter.
