        Charles P. (Chuck) Colgan, a Philadelphia educator who had a long association with rowing as an oarsman, coach and referee, died on Nov. 30 at his home in Ardmore, Pa. He was 72.
        The cause was prostate cancer, a family member said.
        Rowing for the University of Pennsylvania and the Vesper Boat Club in eights, fours and pairs, Colgan won numerous medals during his college years, 1947 to 1950. He then went into coaching on a part-time basis, at Columbia, Penn, LaSalle, St. Joseph's and Vesper, and later served as a referee of intercollegiate races. He also initiated rowing programs on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia for inner-city youths and for those with mental disabilities.
        He spent 23 years with the School District of Philadelphia, beginning as a social studies teacher and later helping to implement school desegregation programs.
        Colgan is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, Kevin C. of Wynnewood, Pa., Sean P. of Narberth, Pa., and Brian E. of Radnor, Pa.; a brother, Edward, of Arden, Del., and 10 grandchildren.
