        Herbert J. Alexander, an internationally known mathematician who had solved several complex problems that had baffled mathematicians for years, died on Aug. 27 in Evanston, Ill. He was 58.
        The cause of death was lymphoma, said his wife, Susan Alexander.
        Dr. Alexander, who lived in Wilmette, Ill., was a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He joined the university in 1975 and remained on staff until this year.
        ''He made important contributions to the study of analytic functions of several complex variables, which is a branch of mathematics developed in this century that has important connections to algebraic geometry, partial differential equations and other mathematics,'' said John Wermer, a retired professor of mathematics at Brown University.
        Among the problems Dr. Alexander had solved was finding the polynomial hull of rectifiable curves in the space of several complex variables.
        Dr. Alexander was born on Dec. 24, 1940, in Cleveland. He graduated from Harvard University and earned his Ph.D. in 1968 at the University of California at Berkeley. He taught at the University of Michigan, the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of California at San Diego before joining the University of Illinois at Chicago.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Alexander is survived by two daughters, Meredith Alexander of San Francisco and Leslie Alexander of Wilmette; a brother, Joseph Alexander of Manila.
