        Stewart R. Macdonald, a former executive of the American Newspaper Publishers Association who started its foundation and helped it raise millions of dollars for education, died on April 18 in the Hospice of Northern Virginia in Leesburg. He was 74.
        The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, said Sig Gissler, a friend.
        Mr. Macdonald was born in Newton, Kan. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1948.
        His award-winning promotional work for The Milwaukee Sentinel and later The Waukegan News-Sun in Illinois brought him to the attention of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, the trade association for daily newspapers, which hired him in 1963. The group is now called the Newspaper Association of America.
        Its foundation successfully promoted newspapers in schools. Mr. Macdonald also led the association's program to establish scholarships for black journalism students.
        From 1976 until retiring in 1983, Mr. Macdonald was director of public affairs for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.
        He is survived by his wife, Lydia Irvine Macdonald of Reston, Va.; three daughters, Laura C. Gunning of Portsmouth, N. H., Marcia A. Macdonald of Wilmington, N. C., Sarah L. Macdonald of Stillwater, Okla.; a son, Andrew S. Macdonald of Carbondale, Ill., and his mother, Pauline Macdonald of Reston.
