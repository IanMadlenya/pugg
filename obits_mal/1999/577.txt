        Robert J. McDonald, a tax lawyer for many years at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York-based law firm, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        The cause of death was heart disease, said Willard B. Taylor, a close friend and a partner in the law firm.
        Mr. McDonald joined Sullivan & Cromwell in 1941 and, except for four years in the Navy during World War II, remained there until his retirement in 1983. He became a partner in 1952.
        He had a national reputation in tax law, and over the years his corporate clients included Lazard Freres & Company, AMAX Inc. and the New York Life Insurance Company. He was also named to national panels on taxation by both President Johnson and President Nixon in the 1960's.
        Mr. McDonald was born on July 15, 1915, in Waterbury, Conn., and graduated from Cornell University and Cornell Law School. He was a trustee of Cornell University for many years.
        He is survived by his wife, Kay, a former chief administrative judge of the New York City Family Courts, and a daughter, Ann McDonald of Manhattan.
