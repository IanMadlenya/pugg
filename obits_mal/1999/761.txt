        Russell Inslee Clark Jr., who as dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale University presided over the enrollment of Yale's first women in 1969, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Wallingford, Conn. He was 64 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        Mr. Clark suffered a fatal heart attack while being treated for injuries received in a fall a few weeks earlier, said his brother Jonathan.
        A Yale graduate, Mr. Clark became dean of Yale's Trumbull College in 1963. He was dean of admissions from 1965 to 1969. He also lectured in sociology.
        Mr. Clark became headmaster of Horace Mann School in 1970. During a period of rapid change, he eliminated the dress code of jacket and tie and oversaw the school's merger with Barnard School in 1973.
        He became president in 1981, in charge of Horace Mann's four campuses in New York and Connecticut. In his two decades there, enrollment increased to 1,640 from 600, the staff more than doubled and the budget grew to $15 million from $1 million.
        In addition to his brother Jonathan, of Greenwich, Conn., Mr. Clark is survived by two other brothers, Christopher, of Dallas, and Anthony, of Alexandria, Va.
