        Albert Beryl Hudes, who organized galas that raised millions of dollars for the New York City Opera and March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75.
        He had suffered from a bone-marrow cancer called multiple myeloma and from chronic kidney failure, said his friend and co-executor, Stephen Kirschenbaum.
        Mr. Hudes (pronounced HEW-dees) held degrees from Harvard and Yale and was a foreign service officer in the 1950's. After a corporate career in the 1960's and 70's, he served as director of development for City Opera and as a consultant to the March of Dimes.
        Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center and former general director of City Opera, credited Mr. Hudes with having raised $1 million for the opera in a single night -- Oct. 27, 1980 -- at a farewell gala on the occasion of her final performance as an opera singer. Patrons paid up to $1,000 a ticket.
        Dr. Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes, said the Gourmet Galas organized by Mr. Hudes in the 1980's were the ''premier fund-raising events'' for the charity, typically raising $750,000 in a night.
        Mr. Hudes is survived by his sister, Ethel Linn of Coconut Creek, Fla.
