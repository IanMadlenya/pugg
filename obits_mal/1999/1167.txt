        Hugh Haynie, a longtime cartoonist for The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., died on Friday at a hospital in Louisville. He was 72.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Keith Runyon, the opinion editor of the newspaper.
        Mr. Haynie, who retired in 1995 after more than 36 years with The Courier-Journal, was known for his finely drawn cartoons, biting humor and liberal views.
        At one time, his work was syndicated in more than 80 newspapers.
        His liberal sympathies and merciless drawings of President Richard M. Nixon landed Mr. Haynie on the Nixon enemies list.
        One of Mr. Haynie's favorite cartoons, however, was apolitical. It was first sketched in 1955, when Mr. Haynie worked for The Atlanta Journal, but the newspaper chose not to run it.
        The drawing showed a man surrounded by wrapped presents, perusing a gift list. In the corner of the cartoon was the head of Jesus. The caption: ''Now, let's see, have I forgotten anyone?''
        He redrew the cartoon in 1961 when he was at The Courier-Journal, which not only ran it but reprinted it Christmas Eve every year since.
        Hugh Smith Haynie was born in Reedville, Va., on Feb. 6, 1927. He served in the Coast Guard in World War II and received a bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary in 1950. He then worked for The Times-Dispatch in Richmond.
        After serving again in the Coast Guard in the Korean War, he rejoined The Times-Dispatch as assistant editorial cartoonist.
        He also worked for The Greensboro Daily News in Greensboro, N.C.
        He is survived by a son, Hugh Smith Haynie Jr. of Louisville.
