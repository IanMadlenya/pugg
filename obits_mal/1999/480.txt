        James J. Heslin, a former director of the New-York Historical Society, died on April 30 at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 83.
        Dr. Heslin, who had a master's degree in library science from Columbia University and a doctorate in American history from Boston University, began working in the society's research library in 1956. He became director of the Society in 1960 and was named director emeritus when he retired in 1982. He was also a trustee of the New York Historical Association in Cooperstown.
        In 1968 he oversaw the refurbishment and air conditioning of the New-York Historical Society's headquarters on Central Park West and the opening of new galleries on the fourth floor. He established the society's education department and revamped the library cataloguing procedures to make its collection more accessible to the public.
        Dr. Heslin is survived by a sister, Mary Ryan of North Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, William, of Atlanta.
