        John Benson Brooks, a jazz composer, arranger and songwriter, died on Nov. 13 at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
        An early composition, ''Just as Though You Were Here'' (1942), with lyrics by Eddie DeLange, brought Mr. Brooks prominence. The song was recorded by Tommy Dorsey's band, with vocals by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers.
        His best-remembered hit, ''You Came a Long Way From St. Louis'' (1948), with lyrics by Bob Russell, was originally recorded by Ray McKinley and his Orchestra.
        Other songs of which Mr. Brooks was composer or co-composer included ''Where Flamingos Fly,'' ''Over the Weekend,'' ''A Boy From Texas, a Girl From Tennessee'' and ''A Door Will Open.''
        A 1957 recording of jazz musicians improvising on music Mr. Brooks had written, ''Folk Jazz, U.S.A.,'' on which Mr. Brooks played the piano,  was praised by John S. Wilson in The New York Times. Mr. Wilson wrote  that Mr. Brooks's arrangements of ''Shenandoah'' and other familiar folk songs, based on the tunes' chord structures rather than their melodies, ''emerge as relatively new compositions melodically, while retaining the evocative nostalgic quality of the source tunes.''
        ''It's a good trick and it works out as valid jazz,'' he added. Other jazz albums of Mr. Brooks's music were ''Alabama Concerto'' (1958) and ''Avant Slant'' (1968), which was a mixed-media collage featuring a performance of his 12-tone jazz work, ''The Twelves.'' .
        Born in Houlton, Me., he attended the New England Conservatory in Boston. In the early 40's he wrote musical arrangements for swing bands, including those of Les Brown and Tommy Dorsey.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy;  two daughters, Stephanie Lee Brooks and Wendy Brooks Mitchell, both of North Palm Beach, Fla., and a grandson.
