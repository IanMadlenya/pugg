        Eugene J. Bockman, a longtime archivist and librarian for the City of New York, died on Nov. 8 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had Parkinson's disease and had suffered a stroke, said his wife, Miriam.
        Mr. Bockman rescued some of the original architectural drawings of the century-old Brooklyn Bridge, which were being used by bridge maintenance crews in the 1970's, and put them into the city archives.
        From 1958 to 1975, Mr. Bockman was the director and chief librarian of the Municipal Reference Library. In 1976, he became the commissioner of the new Department of Records and Information Services.
        In World War II, Mr. Bockman, who had earned bachelor's and master's degrees at City College, flew 29 missions as an Air Corps gunner, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Air Medal with oak leaf clusters and two presidential unit citations.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Bockman is survived by three children, Peter Bockman of Manhattan, Claudia Weisburd of Philadelphia and Andrea Stack of Northbrook, Ill.; a brother, Leonard Bockman of Gainesville, Fla.; and five grandchildren.
