        Wolf Ulrich von Hassell, a former West German ambassador to the United Nations who helped the German resistance to Hitler during World War II and oversaw his country's post-war transition to full membership in international organizations, died at his home in Southampton, N.Y., on March 3.
        He was 85 years old. His family said Mr. von Hassell died of complications from emphysema.
        Through his family ties and his diplomatic postings, Mr. von Hassell witnessed many of the events that shaped his country in the years during and after the war.
        He was a confidant of his father, Ulrich von Hassell, the last Weimar Republic ambassador to Italy who was executed by the Nazis in 1944 for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Hitler.
        After the war, Mr. von Hassell, who had helped his father maintain contacts with the Allies, edited and published his father's diaries.
        During Mr. von Hassell's tenure as ambassador and deputy head of mission to the United Nations, from 1971 to 1978, the Federal Republic of Germany regained its status as a full member rather than observer. His previous diplomatic postings were in the Foreign Office in Bonn, in Belgium and in Italy.
        Mr. von Hassell maintained a home in Manhattan in addition to his home in Southampton.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Christa von Studnitz; a son, Agostino, who lives in Manhattan and in Virginia; a son, Adrian, of Manhattan; a daughter, Malve, of Southampton; and two grandchildren, Christian Ulrich and William Thassilo, who live in Virginia.
