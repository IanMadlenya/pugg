        Prof. Ronald Willetts, a British authority on life in ancient Crete, died on Feb. 19 in Birmingham, England. He was 83.
        His death was reported on Saturday by The Independent.
        Professor Willetts retired in 1981 from Birmingham University, where he had taught for 35 years and had been chairman of the department of Greek beginning in 1975.
        Much of his scholarship dealt with age-old folkways and social conditions in Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, which is in the eastern Mediterranean.
        Crete was where the Minoan culture, the first significant European civilization, was born roughly 5,000 years ago.
        An important product of his scholarship is his edition, with a commentary, of ''The Law Code of Gortyn.'' The edition was published in the late 1960's and has been called definitive.
        The code was discovered in 1884 among the remnants of the ancient Cretan city of Gortyn. The code's laws were inscribed in about 450 B.C. on blocks that were used in a building of that period, and they provide valuable information about civil society in those days.
        For the most part, the code has to do with the rights of families, individuals and slaves and with trial procedure. It includes laws about family matters like marriage, divorce and inheritance.
        Professor Willetts' books that have come out in the United States include ''Cretan Cults and Festivals'' (1962) and ''The Civilization of Ancient Crete'' (1977)
        Two of his translations from Greek drama were produced on the stage. He also wrote poetry of his own.
        He was born in in Halesowen in the English county of Worcestershire and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Birmingham. He became a lecturer in Greek there in 1946 after rising to major in the British Army during World War II.
        He married Annie Marion Dann in 1945, and they had a daughter, Helen Anne.
