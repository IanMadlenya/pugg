        Paul S. Newman, who was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most prolific comic-book writer of all time, died on May 30 in Columbia, Md. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Peter.
        Mr. Newman's stories included scripts for Superman, Mighty Mouse,  Twilight Zone and Star Trek comic books. He wrote stories in every comic-book genre -- humor, horror, romance and science fiction among them. He even wrote comic books about things usually not thought of as comic books, like ''Leave It to Beaver'' and ''I Love Lucy.''
        Starting in 1947, he wrote more than 4,100 stories totaling some 36,000 pages, the equivalent of 120 mystery novels, eventually writing for more than 350 comic-book titles. In 1993 the comic book historian Robin Snyder named him King of the Comic Book Writers after a three-year search for the most prolific writer in that field.
        Mr. Newman was born in Manhattan in 1924 and after high school enrolled at Dartmouth College. He served in three theaters of war during World War II and then returned to Dartmouth, where a play he wrote as a homework assignment became the first original play staged by the Dartmouth Players.
        Play writing remained his real love, but he soon found he could make a living by churning out stories for comic books. He would make up an entire story, panel by panel, describing each drawing for an artist to follow. Then he wrote the dialogue.
        In addition to writing comic books, he wrote five newspaper comic strips, ''The Lone Ranger,'' ''Smokey the Bear,'' ''Space Cadets,'' ''Robin Malone'' and ''Laugh In'' and branched out into screenplays and television sketches for such stars as Boris Karloff.
        In addition to his son, of Easton, Pa., he is survived by his wife, Carol, of Columbia; a daughter, Lisa Newman of Goshen, Mass.; two grandchildren, three stepdaughters and five step-grandchildren.
