        Danny Dayton, an actor and director, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 75 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was emphysema, his publicist said.
        As an actor on television, Mr. Dayton played the character known as Hank Pivnik on ''All in the Family'' and also appeared on ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Sergeant Bilko.'' His television credits included appearances on ''The Nanny,'' ''Cagney and Lacey,'' ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H.'' He also directed television shows, including ''The Lucy Show'' and ''Masquerade Party.'' His deft direction of television commercials won him three Clio awards.
        Mr. Dayton, who was born in Jersey City, N.J., was a graduate of New York University's School of Journalism but turned instead to the theater. He replaced Zero Mostel in ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' on Broadway and directed and appeared in the show's national touring company. He also had roles in ''High Button Shoes,'' ''Detective Story'' and ''At War With the Army.'' His film appearances included ''Flicks,'' ''Requiem for a Heavyweight,'' ''The Turning Point'' and ''Ed Wood.''
        He is survived by his wife, Arlene; a son, Charles, and a daughter, Robin Allison Smalley, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
