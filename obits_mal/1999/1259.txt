        Antonio Claudio Martinez, an immigration lawyer based in Manhattan who was a longtime presence in Dominican-American and other immigrant communities, died last Thursday at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. He was 73 and lived in Rego Park, Queens.
        The cause was complications from lung cancer, his family said.
        After graduating from Brooklyn Law School in 1956, he became the first Dominican-American member of the New York State Bar Association. He helped thousands of immigrants to gain legal residence here.
        Mr. Martinez was born in the Dominican Republic and was brought to this country at age 4. He attended Hunter College and served in the Army in the Pacific in World War II.
        His first marriage to Constancia M. Rodriguez-Guzman, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Nieves Ceballos Martinez; his mother, Estela Castellano of Rego Park; three sons, Francisco G. of Manhattan, Antonio C. 2nd of Wayne, N.J., and Claudio N. of Rego Park; a daughter, Juliette Martinez-Ozaruk of Croton-on-Hudson; and five grandchildren.
