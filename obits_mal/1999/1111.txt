        Richard B. Tullis, who guided the Harris Corporation from a small printing press company to an electronic communications equipment giant, died on Sunday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla., the company said. He was 86.
        Although Mr. Harris's early career predated the computer revolution by decades, he was well primed to ride the electronic communications wave. Mr. Tullis graduated from Principia College in Elsah, Ill., in 1934, with a double major in mathematics and physics. After short stints with the Dictograph Products Company and Schick Dry Shaver, he joined the Miller Printing Machinery Company of Pittsburgh as a salesman.
        Mr. Tullis moved to Cleveland in 1956 to become vice president of what was then known as Harris-Seybold, a maker of printing presses and paper cutters. Over the next 29 years, as Harris began changing into a manufacturer of word processing systems and other computerized communications devices, he rose through the company's ranks, becoming president in 1961, chief executive in 1968 and chairman in 1972. He remained on the Harris board until 1985.
        He also served on the boards of National City Bank, the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, NACCO Industries and GenCorp, and was chairman of Armada Funds Group for nine years.
        Mr. Tullis's role in Cleveland extended beyond Harris. He was among the leaders of a movement to  build low-income housing in the city's downtrodden Hough area and  was a longtime trustee of the Cleve land Orchestra, where he and his  wife, Chaille, endowed the principal  viola chair.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Tullis is survived by his daughter, Mrs.  Charles G. L. de Barcza of Bedminster, N.J.; twin sons, Barclay of Palo  Alto, Calif., and Garner of New York City; nine grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
