        Gilman Kraft, the owner of Playbill magazine in the 1960's and more recently the owner and president of Performing Arts magazine in California, died on June 27 at a hospital in Los Angeles. He was 73 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
        The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by Performing Arts magazine.
        Mr. Kraft was born in Union City, N.J., on April 22, 1926, and worked  during World War II as a linguist with the United States Army.
        After graduating from Columbia College in 1947, Mr. Kraft started the Reader's Subscription, a book club, and enlisted Lionel Trilling and Jacques Barzun as editors.
        In 1957, he took over the then-flagging Broadway program service Playbill, which he owned and operated for nearly 10 years. He was also the publisher of Show magazine in 1965 and 1966.
        In 1966, he moved to Los Angeles and started Performing Arts magazine, which serves the San Francisco Opera and Ballet, the Pasadena Playhouse and more than 40 other venues in California. He also worked as a real estate investor.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two sons, Richard, of Bel Air, Calif., and Frank Pelosa of Reseda, Calif.; two daughters, Dana Kitaj of Westwood, Calif., and Susan Pelosa of Agoura Hills, Calif., and eight grandchildren.
