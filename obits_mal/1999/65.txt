        Harvey Miller, a film and television comedy writer who was nominated for an Oscar for his collaboration on the 1980 movie ''Private Benjamin,'' died on Jan. 8 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 63 and had a second home in East Hampton, Long Island.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        While working as a social director for a hotel in the Catskills, Mr. Miller liked to say, he became fascinated that men could attract beautiful women simply by telling jokes. Eager to try his hand, he pitched a three-page routine to the comedian Vaughn Meader, who paid him, to his amazement, $300. His talent was confirmed by stand-up comedians like Dick Gregory, Shecky Green, Alan King and Sandy Baron, who hired him to write their jokes.
        Mr. Miller moved to Hollywood in 1967 to work with Mr. Baron on the television series ''Hey Landlord!'' With that show, he began a longstanding relationship with the writing-producing team of Jerry Belson and Garry Marshall.
        In 1973, he became the writer, producer and director of the television series ''The Odd Couple,'' for which he received two Emmy Award nominations. He also was nominated for an Emmy for ''Love, American Style,'' and wrote and directed other hit series, including ''Taxi'' and ''The Tracey Ullman Show.''
        In 1980, Mr. Miller wrote and produced, with Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer, ''Private Benjamin,'' starring Goldie Hawn. The picture was a box office success and earned the trio an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay.
        His other film credits included writing and directing ''Getting Away With Murder'' and ''Bad Medicine.''
        Mr. Miller is survived by a brother, Stanley Howard, of Delray Beach, Fla.
