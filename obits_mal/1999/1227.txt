        Vladimir Yashchenko, who as a teenager set world records in the high jump using an antiquated style, died on Tuesday. He was 40.
        No other details were available, yet a track coach from Zaporizhya, Ukraine, his hometown, told Reuters that Yashchenko died of cirrhosis of the liver, which The Associated Press also reported.
        As an 18-year-old student at the Soviet Sports Institute in Kiev, Yashchenko set the world record for the high jump, 7 feet 7 3/4 inches, at an outdoors junior meet in 1977 between the Soviet Union and the United States in Richmond, Va. Remarkably, his jumping method used a scissors kick, in which the jumper straddles the bar as if it were a hurdle. Since 1968, elite high jumpers have used the headfirst, backward flip first made popular by Dick Fosbury.
        In 1978, the 6-foot-3-inch, 179-pound Yashchenko set the indoor mark of 7-8 1/2 at the European championships in Milan, then the same year set the outdoor record of 7-8 at Tbilisi in the Soviet Union. His record was broken two years later.
        An injury in 1979, the year before the Moscow Olympics, forced him to retire. Nikolai Maltsev, the coach from Zaporizhya, said Yashchenko had recently been living on a small pension given to champion athletes.
