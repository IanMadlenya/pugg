        Frank J. Pagliaro, a concrete contractor whose projects included the Chrysler Building and the New York Athletic Club in Manhattan, died on Sunday at his home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 99.
        Mr. Pagliaro provided concrete for the United Nations, Shea Stadium, the New York Coliseum, the Huntington Hartford Gallery in Columbus Circle and numerous public housing projects in Manhattan.
        During the 1960's, Mr. Pagliaro expanded his business, Knickerbocker Construction, and became a general contractor, helping to build Lincoln Towers in Manhattan.
        He constructed buildings in many cities. His projects included the Federal Court Building in San Francisco, and in the Washington area, the Senate Office Building, the Central Intelligence Agency Building and the Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.
        Mr. Pagliaro was born on March 4, 1900, in Manhattan. After graduating from Cornell University in 1925, he joined his father's company, Knickerbocker Fireproofing, which encased steel beams with concrete.
        The firm later branched out into reinforced concrete, the basic material of modern high-rise buildings.
        Mr. Pagliaro is survived by his wife, Anita; a sister, Mary Petrillo of Bronxville, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Pagliaro Jr. of Burlingame, Calif., and Leonard Pagliaro of Seattle; four daughters, Anita Pagliaro and Carla Pagliaro, both of Livingston, Mont., and Alix Barthelmes and Lisa Selz, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
