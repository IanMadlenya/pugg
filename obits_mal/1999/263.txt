        E. Lynn Turgeon, a longtime professor of economics at Hofstra University, died last Wednesday at University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 78.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter, Kim Turgeon.
        Dr. Turgeon, who taught at Hofstra for 33 years before retiring in 1990, was an expert in comparative economic systems and contemporary capitalist economic policies. He was the author of four books and was selected twice as a Fulbright scholar.
        He served in the Navy during World War II and joined the Hofstra faculty in 1957. He taught in the former Soviet Union twice, first as a visiting professor at Moscow State University in 1978 and then at the Academy of Foreign Trade in Moscow in 1991. His articles appeared in publications including The Wall Street Review of Books, Monthly Labor Review, The American Journal of Sociology, The Journal of Comparative Economic and The Nation.
        In addition to his daughter and her husband, William Christensen, Dr. Turgeon is survived by a sister, Margaret Johnson, and two grandchildren.
