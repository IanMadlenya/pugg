        Bishop George Papaioannou of New Jersey, who became the first married priest to be elevated to the rank of bishop in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America, died on Monday at a hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 66.
        The cause was a stroke, the archdiocese said. Bishop George collapsed on Sunday while speaking at a stewardship dinner at St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Bethesda, which he had served as pastor for 27 years, until 1998.
        Bishop George was a widower; his wife, Maria, died in 1993. Nonetheless, his elevation as bishop last year was highly unusual, as that ecclesiastical rank has traditionally been reserved for unmarried, celibate priests.
        Bishop George was enthroned as head of the Diocese of New Jersey on April 17, 1999, with responsibility for 52 parishes in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. For four weeks last August and September, after the resignation of Archbishop Spyridon, Bishop George served as the archdiocese's archepiscopal vicar. In that capacity, he was responsible for making arrangements for the enthronement of the archdiocese's new spiritual leader, Archbishop Demetrios.
        Born in Prodomos, Greece, George Papaioannou graduated from the Patriarchal Theological School of Halki in Turkey in 1957. He subsequently served Greek Orthodox churches in Istanbul; Hamilton, Ontario; and Manchester, N.H. In 1976, he received a doctoral degree in theology from Boston University.
        He wrote three histories of Greek Orthodox life in the United States, one of them on the archdiocese's 75th anniversary in 1997. For 12 years, he wrote a column, ''Tell Me, Father,'' in the archdiocese's newspaper, Orthodox Observer.
        Bishop George is survived by a brother, Elias Papaioannou; three daughters, Alexandra Mosko, Eleni Spirou and Vasiliki Szczesny; and six grandchildren.
