        Correction:  April 1, 1999, Thursday  An obituary of the jazz musician Theodore McRae on Monday misstated the location of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey, to which he was a contributor. It is on the university's Newark campus, not at Rutgers in New Brunswick.
