        Paddy Devlin, who was active in the founding of Northern Ireland's moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, its most popular Catholic party, died on Sunday. He was 74 and a resident of Belfast.
        He died after a lengthy hospitalization, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Devlin, whose full name was Patrick Joseph Devlin, was a big, shaggy man, a trade unionist and a Socialist, and he came to be an an energetic foe of violence.
        The son of a flour-mill worker, he was born and grew up in Belfast and quit school at the age of 14. He became an operative in the Irish Republican Army, and was interned by the British from 1942 to 1945, a period during which he became an opponent of sectarianism.
        After World War II he quit the I.R.A. and also became a flour-mill worker, and a union organizer. He was an active member of the Northern Ireland Labor Party, a Belfast City Councillor and a member of Northern Ireland's parliament for a time, beginning in 1969.
        In 1970 the Social Democratic and Labor Party was founded, and Mr. Devlin strove to give it roots in Belfast. The party has always received the largest number of votes from the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland.
        He also became minister for health in what had been Northern Ireland's only joint Protestant-Catholic government, which was formed in November 1973. It was brought down in 1974 by a general strike by loyalists who wanted the province to remain part of the United Kingdom.
        Mr. Devlin's political career did not rebound after those reverses, and it essentially ended in 1977, when he and the Social Democratic and Labor Party, with which he had been finding fault, parted company.
        In 1981 backers of the I.R.A. forced him and his family to leave their Belfast home because the guerrillas resented his criticism of them.
        Surviving are his wife of 49 years, the former Theresa Duffy, two sons and three daughters.
