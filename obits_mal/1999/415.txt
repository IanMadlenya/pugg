        Norman Rossington, a veteran British character actor whose career embraced films, theater and television, died on Friday in a hospital in Manchester, England. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, according to his agent, Marilyn Collis.
        Mr. Rossington was born in Liverpool, began acting in a community drama club and eventually moved to Bristol, where he received his early theatrical training and eventually began acting at that city's Theater Royal.
        His rumpled features -- he once described himself as having ''a mug like a jug'' -- made him a natural for character roles, and he soon found work in films. He appeared in ''Carry On Sergeant,'' the first of that comedy series, and went on to play supporting roles in ''Carry On Nurse'' and ''Carry On Regardless.''
        Mr. Rossington made more than 40 films, including ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' ''Saturday Night and Sunday Morning,'' ''A Hard Day's Night'' with the Beatles, ''Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines'' and ''A Night to Remember.'' He also appeared in the Elvis Presley film ''Double Trouble.''
        He was a familiar figure on British television, starting with ''The Army Game'' in the 1950's and continuing into the 1970's, playing comedic as well as dramatic roles.
        He also appeared in ''I Claudius'' and was the gravedigger in a production of ''Hamlet'' that starred Richard Chamberlain.
        Mr. Rossington's theater credits included productions of ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''Guys and Dolls,'' in which he played Nathan Detroit.
        His most recent stage appearance was in the London production of ''Beauty and the Beast.''
        He is survived by his wife, Cindy.
