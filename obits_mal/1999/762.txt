        The Rev. S. Howard Woodson Jr., who in 1974 became the first black to lead the lower house of a state legislature, died July 28 at a hospital in Trenton. He was 83.
        Pastor Woodson, a Democrat, lived in Trenton and led the Shiloh Baptist Church there for 53 years. He was elected to the Trenton City Council in 1962 and to the New Jersey Legislature in 1964, serving six two-year terms.
        He served as New Jersey's Speaker in 1974 and 1975, becoming the first black to hold such a post. He was also the minority leader of the Assembly in 1968 and 1969.
        Pastor Woodson resigned from the Assembly in 1976, when Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed him president of the state's Civil Service Commission, which gave him responsibility for many state affirmative action and equal employment programs. He held the position until 1982.
        A strong supporter of Governor Byrne's introduction of a state income tax, Pastor Woodson acknowledged in 1978 that he did not file state or Federal income tax returns in 1976 and 1977. He said the failure resulted from an oversight by his second wife, Lola, who had been ill.
        While the matter was being investigated, Governor Byrne ordered Pastor Woodson to take an unpaid leave of absence from his civil service job. The leave ended after it was learned that he did not owe any taxes and was due a refund.
        S. Howard Woodson was born in Philadelphia on May 8, 1916. He received a bachelor's degree from Cheyney University in Cheyney, Pa., and a master's degree in divinity from Morehouse College in Atlanta. He was ordained in 1944 and moved to Trenton in 1946. He retired from his church position in March, becoming pastor emeritus.
        Pastor Woodson also served as president of the State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P.
        His first wife, Audrey, died in 1969. He is survived by his second wife, Lola: a son, S. Howard 3d of Alexandria, Va.; a daughter, Jean Mitchell of Newtown, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Paulette George of Hamilton Township, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
