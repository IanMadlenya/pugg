        Fred M. Thrower, a former New York television executive who contributed the televised Yule log to New Yorkers' Christmas Eve celebrations, died on Aug. 16 in Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn.  He was 89 and lived in Greenwich.
        Mr. Thrower began his career as an advertising sales executive with the ABC radio network, in 1942. After serving as a Navy lieutenant in World War II, he joined CBS as a sales executive and vice president in the early 1950's, then became general manager of WPIX-Channel 11, an independent station, in 1953. He held the position for 19 years before becoming chairman in 1972.
        In 1966, he had the idea of televising a burning Yule log on Christmas Eve for the benefit of people who had no hearth of their own. The first log burned in the fireplace at Gracie Mansion, the Mayor's residence, accompanied by Christmas music.
        During Mr. Thrower's tenure at the helm, WPIX faced a contentious challenge to the renewal of its license by a group called Forum Communications that sought, among other things, greater minority representation in the station's leadership. The Federal Communications Commission eventually renewed the license, but its highly publicized hearing on the matter lasted five years.
        Mr. Thrower retired in 1975.
        He is survived by a son, F. Mitchell Thrower 3d of La Jolla, Calif., and a daughter, Wendy Thrower Vigars of Mill Valley, Calif.
