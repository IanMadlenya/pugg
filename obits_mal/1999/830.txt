        Jack B. Jackson, a former chief executive of the J. C. Penney Company, the retailer, died on Aug. 12 in Dallas, the company announced. He was 83.
        Mr. Jackson began his 38-year career with Penney while still attending Austin College in Sherman, Tex., his hometown, and at one time he worked as a store manager there. Working his way up through the company's ranks, he was named chief executive and president in 1972 and held those posts until his retirement in 1976.
        Mr. Jackson earned a reputation as a hard-driving, ambitious executive who relished trying to beat his superiors into the office each morning. He is also remembered for focusing the clothing chain's marketing efforts on women's fashion and for recruiting women as store managers.
        After graduating from college, Mr. Jackson worked for J. C. Penney part time while also working as a high school teacher and athletic director in his hometown. A J. C. Penney store manager later coaxed Mr. Jackson into joining the company full time.
        Mr. Jackson was a member of the United Way and the United Negro College Fund and was a trustee of Austin College. After he retired, he raised quarter horses at his ranch in Aubrey, Tex.
        Mr. Jackson is survived by his daughter, Jackie Lee Jackson, and two sons, Joe Monroe Jackson and James Kinsey Jackson.
