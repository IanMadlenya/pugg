        Andrew J. Loyla, a flutist who played in the New York City Ballet Orchestra for nearly 30 years and was a member of the executive board of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, died on  April 17 at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains. He was 69 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said Judy West, the spokeswoman for Local 802.
        Mr. Loyla was a freelance player for much of his career and worked  with the Symphony of the Air, the Little Orchestra Society, the Columbia Symphony Orchestra and the orchestras of the Joffrey, Royal Danish, Kirov and Royal Ballets.
        He was born in Ossining in 1930 and began his performance career after studies at the Juilliard School in the late 1940's. Besides his orchestral jobs, he played chamber music with the New Art Wind Quintet, as well as session work that included film scores and commercials. He was also on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music.
        He is survived by a son, Matthew, of Chester, N.Y., a daughter, Renee Werner of Little Silver, N.J., a sister, Jeanne, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
        Correction:  May 2, 1999, Sunday  An obituary on Thursday about a flutist for the New York City Ballet Orchestra misspelled his surname and misstated his residence. He was Andrew J. Lolya, not Loyla, and lived in Manhattan, not Ossining, N.Y.
