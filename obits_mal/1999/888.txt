        Paul Showers, author of a series of  science books for young readers and a former editor for The New York Times, died on July 17 at the home of his daughter, Dr. Kate B. Showers, in Orange, Mass. He was 89.
        He wrote some 25 science-related books in the ''Let's Read and Find Out'' series, all first published by Crowell. One of them, ''Before You Were a Baby'' (1968), was written jointly with his wife, Dr. Kay Matteson Sperry, a psychologist.
        The first in the series, ''Find Out by Touching'' (1961), enjoyed a success that led Mr. Showers to keep on writing juvenile nonfiction. Another book in the series, ''The Listening Walk'' (1961), was praised by a reviewer in The New York Times Book Review who wrote, ''An ordinary walk won't seem like the same old route after being alerted by Paul Showers to listen for sounds along the way.''
        Mr. Showers's other books included ''The Moon Walker,'' about how babies learn to move, ''Sleep Is for Everyone,'' ''Use Your Brain,'' ''How You Talk,'' ''Me and My Family Tree,'' ''A Book of Scary Things'' and ''The Bird and the Stars.'' His writings have been translated into Dutch, French, Japanese and Portuguese and Spanish.
        He was on the staff of The Times's Sunday department from 1946 to 1976, serving as a copy editor on the Sunday magazine and in other posts. He also wrote numerous articles and book reviews for The Times.
        Born in Sunnyside, Wash., he spent much of his youth in Michigan and received a bachelor's degree in 1931 from the University of Michigan. He became an Army staff sergeant in World War II and was an editor of Yank, the Army weekly, in Okinawa. Early in his career he worked for The Detroit Free Press and The New York Herald Tribune.
        His 1946 marriage to Dr. Sperry ended in divorce in 1973.
        Besides his daughter, a research fellow at Boston University, who has since moved to Petersham, Mass., he is survived by a grandson.
