        Thomas H. Lake, the former president of Eli Lilly & Company, the multinational pharmaceutical concern, and former chairman of the Lilly Endowment, one of the largest private foundations in the nation, died on Sunday at his home in Carmel, Ind. He was 80.
        The cause was melanoma, said a spokeswoman for the endowment, Gretchen Wolfram.
        The son of a coal miner, Mr. Lake was born on Jan. 6, 1919, in Westmoreland County, Pa.
        He graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia and worked as a pharmacist until he enlisted for service in the Army in 1941. Upon being discharged in 1945, he became a major in the Medical Administrative Corps.
        He began his career in sales at Eli Lilly in 1946 and became president in 1973. He retired in 1976 but remained a director until 1989.
        Mr. Lake, who was also active in the effort to renovate downtown Indianapolis in recent years, was the chairman of the Lilly Endowment from 1977 to 1992 and was its president from 1977 to 1984. The foundation is a leading source of grants for education in theology and for community development projects, among other things.
        Mr. Lake is survived by his wife, Marjorie; a daughter, Karen Lake Buttrey of Indianapolis, and one sister, Katherine L. Snyder of New Kensington, Pa.
