        John M. Hartwell, an investment counselor and mutual fund manager, died April 2 in New York City, his wife, Sheila, said. He was 83.
        Until his retirement in 1996, Mr. Hartwell was the president of his own firm, J. M. Hartwell & Company, which managed private accounts and university endowment funds.
        Admired for his candor, geniality and acumen, Mr. Hartwell was widely quoted in business publications. ''He was one of the early pioneers in identifying the inherent value in growth stocks and growth industries,'' said Alexander Lazer, a principal with J. M. Hartwell & Company. ''Using his research methods, several of his former partners went on to start well-known money management firms.''
        Born in Everett, Mass., Mr. Hartwell graduated from Harvard College in 1936 and from the Harvard Business School two years later. He taught economics and accounting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Rutgers University before joining the Navy as an officer in World War II. He was awarded the Purple Heart for wounds received during the invasion of the Marshall Islands.
        Before founding his own company, Mr. Hartwell worked as an economist for Mutual of New York and an economic analyst for the Ford Motor Company. He was also the treasurer of the Piedmont Life Insurance Company and special assistant to the chairman of the finance committee of the Vick Chemical Company.
        In addition to his wife, the former Sheila Walker, of Manhattan, Mr. Hartwell is survived by three children, Robert, of Dorset, Vt., John 3d, of Greenwich, Conn., and Kathryn Hartwell of Manhattan; a brother, Richard, of Bellevue, Wash.; a sister, Tina Hartwell of Loma Linda, Calif.; two stepchildren, Jonathan Walker and Jason Walker, both of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
