        Patrick Bedford, who performed in many Broadway shows and played opposite Sandy Dennis in the 1967 film ''Up the Down Staircase,'' died on Nov. 20 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said Patricia O'Haire, a friend.
        Mr. Bedford, who was born in Dublin, had lived and worked in New York for the last two decades.
        He first came to the United States in 1966 and quickly won a role in Brian Friel's play ''Philadelphia,  Here I Come!,'' for which he received a Tony nomination.
        He starred with Ms. Dennis in the 1967 movie version of Bel Kaufman's novel ''Up the Down Staircase,'' in which he played an English teacher in a troubled high school in a large city.
        Mr. Bedford's 30-year career spanned two continents and several theater companies, including the Hilton Edwards/Micheal MacLiammoir Dublin Gate Theater, where he performed in the works of Chekhov, Shaw and Shakespeare early in his career; he also directed occasionally. He was involved in more than 200 productions.
        Among his other notable roles were Nym in the film ''Chimes at Midnight,'' Orson Welles's adaptation of several Shakespeare plays, which was shown at the 1966 Cannes International Film Festival and released theatrically in 1967 under the title ''Falstaff.''
        He is survived by two brothers, John and Frederick, and two sisters, Alice McGuinness and Cora Kelly, all of Ireland.
