        Lorin E. Price, a theatrical producer, died on Dec. 28 at his home in Tampa, Fla. He was 77.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Price began producing in 1959, beginning Off Broadway with shows like ''The Mime and Me'' and ''The Tiger Rag.'' His first Broadway production was ''The Natural Look,'' a play about Helena Rubinstein, which opened in 1967 with Gene Hackman, Brenda Vaccaro and Jerry Orbach in the leading roles.
        His first big success was ''George M!,'' the 1968 musical about George M. Cohan, with Joel Grey and Bernadette Peters. The show received a Tony Award nomination for its star, Mr. Grey, and a Tony Award for the choreographer, Joe Layton. His credits also included ''Show Me Where the Good Times Are,'' a musical adaptation of Moliere's ''Imaginary Invalid,'' in 1970, and ''Seesaw,'' a musical based on William Gibson's play, ''Two for the Seesaw.'' Choreographed by Michael Bennett and starring Michelle Lee, Ken Howard and Tommy Tune, the show opened in 1973 and Mr. Bennett and Mr. Tune won Tonys.
        He also produced ''Free,'' a 1972 film about the Randalls Island Rock Festival with Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Who.
        He is survived by a daughter, Lorinda, of Tampa; a son, Lorin E. Jr., and three grandchildren.
