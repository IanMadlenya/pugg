        Mohammed Hadid, an Iraqi economist and cabinet minister who advocated democracy but was buffeted by his country's autocratic governments, died on Tuesday in London, where he moved in 1995. He was 92.
        He had an asthma attack, The Associated Press said.
        Mr. Hadid received a degree in the 1920's from the London School of Economics.
        For years he was a leader of the opposition National Democratic Party, which called for the restoration of democratic processes in Iraq.
        He was appointed Minister of Supply in 1946, when his country was a monarchy, but he soon quit because elections were held that were flagrantly manipulated.
        In 1958 the Iraqi military mounted a coup. The monarchy was overthrown, Iraq was proclaimed a republic and Mr. Hadid was appointed Finance Minister.
        But in 1960 he stepped down from the Cabinet, and by 1961 almost all the other ''political ministers'' were gone from it, replaced largely by followers of the country's strongman, Abdul Karim Kassim.
        Mr. Hadid stayed active in party politics. But then, in 1963, the Kassim Government was ousted by another military coup, born of a partnership between the Baath Party, whose goals included Arab unity, and nationalist army officers.
        The party set up a National Council of Revolutionary Command, but the real power was wielded by the party leader, Ali Salih as Saadi. The Baathists stayed in power less than a year, but are said to have kept Mr. Hadid under detention for months.
        Later he stayed out of politics and was active in the business world. The Saddam Hussein dictatorship kept him from leaving Iraq until 1995, when he joined his family in London.
        Surviving are two sons, Haithem and Fulath, and a daughter, Zaha
