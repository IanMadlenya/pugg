        Joseph B. Wheelwright, a driving force behind the spread of Jungian psychoanalytic teaching, died on June 22 at a convalescent home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 93.
        In 1946, Dr. Wheelwright asked Carl G. Jung, the Swiss psychoanalyst, for his blessing in establishing an institute to teach and certify Jungian analysts. In a story that has become part of the lore of the profession and that was often told by Dr. Wheelwright, Jung, who deplored over-organization, replied, ''If you have an organization, make it as disorganized as possible.''
        But Dr. Wheelwright had his own ideas. In San Francisco, he founded a well-structured, democratic Jungian institute, which preceded similar teaching institutes in London, Zurich and elsewhere around the world.
        ''He was a major figure in the dissemination of Jung's ideas,'' said Dr. John Beebe, the president-elect of the C. G. Jung Institute of San Francisco, who was a student and close colleague of Dr. Wheelwright.
        Jung, who died in 1961, began his career as a Freudian but broke with Freud when Jung emphasized that basic human drives are rooted not only in sex but also in the emotionally charged symbols, images and themes in fantasies, dreams, delusions and myths.
        It was while traveling the world in the early 1930's that Dr. Wheelwright and his wife, the former Jane Hollister, met Jung in Zurich. In 1932, they both entered analysis with Jung and Dr. Wheelwright then attended St. Bartholomew's Medical College in London, graduating in 1939.
        Settling in San Francisco, Dr. Wheelwright taught for 30 years at the Langley-Porter Psychiatric Institute at the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, which became a leading psychiatric training institute in the nation.
        Dr. Wheelwright, who was born on June 6, 1906, in Boston, is survived by his wife; a daughter, Lynda Schmidt, of Brooklin, Me., and a son, John, of Point Reyes Station, Calif.
