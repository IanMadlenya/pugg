        Rabbi Jeshaia Schnitzer, a pioneer in integrating Jewish pastoral care and family therapy, died on Thursday while staying at his daughter's home in Manchester, Conn. He was 81 and lived in Montclair, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said Rabbi Michael Monson, the present rabbi of the the Congregation Shomrei Emunah, a conservative synagogue in Montclair, from which Rabbi Schnitzer retired in 1979, after 28 years as rabbi.
        Later, he was deeply involved in chaplaincy work.
        Rabbi Schnitzer (whose first name was pronounced Yesh-AH-ya) was a counseling psychologist who was prominent in many Jewish communal organizations. He was also a board member in the 1960's and 1970's of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States.
        ''It was not conventional for a rabbi in that era to be that identified with the cause of sex education,'' said Rabbi Schnitzer's son, Rabbi Jonathan Schnitzer, of Rockville, Md. ''But he came to it through his framework as a therapist.''
        Born in Philadelphia, Rabbi Schnitzer received a bachelor's degree from the University of Delaware, studied at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York and was ordained in 1944. He also received a master's degree in social work from Columbia University and a doctorate from its Teachers College.
        His wife, Hilde, died in January.
        Besides his daughter, Lisa Plavin, and his son, Rabbi Schnitzer is survived by six grandchildren; a brother, Charles, of Wilmington, Del. and three sisters, Rose Harad of Wilmington, Claire Fleisher of Pembroke Pines, Fla. and Selma Winson of Hollywood, Fla.
