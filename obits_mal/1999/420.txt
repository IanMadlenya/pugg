        Ramon Rubial, a veteran of the Spanish Civil War who spent nearly 20 years in prison under the Franco regime, died Monday at his home in Bilbao. He was 92.
        Mr. Rubial, widely respected as the living memory of Spanish Socialism, still held the honorary title of president of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party at his death. According to the Spanish news agency EFE, King Juan Carlos and all of the country's political parties joined in honoring him for having spent much of his life in the defense of liberty and the rights of working people.
        Born in an industrial town in the coastal Basque province Vizcaya, Ramon Rubial Cavia was the son of a metalworker and a presser. When only 5, he attended a meeting in Bilbao with Pablo Iglesias, the founder of both the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and a socialist labor union.
        He took up his father's trade while in his teens and joined the union at 14 and the Socialist Party two years later.
        Rising to prominence in both organizations, Mr. Rubial fought on the side of the Government against the military uprising led by Gen. Francisco Franco in 1936. The following year he was taken prisoner on the front lines.
        After the defeat of the Government defenders in 1939, Franco seized power and dealt ruthlessly with his opponents. The union and the Socialist Party were banned by the new Government, and Mr. Rubial served several stints in jail for a total of nearly 20 years.
        After his release in 1957 he became ''Pablo,'' the party's leader in the underground. With Franco's death a new generation of Socialists came to the fore under Felipe Gonzalez, a future Prime Minister, in the mid-1970's. Mr. Rubial became their titular president and served as a senator from Viscaya and chief of the Basque regional government since then.
