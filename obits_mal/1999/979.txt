        Thomas O. Foster, 49, a philanthropist, amateur racing driver and executive of Foster Poultry Farms, one of the nation's largest privately held businesses, died Sept. 22 at his home in Hickman, Calif., a farming hamlet in the San Joaquin Valley. He had diabetes and related heart problems, a company spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Foster was a senior vice president and co-owner with his brother George of Foster Poultry Farms. The company, which was founded by their father, Max, in 1939 on a ranch near Modesto, has grown to 8,000 employees in five Western and Southern states. The company does not report financial results, but industry officials said it had about $990 million in sales last year.
        Thomas Foster took over as chief executive in 1977 when he was 27, after his older brother Paul died of a heart attack. In the early 1990's, he stepped down, brought in outside executives, and devoted more time to his hobby, auto racing.
        An informal man who shunned neckties and usually wore jeans, he founded Tracer Racing, which designs and races sports cars. Mr. Foster won more than 200 races and 7 of Tracer's 13 national titles in Sports Car Club of America competitions.
        He helped support the Sierra Vista Children's Center, which provides homes and schooling for abused and neglected children, the DARE drug education program and other charities including American Red Cross relief for California residents displaced by floods and other disasters.
        Besides his brother George of Waterford, Calif., survivors include a son, Trevor, of Carmel, Calif., and a daughter, Emilie Ann, of Atascadero, Calif.
