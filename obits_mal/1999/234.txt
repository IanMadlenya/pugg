        The Rev. W. Frank Harrington, senior minister of the largest Presbyterian (U.S.A.) church in North America, died on Wednesday of cardiorespiratory failure at Emory Hospital in Atlanta. He was 63.
        Mr. Harrington's church, Peachtree Presbyterian of Atlanta, grew significantly during his tenure. It had fewer than 3,000 members when he arrived in 1971 and more than 11,000 at the time of his death.
        Martha Foster, the church's publications director, said Mr. Harrington liked to describe Peachtree Presbyterian as ''a big church that feels more like a small town'' and worked hard to maintain that atmosphere.
        ''He cared about people and expressed that caring in very many ways,'' said the Rev. Stephen Bacon, Peachtree Presbyterian's minister of administration and stewardship. ''He always knew people by name, he understood their circumstances and went out of his way to be with them at any time of need.''
        Colleagues said a $20 million expansion of the church, expected to be completed by fall, will be part of Mr. Harrington's legacy.
        Mr. Harrington grew up near Kingstree, S.C., and graduated from Presbyterian College of Clinton in 1957. He received a master of divinity degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga., in 1960, and a master of theology in 1964.
        He was ordained by the Savannah Presbytery in July 1961, and began his ministry as the pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Hinesville, Ga. He also served at Fairview Presbyterian Church in North Augusta, S.C.
        Mr. Harrington is survived by his wife, Sara; their two daughters, Victoria Franch, of Atlanta, and Susan Potter, of Shelburne Falls, Mass.; and three grandchildren, Carolina Franch, Michael Franch and James Franch, all of Atlanta.
