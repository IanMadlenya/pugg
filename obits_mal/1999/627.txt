        Norman B. Hirsh, who supervised the development of the Apache attack helicopters that were used extensively in the Persian Gulf war in the 1990's and recently in Yugoslavia, died on June 8 at his home in Coto de Caza, Calif. He was 64 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife, Sharon, said.
        He was a former engineer and aerospace executive at the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company, in Mesa, Ariz. As a vice president and general manager there, Mr. Hirsh also fostered production and sales of more than 200 Apaches. Using lasers and infrared technology, the Apaches, unlike other helicopters, are capable of combat operations at night and in bad weather.
        Mr. Hirsh, who was born in the Bronx on April 20, 1935, graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Purdue University. He began his engineering career at the Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Mich., and in 1958, he moved to San Diego as a design engineer for General Dynamics.
        In 1962, Mr. Hirsh took a job in the aircraft division of the Hughes Tool Company in Culver City, Calif., specializing in rotocraft. He rose there from mechanical engineer to deputy program director for Hughes Helicopters. The company later became part of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which merged with the Boeing Company in 1997.
        Mr. Hirsh left McDonnell Douglas as an executive vice president in 1990 and then spent three years in Port Angeles, Wash., as president of the Rogerson Hiller Corporation and the Rogerson Aircraft Corporation flight structures group. He retired in 1993.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Hirsh is survived by two daughters, Sharon Margaret Hirsh of Coto de Caza and Lisa Beyrooty of Newport Beach, Calif.; a son, Richard Scott Hirsh of Studio City, Calif.; one brother, Melvin Hirshowitz of New Rochelle, N.Y.; one sister, Judith Golomb of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.
