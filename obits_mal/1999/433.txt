        D. Robert Yarnall Jr., who helped build a local Pennsylvania manufacturing company into a multinational corporation, died on Thursday at the Unitarian Universalist House nursing home in the Germantown section of Philadelphia. He was 74 and had lived most of his life in the city.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his brother, James B. Yarnall, said.
        Mr. Yarnall started in business in 1950 when he joined the company co-founded by his father, then known as the Yarnall Waring Company, a small manufacturer of specialty valves for power plants. The company, based in suburban Philadelphia, eventually changed its name to the Yarway Corporation. In 1962, Mr. Yarnall, then 37, became president, and in 1977 he was elected chairman.
        While working in that job, Mr. Yarnall founded the Envirite Corporation, an environmental services subsidiary of Yarway. In 1984, Envirite was spun off, and Mr. Yarnall served as chairman of both corporations.
        By 1986, Yarway had operations in seven countries and its sales had greatly increased. That year the company merged with Keystone International, a large maker of industrial valves, and Mr. Yarway stepped down as chairman. He continued as chairman of Envirite until 1997.
        Mr. Yarnall was born in 1925 in Germantown and attended the Germantown Friends School. He graduated from Cornell University in 1948 and worked in Europe with the American Friends Service Committee before beginning his career in business. He was named to the boards of an assortment of companies and nonprofit groups, including the Quaker Chemical Corporation and the World Affairs Council.
        Mr. Yarnall is survived by his wife, Anne Gates Yarnall; a brother, James B. Yarnall; a sister, Nan Yarnall; three daughters from his marriage to the late Rie Yarnall; seven grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.
