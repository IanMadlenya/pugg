        Howell T. Conant Sr., a photographer best known for his pictures of Princess Grace of Monaco, died on March 11 at his home in Carefree, Ariz. He was 83 and also had a home on Block Island, R.I.
        Mr. Conant was working as a fashion photographer in 1955 when he was commissioned by Photoplay magazine to do a cover photograph of Grace Kelly, who shortly thereafter became Princess of Monaco. The picture became one of his best-known images, and he became the favorite photographer of the Royal Family of Monaco. In 1992 he published ''Grace,'' a book of his photographs of the Princess, Prince Rainier and their three children.
        He went on to take pictures for Life, Look, Paris Match and other publications, and photographed celebrities from Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn to Presidents Nixon and Kennedy.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a brother, Roger, of Newport Beach, Calif.; a son, Howell Jr., of Cave Creek, Ariz.; three daughters, Carol Richter-Blum of Philadelphia, Susan Conant of Newport, R.I., and Sarah Martabano of South Salem, N.Y.; 12 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
