        Nicholas Shoumatoff, a nature enthusiast and mountain climber who won praise for a book on Central Asia, died on Sept. 13 at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 81 and lived in Bedford, N.Y.
        The cause was complications from a stomach tumor, his family said.
        A butterfly subspecies, Shoumatoff's hairstreak, was named after Mr. Shoumatoff, who was president of the New York Entomological Society.
        Mr. Shoumatoff, whose Russian family name is pronounced SHOO-ma-toff in the United States, was a native New Yorker. When he was a teen-ager, he went on entomological expeditions to Jamaica with his uncle, Andre Avinoff, director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.
        Mr. Shoumatoff received a bachelor's degree in 1939 in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After Navy service in World War II, he worked for years in the pulp and paper industry and oversaw the building of mills in more than a dozen countries.
        He also climbed mountains in Central Asia and elsewhere. He and his wife, the former Nina Adamovitch, edited ''Around the Roof of the World'' (1995, University of Michigan Press), an anthology of writings about Central Asia by Russian scientists and climbers. Publishers Weekly said in praise that ''armchair travelers'' could ''enjoy an exotic ride.''
        Another book, ''The Alps: Europe's Mountain Heart,'' which Mr. Shoumatoff wrote, is tentatively scheduled to come out in May.
        He married his wife in in 1941. She died in 1995.
        He is survived by two sons, Alexander Shoumatoff, the writer, of Keene Valley, N.Y.; Nicholas Avinoff Shoumatoff of Bedford, and a daughter, Antonia Shoumatoff-Foster of Wassaic, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
