        Charles E. Perry, who turned an abandoned airfield on the fringes of the Everglades into Florida International University, died on Monday at his home in Rockwall, Tex. He was 62.
        The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by the university.
        Mr. Perry, who was the first president of the university, from 1972 to 1975, was hired by the Florida Board of Regents in 1969 to turn Tamiami Airport into the first public university in the Miami area. His first office was in an empty control tower. Classes began in September 1972.
        After leaving Florida International, Mr. Perry was the chief executive at two corporations, Golden Bear International, the golfer Jack Nicklaus's sports marketing and merchandising company in North Palm Beach, Fla., and Family Weekly Publications. In 1993, he became the dean of the Graduate School of Management at the University of Dallas in Irving, Tex.
        Charles Edward Perry was born in Logan, W. Va., and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He was an administrator at Bowling Green in 1967 when Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida hired him to become his special assistant for education. Two years later, Mr. Perry, who was known as Chuck, was assigned the task of building F.I.U.
        The university has grown from 5,600 students in 1972 to 31,500 students today.
        Mr. Perry is survived by his wife, Betty; a son, Tom, of Dallas; a daughter, Lynette Perry McCollum of New York City; a brother, Jim Perry of Miami; his mother, Ethel Perry of Tequesta, Fla., and a granddaughter.
