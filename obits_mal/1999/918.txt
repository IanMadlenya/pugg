        Herbert V. Shuster, a food scientist who founded one of the nation's oldest consumer product testing companies, died Monday at a nursing home in the Brighton section of Boston, where he had been for several days. He was 75 years old and lived in Waban, Mass.
        The cause was complications from a recent stroke, according to James Shuster, one of Mr. Shuster's sons.
        Born and raised in Boston, Mr. Shuster formed his company, Herbert V. Shuster Inc., in 1955, and built it into one of the leading independent companies involved in research and development of consumer products. The consulting company specialized in product testing for the food and drug industries.
        Through his company, Mr. Shuster became a pioneer in the field of manufacturing private-label products, which are made for stores to sell in competition with national brands.
        In 1995, the company was acquired by Hauser Chemical Research of Boulder, Colo. At that time, it had a professional staff of more than 100 people and worked with many manufacturers and marketers that were among the nation's 500 largest industrial companies.
        Mr. Shuster graduated from the Boston Latin School and served as a meteorologist with the United States military during World War II. He later graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and received his doctorate in food technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Mr. Shuster is survived by his wife, Roseanne; two sons, Mark of Newton, Mass., and James of Providence, R.I.; a daughter, Amy Muscott of Amherst, N.H., and three grandchildren.
