        He became the manager of The New York Times Book Division when it was established in 1963. In its first three years, the division issued more than 50 titles in collaboration with 25 publishers; it became Times Books and was later sold to Random House.
        Later he held a variety of positions at The New York Times Company. He retired in 1992.
        His marriage to Helen Markel ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, Linda, he is survived by a sister, Jane Heckman of Lombard, Ill.; his son and daughter from his first marriage, Mark, of Monmouth Hills, N.J., and Jennifer Stewart of Studio City, Calif.; three stepchildren; and 12 grandchildren.
