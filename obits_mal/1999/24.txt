        Paul Corser, the senior program officer of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, died Monday at his home in Harlem. He was 37. The cause was AIDS related, his wife, Sally Morrison, said.
        A native of St. Paul, Mr. Corser graduated from New York University. As program officer, he oversaw the foundation's grant-making activities and its research, behavioral sciences and scientific publication projects.
        In 1991 he developed a clinical trials program, which tests promising AIDS drugs at neighborhood health centers.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Corser is survived by his father, Bartlett, of Minneapolis; five brothers, Joseph of Bagley, Minn., John of New York City, Michael of Guatemala, Patrick of Steamboat Springs, Colo., and Thomas of Clinton, N.J., and two sisters, Anne Joria of Houston, Minn., and Elizabeth Ihrke of Plainview, Minn.
