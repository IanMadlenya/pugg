        Tom Joe, an expert on Government antipoverty programs and a recipient in 1986 of the MacArthur Fellows award, died on Saturday at his home in Arlington, Va.
        Mr. Joe, the director of the Center for the Study of Social Policy here, was 64 and had been undergoing treatment for cancer. His family said he died of heart failure.
        As an official in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration, Mr. Joe helped develop legislation creating the Supplemental Security Income program, which gives assistance under Social Security to poor elderly and disabled people, and the earned-income tax credit, which provides tax rebates to the working poor.
        He formed the Center for the Study of Social Policy in 1979. A nonpartisan research institute, it studies Federal and state welfare programs, foster care and poverty among children. Mr. Joe was known in his field for basing his research on extensive personal interviews with poor people.
        Mr. Joe was born in Milwaukee in 1935 and was blind since childhood. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in political science from the University of California at Berkeley and was on the staff of the California Assembly before going to Washington to work on welfare.
        With his wife, Cheryl Rogers, Mr. Joe wrote ''By the Few, for the Few: The Reagan Welfare Legacy'' (Lexington Books, 1985). In addition to his wife, he is survived by four grown children.
        After winning what is popularly known as a genius award from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Mr. Joe told an interviewer: ''That's very difficult to absorb. I guess if I was a genius, I would have thought of an easier way to make a living.''
