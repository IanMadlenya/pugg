        Henry J. Kurth, a theater lighting and set designer who created scenery for Martha Graham, Erick Hawkins and Doris Humphrey, died on Sunday at his home in Cleveland. He was 81.
        Trained at the Goodman Theater and the Art Institute of Chicago, Mr. Kurth designed more than 450 theater productions, including the 1958 Broadway show ''Heloise'' and burlesque shows, where he worked with Gypsy Rose Lee. He also worked closely with the designers Arch Lauterer and Isamu Noguchi in the late 1940's and early 50's. He created sets for four to seven new productions a year for seven years for the Dance Theater of Kathryn Karipides and Henry Kurth in Cleveland in the 1970's.
        Mr. Kurth began teaching design in 1946 at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, becoming a mentor to several generations of dancers, actors and directors as well as designers. He was a professor emeritus at the university at the time of his death. His scene renderings are in the permanent collection of the McNay Museum of Art in San Antonio.
        He is survived by a brother, Donald, of Columbus, Wis.
