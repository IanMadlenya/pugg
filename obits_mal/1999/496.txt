        Frank Stanton, an entrepreneur and real estate investor who developed an early videocassette, died last Sunday at his home in Water Mill, on Long Island. He was 78.
        He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Domna C. Stanton.
        Mr. Stanton conducted most of his business and real estate dealings in partnership with his brother, Arthur, who died in 1987, and Victor Elmaleh, through World Wide Holdings, the company they established in Manhattan. It was created for trading in surplus goods left scattered around the world in the aftermath of World War II. With a foothold in North Africa, the company became the largest importer of sugar into Morocco.
        It was later involved in importing Volkswagens, Porsches and Audis into the United States. Later, the company engaged in toy manufacturing and movie distribution.
        In the late 1960's, World Wide Holdings joined forces with the Avco Corporation, a high-technology manufacturer, to found Cartridge Television, a company that produced a videocassette and player that anticipated later developments in the field.
        In the 1970's, World Wide Holdings branched into real estate, and was frequently in partnership with William Zeckendorf Jr. in such projects as the $300 million Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza-Manhattan, a 46-story hotel on the west side of Broadway between 48th and 49th Streets, which was designed to light up like a giant jukebox.
        The partners were also among the backers of World Wide Plaza, a residential and business structure at the site of the old Madison Square Garden at Eighth Avenue and 50th Street. That project helped push midtown Manhattan development activity to the west.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, James, of New York City, and Michael, of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter, Alexandra, of New York City, and two grandchildren.
