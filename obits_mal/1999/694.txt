        Igor Belsky, the artistic director of the Vaganova Ballet Academy of St. Petersburg and a former director of Russia's Kirov Ballet, died at a hospital in St. Petersburg on July 3. He was 74.
        The cause was a stroke, said Igor Stupnikov, the St. Petersburg correspondent for The Dancing Times of London.
        A genial, humane dance enthusiast all his life, Mr. Belsky began his career as a performer with the Kirov, which he joined in 1943 following training at the Leningrad Ballet School (later renamed the Vaganova Ballet Academy) and the Institute for Theater Arts. He danced with the Kirov for 20 years, becoming known for his gifts as a character or dramatic dancer of clarity and intensity.
        A choreographer noted for his innovation, Mr. Belsky was at the forefront, with Yuri Grigorovich, of a trend in Soviet ballet that began in the late 1950's and that emphasized the importance of musical interpretation. His ballets tended toward the heroic and sometimes to satire.
        His first ballet, ''The Coast of Hope,'' created in 1959 for the Kirov, was a romantic celebration of Soviet man's loyalty and courage. Mr. Belsky's 1961 ''Leningrad Symphony'' paid tribute to Soviet man's spirit during wartime. His choreography often addressed modern issues and incorporated athletic and work movements. Mr. Belsky turned toward satire in his 1963 version of ''The Little Humpbacked Horse,'' a fairy tale ballet, and his 1969 staging of ''The Nutcracker'' attempted to draw closer to the dark original tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann.
        Mr. Belsky's most famous roles with the Kirov included Shurale in Leonid Jacobson's 1950 ''Ali-Batyr'' (later ''Shurale'') and Nurali in Rostislav Zakharov's ''Fountain of the Bakhchisarai.'' He was the chief choreographer and artistic director of the Maly (now Modest Mussorgsky) Theater in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) from 1962 to 1973, of the Kirov from 1973 to 1977 and of the Leningrad Music Hall from 1979 to 1992. His best-known ballets also included his 1967 ''Gadfly'' and his 1974 ''Icarus.''
        Mr. Belsky's teaching career began with classes in character dance at the Leningrad Ballet School from 1943 to 1956 and for several years in the mid-1960's. He began teaching choreography at the Leningrad Conservatory in 1966. Mr. Belsky was named director of the Vaganova Academy in 1992. At the academy, Mr. Belsky made a point of exposing the students to contemporary Western choreography. But he continued the strict training principles developed by Agrippina Vaganova in the 1930's. Results were achieved by ''severity, severity, and again, severity,'' he told Robert Johnson in 1998 in The New York Times.
        He is survived by his wife, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a former Kirov soloist, and a son, Nikita, both of St. Petersburg.
