        Daniel J. Sullivan, who was a judge in the Bronx for 20 years, died on Thursday at North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, N.Y. He was 72 and lived in Seaford, N.Y.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, his son David said yesterday.
        Judge Sullivan was born on the West Side of Manhattan. He served in the Navy during World War II, graduated from Iona College in 1949 and received his law degree from Fordham Law School in 1955.
        He went on to work on the staff of District Attorney Frank S. Hogan of Manhattan until 1966, and then for more than a decade on the staff of District Attorney Burton B. Roberts of the Bronx.
        Mayor Abraham D. Beame named him a Criminal Court judge in the Bronx in 1977, and he also began serving as an acting State Supreme Court justice. He was reappointed by Mayors Edward I. Koch and Rudolph W. Giuliani, and he retired in 1997. Later, he was a Bronx judicial hearing officer until shortly before his death.
        In 1992, in one of the highest-profile cases over which he presided, Judge Sullivan, as an acting justice, sentenced Alejandro Henriquez to 75 years to life in prison, the maximum punishment possible, in the murders of a young woman and two girls. The courtroom exploded into applause when he read the sentence.
        Judge Sullivan was predeceased by his wife, the former Susan Galligan.
        In addition to his son David of New Hyde Park, N.Y., Judge Sullivan is survived by a daughter, Susan Sullivan of Manhattan; three other sons, Daniel of Seaford, Jim of Mineola, N.Y., and Richard of Belle Harbor, Queens; and 12 grandchildren.
