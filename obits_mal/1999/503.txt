        Charles K. McWhorter, an aide to Vice President Richard M. Nixon and later a lawyer for A.T.&T., died on Tuesday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston after being injured on May 1 in a car accident on Cape Cod. He was 77 and lived in Manhattan and Los Angeles.
        Mr. McWhorter was a legislative assistant to Vice President Nixon from 1957 to 1961 and joined A.T.&T. as an executive assistant and attorney shortly afterward. He retired in 1987.
        In 1968, after Nixon had been  elected President, Mr. McWhorter turned down an offer to work in the White House, saying he preferred to remain in New York. He accepted an appointment to the National Council on the Arts instead.
        Mr. McWhorter was born on Feb. 22, 1922, in Lewisburg, W.Va. He  graduated from West Virginia University and in 1949 received a law degree from Harvard University. He also served in the Army during World War II and the Korean War. A onetime president of the Young Republican National Federation, he was active in Republican politics throughout his life.
        He is survived by a sister, Susanna Reckerd of Claremont, Calif.
