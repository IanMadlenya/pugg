        Robert Beckett Spence, a professor emeritus of psychology at Teachers College at Columbia University, died on Wednesday at his home in a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. He was 89 years old.
        He died of heart disease, his son-in-law, Donald Muntz, said.
        A 1927 graduate of Columbia University with a Ph.D. in psychology, Dr. Spence joined the faculty of Teachers College in 1925 and was named professor emeritus in 1966 when he retired. He was appointed director of the Advanced School of Education at Teachers College in 1950.
        He was a Fulbright Fellow in Pakistan in 1955, and from 1956 to 1961, was head of the Project for Teacher Training, a Teachers College program financed by the Agency for International Development that sent instructors to Afghanistan to help improve the school system in Kabul.
        From 1942 to 1949, he worked for the War Production Board and the New York State Board of Education. He was also a consultant to the New York State Youth Commission and a member of a Governor's task force on juvenile delinquency. In 1952 he wrote a book, ''Reducing Juvenile Delinquency -What New York State Schools Can Do.'' After he retired, he was a visiting professor at the University of Georgia.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rita Pond; a daughter, Carol Muntz of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Donald, of Princeton, N.J.; two sisters, Margo Brown of Madison, Wis., and Lucy Jeffers of Sun City, Ariz., and four grandchildren.
