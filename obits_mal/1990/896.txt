        Mr. Verral, who was born in Ontario, wrote pulp fiction early in his career. From 1934 through 1943, under the pseudonym George L. Eaton, he wrote most of the Bill Barnes Air Adventurer magazines, book-length tales of a flying hero who demolished villains in dogfights.
        In the early 1940's he wrote scripts for the radio series ''Mandrake the Magician'' and then wrote the dialogue for ''Hap Hopper,'' a comic strip about a newspaper correspondent. He also began writing sports and adventure books for young people, a field in which he continued until very recently.
        Mr. Verral's works in the 1950's included novels about a boy detective. He wrote nonfiction books about jets and about space, as well as biographies of Babe Ruth, Casey Stengel and the rocket pioneer Robert Goddard.
        In the 1960's and 70's he was an editor and writer for Reader's Digest.
        Surviving are his wife, Jean, and a son, Charles Spain Verral Jr., of Santa Fe, N.M.
