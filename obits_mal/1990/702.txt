        Tseng Kwong Chi, an artist and photographer who for the last 10 years documented the downtown art scene in Manhattan and particularly the works of the artist Keith Haring, died of AIDS early yesterday in his Manhattan apartment. Mr. Tseng was 39 years old.
        Born in Hong Kong and educated in Paris and Canada, Mr. Tseng took thousands of photographs of Mr. Haring and his art, beginning with Mr. Haring's work as a subway artist. In 1984, the two men collaborated on a book, ''Art in Transit,'' a collection of Mr. Haring's subway drawings and Mr. Tseng's photographs of the drawings.
        Mr. Haring died of AIDS last month at the age of 31.
        Mr. Tseng is survived by his parents, Ronald and Stella Tseng of Vancouver; a sister, Muna Tseng of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond Tseng of Vancouver.
        His companion was Robert Haynes of Manhattan.
