        Adolf Rudnicki, a leading Polish writer and essayist known for his complex characters and his depictions of Jews during the Holocaust, died on Wednesday in Warsaw, the Polish press agency reported. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Rudnicki's works were translated into English, French, Hebrew, German and Russian. His novels include "The Golden Windows" and "The Merchant of Lodz," which focus on Jewish suffering and resistance.
        His best-known works were published after World War II, but Mr. Rudnicki gained an audience in Poland in the 1930's with two novels, "The Unloved" and "The Rats."
        Mr. Rudnicki escaped being killed as a Jew under the Nazi occupation and fought in the Warsaw uprising in 1944. His wartime experiences permeated his work. His "Epoch of the Ovens," a series of short stories, is about the Holocaust.
