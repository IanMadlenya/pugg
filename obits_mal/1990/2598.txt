        Dr. Samuel Berg, who led a research team of doctors into Nagasaki after the second atomic bomb was dropped there in World War II, died on Saturday at his home in Newark. He was 92 years old.
        During the war he served in the Army Medical Corps. After three years in the South Pacific, he was assigned to the Atom Bomb Medical Research Commission. They went into Japan within three weeks after the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and surveyed the effects of radioactive fallout on people.
        Dr. Berg had a private practice in Newark from 1924 to 1984, when he retired.
        He was born in Newark and was a graduate of Bellevue Medical College.
        There are no immediate survivors.
