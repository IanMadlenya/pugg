        He returned to New York in 1979 and took up duties at Britain's mission to the United Nations. He served there as second in command from 1981 to 1983. In 1983 he became British High Commissioner to Nigeria. After retiring in 1987, he took up business in New York.
        Sir Hamilton, whose full name was William Erskine Hamilton Whyte, graduated from Queen's College, Oxford. From 1945 to 1948 he was a seaman in the Royal Navy. He leaves his wife, the former Sheila Duck; two daughters, Polly Chia of Singapore and Kate Whyte of London; and a grandson.
