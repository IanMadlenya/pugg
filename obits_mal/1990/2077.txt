        Dr. Florio suffered a heart attack while attending a meeting of a Chemical Manufacturers Association panel on the effects of fluorocarbons in the stratosphere. The panel, of which he was a founding member, was holding its final meeting.
        He joined Hoechst in 1966 as manager of technical development and held several positions before retiring in 1985 as assistant to the president. He had previously held research positions with Johnson & Johnson, Alexander Smith and Allied Chemical.
        In World War II, he worked with the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. During his career he received 32 patents that stemmed from his work in physical chemistry and six for mechanical inventions.
        Dr. Florio, who was born in Manhattan, received a degree in chemical engineering from Columbia and a doctorate in physical chemistry from Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Eforo; two daughters, Patricia Colrick of Spring Lake, N.J., and Anne Lisa Florio of Short Hills; a brother, Dr. Richard Florio of Gradyville, Pa.; three sisters, Rosina Lukach of Closter, N.J., and Clara and Louise Florio, both of Woodside, Queens, and two grandchildren.
