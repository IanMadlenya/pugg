        John G. Aston, emeritus professor of organic chemistry and former director of the Low Temperature Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, died Monday at Centre Community Hospital in State College, Pa. He was 87 years old and lived in State College.
        Dr. Aston joined Penn State's faculty in 1929 after doing his undergraduate and graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley and serving as an instructor at Northwestern University. He founded the Low Temperature Laboratory in 1933.
        Under his direction, the center, since renamed the Cryogenics Laboratory, achieved national prominence by producing liquid hydrogen and helium and for its experiments in nuclear cooling. In 1960 the laboratory became the first in the United States to achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, the hypothetical point at which a substance would have no molecular motion and no heat.
        His research also led to the development of restrictions on the flexibility of organic molecular shapes, enabling scientists to predict the most likely shapes taken by new molecules. Dr. Aston retired in 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, Henrietta; a son, Timothy of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a daughter, Janet Reist of Chapel Hill, N.C.; two sisters, Zella Norman of Danville, Calif., and Kathleen Olds of Gates Mills, Ohio; and four grandchildren.
