        He died of heart failure, said a spokesman for Kenyon College, where Mr. Greenslade was the archivist.
        Mr. Greenslade began his career teaching chemistry at the City College of New York in 1931. From 1936 to 1949, he taught chemistry at Port Richmond High School on Staten Island and then became the chairman of the science department at New Dorp High School. He was also science supervisor for the New York City public schools and retired from both positions in 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Thomas Jr. of Gambier; a daughter, Elizabeth Vanderploeg of Monroe, Iowa, and five grandchildren.
