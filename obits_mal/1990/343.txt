        William W. Bartley 3d, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University, died of bladder cancer on Feb. 5 at his home in Oakland, Calif. He was 55 years old.
        Dr. Bartley, who was born in Pittsburgh, received bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard University. He went to the University of London on a Fulbright scholarship, earning a doctorate in economic and political science.
        He taught for many years in England and the United States, serving on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley and San Diego, the University of Pittsburgh and Cambridge.
        He is survived by his wife, Elvina; a brother, Arthur, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Faith, of Pittsburgh, and Marian, of Houston.
        Correction:
        An obituary on Thursday about William W. Bartley 3d, a research fellow and former professor, misidentified a survivor, Elvina Bartley. She is his mother, not his wife.
