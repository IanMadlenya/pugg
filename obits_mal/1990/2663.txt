        Edgar Mills Gemmell, a former administrative vice president of Princeton University who was associated with its fund-raising efforts, died on Tuesday at the Medical Center of Princeton. He was 79 years old and lived in Princeton Borough.
        He died "after a long battle with Parkinson's disease and cancer," a university spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Gemmell, a native of New York City, was a graduate of Phillips Exeter Academy and, in 1934, Princeton. He worked for public-relations concerns in New York and Baltimore before joining the Princeton staff in 1939 as executive secretary of the Princeton Fund.
        During World War II he was a photography officer with the Eighth Fleet in the Mediterranean. He was regional public-relations manager of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company when Princeton appointed him administrative secretary in 1954. Five years later He was elected a vice president.
        For over a decade, until he retired in 1965, Mr. Gemmell was responsible for Princeton's off-campus relations, which included annual fund campaigns. He left after a three-month drive that collected $60 million for the university.
        For the next 20 years, Mr. Gemmell was a fund-raising consultant to several colleges and universities, as well as the United Negro College Fund, Lincoln Center and the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington.
        Mr. Gemmell is survived by his wife, Isabelle McIntyre Gemmell; two stepsons, Austin P. Sullivan Jr. of Minneapolis and Alan Agle of Park City, Utah; and a sister, Janet Gemmell Jainschigg of Darien, Conn.
