        Gerald T. McCarthy, a civil engineer and a past president of the International Commission on Large Dams, died on Wednesday at his home in Summit, N.J. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. McCarthy died of Parkinson's disease, his daughter, Susan M. Relyea, said.
        A specialist in water-resources development, Mr. McCarthy was a retired partner in the engineering and architectural consulting firm TAMS, formerly Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton. He supervised construction of dams in South America, the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia, including the Tarbela Dam in Pakistan, the Ziz Dam in Morocco and the Demirkopru in Turkey. He also played an important role in river basin studies in Greece, the engineering of the Binga hydroelectric project in the Philippines and technical and economic surveys in Burma.
        A 1930 graduate of Pennsylvania State University, Mr. McCarthy served with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Venezuela for eight years before becoming a partner in 1947 in the firm that was to become TAMS. He retired in 1974.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by a son, George, of Florham Park, N.J., and two grandchildren.
