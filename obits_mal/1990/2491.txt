        The Rev. Harry R. Burns, a Jesuit priest and professor emeritus of St. Peter's College in Jersey City, died on Sunday at St. Francis Hospital in Jersey City. He was 68 years old and lived at the Jesuit Residence at St. Peter's College.
        His death was attributed to a heart condition, a funeral home representative said.
        Father Burns taught philosophy at St. Peter's from 1965 to 1987, when failing health forced him to retire. He joined the Jesuits in 1948 after serving in the Navy in World War II. He studied at St. Louis University, taught at Lemoyne College in Syracuse and was ordained in 1958. He returned to St. Louis University to complete his doctorate and joined St. Peter's in 1965.
        He is survived by a sister, Sister Jane Burns of the Catholic Medical Mission Sisters in Philadelphia.
