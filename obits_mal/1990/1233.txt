        Charles P. Farnsley, a colorful fixture of Kentucky politics for many years and a former Mayor of Louisville, died in a Louisville nursing home on Tuesday at the age of 83.
        The Pearson Funeral Home of Louisville said Mr. Farnsley, who was 83 years old, died after a long illness.
        A Democrat who was trained as a corporate lawyer, Mr. Farnsley affected the dress of a Kentucky colonel - swallowtail coats, brocade vests, planters' hats and string ties - when he made his first campaign for elective office in 1932 at the age of 25. He was seeking a seat in the United States House of Representatives.
        He lost but he made a run at the Democratic nomination for a United States Senate seat in 1940. He lost that race, too, but won his next campaign, for Mayor of Louisville in 1948.
        In his five years as Mayor, Mr. Farnsley was credited with modernizing municipal government, improving civic services, easing the city into racial desegregation and promoting local cultural groups like the Louisville Orchestra and the Children's Theater.
        Mr. Farnsley was elected to the House of Representatives in 1964, serving for one term. He was an ardent supporter of President Lyndon B. Johnson and his Great Society programs, including the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts.
        He is survived by two daughters, Sally Bird of Arlington, Va., and Ann Farnsley of Vevay, Ind.; three sons, Burrel Farnsley and Douglass Farnsley, both of Louisville, and Alexander Farnsley of La Jolla, Calif., and six grandchildren.
