        Augie Donatelli, a National League umpire for 24 years and the founder in 1964 of the Major League Umpires Association, died today. He was 76 years old. Mr. Donatelli died in his sleep at home, his wife, Mary, said.
        Mr. Donatelli, known for his fiery on-field manner, umpired in five World Series and four All-Star games. He was known for his give-and-take arguments with players and managers.
        The two most famous incidents involving him came in World Series 16 years apart. In the fourth game of the 1957 Series between the Milwaukee Braves and the New York Yankees, Donatelli awarded the Braves' Nippy Jones first base after ruling that Jones had been hit on the foot by a pitch. Donatelli retrieved the ball and found shoe polish on it. An argument ensued, but Donatelli would not change his call. Milwaukee beat the Yankees in seven games.
        In the 1973 Series, also in Game 4, Donatelli called Willie Mays of the New York Mets out at the plate, leading to another famous argument. The Oakland Athletics went on to win the Series, four games to three.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Donatelli is survived by two daughters, Barbara Kulicka and Carole Holsonback; two sons, David and Patrick, and six grandchildren.
