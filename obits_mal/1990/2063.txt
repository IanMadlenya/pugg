        Ben Smathers, whose agile legs and fast feet helped spread the popularity of clog dancing during a 32-year career on the Grand Ole Opry, died Thursday. He was 61 years old.
        The leader of the Stoney Mountain Cloggers died of complications following open-heart surgery. He had been admitted to Vanderbilt Hospital on Tuesday complaining of an upset stomach and heartburn.
        Mr. Smathers, a native of Asheville, N.C., learned the clog dance as a child by watching an old man do it in the mountains of western North Carolina. A hallmark of Appalachian culture, clogging is basically keeping the beat of the music by tapping the feet.
        His eight-member group often danced on the Opry to fiddle tunes like ''Black Mountain Rag,'' ''Old Joe Clark'' and ''Orange Blossom Special.''
        Mr. Smathers made six low-budget movies, performed twice at Carnegie Hall and appeared on many network television shows.
        He is survived by his mother, his wife, three sons and three daughters.
