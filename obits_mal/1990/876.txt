        Jay Johnson, a Manhattan gallery owner and scholar of American folk art, died of AIDS on Thursday at his home in Piermont, N.Y. He was 39 years old.
        In 1973 Mr. Johnson established the Jay Johnson America's Folk Heritage, now on Madison Avenue. Considered the leading gallery for 20th-century self-taught and naive painters and sculptors, its roster of artists included Mattie Lou O'Kelley, Kathy Jakobsen and Janet Munro. Mr. Johnson also wrote a 1983 book with William C. Ketchum Jr., ''American Folk Art of the 20th Century,'' and recently opened a second gallery in Piermont.
        Mr. Johnson is survived by his mother, Peggy Avey, of Riverview, Mich.; his father, Richard Johnson, of Allen Park, Mich., and two sisters, Judy Wardle, of Findlay, Ohio, and Jo Schultz, of Dearborn, Mich. His longtime companion was Rubens Teles.
