        He died as the result of a fall, a spokesman for Columbia Press said.
        He graduated from Columbia in 1932 as valedictorian of his class and joined the Press staff that year. He was the author of a history of the Press, published in 1983, and was an editorial executive during publication of the Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer of the World (1952) and of three editions of The Columbia Encyclopedia (1950, 1963 and 1975). He retired in 1977.
        There are no immediate survivors.
