        Mr. Roman was riding in a car that was hit by a truck on a highway near Chilpancingo, 130 miles south of Mexico City, said Jaime Perez, a W.B.C. spokesman. All five people in the car were killed.
        Mr. Roman, who was born in Mexacali, moved to Mexico City to train for the Olympics when he was 13, Mr. Perez said.
        Mr. Roman fought in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow and made his debut as a professional in August 1981. In his career, he fought 61 amateur and professional matches. He won 54, lost 6 and tied 1.
        He earned his first superflyweight championship in March 1986, then lost the title in March 1987 and regained it in April 1988. He lost the championship again last December. On June 9, he lost again to Sung Kil Moon, the champion, in South Korea.
