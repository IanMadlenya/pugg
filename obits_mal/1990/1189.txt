        For 20 years Mr. Rigo had been in the Federal witness-protection program. Details of his death and information on survivors were not available.
        As the Government's major witness in 1970, Mr. Rigo testified that from 1964 to 1969 he had paid thousands of dollars in kickbacks to Mr. Addonizio, a former Congressman; other members of the Addonizio administration, and organized-crime figures in connection with contracts on water projects.
        Mr. Addonizio, who was defeated for re-election by Kenneth A. Gibson during the trial, was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was paroled after serving five years and died in 1981.
        At the time of the trial Mr. Rigo was married and had four children from a prior marriage.
