        Habib Sabet, one of Iran's major industrialists, died of congestive heart failure on Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 86 years old and lived in Paris.
        Mr. Sabet, whose upbringing in poverty and in the Bahai faith was a double disadvantage in his ascent to the mostly Shiite Muslim Iranian elite, founded more than 40 corporations and was involved in banking, television, business and industry.
        In 1919, with an investment of $20 earned at his bicycle repair shop, he bought an old truck and converted it into Teheran's first taxi. The taxi service blossomed into a trucking company, and with the profits he opened a woodworking and furniture factory.
        He later acquired distributorships from American companies like RCA, Squibb, Autolite, Phelps-Dodge and Pepsi-Cola. He started Iran's first television station in 1958 and two years later opened a second station.
        He was a philanthropist and an art and antiques collector and was an important figure in Bahai religious circles across the world.
        Mr. Sabet, who spoke six languages, served on the boards of major corporations in Iran, including the Industrial Mining and Development Bank, the Iran British Bank, the Iran-Middle East Bank, Iran Volkswagen, and General Tire and Rubber Company of Iran.
        He moved to Paris in 1974. After the fall of the Shah in 1979, his businesses were run by his sons.
        He is survived by his wife, Bahereh; two sons, Hormoz of Manhattan and Iradj of Jurra, Switzerland, and six grandchildren.
