With his wife, the former Helen Bandow, as the designer, Mr. Lazar opened the company in 1946. Over the years, Kimberley's knit dresses and other items came to be fashion staples in wardrobes of women from the Duchess of Windsor to secretaries.
        Mr. Lazar began work in a knitting mill at the age of 15 and studied every aspect of the business, from operating machines to design, finishing, packing, and selling.
        Fashion From Paris
        By the 1940's, knitwear had fallen on hard times. Because knits would stretch, sag and shrink, many fashionable women had banished them from their wardrobes. But merchants like Hector Escobosa, the president of I. Magnin, convinced Mr. Lazar to set his sights on high fashion. He went to Paris and brought back designs for dresses, suits and pants suits, which his company manufactured.
        By the 1970's sales that had peaked at $30 million had reached a plateau, and after Mr. Lazar's retirement in 1977, they dropped severely. In 1972, Kimberly was acquired by the General Mills Corporation, which closed the company in 1979.
        Mr. Lazar, a native of Hunter, N.Y., was a trustee of Brandeis University and a former member of the advisory board of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jeanne Morency of Middleburg, Va.; a son, William, of Portland, Ore,, and two sisters, Ceil Hibbel of Boca Raton, Fla., and Helen Sinclair of Manhattan.
