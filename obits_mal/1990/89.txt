        Harry Traulsen Sr., founder of Traulsen & Company, a commercial refrigeration business in Queens, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan after a long illness. He was 82 years old and also lived in Deering, N.H.
        He founded the company, based in College Point, Queens, in 1938 as a producer of bakery fixtures, including refrigerated showcases.
        In World War II, the company led the way in manufacturing portable refrigerated boxes that preserved food under combat conditions in places where electricity was not always available. Today, the company employs more than 600 people and has plants and offices in California, Illinois and Texas.
        Mr. Traulsen is survived by his wife, the former Ilse Gamero; six children from earlier marriages - three sons, Hugh, of Brewster, N.Y., Harry 2d, of White Plains, and Kurt, of Huntington, L.I., and three daughters, Harmoney Stern of Chappaqua, N.Y., Phoebe Brieloff of Manhattan and Heidi Sweet of Ridgefield, Conn. He is also survived by seven grandchildren.
