        Mr. Werner, who was known as Mort, joined NBC in 1952 as a producer of the ''Today'' show. He later produced the ''Home'' show and the ''Tonight'' show with Jack Paar. He left the network in the late 50's to become the executive producer of ''Maverick,'' the popular western series that starred James Garner. Mr. Werner also served briefly as the vice president for broadcasting at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency.
        Oversaw Successful Shows
        In 1962 NBC rehired Mr. Werner as the senior vice president for programming and talent. In the 10 years he was the chief programming executive at the network, NBC introduced such successful shows as ''Bonanza,'' ''Star Trek'' and ''Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.'' Mr. Werner also oversaw the introduction of series that featured black actors in prominent roles for the first time, including ''I Spy,'' in which Bill Cosby co-starred with Robert Culp, and ''Julia,'' in which Diahann Carroll starred as a nurse.
        In the early 1960's Mr. Werner served as president of the American Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
        He is survived by his wife, Martha; two daughters, Carole Teig of Newton, Mass., and Jill Kahan of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, John, of Brentwood, Calif.
