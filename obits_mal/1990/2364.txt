        James M. Foster, a member of the San Francisco Health Commission who was a prominent advocate of gay rights for more than 25 years, died Wednesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 55 yers old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, city officials said.
        Mr. Foster, a leader in efforts by gay organizations to achieve political influence, addressed the Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach in 1972. He was the first openly homosexual person to speak to a national party gathering. In the same year, while campaigning for the Democratic Presidential candidate, George F. McGovern, he organized the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club in San Francisco, which conducted registration drives among homosexuals.
        Mr. Foster, who was born in Manhasset, L.I., was discharged from the Army in 1959 because of his homosexuality. He later told an interviewer that this had prompted him to become an advocate.
        He became president of the Society for Individual Rights, which focused on the concerns of homosexual men and women.
        Mr. Foster's companion, Larry Ludwig, died in 1985. He is survived by a brother, Robert, of Los Angeles.
