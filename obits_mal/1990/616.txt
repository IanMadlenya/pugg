        Patrick W. O'Brien, a well-known figure in thoroughbred racing who had been involved in the sport in New York for more than 40 years, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home in Garden City, L.I. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. O'Brien, a native of Manhattan, rose from parking attendant to director of public relations, assistant racing secretary, supervisor of racing, steward and vice president of the New York Racing Association.
        In 1979, after Mr. O'Brien's resignation from the association, Red Smith, the New York Times sports columnist, called him ''the one man in the organization who could do and had done every job there was to do on the grounds, and who did it supremely well.''
        After leaving the association, Mr. O'Brien was appointed manager of program promotions for Philip Morris and he was active in promoting the Marlboro Cup, a major thoroughbred race.
        A member of the New York Turf Writers Association, he was also in his third term as secretary-treasurer for the Turf Publicists of America.
        Mr. O'Brien is survived by his wife, Jean; a son, William, of Putney, Vt.; and two daughters, Rachel O'Brien of Crosswicks, N.J., and Nora Triola of Pompano Beach, Fla.
