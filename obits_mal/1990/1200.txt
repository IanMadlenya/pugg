        Joe Wright, one of 10 people whose arrests and jailing for the firebombing of a grocery store became a rallying point for the civil rights movement, died on Wednesday at Hanover Memorial Hospital here. He was 37 years old.
        The hospital said Mr. Wright had died of sarcoidosis, a chronic disease involving the inflammation of any of various organs.
        Those people jailed, nine black men and one white woman who were known as the Wilmington 10, protested against what they said were racial injustices in New Hanover County schools in the early 1970's.
        The men were charged in 1971 with firebombing a grocery store and shooting at emergency personnel responding to the fire during racial violence. They were convicted the next year. The woman, Anne Turner, was convicted of being an accessory. They received sentences ranging from 23 to 34 years.
        Convictions Reversed
        In 1980, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the convictions, ruling unanimously that the defendants had been denied their right to a fair trial. North Carolina officials chose not to retry the case, but it was not until this year that Mr. Wright's conviction record was officially voided.
        In 1978, after questions were raised about the credibility of prosecution witnesses, Gov. James B. Hunt Jr. released Mr. Wright on parole. He was already on study release at North Carolina State University.
        In recent years Mr. Wright was the host of a radio talk show in Wilmington. He planned to enter law school in the fall.
        He is survived by his mother, Sarah; a sister, Dale, and three brothers, James Gibbs, William Gibbs and Thomas Wright, all of Wilmington.
