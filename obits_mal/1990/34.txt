        Dr. Basil Duke Henning, an educator, author and the resident master of Saybrook College at Yale University for 29 years, died Monday at Yale University Health Services Center in New Haven after a long illness. He was 79 years old and lived in New Haven.
        Dr. Henning had the longest tenure of any resident master in the history of Yale's residential college system. He was master of Saybrook, one of 12 undergraduate residential colleges, from 1946 to 1975. He was also the first American scholar selected as editor of The History of Parliament, a major British publishing project that includes the biographies of all the known members of the House of Commons. His three-volume work, ''The House of Commons 1160-1690'' took 20 years to complete. He was also the author or co-author of eight other books.
        Dr. Henning received his bachelor's degree at Yale in 1932 and his doctorate there in 1937. He joined the Yale faculty in 1935. He retired in 1978. In World War II, he was an intelligence officer in the Navy.
        He is survived by his wife, Alison; a daughter, Alison Morgan Stebbins of Corning, N.Y.; two sons, William, of Atlantic Highlands, N.J., and Cameron, of New Haven; a sister, Julia of Louisville, Ky., and four grandchildren.
