        Dr. Hsi Fan Hsu, a parasitologist who was emeritus professor of preventive medicine at the University of Iowa College of Medicine, died of heart disease on Friday. He was 84 years old and lived in Iowa City.
        Dr. Hsu was best known for his contributions to the control of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting many areas of the world.
        In 1952 he and his wife, Dr Shu Ying Li, found a nonhuman strain of the disease that could create immunity in humans and prevent infection. Later he developed a live vaccine against the disease by using an irradiated organism.
        In a career that spanned six decades, Dr. Hsu was a professor at China University in Beijing and Taiwan University in Taipei before going to Iowa.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Amoy University in China, a doctorate in zoology from Neuchatel University in Switzerland and a medical degree from the University of the Philippines.
        Dr. Hsu, a native of Huangyan, China, became a United States citizen in 1963.
        He and his wife published more than 150 scientific articles.
        He is survived by his wife; by a son, Tong-Wen Hsu of Huangyan, China, and two daughters, Tong-Mai Pieper of Beijing and Tong-Tai Lin of Balckburg, Va., and six grandchildren.
