        Born in Los Angeles in 1915, Mr. Ogawa spoke English as his first language and spent his career moving between the nations. As editor of The Japan Times, he was known as a voice against ties with China and in favor of strengthening military ties with the United States, at a time many editorial voices in the country disagreed.
        He joined The Japan Times after the war. In 1969, Mr. Ogawa became editor and was responsible for the paper's editorials until 1977.
        Mr. Ogawa is survived by his wife, Ayame, two daughters and a son.
