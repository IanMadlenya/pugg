        The cause of death was respiratory failure due to tuberculosis, said Terri Hinte, a spokeswoman for Fantasy Records.
        Creedence, a rock 'n' roll band with eight top-10 singles and six gold albums, broke up in 1972. Their hits included ''Proud Mary,'' ''Born on the Bayou'' and ''Bad Moon Rising.'' Mr. Fogerty, older brother of the band's lead singer, John Fogerty, had released several solo albums in addition to his work with the group.
