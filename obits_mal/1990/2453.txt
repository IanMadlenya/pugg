        Donald A. Wollheim, a writer, editor and publisher of science fiction, died yesterday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and lived in Rego Park, Queens.
        He died in his sleep, apparently of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Wollheim, who sold his first science-fiction piece to Astounding Stories magazine in 1933, was known as the creator of the science-fiction paperback. Shortly before World War II, he edited two of the early periodicals devoted entirely to science fiction, Stirring Science Stories and Cosmic Stories.
        He was editor in chief of Ace Books from 1943 to 1946 and held the same post with Avon Books from 1946 to 1951. For the last two decades his company, DAW Books Inc., the first publishing house devoted exclusively to science fiction, distributed its titles through Penguin U.S.A. and published an annual colection, "World's Best SF.".
        He wrote, among other books, "Adventures on Other Planets" (1955), "The Secret of the Ninth Planet" (1960) and "The Universe Makers" (1972).
        Mr. Wollheim, who was born in Manhattan and attended New York University, is survived by his wife, the former Elsie Balter; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Manhattan; a sister, Eleanor Grusky of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
