        Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder, a physicist and educator who contributed to the development of the atomic bomb, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Madison, Wis. He was 78 years old.
        Dr. Hirschfelder retired in 1981 as the Homer Adkins professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He had been affiliated with the university since 1937 and was the founder of the Theoretical Chemistry Institute there.
        From 1943 to 1946 he was a group leader in theoretical physics and ordnance at the Los Alamos Atomic Bomb Laboratory. He was also chief phenomenologist at the atomic bomb tests at Bikini.
        A graduate of Princeton University with Ph.D.'s in physics and chemistry, Dr. Hirschfelder was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and was the recipient of numerous awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1976. Earlier this year, the University of Wisconsin established the Hirschfelder Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry in his honor.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and a sister, Rosalie Akerlof of Walnut Creek, Calif.
