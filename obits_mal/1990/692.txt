        Jay Feigus, a leading contract bridge player, died of heart failure on Thursday at his home in Middletown N.J. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Feigus was a labor arbitrator for the American Fur Manufacturers Association, retiring in 1984 when he reached the age of 92.
        As a bridge player he made 61 consecutive appearances, the last in 1989 at the age of 96, in the Goldman Open Pair Championship. This is believed to be a world record for continued participation in any competitive bridge event.
        Mr. Feigus was a winner of the Vanderbilt Knockout Team Championship in 1948 and was second in the Spingold Knockout Teams in 1942. His New York successes included victories in the Reisinger Knockout Teams in 1947 and 1949. In later life he continued to play well at the local level, winning a Pennsylvania event in both 1988 and 1989.
        He is survived by a son, Warren, of Middletown, a daughter, Jeryl Zimmerman of Westfield, N.J.; 8 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
