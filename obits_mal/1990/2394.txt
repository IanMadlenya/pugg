        Charles Lehman, a former chairman of the American Society of Interior Designers, died on Tuesday at Delray Community Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 82 years old and lived in Delray Beach.
        He died of complications following surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Lehman, who was born in Manhattan and was a longtime resident of White Plains and Manhattan before moving to Florida, was a stockbroker before co-founding Swedlow-Lehman, an early manufacturer of plastics, in the 1930's.
        He and his wife, the former Camille Block, later formed an interior-design firm, The Lehmans and Associates, which planned back-office operations for many brokerage houses.
        Mr. Lehman was instrumental in establishing professional standards for interior designers and in creating a national accreditation program.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, John, of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Jeffrey, of Alexandria, Va., and two granddaughters.
