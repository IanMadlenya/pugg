        Joshua Torczyner, a diamond dealer who helped smuggle Jews out of Germany during World War II, died Sept. 26 at the Care West Hospital in Burlingame, Calif. He was 79 years old and lived in Burlingame.
        His nephew, Jacques Torczyner, said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Torczyner was born and educated in Vienna and was later involved with the Maccabis, an organization that encouraged resettlement of Jews in Palestine as the Nazis rose to power. He became a leader of the underground movement to help Jews escape the terrors of the German extermination camps by smuggling them out of the country. In 1940, he became chairman of the World Maccabi Committee in Geneva and two years later moved to the United States. He settled in California, where he was owner of the Pacific Diamond Company and was active in Jewish affairs.
        He is survived by his wife, Hansi; a son, Jerry, and a daughter, Judy Williams, both of San Francisco, and a sister, Esther Barouh of Manhattan.
