        Sir Ian Trethowan, the chairman of Thames Television and a former director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation, died Wednesday night at Cromwell Hospital in London. He was 68 years old.
        Sir Ian had fought a long battle with motor neurone disease, the company said. He died a few hours after Thames had announced that he was retiring because of poor health. The disease progressively wastes the muscles.
        Thames had announced earlier on Wednesday that Sir Ian would be succeeded as chairman next month by a movie producer, Lord Brabourne.
        Sir Ian, who began his career as a newspaper reporter in York in northern England, had been chairman of Thames since 1987. He held the posts of deputy editor and political editor of Independent Television News from 1958 to 1963 and then joined the BBC as a commentator.
        He was director general of the BBC from 1977 to 1982. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1980 in recognition of his services to television journalism.
        He is survived by his wife and three daughters.
