        Johannes Eerdmans, retired president of Jaguar Cars North America, died on Monday at the Eliot Center Hospital in Manchester, N.H. He was 85 years old and lived in Manchester.
        Mr. Eerdmans died of bone cancer, a spokeswoman for the company said.
        In 1953, at the request of Sir William Lyons, head of Jaguar in England, he started Jaguar Cars, Inc., in Manhattan, to import Jaguar and Daimler automobiles into the United States. The company's headquarters have since been moved to Mahwah, N.J. He continued to oversee Jaguar's United States activities here after the company merged with British Leyland in 1968. He retired in 1970.
        Mr. Eerdmans, a native of Bolsward, the Netherlands, was president of the British American Chamber of Commerce in Manhattan, and in 1966 was appointed Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lucy Kheriaty; four daughters from a former marriage, Lidi Woodthorpe of Woldingham, England, Elizabeth Carter of Wootten, England, Anita Schwarz of Rye, N.Y., and Tris Barker of Chislehurst, England; 15 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
