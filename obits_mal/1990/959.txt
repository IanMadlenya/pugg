        Peter C. Stocker, a Northern California real estate developer, was killed Saturday in a helicopter crash in Monterey County, Calif. He was 47 years old and lived in Sausalito, Calif.
        Mr. Stocker was a passenger in a helicopter that crashed after hitting a power line on takeoff from the 20,000-acre site of his latest development, Rancho San Carlos near Carmel Valley.
        He was co-founder with William Harlan of the Pacific Union Company, which has built more than $1 billion in projects since 1974.
        In 1985 he proposed building a privately financed ball park, hotel and shopping mall at Rincon Hill to keep the San Francisco Giants from leaving the city, but he was unable to reach agreement with the team's owners. The Giants nonetheless remained at Candlestick Park.
        Mr. Stocker is survived by his wife, the former Catherine Ann Weston; two daughters, Georgianne and Jacquelyn, and two sons, Erik and Peter, all of Sausalito; his mother, Ruth Barry of St. Helena, Calif., and a sister, Chris Free of San Francisco.
