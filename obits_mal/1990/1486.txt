After working as a laborer in steel mills, he joined Internaional Rolling Mill Products, a company controlled by his family, as a salesman. In 1949 he established Nikoh Tube, the name is Hokin spelled backward, to manufacture seamless tubing.
        Mr. Hokin was a trustee of Brandeis University and vice chairman of its board for many years. He was also a trustee of the Chicago Art Institute and the Chicago Medical School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Grace Cohen; a son, John, of Highland, Park, Ill.; three daughters, Janis Morris and Lori Kaufman of Chicago and Linda McCracken of Winnetka, Ill., and eight grandchildren.
