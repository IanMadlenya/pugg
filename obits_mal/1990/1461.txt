        Charles R. Keller, an emeritus professor of history at Williams College and a leader in secondary education, died on Wednesday at North Adams Regional Hospital in Massachusetts.
        He was 88 years old and lived in Williamstown, Mass. The college said Dr. Keller died of heart failure.
        In 1940 Dr. Keller helped to devise a program in American studies at Williams that combined history, literature and philosophy and became a model for similar programs at other liberal arts colleges.
        After retiring from Williams in 1958, he helped to found the College Entrance Examination Board's Advanced Placement Program, under which high school students earn college credits. He also became the first director of the John Hay Fellows Program in liberal arts for high school teachers.
        In 1971 he received an award from the National Association of Secondary School Principals ''for distinguished service to American secondary education at the national level.''
        Mr. Keller was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Yale College in 1922. He joined the Williams faculty in 1929 and earned his doctorate in history from Yale in 1934. At Williams he was later director of admissions and chairman of the history department.
        He was the author of ''The Second Great Awakening in Connecticut'' (1942, Oxford University Press).
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Ransayer, and a daughter, Anne Keller of Boston.
