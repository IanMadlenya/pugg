        John M. Martin, a former chairman of Hercules Inc., the chemical aerospace company, died Wednesday at his home in Wilmington, Del., after a short illness. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Martin, a 1934 graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology, spent 43 years with Hercules, originally the Hercules Powder Company of Wilmington.
        An expert in explosive and solid rocketry, he assisted in the construction of one of the first ammunition plants built for the Army in World War II. The plant was built at Radford, Va., in 1941. He later headed the Hercules department that first developed solid rocket motors for tactical and strategic systems, including the Minuteman, the first solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile.
        Mr. Martin was elected chairman of Hercules in 1970. He stepped down in 1977, but remained on the board until he retired in 1978.
        He was a director of a number of companies and corporations, including the Delaware Trust Company, the Electric Hose and Rubber Company, Lehman Corporation and the Greyhound Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Malone; two sons, John M. Jr. of Denver and James B. of Washington; five daughters, Mary Ellen Martin of Manhattan, Janet Jones of Chadds Ford, Pa., Josephine Bayard of Wilmington, Alice Whelihan of Washington and Elizabeth Flook of Plainfield, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
