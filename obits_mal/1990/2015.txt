       Sam Cook Digges, a CBS television and radio executive who in 1957 initiated ''Sunrise Semester,'' the pioneering television course for college credit, died on Monday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 74 years old and lived in Palm Beach.
        Mr. Digges was general manager of WCBS-TV, Channel 2, in New York when the station joined with New York University to offer a course in comparative literature five days a week from 6:30 to 7 A.M. Viewers who qualified with the university paid $75 for the course, which gave three points of academic credit for a total of 76 half-hour sessions.
        Dr. Floyd Zulli, an assistant professor of Romance languages at the university, taught the course and became an instant television personality. Critics predicted that the program would fail to attract viewers at dawn, but its announcement drew 7,500 applications before the start of the fall semester. No advertising was permitted, yet would-be sponsors, mostly bookstores, magazines and motion-picture producers, scheduled commercials in the time slots immediately before and after ''Sunrise Semester.''
        In the Merchant Marine
        Mr. Digges spent most of his professional career with CBS. He was a native of Columbia, Mo., and a graduate of the University of Missouri. He entered broadcasting in 1942 in the sales department of WMAL in Washington. After service in World War II as a radio officer in the Merchant Marine, he rose at CBS to become executive vice president of the radio division and its president from 1970 to 1981, when he retired.
        Among other awards, he received the Gold Medal of the International Radio and Television Society.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carol Ellis; a son, Sam Jr., of Birmingham, Ala., and a brother, Charles, of Columbia, Mo.
