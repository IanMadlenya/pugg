        Irving Price, an accountant, a builder and a real-estate broker in upstate New York for more than 35 years, died of a heart attack on Monday at John F. Kennedy Hospital in Lantana, Fla. He was 64 years old and lived in Hudson, N.Y.
        Mr. Price was the founder and president of Hudson Michael Realty Inc., a large real-estate concern with listings in Columbia, Dutchess, Rensselaer and Greene Counties. He founded the company in 1955 after working as an accountant in Hudson for four years.
        Mr. Price attracted hundreds of potential real-estate buyers from the New York metropolitan area in the 1970's by offering free lectures and tips on buying farms and undeveloped land in rural areas. He also wrote a book, ''Buying Country Property: Pitfalls and Pleasures,'' published by Harper and Row in 1972.
        He was a graduate of Ryder College in Trenton.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; two sons, Michael, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Stephen, of Brooklyn; a sister, Mildred Sapperstein of Trenton, and one grandchild.
