        Mr. Schriner, a left wing who had 201 goals and 204 assists in 484 N.H.L. games, began his career with the New York Americans, winning the Calder Trophy as the N.H.L. rookie of the year in 1934-35. He led the league in scoring in the next two seasons.
        In 1938-39, he was traded for four players to Toronto, which won Stanley Cups in 1942 and 1945. He retired after the 1945-46 season and went into business in the oil and gas industry in his hometown of Calgary, Alberta.
