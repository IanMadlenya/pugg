        After more than two decades as a television journalist, Mr. Newman joined NASA in 1986. He began working for ABC in the early 1960's as a news writer and became a producer of the evening news program in New York. Mr. Newman then moved to Washington, where he oversaw coverage of the capital for ABC's ''World News Tonight.'' He was later named executive producer of ABC's weekend news programs, a job to which he returned after a brief period in 1980 at the Cable News Network.
        Mr. Newman is survived by his wife, Carol; a daughter, Amanda, and two brothers, Edward, of Springfield, Va., and Steven, of Arlington, Va.
