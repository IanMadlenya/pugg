        Former President Yun Po Sun of South Korea died Wednesday night at the age of 92, his aides said today.
        They said that Mr. Yun died an hour after he was taken home from the Seoul National University Hospital, where he had been treated since March for diabetic conditions and high blood pressure.
        Mr. Yun, a graduate of Edinburgh University in Scotland, served as President from August 1960 to March 1962. He resigned following the military coup led by Maj. Gen. Park Chung Hee on May 16, 1961.
        Mr. Yun retired from politics in 1967 after twice losing presidential elections to Mr. Park.
        He was a strong critic of the Park Government and stood trial in 1979 for supporting dissident organizations. Later, he devoted his life to cultural activities.
        Mr. Yun is survived by his wife and two sons.
        He will be buried at the family cemetery outside Seoul, his aides said.
