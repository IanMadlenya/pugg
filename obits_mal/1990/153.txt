        Mr. Riddell, who retired in 1987, welcomed more than a million servicemen and their families to the city each year through the United Service Organizations. He provided them not only with hospitality at the familiar U.S.O. canteens staffed by hundreds of volunteers, but also with tickets to theater, film and sporting events and information about hotels and tours.
        He was also host to foreign military personnel and expanded the service to include a U.S.O. building at the New York World's Fair of 1964-65.
        Mr. Riddell began his U.S.O. career as director of a servicemen's club in 1954. Four years later he moved to the Times Square canteen. When the U.S.O. stopped staffing centers sponsored by agencies like Travelers' Aid and local religious and patriotic organizations, he became executive director of the General Douglas MacArthur Memorial U.S.O. center at Broadway and 45th Street.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Riddell served in World War II as a Navy underwater demolition frogman in the invasions of Normandy, southern France and Okinawa. He was recalled for duty in the Korean War. He resumed his studies at New York University after service in Korea and received a bachelor's degree in 1954.
        Mr. Riddell is survived by his wife of 42 years, the former Alice Robertson; a son, Jeffrey, of Margate, Fla., and two brothers, Donald, of Manhattan, and John, of Fort Worth.
