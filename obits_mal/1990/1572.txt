        Cazuza, a popular singer and composer in Brazil who emerged as a symbol in the country's fight against AIDS, died in his sleep today after a four-year struggle with the disease. He was 32 years old.
        The singer, whose given name was Agenor Miranda de Araujo Neto, began as a performer in small clubs. His career took off in 1984 when he joined a hard rock band, Barao Vermelho, Portuguese for the Red Baron. Then Cazuza left to record on his own. Mixing bossa nova music with 1960's British and American rock, he composed and recorded his first solo album in 1985, a record known for its biting, sarcastic tone and lyrics.
        Cazuza's music underwent a transformation after doctors confirmed in 1986 that he had AIDS. His songs gained a poetic quality, the lyrics focusing on his struggle to live.
