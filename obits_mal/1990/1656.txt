        A spokesman for the Diocese of Washington said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Smith was ordained in 1958 after graduating from the University of the South. He was chaplain at the university in 1962, when riots broke out after James H. Meredith became the first black student at the university.
        Mr. Smith then moved to the University of Maryland and retired as chaplain emeritus in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, the Rev. Elizabeth Platz; three children from his first marriage, a daughter, Virginia, of Silver Spring, Md., and two sons, Robert of Takoma Park, Md., and Andrew of Hyattsville, Md.; two sisters, Anne McClellen of Farmville, Va., and Caroline Vann of Huntsville, Ala., and three grandchildren.
