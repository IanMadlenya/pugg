        Abraham Goodman, a chemical engineer who helped to develop an inexpensive process for refining sugar from beets, died on Tuesday at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio. He was 80 years old and lived in San Antonio.
        Mr. Goodman died of complications following heart surgery, said his wife, the former Marion Mintz.
        Mr. Goodman joined DCA Food Industries in Manhattan in 1943. His work in making sugar from beets during World War II, when sugar supplies were limited, is credited with helping to transform the company from a modest business into a multimillion-dollar company.
        He developed a number of patents for the company and worked on the development of Accent, a flavor enhancer. He retired in 1979 and moved from Great Neck, L.I., to San Antonio, where he worked as a consultant for the company for six years.
        He was born in St. Louis, graduated from Ross-Hulman Institute of Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., and received a master's degree from Purdue University.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Rabbi Robert Goodman of Chicago; a daughter, Nancy Hoenig of San Antonio; two sisters, Sarah Gross of Memphis and Rosalie Shapiro of West Palm Beach, Fla., and five grandchildren.
