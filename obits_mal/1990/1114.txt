        Mason E. Hale, a botanist at the Smithsonian Institution who was known internationally, died of cancer on Monday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Hale, who worked for the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, published more than 150 studies, including five books on lichens.
        In one study, Mr. Hale's research found that lead accumulation in lichens on an island in the Potomac River showed a noticeable increase as a result of emissions from cars crossing a bridge over the river.
        In his 33 years at the Smithsonian, Mr. Hale built the lichen collection at the natural history museum into the world's third largest.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University and master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Wisconsin. He taught at the University of Wichita and the University of West Virginia before joining the museum.
        Survivors include his wife, Beatrice Hale; two daughters, a son, his mother and two brothers.
