        The Most Rev. Lawrence J. Kenney, Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services, died Thursday at the residence of John Cardinal O'Connor in Manhattan. He was 60 years old and lived in Washington.
        The archdiocese said he had been in New York for treatment of emphysema and lung cancer since June.
        Shortly before being consecrated in 1983, Bishop Kenney was appointed to the military services post by Pope John Paul II. Since 1973, he had been secretary to Terence Cardinal Cooke, who was then Archbishop of New York and Military Vicar. In 1985 the vicariate was separated from the New York Archdiocese and made independent under Archbishop Joseph T. Ryan, with headquarters in Silver Spring, Md.
        Bishop Kenney was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., attended Cathedral College and St. Joseph's Seminary, and received a master's degree in education from Iona College. He was ordained as a priest in 1956.
        He became assistant chancellor of the New York Archdiocese in 1969 and vice chancellor two years later. As Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese for Military Services he was Vicar General for Europe from 1984 to 1986, living in Bonn. He returned to Silver Spring to become Vicar General for Administration, a position he held until his death.
        He is survived by a brother, George, of New Rochelle, and two sisters, Madeline of New Rochelle and Sister Rose Kenney of Newburgh, N.Y.
