        He died of AIDS-related pneumonia, his sister Myrta said.
        Mr. Torres was one of a group of Hispanic designers - among them Betsy Gonzales, Julio Espada, and Mayda and Antonio Fidalgo - who came to prominence in the 1970's. His specialty was working in leather. At the time of his illness, he was doing custom-order design for private clients.
        He began his career as an associate with other young designers in the ''O'' Boutique on Park Avenue South. The boutique was later bought by Henri Bendel. He also did work for individual designers like Halston, Fernando Sanchez and Calvin Klein.
        Mr. Torres was born in Aibonito, P.R., and graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan in the late 1960's.
        He is survived by his parents, Pura and Ignacio Torres of Aibonito; two sisters, Myrta, of Manhattan, and Judy, of Sacramento, Calif., and two brothers, Orlando, of Tampa, Fla., and Louis, of Brooklyn.
