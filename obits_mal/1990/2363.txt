        Leland M. Goodrich, a Columbia University professor emeritus and a United Nations scholar, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91 years old.
        His son John said that Dr. Goodrich died of heart failure.
        Dr. Goodrich was a member of the International Secretariat of the United Nations Conference on International Organization in 1945. He was also the secretary of the Committee on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes, which drafted a section of the United Nations Charter. In 1960, he was appointed to the United Nations Committee on the Review of the Activities and Organization of the Secretariat, and later served as a consultant to the United Nations.
        Dr. Goodrich graduated from Bowdoin College in 1920 and received his master's degree in 1921 and his doctorate in 1925, both from Harvard. He taught at Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., in 1925 and 1926, and at Brown University in Providence, R.I., where from 1926 to 1950 he was an assistant professor, associate professor and professor and chairman of the department of political science.
        He joined the Columbia faculty in 1950 and had been the James T. Shotwell Professor Emeritus of International Relations since 1968.
        Besides his son John, of Weston, Conn., he is survived by another son, Richard, of Falls Church, Va., and four grandchildren.
