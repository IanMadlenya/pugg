        Benjamin F. Schwartz, a prosecutor with the Navy, died of heart failure on Sunday. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Schwartz was the prosecutor at the Manila trial of Gen. Masaharu Homma, who was convicted of organizing the 1942 death march on the Bataan Peninsula and then executed.
        American and Philippine defenders of Bataan fell to Japanese forces in May 1942. Under General Homma, the Japanese forced 60,000 prisoners to march 70 miles to prison camps. About 10,000 died on the march.
        After the trial, Mr. Schwartz entered private practice in Los Angeles. He later became a member of the Democratic Party's state committee and was a delegate to the 1956 and 1960 Presidential nominating conventions.
        Mr. Schwartz is survived by his wife, Lois; four children, and four grandchildren.
