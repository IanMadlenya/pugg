        Guichard Parris, a former officer of the National Urban League, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the league said.
        Mr. Parris, an adviser to two former league executive directors, Lester Granger and Whitney Young, joined the organization in 1944. In 1946, he started the league's public relations program. At his retirement in 1988, he had built it into a department employing 16 people who produced and distributed three million pieces of literature yearly, in addition to films for schools, television and civic organizations.
        With Lester Brooks, he put together a book, "Blacks in the City," in 1950, commemorating the league's 40th anniversary.
        He was born on the island of Guadeloupe in the French West Indies, and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. He graduated from Amherst College, magna cum laude, and received an M.A. from Columbia University. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Willie Ferron; two daughters, Mary Jacobs and Louise Manley, and a son Frederick, all of Manhattan; three grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
