        Eugene M. Hanofee, a judge in Sullivan County for 13 years, died on Friday at Community General Hospital in Harris, N.Y. He was 69 years old and lived in Liberty, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Judge Hanofee, a 1950 graduate of Albany Law School, was a Navy lieutenant in World War II. He was a partner in Rothblatt, Hanofee & Friedman in Liberty before being appointed to Family Court in 1977. At his death he was Sullivan County Court judge and surrogate. In 1989, he was censured by judicial oversight commissions for banning a Legal Aid lawyer from his courtroom and for seeking favored treatment from another judge.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and two daughters, Heather, of Boston, and Deirdre Friedland of Liberty.
