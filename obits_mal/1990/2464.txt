        Hyosuke Niwa, a former Japanese Labor Minister, died today of heart failure 12 days after he was stabbed by a mental patient, officials said. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Niwa had been in a coma in Aichi Medical University Hospital since he was stabbed, said a spokesman for the hospital in Aichi prefecture in central Japan. He was attacked on Oct. 21 while walking to a military ceremony at the Moriyama base in Nagoya, about 170 miles west of Tokyo. He was stabbed by a 47-year-old mental patient with a fruit knife, the police said.
        A 12-term member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Mr. Niwa was Labor Minister from December 1988 to June 1989 in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
        Mr. Niwa is survived by his wife, Yuriko; a son, Takamitsu, and three daughters, Atsuko, Setsuko and Yoshimi.
