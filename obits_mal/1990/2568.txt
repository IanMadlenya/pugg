        Alfred Dennis Sieminski, a former Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Hudson County, N.J., collapsed and died, apparently of a heart attack, while attending a Christmas party in McLean, Va., on Thursday, a family spokesman said. He was 79 years old and lived in Vienna, Va.
        Mr. Sieminski represented Bayonne and Jersey City for eight years. He was first elected in 1950, while on active duty as an Army major in Korea. He had volunteered for combat duty after winning the Democratic primary, leaving his wife to campaign for him.
        In 1952, he was one of the few Democrats to survive the landslide victory of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and in 1956 unofficial returns indicated that he had lost, but a recount of the absentee ballots gave him a 57-vote margin of victory. In 1958, the county's Democratic machine nominated another candidate, and Mr. Sieminski did not seek re-election.
        A 1934 graduate of Princeton University, Mr. Sieminski was also a World War II veteran and a laundry executive before his Congressional service. From 1962 to 1973 he worked at the Veterans Administration library.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie; two stepdaughters, Isabella Noyes of San Francisco and Christine Andreoni of Sydney, Australia; a stepson, Roman Mycielski of Warsaw, and five stepgrandchildren.
