        Born in the Ukraine in 1930, Mr. Raitzin studied voice at the Moscow Conservatory and became a leading tenor with the Bolshoi Opera. He also was a soloist with the Moscow Philharmonic and other European orchestras.
        Mr. Raitzin emigrated with his family to Israel in 1972, where he sang with the Tel Aviv Opera and the Israel Philharmonic under Zubin Mehta. Two years later, he made his United States concert debut at Town Hall. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1974 as Dimitri in Mussorgsky's ''Boris Godunov.''
        Mr. Raitzin subsequently sang many leading roles with the company, including King Gustav in Verdi's ''Ballo in Maschera,'' Enzo in Ponchielli's ''Gioconda'' and Walther in Wagner's ''Tannhauser.'' He appeared frequently as a soloist, and served as a cantor at the Sutton Place Synagogue and at Grossinger's Hotel near Liberty, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, Ludmila; a son and daughter, David and Marina, of New York; a brother, Reuven, and a sister, Rachel Golland, both of Tel Aviv.
