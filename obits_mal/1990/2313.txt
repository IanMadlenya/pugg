        Robert DeBragga, a marketing executive who was told in 1978 that he was terminally ill with cancer but who lobbied for the next 12 years for improved cancer therapy and more treatment options, died on Friday at his home in Stonington, Conn. He was 50 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, a family spokesman said.
        He was an outspoken advocate of nutritional and nontoxic methods of cancer treatment as alternatives to surgery, chemotherapy and radiation for some patients.
        He spoke at Congressional hearings, on radio and television and in debates with doctors at medical schools across the country. He also founded Project Cure, an advocacy group to promote the availability of options for cancer treatment.
        Mr. DeBragga served in the Navy from 1959 to 1967 and for the next 11 years was a marketing executive with the Raytheon Corporation, mainly in Washington.
        He is survived by his father, Joseph, of Stonington; a son, James, of Tempe, Ariz., and a daughter, Leigh Case of Mesa, Ariz.
