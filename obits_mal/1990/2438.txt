He was editor of New York History, the journal of the historical association, from 1947 to 1952. He was a founder of the New York Folklore Society and edited its quarterly from 1951 to 1958.
        Dr. Jones, a native of Albany, was a graduate of Hamilton College and received his doctorate from Columbia. He taught at Long Island University, Syracuse and the State College for Teachers in Albany before becoming director of the historical association.
        He was an original member of the New York State Council of the Arts in 1960 and served as chairman of the New York State Historic Trust. He received the Award of Distinction of the American Association of State and Local History in 1969.
        Dr. Jones is survived by his wife; two sons, Peter, of Ocean Township, N.J., and David, of Boca Raton, Fla.; a daughter, Carol Loomis of Winthrop, Mass., and five grandchildren.
