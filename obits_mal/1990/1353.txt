        Demian Acquavella, a dancer with Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane and Company and other troupes, died of AIDS on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 32 years old.
        An exuberant dancer and a popular figure in post-modernist dance in New York, Mr. Acquavella was the inspiration for Mr. Jones's 1989 work ''D-Man in the Waters,'' a celebration of Mr. Acquavella's determination to fight his illness. He was also an irrepressible dancegoer who attended performances after he was too ill to perform, sometimes loudly cheering the dancers from his seat.
        Mr. Acquavella was born in Brooklyn and trained with Marjorie Mussman, Cindi Green, Ernie Pagnano and Phil Black and also studied at the Nat Horne Musical Theater and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center. He danced with Lillo Way, Elisa Monte, Miss Mussmann, the Rush Dance company and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater before joining the Jones-Zane troupe, which he left in 1988.
        Mr. Acquavella's companion was Robert Altman.
        He is survived by his mother, Fanny Acquavella, of Brooklyn; his sisters, Anna, Rosemarie and Adeline Acquavella and Deborah Abraham, all of Brooklyn, and a brother, Anthony, of West Hollywood, Calif.
