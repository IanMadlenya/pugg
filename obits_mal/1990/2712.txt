        Harry K. Lennon, a former United States and United Nations official, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan. He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Lennon joined the Marshall Plan in 1950 after World War II service in military intelligence in Greenland and Europe. With the Marshall Plan, and later with the United States Agency for International Development, he held posts in Spain, Tunisia and Algeria before becoming a member of the United States Mission to the United Nations.
        He retired in 1972 and joined the United Nations Secretariat, where for five years he wrote speeches for the Secretary General and contributed to the world organization's publications on economic issues.
        Mr. Lennon, a native of Liege, Belgium, came to the United States in the 30's and was a graduate of Williams College. He was a newspaper reporter and a news magazine writer before his Government service.
        Since 1978 Mr. Lennon served as president of the Fourth World Movement-New York, an organization offering educational and support services for the poor in several New York neighborhoods.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Claudia Furneaux; a daughter, Eleanor, of Arzier, Switzerland; a son, Thomas, of Manhattan and two grandchildren.
