        Dr. Borgstrom, who taught for many years at Michigan State University, edited more than 30 books about the difficulties in providing food for a constantly expanding world population. The best known was ''The Hungry Planet'' (1965), which was published in eight languages.
        Dr. Borgstrom was born in Gustaf Adolf, a rural area in Sweden. He was a graduate of the University of Lund, where he was a professor. From 1941 to 1948 he was also head of the Institute of Plant Research and Food Storage in Nynashamn, and from 1948 to 1956 he was head of the Swedish Institute of Food Preservation Research in Goteborg.
        In 1956 Michigan State appointed Dr. Borgstrom a professor in the department of food science and human nutrition. He taught there for 25 years.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Greta Stromback; two sons, Lars and Sven, and a daughter, Anna Gerd Lindler, all of Goteborg.
