        Lawrence Zirinsky, a real-estate developer, died Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Zirinsky died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        His most recent major acquisition in the New York area was an 11-building office complex in the Princeton Forrestal Center in New Jersey. Earlier he had bought an empty Fedders plant in Edison, N.J., which is now being converted into a printing plant for The New York Times.
        In 1940, after graduation from law school, he and his cousin, Richard, built industrial and commercial projects in Brooklyn and Queens. In the late 1950's, the two men built and operated Gracie Square Hospital.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Zirinsky expanded into New Jersey and other areas, including commercial and residential projects in Morristown, Princeton, Edison and Basking Ridge.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from New York University and New York University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Gelsey; two daughters, Jane Zirinsky-Wayatt and Nancy, both of Manhattan; two sons, John, of Brooklyn, and Bill, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; four sisters, and a granddaughter.
