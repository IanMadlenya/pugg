        Paul Wiesenfeld, an American realist painter who specialized in portraits and finely detailed interiors, died on Saturday in a hospital in Munich, Germany. He was 48 years old and lived in Lanshut, a small town outside Munich.
        He died of cancer, his son, Daniel, said.
        Mr. Wiesenfeld was born in Los Angeles in 1942 and studied art at the Chouinard Art Institute there, the Kunst Academie in Munich and the University of Indiana. He had solo exhibitions at the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery in New York in 1973, 1976 and 1981, and is represented in several public collections in Germany and the United States, including one at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Karla, of Lanshut; a daughter, Alexandra, of Claremont, Calif., and his mother, May Wiesenfeld of Los Angeles.
