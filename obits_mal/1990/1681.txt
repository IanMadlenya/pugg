        Frank J. Viola, a former Postmaster of Bronx County, died yesterday at his home in New Fairfeld, Conn. He was 78 years old.
        The cause of death was cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Viola had been a postal employee for 30 years before his appointment as the Bronx Postmaster in 1966 by Senator Robert F. Kennedy, with the approval of President Lyndon B. Johnson.
        Mr. Viola was born in the Bronx and joined the postal system as a mail clerk in 1936. He later served eight years as a postal inspector before becoming assistant director of the engineering and facilities division of the New York Postal Region, directing the design and construction of more than 200 post offices in the Northeast. He retired as Postmaster in 1980 and moved to New Fairfield.
        He is survived by his wife, Angela; two sons, Frank, of Manhasset, L.I., and John, Postmaster of Hopewell Junction, N.Y.; five grandchildren; two sisters, Margaret D'Aci of New Fairfield and Anna Mendolia of the Bronx, and a brother, Santo, of Jackson Heights, Queens.
