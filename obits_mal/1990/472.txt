        In 1978, Mr. Livingston turned a half-century hobby into a full-time post at the educational organization at 270 Madison Avenue after selling clothing at R. H. Macy for more than 40 years. He was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of Townsend Harris High School.
        Surviving are a brother, the Rev. Edward Lieberman of Greenville, S.C.; three grandchildren, and five greatgrandchildren.
