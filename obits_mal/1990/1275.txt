In 1975 he became vice chairman and continued in that capacity after the corporate name changed to the Culbro Corporation in 1976. He was also president and then chairman of the general cigar division of the parent company. He retired in 1977.  Mr. Bondy is survived by his wife, the former Rae Parish; a son, Richard, of Wilton, Conn.; three daughters, Sally Herndon and Susan Willoughby of Los Angeles and Sandra Kelley of Scottsdale, Ariz., and seven grandchildren.
