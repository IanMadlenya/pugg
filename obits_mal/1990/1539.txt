        Herbert T. Jenkins Sr., the Atlanta Police Chief in the civil rights protests of the 1960's, died July 20 at his home in Atlanta. He was 83 years old.
        He died of a gunshot wound that was apparently self-inflicted, said his son, James Sage Jenkins.
        Chief Jenkins headed the Atlanta Police Department from 1947 to 1973. His stance of accommodating civil rights leaders rather than frustrating their efforts helped the city acquire a national image as a place of racial cooperation while other cities across the South were rocked with disorders.
        In a city that was the headquarters of civil rights organizations and segregationist elements, Chief Jenkins maintained peace in sit-ins at Atlanta lunch counters and provided police protection for ''freedom riders'' passing through the city. In 1967 he provided a police escort in a Ku Klux Klan march through one of the city's poorer black sections, thus preventing any clashes.
        Named to Johnson Panel
        In 1967 he was the only Southerner appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders.
        Chief Jenkins, a high school dropout, joined the police force in 1931. He rose to captain in 1945 and to chief in 1947. A year later he appointed the city's first eight black officers.
        He retired from the department in 1973 and for 10 years was a senior research associate of the the Center for Research in Social Change at Emory University in Atlanta, Besides his son James, of Atlanta, he is survived by another son, Herbert Jr., also of Atlanta; two brothers, Joe L. Jenkins of Atlanta and Ralph Jenkins of Canton, Ga.; two sisters, Elizabeth Perkerson and Martha Van Zant, both of Atlanta, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
