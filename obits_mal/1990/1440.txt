        Valentin Pikul, a popular historical novelist whose books focused on Russia's sweeping upheavals, has died, the news agency Tass reported today. He was 62 years old.
        The dispatch from Riga, Latvia, which quoted the Union of Latvian Writers, did not give the date or the cause of death.
        Mr. Pikul's novels often delved into topics that were long taboo, like the downfall of Russian royalty and the influence of the monk Grigory Rasputin over the family of Czar Nicholas II.
        He was accused of being anti-Semitic in some of his historical novels. In his 1979 novel ''At the Final Frontier,'' he tried to show that Rasputin was a tool of Zionists.
        Other literary critics accused him of taking a nonchalant attitude toward historical facts.
        ''The novel is the form of self-expression that I love,'' he once wrote. ''I love a novel with a multitude of characters and a furious succession of events.''
        Mr. Pikul served on a navy destroyer during World War II. His first novel, ''Ocean Patrol,'' published in 1954, was about the Soviet fleet. In 1961, he published ''Bayazet,'' about the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78. Other books included ''With Pen and Rapier'' (1970), ''Moon Sound'' (1973) and ''Word and Deed'' (1975).
