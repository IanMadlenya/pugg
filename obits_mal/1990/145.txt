        Archbishop Lewis Garnsworthy, an outspoken Anglican cleric who tangled with political leaders over school funding and once scolded his own church for being too ''respectable,'' died on Friday. He was 67 years old.
        A church spokesman said Archbishop Garnsworthy died in his sleep at Toronto Western Hospital, where he was admitted last weekend. No cause of death was given. In 1983, Archbishop Garnsworthy had a cancerous lung removed. Two years ago, he had abdominal surgery to remove a tumor.
        Elected Archbishop of Ontario in 1979, he later battled former Premier William Davis's plan to extend funds to Catholic schools separate from the public system. Archbishop Garnsworthy favored a publicly funded system.
        A week before the election, he compared Mr. Davis to Hitler for making the decision ''by decree.'' The Archbishop lost that fight, but some angry Conservatives later blamed him after the 1985 provincial election ended the party's 43-year dynasty in Ontario.
