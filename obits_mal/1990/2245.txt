        Dan Herr, board chairman of the Thomas More Association and publisher of The Critic, its cultural and literary magazine, died last Friday at Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago. He was 73 years old and lived in Chicago.
        A spokesman for the association said Mr. Herr died of emphysema.
        In 1940, Mr. Herr was the principal founder of the association, a nonprofit group seeking to foster Roman Catholic thought, education and reading. He also founded the Thomas More Book Club, the Thomas More Press and the annual Thomas More Medal for distinguished contributions to Catholic literature.
        He was born in Huron, Ohio, graduated from Fordham University and did postgraduate work at Columbia University. In World War II, he rose from private to major in the Army and was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action.
        After the war he was assistant to the editor of The Information Journal in Washington and was a reporter for The Daily News in New York before becoming president of The National Catholic Reporter in 1968. In 1970, he was named chairman of the board of Rosary College, a post he held until 1972.
