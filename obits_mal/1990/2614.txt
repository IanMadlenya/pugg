        Clifford F. Messinger, chairman of the Nature Conservancy and a former Wisconsin businessman, died last Wednesday at St. Luke's Medical Center in Milwaukee. He was 65 years old and lived in Vernon, Wis.
        Mr. Messinger was diagnosed last winter as having cancer but the cause of his death was not determined pending an autopsy, the conservancy said.
        He was born in Milwaukee and, graduated from Yale College. He left a family business in 1968, bought a small Milwaukee company, Oven Systems Inc., a maker of heat-treating equipment for industry, and built it into a $9 million-a-year business. He was named Wisconsin Small Businessman of the Year in 1979. He retired in 1988.
        Beginning in 1972, when he learned that mining companies were dumping waste into Lake Superior, Mr. Messinger became interested in conservation. In 1978 he was appointed chairman of Wisconsin's Natural Resources Board and in 1979 was named the state's Conservationist of the Year.
        He had served on the national board of governors of the Nature Conservancy since 1983 and last year became chairman of the conservancy, which acquires and preserves ecologically valuable land. He gave a 700-acre wilderness tract in Iron County, Wis., to the conservancy several years ago.
        In addition to his wife, Sarah Berg, Mr. Messinger is survived by two daughters, Sandra De Master of Brookfield, Wis., and Wendy Hollidge of Grosse Pointe, Mich.; a son, Jeffrey, of Dallas; three sisters, Polly Asmuth of Fox Point, Wis., Joanne Wight of Beaufort, S.C., and Margaret Renz of Darien, Conn., and five grandchildren.
