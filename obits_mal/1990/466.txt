        Mirza Abdul Baqi Beg, a professor of physics at Rockefeller University who helped verify that elementary particles like protons and neutrons are made up of smaller entities known as quarks, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 55 years old.
        Dr. Beg, who was born in India in 1934, received his master's degree from Karachi University in 1954 and his doctoral degree in theoretical physics from the University of Pittsburgh in 1958. He joined the faculty at Rockefeller in 1964 and was appointed a professor in 1968. His work focused on the structure of elementary particle interactions.
        Since 1965 Dr. Beg had been a consultant at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and from 1975 to 1978 he was on its High Energy Advisory Committee, which selected experiments to be conducted at the laboratory. As a visiting senior scientist he contributed to many other projects, including the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva. He was also a fellow of the American Physical Society and the New York Academy of Sciences.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancie.
