        Stanley Green, a historian of the American musical theater and films, died Wednesday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 67 years old and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        He died of complications from leukemia, said his daughter, Susan, of Manhattan.
        Mr. Green, a witty raconteur, wrote 10 books and scores of articles, lectured widely, and produced and wrote commentary for more than 100 record albums.
        His first book, "The World of Musical Comedy," now in its fourth edition, traces the development of works by Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, and many other composers.
        Among Mr. Green's other books are "Starring Fred Astaire" (1973); "Encyclopedia of the Musical Theater" (1976 and 1980), "Encyclopedia of the Musical Film" (1981), "Broadway Musicals Show by Show" (1985) and "Hollywood Musicals Year by Year," just published.
        Reviewers have hailed the books as readable, informative and scholarly, and they have praised Mr. Green's insights and affection. Hailing his 1984 book, "The Great Clowns of Broadway," as a noted survey of 10 irreplaceable performers, Walter Kerr wrote in The New Republic that "what is truly sad is that 25 years from now, no one will be able to write this sort of book."
        Mr. Green was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of Union College. In World War II, he served in the Signal Corps in the Pacific and Japan. Later, in addition to writing, editing and reviewing, he was often a consultant for other publications. In 1967, he wrote a play for the Manhattan School of Music, "A Salute to the American Musical Theater," that was performed twice at the White House.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Kay, and a son, Rudy, of Brooklyn.
