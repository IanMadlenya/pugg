        Larry Lee, an award-winning television and radio producer and co-author of biographies of the writers Jack Kerouac and William Saroyan, died of AIDS on Thursday at Children's Hospital in San Francisco. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Lee, who was the executive producer of KRON-TV's ''Target 4 Investigative Team,'' received the Peabody and Dupont awards for his documentary ''Climate of Death,'' about the war in El Salvador. In 1985, he produced the first television documentary on AIDS, ''In the Midst of Life,'' which gained wide critical acclaim. In 1986, he was awarded an Emmy for ''Shattered Dreams,'' a documentary on a Belgian boys' home that sheltered Jewish children during the Holocaust.
        Mr. Lee was born in Fort Worth. He graduated from the University of Texas and began his career in journalism as a copyboy for The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He later covered the civil rights movement for United Press International and was the founding manager of KPFT-FM radio, a Pacifica Foundation station in Houston.
        In 1971, Mr. Lee settled in the Bay Area, where he wrote extensively for many publications, including The Village Voice and Rolling Stone. He and Barry Gifford wrote ''Jack's Book,'' an oral history of Jack Kerouac, and ''Saroyan,'' a biography.
        He is survived by his mother, Anita Lee, and brother, David Lee, both of Fort Worth.
