        John Edward Davis, former Federal director of Civil Defense, national commander of the American Legion and a two-term Governor of North Dakota, died Saturday at his winter home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 77 years old.
        Reporting the death of Mr. Davis from his home in Bismarck, N.D., The Associated Press quoted his son, John E. Jr., as saying that his father had been in declining health for some time but that he did not know the cause of death.
        Mr. Davis became the head of Civil Defense in 1969 and served in that post until 1977.
        Mr. Davis, a Republican, served as Governor from 1956 to 1960. In 1960, in a special election for a seat in the United States Senate, he was narrowly defeated by Quentin Burdick, a Democrat.
        In 1966, he was elected as the Legion's national commander for the 1967-68 term.
        Mr. Davis, who graduated from the University of North Dakota in 1935, entered the Army as a lieutenant in 1941 and left as a lieutenant colonel in 1945 with a Silver Star and other decorations earned as a battalion commander with the 35th Infantry Division in Europe.
        Mr. Davis was divorced from his first wife, Pauline. Besides his son John E. Jr., he is survived by his second wife, the former Marilyn R. Westlie; another son, Richard J. of Minnesota; a brother, David, of Bismarck, and several grandchildren.
