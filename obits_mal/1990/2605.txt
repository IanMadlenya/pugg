        James L. Sturm, an authority on stained glass and a professor of history at the College of Staten Island, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 50 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, a spokesman for the college said.
        Professor Sturm wrote "Stained Glass from Medieval Times to the Present: Treasures to Be Seen in New York." When it was published in 1982, it was praised by Paul Goldberger, then the New York Times's architecture critic, for the "grace and clarity" with which it explained the technical aspects of stained glass and as "an impressive piece of scholarship."
        He had been on the faculty of the college since 1968, when it was known as Richmond College.
        His companion was Dennis Serriane. He is survived by his father, James L. Sturm of Peoria, Ill., and two sisters, Christine Blancaflor of Peoria and Karna Slifer of San Francisco.
