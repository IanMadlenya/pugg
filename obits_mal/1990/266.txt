        Earl Gagosian, founder of the Royal Inns of America and the Continental Inns, both hotel chains in the Southwest, died of a heart attack on Friday. He was 61 years old and lived in LaJolla, Calif.
        Mr. Gagosian began in the hotel business as a 23-year-old construction supervisor with TraveLodge. He advanced to vice president before leaving the company in 1965.
        He then founded the Royal Inns of America, serving as president and chairman of the board for seven years while the company built 69 hotels.
        In 1973 Royal Inns had financial difficulties, and Mr. Gagosian was forced out of his leading role. The company declared bankruptcy several years later.
        In 1980 he founded Continental Inns Inc. with his son Wayne Earl. That company has built a chain of hotels in the Southwest, which in 1987 became part of Howard Johnson Franchise Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Prime Motor Inns, Inc.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Gagosian is survived by a daughter, Janice K. Bezlan, three sisters, three brothers and four grandchildren.
