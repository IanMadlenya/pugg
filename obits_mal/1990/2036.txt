       B. Rodney Marriott, a former associate artistic director of the Circle Repertory Company, died Sunday in the Woodlands Nursing Home in Calcutta, India. He was 52 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The theater group said the American Consulate in Calcutta attributed his death to septic shock caused by kidney failure and to heart failure.
        Mr. Marriott was in Calcutta to direct ''The Rainmaker'' for Arts America, a cultural program of the United States Information Agency. He had staged productions in England, Liberia, Japan and China and in regional theater in the United States.
        From 1984 to 1989 Mr. Marriott was associate artistic director at the Circle Rep. He had also been the company's literary manager. Recently, he taught stagecraft at Fordham University and the New School for Social Research.
        He is survived by his mother, Sara Marriott, of Brazil.
