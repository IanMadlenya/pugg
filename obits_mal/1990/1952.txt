        The Rev. Laszlo Ladany, a Hungarian-born Jesuit who ran a journal on China from a student hostel at the University of Hong Kong, died on Sunday of lung cancer. He was 76 years old.
        With China's revolution of 1949, Father Ladany and other Jesuits were forced to flee China. Father Ladany arrived in the British colony of Hong Kong and began publishing China News Analysis in 1953. It became his life work and made him well known on university campuses and in embassies on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
        His gleanings from Chinese broadcasts opened a window on China, which was off-limits to most Western journalists at the time.
