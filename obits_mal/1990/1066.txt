        Don Wallance, a designer of furniture, flatware and cooking utensils, died Friday of congestive heart failure at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 80 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson.
        Mr. Wallance's furniture designs included the original cantilever seats in Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center, which were mounted on horizontal tubular beams instead of legs to make moving and cleaning easier. The critic Winthrop Sargent hailed the seats as ''infinitely comfortable.''
        Mr. Wallance was a native of Queens, and a graduate of New York University and the Design Laboratory, where he studied Bauhaus theory, which combines arts and crafts. He served in the Army Air Corps in Alaska in World War II, was the author of a 1956 book, ''Shaping America's Products,'' and was the founder and chairman of the Croton Visual Environmental Board from 1980 to 1989.
        His wife, the former Shula Cohen, died in 1979. Surviving are two sons, Gregory, of Larchmont, N.Y., and David, of Brooklyn; a sister, Beatrice Feder, of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
