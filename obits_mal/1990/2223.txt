        Thomas M. Beggs, director of the Smithsonian Institution's National Collection of Fine Arts from 1948 to 1964, died on Thursday at his home in McLean, Va.. He was 91 years old.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, his family said.
        As administrator of the Smithsonian's permanent collection of American paintings, sculpture and decorative art, Mr. Beggs sought to expose the collection to as wide a public as possible. He organized more than 50 traveling exhibitions and arranged for artworks that had been in storage to be displayed in the Federal offices, including the Oval Office in the White House.
        Mr. Beggs was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Pratt Institute. After studying at the Art Students League in New York City, he went to Yale, where he earned a bachelor of fine arts degree, and to the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, from which he received a diploma.
        He taught at Pomona College from 1926 to 1947. He was chairman of its art department when he left to become assistant director of the National Collection. He became director the following year.
        Mr. Beggs, a painter of murals, received the gold medal of the American Artists Professional League in 1953.
        He is survived by a daughter, Patricia Westberg, and a son, Malcolm, both of McLean; a brother, Harry, of Weston, Ga.; a sister, Alice Powers of Minneapolis, and three grandchildren.
