        Francesco Folonari, the innovative general manager of one of Italy's most prestigious Chianti wineries, died on Monday, the Italian press reported today. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Folonari died of complications after heart surgery, the reports said.
        Born in 1929, Mr. Folonari entered the family winery Chianti Ruffino S.p.A. after the death of his father in 1951. He had served as general manager of the winery since 1966.
        In 1954, he introduced screwtop wine bottles with a deposit added to the price for reuse of the bottles. Both were firsts for the Italian wine market.
        Asked about his company's policy of innovation, he was reported to have said, ''One must continually keep one's mentality up to date, even for daily table wine.''
        Mr. Folonari is survived by his wife, Luisa. The couple had no children.
