        Ralph Brown, a tap dancer on Broadway and in films, died Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Brown died of congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        His most recent Broadway engagement was in the musical "Black and Blue," which he left this year because of failing health.
        Born in Indianapolis, Mr. Brown moved to New York City in 1931 after winning amateur talent contests in his hometown. He became a regular at the Hoofers Club in Harlem, picking up steps from tap dancers like Eddie Rector and John Bubbles and developing his own style.
        In 1934 he got a job dancing at the Cotton Club, where he met the band leader Cab Calloway, with whom he traveled for several decades. He also appeared with Charlie Parker, Cootie Williams and Duke Ellington. In recent years he toured with the cast of "The Original Hoofers."
        There are no immediate survivors.
