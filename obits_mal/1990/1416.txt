        Dr. George Wythe, a former Latin American specialist and section chief in the Department of Commerce, died on June 23 at a hospital in Vienna, where he had lived in retirement. He was 96 years old.
        A family friend said he died after being stricken with a blood clot of the brain and complications.
        Dr. Wythe retired in 1960 after many years as director of the American Republics division of the Commerce Department in Washington. He then lectured on economics and Latin American industrial development at George Washington, Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities until moving to Austria in 1972.
        A descendant of George Wythe, the colonial patriot, jurist and signer of the Declaration of Independence from Virginia, he was born in Weatherford, Tex., and graduated from the University of Texas in 1914. He earned his doctorate in economics from George Washington University in 1938.
        During World War I, Mr. Wythe joined the 90th Infantry Division of the American Expeditionary Forces. He was wounded in combat in France and rose to the rank of major.
        He then joined the Commerce Department and was posted abroad as trade representative in Turkey and Mexico and as Commercial Attache-at-large in Europe. In the early 1930's, he was called to Washington as an expert on Latin American commerce and industry and over the next several years came to head the section responsible for that region.
        Dr. Wythe is survived by his wife, the former Zoe Mostert.
