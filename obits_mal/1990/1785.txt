        He died after failing to recover from a heart attack he suffered on June 5, said Dr. Donald Kornfeld, dean of the college's faculty of medicine.
        Dr. Symonds, who was also attending surgeon of plastic surgery at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, established the first burn unit at Harlem Hospital in 1970 when he was director of its plastic surgery service. He also maintained a private practice at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center.
        He was born in Fayetteville, N.C., and graduated from Princeton University. He received his medical degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1951.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Higbee; two sons, Francis, of Atlanta, and Stephen, of Edgewater, N.J.; two daughters, Beverly Benveniste of Valley Cottage, N.Y., and Jennifer, of Sayreville, N.J., and a granddaughter.
