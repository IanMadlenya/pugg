        Harold E. Beste, an electronics researcher and engineer who helped develop television components and weapons systems, died on Friday at his home in Verona, N.J. He was 81 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Beste, who held almost 50 patents, supervised the design and creation of underwater and high-altitude reconnaisance systems, commercial television cameras, flight simulators and communications units for the space shuttle.
        In the 40's and 50's, he designed television cameras and other equipment for the Allen B. DuMont Laboratories. He also worked on radar guidance and low-light television.
        From 1960 until retiring last fall, Mr. Beste devoted many of his efforts to reconnaisance, coding, communications and other systems for the Navy and Air Force. As chief electronics engineer of Vare Industries, he worked on underwater control and guidance systems, high-altitude reconnaisance imaging and encryption.
        Mr. Beste oversaw the development of underwater laser imaging at the Kollsman Instrument Corporation and pilot-training simulators at Dalto Electronics in the late 60's and early 70's.
        Mr. Beste worked on submarine-communications devices at the Conrac Corporation, which he joined in 1972 and which is now the avionics division of Smiths Industries of Florham Park, N.J. He helped develop video scoreboards for stadiums, as well as a communications unit and precision timers for the space shuttle.
        Mr. Beste was born in Manhattan. He studied at the New Jersey College of Engineering and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Marie Calderaro; a son, Brian, of Verona, and a daughter, Bonne Bejan of Manhattan.
