        He was born on Oct. 23, 1908, in St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, and graduated from Moscow University in 1928. He worked at the Leningrad Optical Institute and the Lebedev Institute of Physics in Moscow, and in 1944 he was appointed a professor at Moscow University. In 1957, he was named head of the university physics laboratory.
        Dr. Frank shared the Nobel Prize in 1958 with two other Soviet physicists, Dr. Pavel A. Cherenkov and Dr. Igor Y. Tamm. He also received the Soviet Union's Lenin Prize.
        Dr. Frank was a specialist in physical optics and nuclear physics who along with Dr. Tamm developed a theory on neutron physics.
