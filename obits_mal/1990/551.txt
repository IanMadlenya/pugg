        Dr. George Yohe Lesher, a scientist who discovered drugs used in treating heart disease, drowned in a canoeing accident on Saturday at Normans Kill in Guilderland, N.Y. He was 64 years old and lived in East Greenbush, N.Y.
        Dr. Lesher was a researcher, an inventor and an institute fellow in the Sterling Research Group, an Albany-based division of the Sterling Drug Company. He had held the position since 1982. Dr. Lesher joined Sterling's research institute in 1952 in the medical chemistry department and was appointed a group leader in 1957.
        Within a few months, he had identified a new class of antibacterial agents and later discovered another class of therapeutic agents that are used widely in the treatment of heart disease. One drug, Amrinone, helps people with a failing heart beat by causing the heart to pump more blood.
        Dr. Lesher, a Ph.D. graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, wrote more than 40 scientific papers and held more than 160 patents.
        He is survived by his wife, Louise; a son, Richard, of Chicago; a daughter, Roberta, of East Greenbush, and his parents, George and Edna Lesher of Chicago.
