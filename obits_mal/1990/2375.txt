        He died of heart failure, a spokeswoman for the family said.

These included "Legends of Israel," "Israel: The Story of a Miracle" and a series of volumes of "Torah Thoughts," published by Jonathan David Press.
        He was also a columnist for The Jewish Press for about 30 years. He served as secretary of the Pioneer Milk Fund and as vice president of Children's Salvation, fund-raising organizations for Jewish relief.
        He is survived by his wife, Devora; a son, Jackie, of Monsey, N.Y.; a daughter, Chave Heftler of Jerusalem; two brothers, Sidney, of Brooklyn and Joseph, of Miami; two sisters, Elaine Klughaupt of Rockaway Park, Queens, and Florence Solomon of West Palm Beach, Fla; 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
