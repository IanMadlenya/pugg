        Matthew Ward, the winner of the 1989 PEN-Book-of-the-Month Club prize for the first translation by an American of Albert Camus's ''The Stranger,'' died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. He was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        His death resulted from AIDS, said Steven Madoff, the executive editor of Art News and executor of Mr. Ward's estate.
        In reviewing Mr. Ward's recent work, The Chicago Sun-Times said, '' 'The Stranger' is now a different and better novel for its American readers; it is now our classic as well as France's.''
        Mr. Ward also earned praise for his translations of works by Colette, Jean Giraudoux and Roland Barthes. He was a native of Denver, a graduate of Stanford University and Columbia, a Fulbright Fellow at University College in Dublin and a former teacher at the Fieldston School in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        Surviving are his parents, Andrew and Carmen Ward of Denver, two sisters and six brothers.
