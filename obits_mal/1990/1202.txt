        Rabbi Joseph Asher, the former senior rabbi of San Francisco's largest synagogue, Temple Emanu-El, died of cancer last Tuesday. He was 69 years old.
        Rabbi Asher had served as Temple Emanu-El's senior rabbi from 1967 until 1986. Before that, he served congregations in Florida, Alabama and North Carolina.
        A native of Germany, Rabbi Asher was a descendant in a line of rabbis going back seven generations. His family fled Germany in 1936.
        In 1966, at Rabbi Asher's urging, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, a leading Reform Jewish group, sponsored a project in which rabbis went to West Germany to teach Germans about Jews. The organization said at the time that the purpose of the project was to overcome ''a virtual vacuum'' on a full understanding about Judaism.
        The idea had come to Rabbi Asher during a return visit to Germany in 1964 when he realized, he said, that German educational institutions were trying to instill in young Germans ''a sense of atonement'' about the Holocaust.''
        ''There is an honest attempt to recount the tragedy of European Jewry,'' he said, but that attempt constituted ''a negative and incomplete approach.''
        Last year, West Germany awarded Rabbi Asher the Grand Cross of Merit for service to humanity.
