       Marshall Bridges, a relief pitcher for four major league teams, died of cancer on Monday at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He was 59 years old.
        Over seven major league seasons beginning in 1959, he had 23 victories, 15 losses, 25 saves and a 3.75 earned run average.
        Mr. Bridges, who was known as Sheriff, broke into the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals and also pitched for the Cincinnati Reds, the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators before returning to the minor leagues after the 1965 season. He began his pro career with the Memphis Red Sox in the old Negro leagues.
        His best season was 1962, when he was 8-4 with 18 saves for the World Series champion Yankees. In that year he allowed the first World Series grand slam home run by a National League player, hit by Chuck Hiller of the San Francisco Giants in Game 4.
