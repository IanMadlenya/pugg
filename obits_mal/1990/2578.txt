        Edwin Lester, founder and longtime general director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera and its affiliate, the San Francisco Civic Light Opera, died on Thursday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 95 years old.
        He died of cardiac arrest after a long illness, said an associate, Tim Choy.
        Mr. Lester, who founded the Los Angeles company in 1938 and its San Francisco branch two years later, also produced or co-produced several of their shows that went on to Broadway. These included "Song of Norway" (1944), "Magdalena" (1948), "Kismet" (1953), "Peter Pan" (1954) and "Gigi" (1973). He also took Broadway shows to California, often with their original casts.
        He retired as general director and producer of the companies in 1976 but continued on their boards. The San Franciso company ceased operations in 1980.
        Mr. Lester was born in New York City and had brief careers as a child singer and as a pianist. In the late 1920's he staged spectacle prologues for Sid Grauman at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, then became a manager of performers. In 1935, he started producing light-opera festivals to provide job opportunities for singers, which led to the Civic Light Opera.
        There are no immediate survivors.
