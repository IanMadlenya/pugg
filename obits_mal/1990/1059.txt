        Vic Tayback, a film, television and theater actor best known for playing Mel the diner owner in the television series ''Alice,'' died of a heart attack yesterday at his home in Glendale, Calif. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Tayback appeared in dozens of films and stage productions, but the role of his career was Mel, which he played from 1976 to 1985. It brought him two Golden Globe Awards and an Emmy Award nomination for best supporting actor.
        Mr. Tayback was born in Brooklyn and served in the Navy before beginning his acting career at the age of 25. He appeared on the stage frequently in California, appearing in ''Death of a Salesman'' and ''Brighton Beach Memoirs.'' With Richard Chamberlain and Sally Kellerman, he founded a Los Angeles theater troupe called the Company of Angels.
        Among his many movie credits are ''Papillon,'' ''Bullitt,'' ''The Cheap Detective'' and ''Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,'' which was the basis for the television series. After making his television debut in 1958, he appeared in scores of shows, including ''Star Trek,'' ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and ''Bonanza.''
        Mr. Tayback is survived by his wife, Sheila, and son, Christopher, both of Glendale; his mother, Helen, of Los Angeles; a sister, Emily, of Glendale, and a brother, Joe, of Los Angeles.
