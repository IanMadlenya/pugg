        In 1918, Mr. Izac was captured by the Germans after his ship was torpedoed. He learned important information about German submarine movements and managed to escape, drawing fire as he helped others flee. He subsisted on raw vegetables in the countryside until he swam to safety across the Rhine River.
        Awarded a Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for bravery, Mr. Izac served as a Democratic Congressman from 1936 to 1947. In later years, he raised beef cattle and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        Mr. Izac's wife, Agnes Cabell Izac, died in 1975. He is survived by five children, Cabell Berge of Arlington, Va., Edouard Jr., of Santa Ana, Calif., Charles D., of San Clemente, Calif., Suzanne Quinlan of Fairfax and Comdr. Carrol A. Izac, a Navy chaplain based in Norfolk, Va.; 19 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.
