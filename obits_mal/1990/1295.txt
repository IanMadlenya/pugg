He was 89 years old and lived in Chicago. The cause of death was not disclosed.  Mr. Spiegel joined the family-owned mail order company after graduating from Dartmouth College in 1922. He became general manager in 1932 and president in 1939.
        Under his leadership, the company expanded into scores of retail outlets in the mid-1940's, but in the mid-1950's it retrenched and divested itself of many stores. Mr. Spiegel was named chairman and chief executive in 1954 and retired in 1970.
        He owned several race horses that competed under the colors of Alamode Farms. He was a director of the Arlington Park and Washington Park race tracks and was also president of the Mail Order Association of America for many years.
        He is survived by his wife, Carolyn; a daughter, Barbara Linhart of Manhattan; a son, Edward of Winnetka, Ill.; a brother, Dr. John Spiegel of Cambridge, Mass., and two grandchildren.
