        Arthur L. Amundsen, former director of operations for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, died on Thursday at a friend's home, where he was staying as part of the Good Samaritan Hospice Program in Bay Shore, L.I. He was 85 years old and lived in Valley Stream, L.I.
        Mr. Amundsen died of lung cancer, said his daughter-in-law, Lynn Amundsen.
        He was hired by the A.S.P.C.A. in 1932 to take charge of horse watering, and remained until 1972, when he retired as director of operations.
        Mr. Amundsen created one of the first animal-care centers at Kennedy International Airport, which was used as a model for subsequent operations. He was a board member of Bide-a-Wee Home Association in Manhattan.
        He is survived by a daughter, Karen, of Boston; a son, Arnold, of Setauket, L.I., and two grandchildren.
