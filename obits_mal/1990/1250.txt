        A family spokesman said Professor Johnson died after a long illness.
        Professor Johnson's specialty was 19th- and 20th-century English literature. Among his works were ''W. H. Auden'' (Continuum, 1990), a biography of the English poet; ''Sons and Fathers: The Generation Link in Literature'' (Peter Lang, 1985), and ''Sex and Marriage in Victorian Poetry'' (Cornell University Press, 1975).
        At his death, he was working on an edition of early unpublished poems by Auden, a personal friend, which he had given to the Bird Collection of the New York Public Library.
        Professor Johnson, who was born in Kansas City, Mo., graduated from Ohio State University, where he also received a doctorate. He joined Hunter's faculty in 1962 and was assistant dean for graduate studies from 1966 to 1969. He retired last February. From 1952 to 1962 he taught at Smith College.
        He is survived by a brother, Roland, of Independence, Mo.
