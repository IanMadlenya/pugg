        Otha D. Wearin, a former Congressman who became a writer of westerns and was elected to the Cowboy Hall of Fame, died of heart disease on Tuesday at a nursing home here. He was 87 years old.
        A Democrat, he won a seat in the Iowa Legislature at 25. In 1932 he was elected to the House of Representatives in a heavily Republican district. In 1938, despite the support of the White House, which was seeking to ''purge'' anti-New Deal Democrats, he was defeated in a primary by Senator Guy M. Gillette.
        His books include ''Before the Colors Fade,'' ''Along Our Country Road,'' ''I Remember Yesteryear'' and ''Grass Grown Trails.'' His writings were cited in his 1985 induction into the Cowboy Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by his wife, Lola; two daughters and four grandchildren.
