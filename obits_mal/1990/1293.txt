        Mr. Elstad spent nearly all of his career in education of the deaf, although he was not deaf himself. He was a graduate of St. Olaf College and received a master's degree from Gallaudet, the only institution of higher education devoted to the deaf.
        After teaching at Gallaudet in the early 1920's, he became principal of the Kendall School in Washington, an elementary and secondary school for the deaf. He had also been assistant principal at schools in New York City and Fairbault, Minn.
        Mr. Elstad is survived by his wife, the former Nora Larsen; a daughter, Margaret Hegstrom of Savannah, Ga., and two grandsons.
