        Michael Goldsmith, an Associated Press foreign correspondent for 45 years, died today at a hospital in southern France. He was 68 years old.
        His doctor at the Grasse hospital said the cause of death was a stomach hemorrhage. Mr. Goldsmith suffered a stroke Oct. 1 and was hospitalized again on Sunday after a relapse.
        He joined The Associated Press in 1945 and was based in Geneva and Paris for most of his career, but traveled widely on assignment, reporting on post-independence turmoil in the Congo, Algeria and Yemen; the building of the Berlin wall; the Vietnam War and the Paris peace talks that ended the United States involvement there; the 1973 Middle East war, and the Afghan civil war.
        Mr. Goldsmith was on assignment in the Central African Republic in 1977, covering the ceremony in which Jean-Bedel Bokassa proclaimed himself emperor, when the authorities arrested him and accused him of being a spy. He was beaten unconscious by Mr. Bokassa, two of his sons and a group of aides, and imprisoned for a month. Despite this incident, Goldsmith kept in touch with the deposed emperor while he lived in exile in France.
        Mr. Goldsmith was born in Vienna in 1921 to British parents. He was educated at London University and served as an intelligence officer in the British Army in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Roxanne; their son, Andrew, 15; and two sons and a daughter from previous marriages: Martin, Michael and Mary.
