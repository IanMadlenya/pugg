        Ned B. Ball, a former president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, died Saturday at a hospital in Portland, Ore. He was 81 years old.
        His wife, Grace, said he suffered a heart attack.
        Mr. Ball, who was born in Raleigh, N.C., dropped out of North Carolina State University in 1928 and went to work marking a chalkboard for a cotton-brokerage firm started by his grandfather. The firm was absorbed by another brokerage and eventually became part of Merrill Lynch.
        Mr. Ball became a partner in the firm, managed its Portland office and directed its international expansion in the 1960's. In 1970 he was named president and served until 1975, when he retired at the age of 65.
        Mr. Ball left Manhattan after his retirement and returned to Portland. He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Lyn White of Seattle, and six grandchildren.
