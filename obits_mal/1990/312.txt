        Allen Rivkin, a screenwriter and a founder of the Screenwriters Guild, died of kidney failure on Saturday at his home in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Rivkin, who was in Hollywood in the early years of talking pictures, wrote more than two dozen screenplays from the mid-1930's to the early 60's. His best-known film was a World War II feature, ''Joe Smith, American,'' which starred Robert Young and Marsha Hunt.
        Mr. Rivkin and his wife, Laura Kerr, collaborated on the screenplay for ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' the 1947 film for which Loretta Young won her Academy Award as best actress.
        Other Rivkin films included ''Dancing Lady,'' which starred Joan Crawford; ''This Is My Affair,'' with Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck; ''Let Us Live,'' with Maureen O'Sullivan and Henry Fonda; ''Till the End of Time,'' with Dorothy McGuire, and ''Prisoner of War,'' with Ronald Reagan.
        Mr. Rivkin and his wife also collaborated on two nonfiction books about the film industry: ''Hello Hollywood'' and ''I Wasn't Born Yesterday.''
        Mr. Rivkin was one of the first board members of the Screenwriters Guild, later the Writers Guild of America. In 1963 he left screenwriting and became director of publicity for the Writers Guild, and he founded and edited its newsletter.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Rivkin is survived by his daughter, Caroline Veiller Saltzman of West Los Angeles, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
