        Born in New York City in 1910, Mr. Potter attended St. Bernard's School in New York and Groton School in Groton, Mass. He studied painting in Paris with Andre Lhote from 1929 to 1931, then studied in New York with Walt Kuhn. At that time he specialized in still lifes and landscapes, and he showed his work in New York in the 1930's at the Marie Harriman Gallery.
        In 1950, Mr. Potter met Jackson Pollock and changed his mode of painting permanently to abstraction. He had a number of shows in that vein at the Mystic Gallery in Mystic, Conn.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice; three sons, Daniel Otis, of Stonington, Conn., Paul, of Washington, and Benjamin C. J., of Marion, N.C.; a daughter, Mary Barton Goodman of Morristown, Tenn.; a sister, Polly Balding of Camden, S.C., and two brothers, Charles, of Chicago, and Jeffrey, of East Hampton, L.I.
