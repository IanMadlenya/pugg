        Rabbi Nathan Witkin, who served for three decades as a chaplain ministering to United States armed services personnel and their families in the Canal Zone. died Tuesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 88 years old and had lived in retirement in Sarasota since 1978.
        His family said he died after a stroke.
        Rabbi Witkin went to the Canal Zone in 1937 as a field representative of the National Jewish Welfare Board. He built the first center there for Jewish military personnel; it soon became a meeting place for Americans of all faiths.
        His first wife, the former Esther Finkelstein, was killed in 1942 when a fighter plane crashed into the center. He later married Helen Schuchat, then a teacher in the Canal Zone.
        Rabbi Witkin, who was born in Manhattan, studied in Jerusalem and was ordained there by the Chief Rabbi in 1933. Before his assignment to Panama in 1937, he was a chaplain in the Civilian Conservation Corps for two years.
        In recognition of his work in Panama he was awarded the Medal of Freedom in 1947 and the Army's Outstanding Civilian Service Medal. In 1967 he moved to Houston, where he organized a Jewish chaplaincy at the Houston Medical Center.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Naomi Steinberg of Boston; two sons, Dr. Michael Witkin of Metairie, La., and Samuel Witkin of Austin, Tex.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
