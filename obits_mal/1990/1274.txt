        He died of heart failure, his son, Otto, said.
        Dr. Trautz was born in Germany and received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Heidelberg in 1927. He came to the United States in 1928 and began teaching biochemistry at New York University. He was named professor emeritus there in 1968. He moved to Badenweiler, West Germany, and returned to the United States last October to live with his son in Vermont.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Helene; two sisters, Gretel Michelfelder of Neuenstein, West Germany, and Luise, of Pforzheim, West Germany, and two grandchildren.
