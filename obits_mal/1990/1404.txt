        Mr. Turnage was born in Dunn, N.C. He studied music at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, where he received a master's degree. After winning the finals in the Metropolitan Opera Council Regional Auditions in 1962, he joined the Metropolitan Opera Studio.

        In 1979 he sang in the Washington Opera's production of Dominick Argento's ''Postcard From Morocco.'' He also performed in the first fully staged performance of Richard Owen's ''Mary Dyer'' with the New York Lyric Opera in 1979 and, a year later, played the Count in Opera Ebony's production of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro.''
        A frequent collaborator with Leonard Bernstein, Mr. Turnage performed in the composer's ''Mass'' at the Kennedy Center and in the West Coast premiere of ''Songfest'' at the Hollywood Bowl in 1979.
        He is survived by his mother, Evelyn Turnage, and a sister, Fannie Sue Jackson, both of Dunn, and two brothers, James, of Greensboro, N.C., and Pate, of Longwood, Fla.
