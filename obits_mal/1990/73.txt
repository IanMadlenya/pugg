        Tomisaburo Hashimoto, a powerful official who was convicted in the bribery scandal that swept the Government in the mid-1970's, died of pneumonia today, a hospital official said. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Hashimoto served in such posts as secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Construction Minister and Transport Minister.
        In 1976, while Transport Minister, he was arrested on charges of accepting $34,000 for promoting sales of Lockheed aircraft to a Japanese airline.
        Appealed to Supreme Court
        The Tokyo District Court later sentenced him to a two-and-a-half-year jail term. Mr. Hashimoto, who denied the bribery charges, took his case to the Supreme Court, but the court had not issued a ruling by the time of his death.
        The Lockheed scandal broke in 1976 when the American aircraft maker acknowledged that it had bribed Japanese officials to influence their decisions on purchases. The scandal caused a split in the Liberal Democrats that took several years to repair.
        Mr. Hashimoto, a native of Ibaraki prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, joined Asahi Shimbun, a major Japanese newspaper, in 1927 after graduating from the department of politics and economics at Waseda University.
        Many Years in Parliament
        He quit the newspaper company after World War II and won his first election to the lower house of Parliament in 1949. He returned to Parliament 12 times before losing in general elections in 1980.
        He served in the Cabinets of Prime Ministers Hayato Ikeda, Eisaku Sato and Kakuei Tanaka. Mr. Tanaka, who was also implicated in the Lockheed scandal, is still appealing his case to the Supreme Court.
