        Hospital officials said he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
        Mr. Cleary joined what was then the New York Edison Company in 1925 after graduating from Cooper Union with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. He later studied accounting at New York University. He was named assistant controller after New York Edison merged with several other utilities to become Consolidated Edison.
        He eventually became a senior vice president, a trustee and president. Among his early duties as president was presiding over the first stockholders' meeting after the blackout of Nov. 9, 1965. He retired in 1969.
        Mr. Cleary served as an official of the Greater New York Fund, and was a founding member of the United Fund of Greater New York. He was also a member of the Cardinal's Committee of the Laity.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lillian V. Dacey; a son, John V. Jr., of Charlotte, Vt., 12 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
