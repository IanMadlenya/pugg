        Mr. Renzulli's brother, Michael, said his brother, who had undergone surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center a few weeks ago, died in Long Island College Hospital after a heart attack.
        Robert Phillips and Franco Renzulli performed and recorded throughout the United States. In a review in The New York Times, Harold Schonberg said Phillips and Renzulli were ''a neat, fluent two-piano ensemble.'' He continued, ''Tonally the two pianists are alike, their coordination is perfect, their musical views sensitive.''
        Mr. Renzulli was also musical director at St. Francis Cabrini Church at 16th Avenue and 86th Street in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. A memorial mass will be held there at 7:30 P.M. tomorrow.
        He is survived by his father, Comunardo, and his mother, Sue, of Rockville Center, L.I., and his brother, Michael, of Manhattan.
