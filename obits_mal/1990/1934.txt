        Louis Calta, a former reporter in the drama department of The New York Times, died yesterday at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 77 years old.
        His daughter Angela Castricone said he died of complications from pneumonia brought on by Parkinson's disease.
        Mr. Calta retired in 1977 after 49 years at The Times. He joined the staff as an office boy while attending Washington Irving Evening High School. He later attended New York University, also at night.
        In the 1940's he was the nightclub editor of The Times. Later, as a kind of diarist of Broadway, he tracked many shows, from first casting call to black-tie opening night to closing. In a typical week, in January 1956, for example, he reported on the opening of Christopher Marlowe's ''Tamburlaine the Great,'' starring Anthony Quayle, at the Winter Garden Theater; Irving Berlin's departure for a working winter vacation in Florida, and Shelley Winters's return to the cast of ''A Hatful of Rain'' after she broke her foot.
        For many years, he reviewed Off Broadway plays. He wrote one of the first Times reviews of a Joseph Papp production, ''Romeo and Juliet'' in December 1955.
        Besides Mrs. Castricone, he is survived by a daughter, Rosemarie Kent of Brooklyn; a brother, Vincent Caltagirone of Houston, and four grandchildren.
