        Councilman Morgan, a microbiologist, educator and former administrator at the National Academy of Sciences, died on Wednesday at Anne Arundel Hospital in Annapolis, Md. He was 70 years old and had moved to Annapolis from Teaneck, N.J., about a year ago.
        He died of complications after heart surgery, said Judge Douglas Ginsburg, his son-in-law.
        Dr. Morgan graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University in 1946 and joined the faculty there in 1954. He taught microbiology, and was an associate dean of students and of curriculum affairs from 1970 to 1978.
        He then became executive director of the Assembly of Life Sciences of the National Research Council until 1981. After that he was named senior executive assistant to the president of the National Academy of Sciences. He retired in 1982.
        From 1978 to 1982 he was the American representative on the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, a joint United States-Japan organization studying the effects of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1980 he wrote a book outlining the foundation's 10-year study of the radiation.
        He is survived by his wife, Hallee; three daughters, Dr. Hallee Perkins Morgan of Washington, Hilary Morgan of San Francisco and Christiana Morrison of Pahoa, Hawaii; a son, Councilman S. Morgan of Beltsville, Md., and three grandchildren.
