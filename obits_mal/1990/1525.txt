        David Goldway, chairman of the editorial board of Science & Society, a quarterly journal of Marxist scholarship, died on Tuesday near his home in Truro, Mass. He was 83 years old.
        He died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident, his family said.
        In the 1940's and 50's Mr. Goldway was a teacher and administrator at the Jefferson School of Social Science, a center of left-wing study in Manhattan.
        He had taught English at Townsend Harris High School in New York until 1941, when he was dismissed for refusing to sign a waiver of immunity when called to testify before a New York State legislative committee investigating claims of subversive activities in public schools. He later became an English instructor at City College.
        He was born in Gloversville, N.Y., graduated from City College and received a master's degree from Columbia University.
        Mr. Goldway was the co-editor of two collections of works by Marx, Engels and Lenin. He joined the editorial board of Science & Society in 1967 and soon became its central figure.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rosalyn Hersh; three daughters, Linda Keen of Leonia, N.J., Mary Ellis of Manhattan and Ruth Goldway of Santa Monica, Calif.; a son, Marty Kalb of Delaware, Ohio; a brother, Arthur Gallway, and a sister, Evelyn Ariesohn, both of Venice, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
