        Mr. Glemser was born in London in 1908. He was an intelligence officer in the Royal Air Force in World War II, then worked for the British Government in New York and Washington after the war. He resigned to devote himself to writing, and his first novel, ''Love for Each Other,'' a chronicle of a British family before World War II, was published in 1946. Among his other novels are ''Gallery of Women'' (1957), about a man's conflicting loves; ''Girl on the Wing'' (1960), about flight attendants, and ''The 60th Monarch'' (1974), set in Malaysia.
        Mr. Glemser also wrote science fiction under the pen name Robert Crane and other fiction under the name Geraldine Napier. His children's books include ''All About the Human Body,'' ''All About Biology'' and ''Radar Commandos.'' In 1969 he wrote ''Man Against Cancer,'' based on discussions with prominent researchers throughout the world.
        Mr. Glemser is survived by his wife, Violetta; a stepson, Jonathan Flaccus of Putney, Vt., and a sister, Josephine Evans of England.
