        John Markay Williamson, an interior designer, died on Sunday at a convalescent home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Williamson died of cancer of the liver, said Daniel Royce, manager of the Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., where Mr. Williamson lived until he entered the convalescent home earlier this year.
        Mr. Williamson was born in Scotland and came to the United States in 1929. He was employed by W. & J. Sloane Inc., a Fifth Avenue furniture store that has since gone out of business, as head of the interior design department.
        In 1933 he designed and installed the ''House of Tomorrow'' for the Chicago World's Fair, incorporating white carpets and interiors with bright color accents, a style that was his trademark.
        In the late 1930's Mr. Williamson opened the W. & J. Sloane design department in Beverly Hills, Calif., and designed period rooms for homes in the area.
        After World War II service in the Royal Air Force, he settled in the Palm Springs-Rancho Mirage area and opened his own interior design business. His clients included President and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower. He retired in 1983.
        There are no immediate survivors.
