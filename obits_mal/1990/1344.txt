        He began broadcasting in 1934 and had a major hit in 1936 with his recording of ''Begin the Beguine,'' which sold a million copies. His signature tune, ''In the Mood,'' sold another million.
        Mr. Loss also gave a start to many aspiring stars, including the singer Vera Lynn, who became Britain's ''Forces' Sweetheart'' in World War II.
