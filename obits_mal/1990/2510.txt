        Elwood Ingledue, founder of Hotel and Travel Index, a listing of hotel rates and services, died on Monday at his home in Glendale, Calif. He was 91 years old.
        His death followed a stroke, a spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Ingledue, the son of a hotel owner in Glendale, started his index in 1928, expanding it over the years to a quarterly publication with 45,000 international listings. He also published the International Golf Directory.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice Lee; a son, Ronald, of Glendale, and two grandchildren.
