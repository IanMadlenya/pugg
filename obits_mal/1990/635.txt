        From 1934 to 1947 Mr. Stewart was an editor at The Nation. During much of that time, beginning in 1936, he was also editor of Public Affairs Pamphlets, a publication of the Foreign Policy Association. After leaving The Nation he continued to edit the pamphlet series until 1970. He retired in 1986 as chairman of the Public Affairs Pamphlets board.
        Mr. Stewart was also editor of a pamphlet series for the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations and lectured at the New School for Social Research and City College of New York. He was the author and editor of more than a dozen books on economic issues.
        Mr. Stewart graduated from Allegheny College in 1921 and taught in China before returning to the United States to earn a master's degree from Columbia University in 1926. He returned to China to teach at Yenching University in Beijing, and came back to New York in 1931 to work as an economist on the staff of the Foreign Policy Association.
        He is survived by a sister, Majorie Russell of Yellow Springs, Ohio.
