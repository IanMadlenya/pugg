        Mordecai (Max) Gorelik, a theatrical designer who also wrote, produced and directed plays, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Gorelik, a 1920 graduate of the Pratt Institute, was primarily a scene designer. But in a six-decade career he also designed costumes, directed lighting and taught theater. He was a research professor in theater at Southern Illinois University from 1960 to 1972 and also taught at San Jose State College.
        Mr. Gorelik created scenic designs for ''Men in White,'' ''Golden Boy,'' ''Tortilla Flat,'' ''Casey Jones,'' ''All My Sons,'' ''Desire Under the Elms, ''The Flowering Peach,'' ''A Hatful of Rain,'' ''The Plough and the Stars'' and ''Volpone.''
        Mr. Gorelik was the translator and adapter of ''The Firebugs,'' by the Swiss playwright Max Frisch, which opened Off Broadway in 1963. Two years ago he published ''Toward a Larger Theater,'' a book of seven of his plays, most of which were written in his later years.
        Mr. Gorelik is survived by his wife, Loraine; a daughter, Linda, and a son, Eugene, both of New York, and a sister, Anne Levine, of New York.
