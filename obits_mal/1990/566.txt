        Anthony J. Prudenti, a contractor who was Suffolk County Republican chairman from 1980 to 1984, died of a heart attack on Thursday at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, N.J. He was 61 years old and lived in Blue Point, L.I.
        Mr. Prudenti became county chairman in 1980 after Peter F. Cohalan's victory in the primary for county executive. At that time Mr. Cohalan; Anthony Pace, a former Islip leader, and Mr. Prudenti took control of the party. But chronic intraparty bickering eroded Mr. Cohalan's confidence in Mr. Prudenti, and in 1984 William M. Blake of Babylon succeeded him.
        Mr. Prudenti, who had a stroke in December, was president of the Prudenti Construction Company from 1956 to his death. In the 60's and 70's, it built 5,000 homes in Suffolk.
        He also owned the Mahoning Valley Golf Club in Tamaqua, Pa., and was a general partner of Dune Road Associates, owner and operator of recreation centers. Mr. Prudenti was on the board of the Shirley Water Works in the Mastic-Shirley, L.I., area.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Annelies Miller; two sons, John and Anthony, both of Tamaqua; a daughter, Gail Cimino of Stony Brook, L.I.; a brother, John, of East Moriches, L.I.; a sister, Marie Weiler of Blue Point, and a granddaughter.
