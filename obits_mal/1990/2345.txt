        Sol Kaplan, a child prodigy who became a conductor, a pianist and a composer of music for films and the stage, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 71 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said Ring Lardner Jr., a family friend.
        When he was 12 years old, Mr. Kaplan performed in concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra. By the age of 21 he was a veteran performer at Carnegie Hall. His film scores included "Tales of Manhattan," for which he was nominated for an Academy Award, "Niagara," "Titanic," "The Victors," "The Guns of August," "The Spy Who Came In From the Cold," "I Can Get It for You Wholesale" and "Over the Edge," directed by his son, Jonathan Kaplan.
        Mr. Kaplan's film career was disrupted when he was blacklisted after he appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. During that period he wrote the score for the film "Salt of the Earth."
        In World War II, Mr. Kaplan wrote music for the film units of the Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Army Signal Corps.
        Mr. Kaplan and Edward Eliscu wrote the score for the Off Broadway musical "The Banker's Daughter." For television, Mr. Kaplan was musical director of "The Zero Hour," a special starring Zero Mostel.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Kaplan is survived by his wife, Frances Heflin, an actress; two daughters, Nora Heflin and Mady Kaplan Ahern, and a sister, Rose Penneys of Rochester.
