        Phil Boggs, who dominated United States diving competition during the 1970's, died on Wednesday. He was 40 years old.
        Mr. Boggs, the 1976 Olympic gold medalist in springboard diving, died at his home after a seven-month bout with lymphoma, a malignant tumor of the lymph nodes, his wife, Jody, said.
        The first aquatic athlete to win three world championships, Mr. Boggs was a three-time world champion in springboard diving and won nine United States national championships in the 1970's.
        Served in the Air Force
        Mr. Boggs, a native of Akron, Ohio, attended Florida State University and served in the Air Force from 1971 to 1976. He was a teacher at the Air Force Academy and left the service as a captain.
        He earned a law degree at the University of Michigan, and practiced for three years with a Miami firm. Mr. Boggs was an active public speaker, and was a commentator for CBS Sports and ESPN, his wife said.
        He was president of United States Diving, a national governing board, in 1980-84, and had been president of the Legend National Corporation, offering retirement services.
        Mr. Boggs won his first world championship in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in 1973. He won again in Cali, Colombia in 1975.
        Hard Worker in Practice
        Mr. Boggs practiced twice a day during his years in law school, and was gearing up for the 1980 Moscow Olympics before the United States boycotted the event because of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan.
        ''He works harder than any diver around,'' his coach, Richard Kimball, said in 1978.
        ''Nothing special,'' Mr. Boggs said of his hard work. ''I love doing it. I love the training and I love the competition.''
        He is survived by his wife, his mother, Angie, of Akron, and two brothers, Peter of Akron and Paul of Damascus, Md.
