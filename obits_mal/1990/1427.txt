        Dr. Larkin H. Farinholt, a chemistry professor and foundation executive who held a number of scientific posts in Washington, died Thursday at the Long Green Nursing Home in Baltimore. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan and Leonia, N.J., for many years. A daughter, Kathryn, said he died of pneumonia. From 1960 to 1973 he was administrator of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation's $1.2 million-a-year program for basic research in physical sciences, which selects promising young scientists to receive grants as research fellows.
        From 1947 to 1970 Dr. Farinholt was a professor and director of the chemistry laboratories at Columbia University. He had previously taught at Washington and Lee University.
        In World War II he was executive officer of the explosives research laboratories of the National Defense Research Council, which later became the Office of Scientific Research and Development in Washington.
        Dr. Farinholt served as science attache in the United States Embassy in London in 1951 and 1952 and as deputy science adviser to the State Department in the late 1950's.
        Born in Baltimore, he received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Johns Hopkins University. He was captain of the lacrosse team there and a member of the United States lacrosse team in the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam. While studying as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford, where he earned a Ph.D. degree, he was captain of the All-British lacrosse team.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Mary Kathryn Snyder; a son, Larkin Jr. of Los Angeles; two daughters, Kathryn and Mary Victoria, both of Baltimore, and three grandsons.
