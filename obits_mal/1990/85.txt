        Mr. Horiguchi, who was educated in Japan, came to the United States in 1953. In 1955 he became executive director of the Nippon Club, which helps Japanese executives and visitors. In 1965, after 17 students were deported for violating their student visas by working at the club, he resigned and formed the Nippon Employment Agency. He was its president until 1986, when he retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Kiyo; two sons, Atsuo, of Belle Mead, N.J., and Tsuneo, of San Jose, Calif.; a daughter, Michiko Ishida of Setauket, L.I.; a stepdaughter, Mari Ebata of Larchmont, and six grandchildren.
