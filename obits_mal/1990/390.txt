        Tom Barwise, co-founder of the Old El Paso brand of Mexican food products, died here Saturday. He was 80 years old and lived in El Paso.
        He began his career in wholesale groceries and canning in 1935 with the James A. Dick Company. After the company was sold to Safeway Stores in the early 1950's, Mr. Barwise joined Mr. Dick in buying Mountain Pass Canning Company; they canned vegetables grown in the El Paso area. In 1955 they bought Valley Canning Company, which was used to inaugurate the Old El Paso brand.
        Mr. Barwise was president of Mountain Pass until the company was sold to the Pet Milk Company in 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, Cleta; a daughter, a son, his mother, a sister and four grandchildren.
