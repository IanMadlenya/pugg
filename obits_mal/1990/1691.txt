        He died of heart disease, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Purdy was an authority on Victorian literature, especially Thomas Hardy. His bibliography of Hardy, published in 1954, is the standard work on the subject. With Michael Milgate, he edited ''The Collected Letters of Thomas Hardy,'' which were issued in seven volumes from 1978 to 1988.
        Dr. Purdy, a native of Middletown, N.Y., earned bachelor's and Ph.D. degrees at Yale, where he taught from 1925 until he retired in 1970.
        Survivors include a niece, Nancy, of Manhattan, and a nephew, William, of Norfolk, Va.
