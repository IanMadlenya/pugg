        Cletus Odia Oakley, a retired professor of mathematics at Haverford College who wrote several textbooks, died Monday at a retirement home in Chelsea, Mich. He was 91 years old.
        Dr. Oakley died of Alzheimer's disease, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        Dr. Oakley joined the staff at Haverford in 1934 and was chairman of the mathematics department from 1942 until his retirement in 1964. He wrote eight textbooks, including "Principles of Mathematics" and "Fundamentals of Freshman Mathematics," which he wrote with Dr. Carl B. Allendoerfer, also of Haverford. The works introduced "new math" into college freshman texts.
        He wrote extensively for professional publications and was an editor from 1956 to 1961 of the American Mathematical Monthly. A Ph.D. graduate of the University of Illinois, he taught at Brown University from 1929 to 1934.
        He is survived by two sons, Bruce of Chelsea, Mich., and Gladney of New South Wales, Australia.
