        Moises Torrijos Herrera, Panama's Ambassador to Spain from 1971 to 1978, died on Thursday after a brief illness, family members said on Friday. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Torrijos, a brother of the late Panamanian leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, was also accredited as Ambassador to Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Algeria during his service in Spain.
        In 1972 he was indicted in the United States on charges of involvement in a heroin smuggling network but was never arrested. He denied the accusation, which he termed a slander aimed at blocking Senate approval of treaties concerning the Panama Canal.
