        Mr. Sears, whose style combined many contrasts and inflections that alternated with enthusiastic staccato passages, played with Elmer Snowden, Andy Kirk, Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington and Johnny Hodges. His recordings included ''It Don't Mean a Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing'' with Ellington (1945), ''Castle Rock'' and ''Something to Pat Your Foot To'' with Mr. Hodges (1951) and, under the Sears name, ''Nell, Don't Wear No Button-Up Shoes'' (1951).
        Albert Omega Sears, a native of Macomb, Ill., is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Albert Jr., also of Queens; a daughter, Sylvia Cartwright of Phoenix, Ariz., and three grandchildren.
        A funeral service is to be held on Wednesday at 7 P.M. in St. Peter's Lutheran Church at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street.
