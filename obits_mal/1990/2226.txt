        Woodrow Bradley Seals, a senior United States district judge who ruled in 1980 that it was unconstitutional to deny children of illegal immigrants access to free public education, died Saturday after open-heart surgery. He was 72 years old.
        His ruling, along with a similar one by Federal District Judge William W. Justice, was upheld in 1981 by the United States Supreme Court.
        Known for his humanitarianism, Judge Seals received the World Methodist Peace Award in 1987. In 1979 he became the first non-Roman Catholic to receive a papal medal for his work with the needy.
        He was a graduate of the University of Texas Law School. In the 1950's he became active in Democratic politics; in 1960 he was a campaign manager for John F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign. He became a United States Attorney in 1961 and was elevated to the Federal bench on 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. He took senior status in 1982.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Daisy Herman; a son, Bradley, of Austin; two brothers and a sister.
