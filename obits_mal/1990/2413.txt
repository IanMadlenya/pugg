        His wife, Gladys, said he had died of heart failure after a lengthy illness.

        Mr. Perigard served on several scientific and government advisory panels in Virginia. These included a task force on science and technology under Gov. Charles S. Robb, an advisory board on revenue estimates under Mr. Robb's successor, Gerald L. Baliles, and the Virginia Center for Innovative Technology.
        He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Rhode Island and a master's degree in mechanical engineering from New Mexico State University.
        In addition to his wife, Gladys, of McLean, Va., he is survived by four sons from his first marriage, Michael, of Silver Spring, Md.; Stephen, of Richmond; Gregory, of McLean; and Douglas, of Germantown, and two stepchildren, Don Woods of Silver Spring and Stephanie Woods of McLean, and a sister, Ann Brennan, of North Kingstown, R.I.
