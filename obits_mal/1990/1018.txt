        Hippolyte Kamenka, a Russian-born architect who worked in Paris, New York and New Jersey, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94 years old.
        He was born in St. Petersburg and was educated there and in Paris, where he graduated from the Ecole Politechnique. In the 1920's and 30's he designed the Clinique Mirabeau in Paris and luxury villas in southern France. In 1940, he came to the United States.  Mr. Kamenka settled in Manhattan, where he designed several high-rise buildings, including a 12-story office building at 60 East 56th Street, an apartment house on Beekman Place and a 17-story apartment building at 235-43 East 57th Street. He also designed projects for low- and middle-income residents in New Jersey.
        He was the author of ''Flats: Modern Development in Apartment House Construction,'' published in London in 1947 by Crosby Lockwood & Son.
        He is survived by a sister, Daria De Cayeux of Paris.
