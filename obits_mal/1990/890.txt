        Dr. Kozin developed ways to improve the design of buildings to withstand earthquakes, to reduce metal fatigue in planes and bridges and to establish which parts of cities to repair first after a disaster.
        He was a professor at Purdue University from 1958 to 1967, co-director of Purdue's Center for Applied Stochastics from 1963 to 1967 and a professor at the Polytechnic Institute for the last 23 years.
        Dr. Kozin was a native of Chicago, earned bachelor, master and doctoral degrees at the Illinois Institute of Technology and had been a visiting professor at Kyoto University and London University.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Cynthia Hsiao; a son, Daniel, of Boston; and two sisters, Jackie Elster and Sandra Petralia, both of Chicago.
