        Mr. Utell, a native of Berlin, began his career as a journalist in Vienna for the weekly Aufbau. In 1926, he began a travel section in The Berliner Kurier, one of the first newspapers to cover travel news in Europe.
        Mr. Utell immigrated to the United States in 1927 and became a correspondent for German and Austrian newspapers. Three years later, he founded Utell International in Manhattan, from which he retired in the late 1960's. At the time it was sold to Grand Metropolitan, a hotel chain.
        In 1982, he was awarded a gold medal by Austria's deputy premier in recognition of his achievements in the field of international tourism.
        There are no immediate survivors.
