        Philippe Soupault, a writer and poet who was one of the founders of Surrealism, died on Sunday at his home in Paris. He was 92 years old.
        ''The Magnetic Fields,'' a poem Mr. Soupault wrote with Andre Breton, was published in 1919 and is considered to have given birth to Surrealism.
        Mr. Soupault was born in Paris and educated at the Sorbonne. He was influenced by the works of Marcel Proust and by visits to Germany and England.
        In March 1919 he joined Breton and Louis Aragon to found the review ''Literature,'' which became the standard-bearer for intellectuals disillusioned with the bourgeois culture they believed was the cause of World War I. Mr. Soupault eventually fell out with Breton and the Surrealist movement, accusing it of having become politicized. He continued to write poetry and novels including ''The Negro.'' He turned to journalism in the 1930's, reporting for the newspaper Petit Parisien and founding Radio Tunis in 1938.
        He continued writing poetry, including ''Day and Night Song'' and ''Without Sentences,'' brought together in his ''Poems and Poetry'' collection in 1973. His last published work was ''Memoirs of the Forgotten'' in 1981.
        He married Renee Niemeyer in 1937. They had two daughters.
