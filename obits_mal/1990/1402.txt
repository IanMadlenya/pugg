        Raul A. Campanioni, a stockbroker who ran a firm that served gay clients and donated heavily to gay causes, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 34 years old and lived in Chelsea.
        He died of complication of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Campanioni, the managing director of Christopher Street Financial, was a well-known figure in the West Village. He was born in Havana on June 10, 1956, the son of an accountant, his family said. His family immigrated to Tampa, Fla., in 1960 after Fidel Castro took power.
        Mr. Campanioni received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School in 1978 and a master's in business from Harvard in 1980.
        In International Gay Games
        Later that year, Mr. Campanioni began managing a clothing store in Paramus, N.J. In 1985, he took a position with Christopher Street Financial, a stock brokerage firm that serves thousands of gay and lesbian clients. He was later named its managing director.
        An avid tennis player and swimmer, Mr. Campanioni was one of the organizers of the International Gay Games, to be held in August in Vancouver, British Columbia, and managed the team that is to represent New York City there.
        He had also served on the boards of the Fund For Human Dignity, a gay and lesbian educational group; Fair P.A.C., a gay political action commitee, and the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, which promotes sex education in public schools.
        He is survived by his mother, Olga, and a brother, George, both of Tampa.
        A memorial service will be at the Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, on July 31 at 6 P.M.
