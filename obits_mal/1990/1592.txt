        Joseph L. Mailman, an investor and philanthropist who was president of the Mailman Foundation, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 years old.
        His family said the cause of death was lymphoma.
        Mr. Mailman, who was born in Utica, N.Y., and attended Syracuse University, formed the Utica Knife and Razor Company with his brother, Abraham, in 1920. Eight years later they formed the Pal Blade Company and in 1934 the Mailman Corporation, one of the earliest conglomerates in North America.
        Later the brothers acquired substantial interests in several American and Canadian companies, including Air Express International, Diamond T Motors, Gulfstream Land and Development and Republic Aviation.
        Through the Mailman Foundation, the family philanthropy, Mr. Mailman was a major benefactor of institutions in education, medicine and the arts, including Montefiore Medical Center and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and the Mailman Center for Child Development in Miami. He was chairman of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies fund-raising campaign in 1961.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Phyllis Scheffreen; a daughter, Jody Wolfe of Miami; a son, Joshua, of Manhattan; a sister, Mary Greene of Utica, and three grandchildren.
