        Mr. Khalil served in Parliament for most of the years from 1937 to 1972, when Lebanon's last parliamentary elections were held. He held several Cabinet posts in the 1950's.
        After Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943, Mr. Khalil was one of the founders of the National Liberal Party of former President Camille Chamoun. He fiercely opposed the activities of armed Palestinian groups in Lebanon, a presence that led to the Israeli invasion in 1982.
        He was among the legislators who met last fall in Taif, Saudi Arabia, to devise a new power-sharing arrangement between the country's Christians and Muslims that empowered Parliament to select a new President.
        Mr. Khalil oversaw the election of Rene Moawad as President. Mr. Moawad was killed 17 days later in a bomb blast. Mr. Khalil then presided over the election of the current President, Elias Hrawi.
