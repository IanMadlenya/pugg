        Mr. Tibbs, a native of Fort Pierre, won six world saddle bronco riding championships in the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, a record. He won the association's all-around cowboy title twice and also won one bareback bronco riding championship.
        Because of his flamboyant personal style, which included purple Cadillacs and a flashy wardrobe, Mr. Tibbs was often credited with bringing professional rodeo to national attention.
        Last August a statue of Mr. Tibbs riding a bucking horse was dedicated at the Pro Rodeo Cowboy Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs.
        He is survived by a brother, Thad Tibbs, of Fort Pierre, and a sister, Ardith Cook, of Spearfish, S.D.
