        Arthur Kornhauser, an industrial psychologist, died Tuesday at Valle Verde, a retirement community in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Kornhauser died as the result of a stroke, his daughter, Ruth Zubrensky of Milwaukee, said.
        An early researcher on social class, worker attitudes and labor unions, he taught at the University of Chicago from 1921 to 1946. He also taught at Columbia University and at Wayne State University, from which he retired in 1962 as professor emeritus of psychology.
        He wrote several books, including "When Labor Votes: a Study of Auto Workers" (1956; University Books) and "Mental Health of the Industrial Worker" (1965; John Wiley & Sons).
        Besides his daughter, Professor Kornhauser is survived by his wife, the former Mary Caswell; a son, William of Berkeley, Calif.; and three grandchildren.
