        Levin Kipnis, a prolific writer of children's literature, died Wednesday in Tel Aviv. He was 96 years old.
        Mr. Kipnis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Ushomir in 1894, arrived in Israel in 1913 and studied at the Bezalel School of Arts. He later joined the staff of the Levinsky Teacher's Seminary in Tel Aviv.
        His collections in Hebrew encompass about 800 stories and 600 poems. He also wrote children's books in Yiddish, publishing a collection in 1961.
        He was awarded the Israel Prize in 1978 for ''devoting his life to the development of children's literature in Hebrew.''
