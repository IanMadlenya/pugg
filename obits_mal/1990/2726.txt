        Byron Capleese Smith, an ophthalmic plastic surgeon and chairman emeritus of the ophthalmology department of the Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Smith died of injuries sustained in a fall from a balcony, a spokesman for the family said.
        In the late 1940's Dr. Smith and Dr. John Converse founded one of the first ophthalmological training programs, at New York University-Bellevue Medical Center. In 1946, he established a second training program, at Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital.
        He published five major textbooks in his field and received many awards, including the Howe Gold Medal from the State University at Buffalo School of Medicine in the early 1980's.
        He joined Manhattan Eye Ear & Throat in 1946 and became chairman of the ophthalmology department in 1963. He was a past president of the ophthalmological section of the New York Academy of Medicine.
        Dr. Smith was born in Tonganoxie, Kan., and graduated from the University of Kansas in 1929, where he also received a medical degree in 1931.
        He served in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Marguerite; a daughter, Constance Batton of Los Gatos, Calif.; two sons, Grady and Lindsay, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Andrew, of Walnut Creek, Calif.
