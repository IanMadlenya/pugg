        Edward Ehre, a high school English teacher who parlayed his devotion to sports into a separate career as an editor of a popular series of annual anthologies of distinguished sports writing, died on Tuesday at the Beneva Nursing Pavilion in Sarasota, Fla. He was 84 years old and had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Ehre, who was born in Rochester and graduated from the University of Rochester, taught at Port Washington (L.I.) High School for about 35 years and in 1953 helped found the Rolling Hills Day Camp in Albertson, L.I.
        In 1944 he and a friend, Irving T. Marsh, a longtime sportswriter for The New York Herald Tribune, got the idea of enlisting a panel of judges and bringing out a collection of the 50 or so best newspaper and magazine sports articles of the year.
        The result, ''The Best Sports Stories of 1944,'' became the first of an annual series published by E. P. Dutton until the 1980's. After Mr. Marsh's death several years ago, Dutton sold the title to The Sporting News, which continued the series under other editors.
        Mr. Ehre, who moved to Sarasota several years ago, is survived by his wife, Gertrude; a sister, Judith E. Kranes of New York, and two sons, Paul L. of Los Angeles and Stephen J. of Westbury, L.I.
