        Lawrence F. Stayer, the executive director of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Stayer died of cancer, complicated by pneumonia, his lawyer, David Fettes, said.
        Mr. Stayer, a native of Olean, N.Y., studied voice at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. In 1967 he became an assistant manager of the Metropolitan Opera Studio, an adjunct that trains young singers. Five years later he became an artistic administrator for the company, working on casting and scheduling.
        In 1980, Mr. Stayer helped form the Metropolitan Opera Young Artist Development Program and was named its administrator shortly afterward. He succeeded the soprano Rise Stevens in 1988 as the executive director of the National Council Auditions.
        He is survived by a brother, Michael Stayer, and a sister, Mary McCoy, both of Allegany, N.Y.
