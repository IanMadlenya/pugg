        Jim Wynne, a powerboat racer and pleasure-boat designer who influenced both aspects of boating, died Friday in Miami after an extended illness. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Wynn's engineering developments in creating and perfecting the deep-V hulls and the inboard/outboard powerboat drive engines known as sterndrives not only made possible high-speed offshore racing but also proved a boon to millions of pleasure and military craft afloat worldwide.
        In 1958, he and a fellow boat builder, Ole Botved, completed the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by outboard motor, going from Copenhagen to New York City in 11 days.
        In 1964, Mr. Wynne won the first World Open Class championship. He won the title again two years later.
        Besides competing, Mr. Wynne often wrote on offshore powerboat racing. He was also an accomplished skin diver who appeared in the television series "Sea Hunt" with Lloyd Bridges.
        Mr. Wynne is survived by his wife, Sharon Kirby Wynne; his mother, Aida; a son, Christopher, and a sister, Patricia.
