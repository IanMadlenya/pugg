        David G. Scanlon, a retired professor of international education at Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Thursday at Boston University Hospital. He was 69 years old and lived in Orleans, Mass.
        He died of cancer, said a spokesman for the Nicherson Funeral Home.
        Dr. Scanlon, who specialized in African studies, directed the Institute for Education in Africa at Teachers College, which trained teachers for the Peace Corps in several African countries, from 1956 to 1970. He traveled extensively in Africa and lived for a time in Uganda. During the long conflict between Nigeria and Biafra, Dr. Scanlon, a Quaker, represented the American Friends Service Committee in relief work.
        In 1970 he retired from Teachers College because of an illness. He later joined Cape Cod Community College in Barnstable as professor of history, and established a program in international studies. He retired in 1983.
        Dr. Scanlon was born in Leominster, Mass., was a graduate of Fitchburg State Teachers College in Massachusetts and held a doctorate from Teachers College. He served for two years with Unesco, establishing schools in the interior of Liberia.
        He wrote several books on African and international education and was co-editor of the World Yearbook of Education from 1968 to 1970.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, and a daughter, Judith, of Kingston, Mass.
