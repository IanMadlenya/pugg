        Richard Samuel Miller, an ecologist and a professor emeritus at Yale University's School of Forestry, died last Friday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in North Branford, Conn.
        He died after a heart attack, his son, James, said.
        Dr. Miller was a Fulbright Scholar and a 1951 graduate of Oxford University with a Ph.D. in animal ecology. He joined the faculty at Yale in 1961 as an assistant professor. When he retired last month, he was the William Oastler Professor of Wildlife Ecology.
        Earlier, he taught at the University of Saskatchewan, at Colorado State University and at Harvard. He was known for his research on a wide range of animal life, from fruit flies and mice to elephants in game parks in Africa and hummingbirds. He served in the Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1946.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; two sons, James, of Piermont, N.Y., and Richard, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.
