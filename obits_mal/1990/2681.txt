        Nicholas LaPorte, a former City Council member and former chairman of the Richmond County Democratic Committee, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island. He was 63 years old and lived in Great Kills, S.I.
        Mr. LaPorte, who resigned his Democratic leadership last spring in part because of ill health, died of heart failure, his family said.
        A businessman who was born in Crumlyn, Pa., and grew up in the Bronx, Mr. LaPorte moved to Staten Island in 1967 and soon entered Democratic politics. He was appointed to a vacancy on the Council in 1977 and was elected to a full term in November of that year.
        He became chairman of the Democratic Party for Richmond County in 1980 and continued to serve on the Council until 1984, when he was appointed deputy borough president of Staten Island, a post he lost last year when a Republican, Guy V. Molinari, won the borough presidency.
        Mr. LaPorte is survived by a son, Nicholas Jr., of Staten Island; a daughter, Deborah Lumba of Marlboro, N.J.; a brother, Anthony, and a sister, Josephine Fiore, both of the Bronx, and two grandsons.
