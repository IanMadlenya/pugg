        Herman J. Jessor, an architect who helped build more than 40,000 units of cooperative housing in New York City, died Sunday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. He was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Jessor, who was born in Russia and came to the United States when he was 12 years old, spent more than 60 years designing and building cooperative apartment buildings.
        He worked on the first limited-equity cooperative in the city, the Bronx Amalgamated Cooperative Houses, in 1927. He was the architect for Seward Park Houses, Hillman Houses and East River Houses, the large complexes at Grand Street on the Lower East Side.
        He was also one of the designers of Co-op City, the 15,500-unit project in the Bronx and of Rochdale Village in Queens. He also designed the Penn-South housing complex in Manhattan.
        Worked With Labor Unions
        Mr. Jessor, a graduate of the Cooper Union School of Engineering, was known for the social amenities of his designs, including apartments with entrance foyers, eat-in kitchens with windows, and bedrooms with cross-ventilation for working-class families without air-conditioning.
        He worked closely with labor unions, like the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers to design complexes that would suit their members.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eva Jaffee; and a brother, David, of Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan in the Soviet Union.
