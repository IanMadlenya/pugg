        Harry Adelberg, founder of the law firm of Adelberg, Rudow, Dorf, Hendler & Sameth in Baltimore, died Sunday at his home in Baltimore. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Adelberg died of cancer of the colon, his daughter Janet said.
        He came to public attention in the late 1930's as the lawyer of a man accused of dismembering a girlfriend. Although the man was convicted, Mr. Adelberg's defense was generally regarded as a victory because his client was not sentenced to death.
        Mr. Adelberg, a Baltimore native, graduated from the City College of Baltimore and the University of Maryland Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elaine Recht Hassman; three children from a previous marriage: a son, Richard D. of Baltimore, and two daughters, Vivian Rudow, also of Baltimore, and Janet Davis of Manhattan; two sisters, Sylvia Sinsky and Toby Sober of Baltimore; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
