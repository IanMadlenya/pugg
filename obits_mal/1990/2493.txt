        G. Malcolm Trout, professor emeritus of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University, died last Thursday at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing, Mich. He was 94 years old and lived in East Lansing.
        Dr. Trout was credited with helping make homogenized milk feasible in the early 1930's by linking the processes of pasteurization and homogenization in its production. He found that by pasteurizing the milk before forcing it through screens at high pressure to break down the fat globules, the fat and milk were kept from separating.
        He worked closely with the dairy industry to develop new processes to make cheeses, yogurt and other products.
        Dr. Trout was born in Birmingham, Iowa, and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Iowa State University and a doctorate from Cornell. He was on the dairy husbandry staff of the University of West Virginia before joining the Michigan State faculty in 1928. He became a full professor in 1941. He retired in 1966.
        In 1964 the American Dairy Science Association gave him its highest award.
        Dr. Trout is survived by his wife, the former Agnes Crain; a daughter, Nelda Stuck of Redlands, Calif.; a son, James, of Jackson, Mich., 7 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
