        Mr. Ott was the first composer commissioned to write a complete concert of electronic music for the National Gallery of Art Orchestra in Washington. His Piano Trio No. 3 was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and in 1962 he won the first City of Trieste International Competition in Italy with his ''Premise for Orchestra.''
        Mr. Ott is survived by his son, Noah, and daughter, Jenika Ott, both of Minneapolis. Also surviving are a brother, two sisters and one grandchild.
