        Franklin R. Collbohm, an aviation engineer who became the founding president of the Rand Corporation, the nonprofit research organization, died Monday at his home here, three weeks after a suffering a stroke. He was 83 years old.  Mr. Collbohm, who studied engineering at the University of Wisconsin, worked for the Douglas Aircraft Corporation at Santa Monica, Calif,, on designs for the Douglas DC-1, DC-2 and DC-3 aircraft.
        In 1946, while still an employee of Douglas, he was asked by Gen. Henry H. Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces in World War II, to consider assembling a talent pool to study long-range problems.
        In 1948, Mr. Collbohm broke Rand away from Douglas, establishing it as an independent, not-for-profit corporation that specialized in scientific research related to national security.
        Mr. Collbohm retired from Rand, which is based in Santa Monica, in 1967.
        A widower, he is survived by two sons, Robert of Santa Monica and Carl of Middleburg, Fla., two sisters, a brother and a granddaughter.
