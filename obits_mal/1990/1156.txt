        John J. Winkler, who taught classics at Yale and Stanford, died of complications arising from AIDS Wednesday at the Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 46 years old and lived in Los Gatos, Calif.
        Dr. Winkler, a graduate of St. Louis University, joined the Benedictine religious order but left in 1970 to attend the University of Texas, from which he received a doctorate.
        He taught at Yale from 1974 to 1979 and at Stanford since then. He was the author of three books and 19 articles, many of them reinterpreting classical works.
        Last year he received the Goodwin Award of Merit, given annually by the American Philological Association for the best book in the field of classical scholarship, for ''Auctor and Actor,'' published in 1985, in which he treated the Latin classic ''The Golden Ass'' by Lucius Apuleius as a detective story.
        He is survived by his mother, Mary, of Palo Alto, and four sisters, Cathy of Palo Alto, Ann of Springfield, Mo,, Mary Carol of San Anselmo, Calif., and Margaret Richards of Cumming, Ga.
        His companion was David A. Braaten of San Francisco.
