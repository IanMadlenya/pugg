        Kenjiro Takayanagi, known as the father of Japanese television, died of pneumonia on Monday in a hospital in Yokosuka, company officials said today. He was 91 years old.
        An electrical engineer, Takayanagi achieved the first television transmission in Japan in 1926 and developed the main component of a television camera in 1933 only months after it was invented by Vladimir K. Zworykin in the United States.
        After teaching at a Japanese college, he worked for the Japan Broadcasting Company and then at the Victor Company of Japan, known as JVC, where he later became vice president.
        Takayanagi was honored by the Japanese Government with the Order of Culture in 1981, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1989 and various other prizes for his work in advancing television technology.
