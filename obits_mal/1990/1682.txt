        Gerald F. Stevens, a lawyer, former Connecticut legislator and a 1978 Republican candidate for governor of Connecticut, died on Monday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 52 years old and lived in Milford, Conn.
        Mr. Stevens died of lymphatic cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Stevens had a lengthy background in community and political involvement, and was a member of the State House of Representatives from 1964 to 1978. He became House minority leader and, when the Republicans controlled the House in 1973-1974, majority leader.
        He made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1978, pulling out in favor of Ronald A. Sarasin, who was then a United States Representative. When he withdrew, Mr. Stevens announced he would not seek re-election, saying, ''I intend to become a full-time husband, father and lawyer.''
        Gov. William A. O'Neill, who was Democratic majority leader when Mr. Stevens was minority leader, said that Mr. Stevens had left an indelible mark on the state.
        ''I know firsthand how hard he worked and how much he cared about his party and this state,'' the Governor said.
        Mr. Stevens is survived by his wife, Judith, and four daughters, Karen, Laurie, Amy and Wendy, all of Milford.
