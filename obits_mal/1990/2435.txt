        Francis T. Offer, a member of the Congregation of Christian Brothers for more than 50 years and a former dean of admissions at Iona College, died on Sunday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 69 years old and lived in New Rochelle.
        He died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident on Sunday in Pleasantville, N.Y., a spokesman for the order said.
        Brother Offer was named director of admissions at Iona in 1966, after teaching at a number of elementary and high schools and serving as founding principal of Essex Catholic High school in Newark.
        A graduate of Fordham University and Columbia University, Brother Offer had entered the novitiate of the Christian Brothers in 1935. In 1981, he was named dean of admissions and retired as dean emeritus in January. He continued at Iona as associate director of alumni relations.
        He is survived by two brothers, Richard, of Cliffside Park, N.J., and Thomas, of Manhattan; and two sisters, Jacqueline Whalen of Granite Spring, N.Y., and Geraldine Freeley of Keansburg, N.J.
