        Lien-Sheng Yang, a professor emeritus at Harvard University whose extensive research on Chinese history and Sinology spanned nearly four decades, died on Friday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 76 years old.
        Professor Yang died of a stroke following a two-year illness, a family spokesman said.
        He was the author of several books, including "Money and Credit in China, a Short History," (Harvard University Press, 1952 and 1971). With Y. R. Chao, he compiled the "Concise Dictionary of Spoken Chinese," (Harvard University Press, 1947).
        In 1957 Professor Yang was presented with a gold medal by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China for achievement in the humanities. He became a citizen of the United States in 1961.
        Professor Yang is survived by his wife, Jean Miao-Chen Yang; a daughter, Zhongping Jiang of Beijing; two sons, Daosheng Yang of Beijing and Thomas Te-cheng Yang of Dorchester, Mass, and six grandchildren.
