        Mr. Appell wrote ''Milk and Honey,'' the 1961 musical comedy about Americans in Israel. His work was praised by Howard Taubman in The New York Times for its ''ring of authenticity'' and ''taste and imagination.''
        His other plays included ''Lullaby'' (1954) and ''A Girl Could Get Lucky'' (1964).
        Mr. Appell, a native New Yorker, began his acting career at age 12 in summer stock. He later appeared on Broadway in ''Native Son,'' ''Tapestry in Gray'' and ''Odyssey.''
        He directed such Broadway productions as ''Career Angel,'' ''Dr. Social'' and his own play, ''This, Too, Shall Pass.'' He also directed scores of television productions in New York and Hollywood.
