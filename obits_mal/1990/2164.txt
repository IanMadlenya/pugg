        From 1960 to 1980, Mr. Nagler served as president of the New York Boxing Writers Association a dozen times. From 1984 to 1989, he was president of the Boxing Writers Association of America, from whom he received the James A. Farley Award in 1989. In 1978, he received the Walter Haight Award for excellence in reporting on thoroughbred racing from the National Turf Writers Association.
        Mr. Nagler's books included "James Norris and the Decline of Boxing," "The American Horse," "Brown Bomber -- the Pilgrimage of Joe Louis," "Only the Ring Was Square," with Teddy Brenner, and "Shoemaker, America's Greatest Jockey."
