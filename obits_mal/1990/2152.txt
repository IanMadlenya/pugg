        Lew Worsham, winner of the 1947 United States Open golf championship, died Friday after a long illness. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Worsham's most notable victory was his triumph over Sam Snead in an 18-hole playoff for the Open championship. He shot a 69 to win by a single shot at the St. Louis Country Club in Clayton, Mo., after the two had tied with 72- hole scores of 282.
        He won the Tam O' Shanter World Championship in 1953 in Chicago, golf's first $100,000 tournament, with an eagle-2 on the 18th hole.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia.
