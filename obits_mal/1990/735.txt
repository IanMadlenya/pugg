        Frank A. Welt, a founding partner of a New Jersey law firm and a lifelong lawyer for former Gov. Thomas H. Kean's family, died of congenitive heart failure on Friday at the Elizabeth (N.J.) General Medical Center. He was 82 years old and lived in Cranford, N.J.
        Until shortly before his death, Mr. Welt worked as a senior partner at the law firm of Mackenzie, Welt, Duane, Maher & North of Woodbridge, N.J., which he helped found in the late 1950's. After receiving a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1927 and a law degree in 1930 from the New Jersey Law School, now Rutgers University Law School, Mr. Welt joined a law office in Elizabeth, N.J., that was a precursor of the current firm.
        Throughout his career, he was the lawyer for members of three generations of the Kean family, including the former governor, representing both their business and personal interests.
        In 1964, he served as chairman of the ethics and grievance committee of the Union County Bar Association. From 1984 to 1985, he was chairman of the association's fee arbitration committee.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rachel Shacter; a son, Dr. Aaron G. Welt of Morristown, N.J.; two sisters, Helen Reibel of Elizabeth, N.J. and Dorothy Shuff of Delmar, Calif., and one grandchild.
