        Christopher Ian Higgins, the Treasury Secretary of Australia, died of a heart attack on Thursday after running a 3,000-meter race at the nation's Sports Institute in Canberra. He was 47 years old and lived in the suburb of Garran.
        Dr. Higgins, a specialist in econometrics, was a director of the Organization of European Cooperation and Development from 1982 to 1984 and was Deputy Treasury Secretary from 1984 until his promotion last year.
        He was a native of Murwillumbah, New South Wales, and a graduate of the Australian National University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a senior Fulbright scholar. He was also a fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences and an author who was widely known in the United States.
        Surviving are his wife, Paula, a native of Pennsylvania, and two sons, David and Timothy, both of the Canberra area.
