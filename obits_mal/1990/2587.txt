        Dr. Walter S. Schachat, an ophthalmologist in Manhattan for 35 years, died on Sunday at the North Ridge Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 74 years old and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.
        He died of pneumonia, his daughter-in-law, Robin Schachat, said.
        Dr. Schachat (pronounced SHACK-it) was affiliated with the Manhattan Eye and Ear Hospital from 1946 to 1981. He was also a medical consultant to The New York Times for many years, as well as to the New York Aquarium, where he provided eye care to whales and walruses.
        He earned his medical degree at the New York Medical School in 1940 and completed his ophthalmology training at Queens General Hospital. During World War II he served with the United States Public Health Service at a naval hospital in New Orleans and was the attending ophthalmologist at a leprosarium in Carville, La.
        He is survived by his wife, Francine, and a son, Dr. Andrew Schachat of Baltimore.
