        William F. Peiffer, a builder who helped coordinate the construction of the United States Embassy in Moscow, died on Tuesday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 61 years old and lived in Westfield, N.J.
        Mr. Peiffer died of cancer, his son, William J. Peiffer, said.
        As a project manager for Circle Industries Associates, Mr. Peiffer was one of three Americans who worked in the Soviet Union from 1980 to 1987 overseeing the construction of the ill-fated embassy building in Moscow. The building, which utilized concrete beams and girders cast in a Russian factory, was later found to be riddled with secret listening devices.
        Mr. Peiffer also coordinated the construction of other major projects like the Short Hills (N.J.) Mall and the Renaissance Center in Detroit.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan; a daughter, Nancy Bender of Baltimore; a son, William, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; his parents, Willard and Gladys, and two brothers, James and George, all of Harrisburg, Pa.; five stepchildren, David West of Marina Del Ray, Calif., James West of Westfield, JoAnn West of New Hope, Pa., Donna West of Ocean City, N.J., and Cindy West of Westfield, and seven grandchildren.
