        Peter Amman Brandon, a former vice president of a hat-design company, Mr. John, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Brandon died of pancreatic cancer, said John Pico John, his companion and employer for many years.
        Mr. John was founded in the 30's, with Mr. Brandon as an officer and director of public relations. An immediate success, it attracted film stars like Mary Pickford and Vivian Leigh, whose hats in ''Gone With the Wind'' were designed by Mr. John, and socialites like Gloria Vanderbilt and the Duchess of Windsor.
        With the decline in the popularity of hats, the business closed in 1970, brought down by what Mr. John described acidly as ''orthopedic hairdos and french fried curls.''
        Mr. Brandon was born in Riverhead, L.I. He graduated from Yale University. Early in his career, he appeared in films and was the leading man in a theatrical act starring Mae West.
        There are no immediate survivors.
