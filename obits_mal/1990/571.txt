        Robert Karplus, a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley for more than 35 years who led in developing new techniques for teaching science in elementary schools, died of a heart attack on Thursday at a convalescent home in Moraga, Calif. He was 63 years old and lived in Orinda, Calif.
        As associate director of the university's Lawrence Hall of Science for more than a decade, Dr. Karplus played a major role in the Science Curriculum Improvement Project, which produced teaching kits that have been used in thousands of classrooms. Applications of the method have been adopted in Canada, Sweden, Japan and Korea.
        Dr. Karplus was a recipient of awards from the National Science Teachers Association and the American Association of Physics Teachers, of which he was a past president.
        A native of Vienna, Dr. Karplus held bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard. He was a research fellow from 1948 to 1950 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and taught physics at Harvard from 1950 to 1954, after which he joined the Berkeley faculty.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Frazier; three daughters, Barbara Boone of Newbury Park, Calif., Beverly Hartline of Grafton, Va., and Margaret Hellweg of Orinda; four sons, Andrew, of Ithaca, N.Y.; David, of Kings Canyon National Park, Calif.; Peter, of Orinda, and Richard, of Houston; a brother, Martin, of Cambridge, Mass., and 14 grandchildren.
