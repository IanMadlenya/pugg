       C. Dale Badgeley, an architect who designed the overall scheme for the 1939-40 New York World's Fair, died last Monday at his home in Old Field, L.I. His death, at the age of 91, resulted from a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        He outfitted many offices for Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia; planned major office skyscrapers in Caracas, Venezuela, and added many new campus structures at the American University in Beirut.
        He was a native of Warren, Ohio. He grew up in Springfield, Ohio, and he was a graduate of Ohio State and Columbia Universities.
        He won the Prix de Rome, and, over the decades, designed many private homes.
        Surviving are his son, William Dale Badgeley, of Seattle; a sister, Louise Ream, of Leesburg, Fla., and a granddaughter.
