        Morris Howard Hansen, an internationally known statistician who was former associate director for research and development at the United States Bureau of Census, died Tuesday at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington. He was 79 years old and lived in Rockville, Md.
        He died of heart and kidney failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Hansen joined the Census Bureau in 1935, after graduating from the University of Wyoming. He was a leader in the development of methodology for samplings and surveys and contributed to the mathematical theories that govern the field. He was also a consultant to foreign governments.
        He retired from the Census Bureau in 1968 and joined a private polling organization, Westat, Inc., where he was chairman of the board.
        He was the recipient of the 1962 Rockefeller Public Service Award and served as president of the American Statistical Association and of the Institute for Mathematical Statistics.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleonore; two sons, Morris of San Jose, Calif., and James of Silver Spring, Md.; two daughters, Evelyn Allin of Germantown, Md., and Kristine Hare of Annapolis, Md.; and eight grandchildren.
