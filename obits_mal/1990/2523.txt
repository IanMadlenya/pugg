        David Mizrahi, a newsletter publisher who was an authority on oil and Middle East politics, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 64 years old and lived in Tenafly, N.J.
        Mr. Mizrahi, who had been undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, died of complications resulting from pnuemonia, a spokesman for his family said.
        He was the editor and publisher of MidEast Report, a Manhattan-based newsletter. He started the fortnightly publication, specializing in economics and politics, in 1967, and appeared regularly as a guest expert on national television programs, including "The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour" on PBS.
        Mr. Mizrahi was born in Beirut and graduated from the University of Beirut. He received a law degree from the Sorbonne in Paris.
        He immigrated into the United States in 1960 and worked as a foreign correspondent in New York and Washington for several Mideast newspapers. In 1988, he helped establish the International Commentary Service Inc., a nonprofit organization in Brooklyn that specializes in producing third world television documentaries.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jocelyne Salama, and three daughters -- Audrey of Auburn, Ala.; Lauren of Huntington, L.I., and Carla of Tenafly.
