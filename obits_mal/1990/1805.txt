        Joaquin E. Meyer, a former Cuban diplomat who later served at the Inter-American Development Bank, died on Sunday at the Hospice of Washington. He was 83 years old and lived in Washington.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Meyer joined the Cuban diplomatic service in 1933 after receiving a law degree from the University of Havana. He was a delegate to the Breton Woods Conference in 1944, which led to the creation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
        He resigned from the diplomatic service in 1959 and joined the World Bank. He retired in 1972, but then served as a special assistant to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank until 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Alicia; two daughters, Alicia Tremols of Miami and Isabel Calonder of Aix-en-Provence, France; a son, Carlos of Annapolis, Md.; a sister, Margarita Pedroso of Chicago, and six grandchildren.
