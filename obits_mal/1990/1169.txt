        Sir Cecil Wallace-Whitfield, leader of the opposition party in the Bahamas, died on Wednesday in a Miami hospital, where he had gone for cancer treatment. He was 60 years old.
        In 1967, the Progressive Liberal Party came to power under the Wallace-Whitfield chairmanship and he was appointed to the Cabinet. But he became disillusioned with the party and resigned his post in 1970. A few months later, a group he headed was expelled from the party and it formed the Free National Movement, which is still in opposition.
        Sir Cecil was knighted in August 1989.
