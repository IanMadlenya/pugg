        Yisrael Levy, an underground fighter in Israel's struggle for independence who carried out the 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, in which 91 people were killed, has died. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Levy died on Friday and was buried the same day, according to a death notice in the Israeli press. The cause of his death was not given.
        Mr. Levy belonged to the Irgun Zvai Leumi, the militant Jewish underground group led by Menachem Begin that was one of the organizations fighting the British for independence in the 1940's. It carried out attacks on British Army, Government and police targets.
        Mr. Levy, who was born in Jerusalem, joined the Irgun at the age of 14 and used the pseudonym Gideon. He was entrusted with the mission of bombing the King David Hotel, a luxury six-story hotel that housed the British Government Secretariat and army headquarters, having participated in a bombing of British police headquarters in Jerusalem in 1945.
        "Giddy's tremendous inventive and creative powers were called upon to the full," Mr. Begin, who was Israel's Prime Minister from 1977 to 1983, recalled in his memoir, "The Revolt."
