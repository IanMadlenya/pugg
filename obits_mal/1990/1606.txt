        Mr. Grant was born in Nebraska in 1902, but moved with his family to California when he was a teen-ager. He studied at the University of Southern California, and later at the Art Institute of Chicago.
        In 1932, a gnome figure he drew of Santa Claus appeared on the cover of Ladies Home Journal. A year later, inspired by a radio commercial for Kellogg's Rice Krispies, he created the gnomelike characters of Snap, Crackle and Pop.
        Mr. Grant designed 187 magazine covers in the 1930's, 40's 50's, and also illustrated children's books.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, a son and a daughter.
