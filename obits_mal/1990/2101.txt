        Eristus Sams, a former Mayor of Prairie View who led an effort to win students the right to vote, died of a heart attack Thursday at his home here. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Sams, Mayor from 1970 to 1984, mounted the first statewide campaign by a black for the United States Senate in 1961. He placed seventh in a race won by John Tower.
        A former agriculture professor at Prairie View A&M University, Mr. Sams worked for 13 years to win voting rights for students at the predominantly black college.
        The United States Supreme Court ruled in 1979 that a residency questionnaire arbitrarily applied by officials of Waller County discriminated against students at Prairie View.
