        Dan Turner, a playwright, actor and composer who waged an eight-year battle against AIDS and lectured on how to live productively with the disease, died on Monday at a San Francisco hospice. He was 42 years old.
        When Mr. Turner was found in 1982 to have Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer common in AIDS victims, the life expectancy for people with AIDS was about a year.
        He helped found the AIDS Foundation, People with AIDS and the AIDS Switchboard.
