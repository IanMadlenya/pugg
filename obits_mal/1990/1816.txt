        Zvee Aroni, a prominent cantor for Conservative Jewish congregations, died Tuesday at his daughter's home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 65 years old and lived in North Miami Beach.
        The cause of death was an asthma attack, said Rabbi Max A. Lipschitz, head of the Beth Torah Congregation in North Miami Beach, where Cantor Aroni had served for the last 11 years.
        Educated in Palestine, where he fought with the Jewish underground army against the British, Cantor Aroni studied with Prof. Samuel Kavetsky and had his first pulpit at the age of 18.
        He later held pulpits at Temple Emeth-Beth Yehuda in Toronto, where he developed a notable boys' choir, and at Congregation Shaarei Zedek in Manhattan, where he founded the Manhattan School for Cantors. He also held pulpits at the Yeshurun Synogogue in Tel Aviv, the Forest Hills Center in Queens and Temple Sholom in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his wife, Hedva; his daughter, Vivian Serota of Manhattan and Boca Raton; two sons, Benjamin of North Miami Beach and Herbert of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
