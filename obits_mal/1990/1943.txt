        Bishop Robert Fisher Gibson Jr., former head of the Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, died Friday at Stuart Circle Hospital in Richmond. He was 83 years old.
        A spokesman for the family said Bishop Gibson, who retired in 1974, died of a heart attack.
        An outspoken leader in the ecumenical movement, he served in the mid-1960's as chairman of the Consulation on Church Union, which developed a plan to merge eight major Protestant denominations into a 24-million-member church. He also supported the movement to admit women to the governing bodies of Episcopal parishes.
        Bishop Gibson also served as vice president of the House of Bishops and as chairman of the Province of Washington, which includes the dioceses of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.
        He was a graduate of Virginia Seminary and of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tenn. He was ordained as a deacon in June 1940 and as a priest six months later. He served in two parishes and did missionary work in Mexico before teaching church history at Virginia Seminary and serving as dean of the School of Theology at Sewanee.
        He served as Suffragan Bishop of the Diocese of Virginia from 1949 to 1954, when he was elected Bishop Coadjutor.
        He was elected as the 10th Bishop of Virginia in 1961. After his retirement he remained active in church affairs and was a member of the House of Bishops.
        Bishop Gibson, who lived in Richmond, is survived by his wife, Alison; three sons, Robert Gibson 3rd of Tenafly, N.J., John Gibson of Memphis and Peter Gibson of Washington; a daughter, Greta Marshall of El Cerrito, Calif., and five grandchildren.
