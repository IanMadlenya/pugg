        Ben Holt, a baritone who sang with the Metropolitan and New York City Opera companies and who created the title role in the opera ''X (The Life and Times of Malcolm X),'' died of Hodgkin's disease Saturday at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. He was 34 years old and had homes in New York City and Old Greenwich, Conn.
        One of Mr. Holt's agents, William Hendrickson, said the singer had become acutely ill during a flight by air ambulance to Mexico, where he hoped to receive treatment for the disease, which had been in remission. The plane returned to Albuquerque, where Mr. Holt was admitted to the hospital. He died the next day.
        Mr. Holt was born in Washington and attended Oberlin Conservatory and the Juilliard School. Early in his career he won the Joy of Singing and Independent Black Opera Singers awards and Young Concert Artists auditions. He sang at the Kennedy Center in Washington and with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, with the New York Philharmonic orchestra, and with symphony orchestras and opera companies in the United States and abroad.
        He made his recital debut at Carnegie Hall in 1981 and his first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera during the 1985-86 season, in ''La Boheme.'' He made his City Opera debut in the fall of 1985 in Anthony Davis's opera about Malcolm X, the black separatist leader. He recorded for Decca records.
        Mr. Holt is survived by his father, Ben E. Holt Sr. of Wyckoff, N.J., and his mother, Mayme Wilkins Holt of Washington. His fiancee was Amanda Fry of Old Greenwich.
