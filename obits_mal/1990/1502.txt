        A specialist in 19th- and 20th-century American painting, Mr. Reynolds recently worked with Samuel Miller, director of the Newark Museum, and the architect Michael Graves on installing the museum's galleries of American paintings and sculpture on the first and second floors of its newly renovated North Wing.

        He also organized a number of exhibitions for the museum, including ''Against the Odds: African-American Artists and the Harmon Foundation,'' which is now at the Chicago Cultural Center.
        Mr. Reynolds was also curator of the Alex Hillman Family Foundation, a private foundation in Manhattan with a collection of Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings.
        He wrote extensively on earlier American art, preparing catalogues for exhibitions of the work of Walter Gay, John James Audubon, Samuel F. B. Morse, Louis Comfort Tiffany and John Singer Sargent, among other artists.
        Mr. Reynolds earned a bachelor's degree in art history in 1972 from Trinity University in San Antonio and a master's degree from Brooklyn College in 1977. He was formerly curator of the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New York University and curatorial assistant at the Brooklyn Museum. His companion was Tom McKeehan. Survivors include his parents, Ann and R. B. Reynolds of Dalhart, Tex.; a sister, Stacy, of Dalhart, and three brothers, Ray and Jeff, of Dalhart, and Earl, of Amarillo, Tex.
