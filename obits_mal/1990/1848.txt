        Jay Rubin, president emeritus of the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, A.F.L.-C.I.O., died on Sunday at his home in Newtown, Conn. He was 86 years old.
        The cause of death is not yet known, his son, Donald, said.
        Mr. Rubin, an early labor union organizer, was a native of Gradno, Poland, which is now part of the Soviet Union. He came to the United States at the age of 21 and worked as an upholsterer and baker before becoming a union organizer.
        He was the chief figure in a 1937 drive to organize 25,000 hotel workers, and in 1939 he became president of the New York Hotel Trades Council. The council negotiates and enforces the citywide contract covering hotel workers, who are members of 10 locals affiliated with seven different international unions.
        Specialist in Health Care
        The council's first contract in 1939 raised the pay of maids in the hotels to $14.50 for a six-day, 48-hour week. Benefits included a new health-care system in which workers and their dependents received free care through five medical offices.
        As a result of this program, Mr. Rubin became one of the state's principal union leaders involved in medical benefits.
        Mr. Rubin's first wife, Gertrude Lane, secretary-treasurer and a founder of the Hotel and Club Employees Union, Local 6, now Hotel, Restaurant and Club Employees and Bartenders Union, Local 6, died in 1953.
        He is survived by his present wife, the former Elizabeth Bentz; a son, Donald, of Manhattan; a daughter, April Bloom of Kingston, N.Y., five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
