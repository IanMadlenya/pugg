        Professor Costigan taught at the University of Wisconsin and Idaho State University before joining the University of Washington in 1934. He retired in 1975.
        In the 1950's he defended colleagues subjected to anti-Communist investigations, and in the early 1960's he was the target of a campaign seeking his dismissal from the university. The university president, Charles Odegaard, retained Professor Costigan.
        The professor wrote biographies of Sigmund Freud and Sir Robert Wilson, a British general under Wellington, as well as a history of Ireland.
        Survivors include his wife, Amne,
