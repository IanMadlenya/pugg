        Richard J. Hummler, the theater editor and critic of Variety, a weekly newspaper of the entertainment industry, was found dead yesterday afternoon at his home in Manhattan. He was 47 years old.
        The police initially attributed his death, which apparently occurred over the weekend, to a heart attack, George Russell, Variety's assistant managing editor, said yesterday.
        Mr. Hummler joined Variety in 1967 as a theater reporter. In 1970 he left to work as head of development for Alexander H. Cohen, a theater and television producer. Mr. Hummler returned to Variety in 1978 as the assistant theater editor and became theater editor in 1984. Reporting on the theater industry and reviewing major Broadway and Off Broadway shows, he wrote in the slangy Variety style directed at the show-business audience. He was a member of several organizations of theater journalists, including the New York Drama Critics Circle and the American Theater Critics Association.
        Mr. Hummler was born and grew up in Scranton, Pa., and was a cum laude graduate of the University of Scranton. His marriage to Marilyn L. Stasio ended in divorce.
