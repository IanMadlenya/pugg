        Sam Dolgoff, one of the few surviving members of the Industrial Workers of the World, a radical labor organization, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Dolgoff, who was born in Russia, came to the United States at the age of 2. A house painter, he joined the anarchist movement and the I.W.W., which was founded in 1905. He became an organizer for the I.W.W., known as the Wobblies, a militant, syndicalist rival of the American Federation of Labor.
        He was self-educated and spoke six languages. Throughout his life he worked for and contributed to anarchist publications. In the 1930's, he was a member of the editorial board of Spanish Revolution, a monthly American publication reporting on the largest Spanish labor organization taking part in the Spanish Civil War.
        In later years, he wrote on anarchist and syndicalist themes. Among his books were "Bakunin on Anarchy" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1972) and "The Cuban Revolution," (Black Rose Books, 1976), a denunciation of Cuban life under Fidel Castro. He was vigorously opposed to Communism.
        Mr. Dolgoff, a widower, is survived by two sons, Anatole, of Manhattan, and Abraham, of Chicago; a sister, Elaine Brunner of New Rochelle, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
