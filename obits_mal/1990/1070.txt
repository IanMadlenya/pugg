        Philip V. White, a former associate dean at the City University of New York who was about to become New Jersey's acting Chancellor of Education, died Thursday night at his home in Princeton Township. The police said the death was apparently a suicide. He was 46 years old.
        The Princeton Township police said Mr. White's wife, Constance, found him in the family's garage, dead from carbon monoxide poisoning from two cars that had been idling. No note was found, the police said.
        Mr. White, New Jersey's Vice Chancellor of Education, was selected on May 18 to become the acting chancellor of education upon the departure of Chancellor T. Edward Hollander on July 1. He was to serve until a permament replacement could be found. Mr. White had said he was not interested in the permanent position.
        Chancellor Hollander sent Mrs. White a telegram saying that ''the loss of such a great intellect and spirited human being is too stunning to fathom.''
        Mr. White, a scholar in African-American studies and African politics, was an administrator for CUNY from 1983 to 1987. Previously he was associate director of research at the Joint Center for Political Studies in Washington.
        He is survived by his wife and two children, Gabrielle, 16, and Philip Alexander, 9.
