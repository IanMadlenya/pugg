        An author, lecturer and archeologist, Dr. Grabar was born in Kiev, in the Ukraine, on July 26, 1896, and was educated in St. Petersburg. In 1928 he earned a Ph.D. in Byzantine art from the University of Strasbourg, France. He taught art history there until 1937 and at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris until 1966. He was also a professor of early Christian and Byzantine archeology at the College de France in Paris from 1946 to 1966, and a research profesor at Dumbarton Oaks Institute of Harvard University from 1950 to 1964.

        He wrote more than 30 books on the early and medieval art of Crete, Italy, France, Bulgaria and Turkey. He gave the A. W. Mellon Lectures in Fine Arts at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1961. They were later turned into a book, ''Christian Iconography: A Study of Its Origins.''
        Dr. Grabar also wrote ''The Art of the Byzantine Empire: Art in the Middle Ages,'' ''Byzantium From the Death of Theodosius to the Rise of Islam'' and, with Michelangelo Muraro, ''The Treasures of Venice.''
        Other books by Dr. Grabar include ''The Emperor in Byzantine Art,'' ''Martyrium,'' ''Byzantine Sculptures of Constantinople'' and ''Romanesque Painting: From the 11th to the 13th Century.'' He wrote in French, and his books were translated into English, German, Italian and Spanish. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        In addition to his son Oleg, of Princeton, N.J., he is survived his son Nicolas, of Paris; four grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
