        Mr. O'Donnell had been a professor of journalism at Boston University since 1985.
        He was an Army captain in Germany when World War II ended in Europe. He then joined Newsweek magazine, with instructions to write about the Berlin bunker where Hitler died. He gained entry to the bunker by giving a pack of cigarettes to a Russian sentry and found voluminous files on the final days of the Third Reich.
        Later he became chief of Newsweek's Berlin bureau, a foreign correspondent for The New York Daily News and a Paris-based editor for the Saturday Evening Post. He returned to the United States in 1981.
        Mr. O'Donnell was a graduate of Harvard University.
        He is survived by his wife, Antonia Howard of Theoule, France, and two sisters, Sally Batchelder of Wakefield, Mass., and Patricia Keady of Melrose, Mass.
