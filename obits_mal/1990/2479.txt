        Maj. Gen. Franciszek Szlachcic, a former Interior Minister and former member of the Communist Party Politburo, has died, the official Polish press agency reported on Sunday. He was 70 years old.
        The agency said said Mr. Szlachcic died on Saturday but did not say what the cause was or where it occurred.
        Mr. Szlachcic (pronounced SHLAHK-cheetz), a member of the Communist resistance during the Nazi occupation, joined the Soviet-backed Communists as they consolidated power in Poland in the years after World War II.
        He rose through the party ranks, reaching the Politburo in the early 1970's during the leadership of Edward Gierek as party general secretary. Mr. Szlachcic was Interior Minister in 1971 and deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers until his retirement in 1976.
        In recent years, he served as president of the Polish Committee for Standardization, Measures and Quality Control, and joined other former members of the Communist leadership in writing memoirs.
        The Communist Party was dissolved in January, after the transfer of power to a Government led by the Solidarity union movement.
