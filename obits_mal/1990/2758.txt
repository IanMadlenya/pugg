        James T. Callaway, an advertising executive, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 52 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lung cancer, said his son David, of Boston.
        With George Lois and J. Ronald Holland, Mr. Callaway formed the Lois Holland Callaway agency in 1967 and became its president. The three men had worked together for two years at Papert, Koenig, Lois. In 1977, Mr. Lois quit after a clash with the board over a merger that he favored, and the company became Holland & Callaway, with Mr. Callaway as president.
        Mr. Callaway was born in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Missouri with a master's degree in journalism. He came to Manhattan in 1961 and joined the Benton & Bowles agency, becoming the youngest vice president in its history. In 1965 he joined Papert, Koenig, Lois.
        Besides his son David, he is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Neal; another son, Jack, of Manhattan; a sister, Mary, of Manhattan, and two brothers, Michael, of Detroit, and Patrick, of Kansas City, Mo.
