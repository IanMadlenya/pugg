        Bobby Scott, a musician, conductor and arranger who wrote the songs "A Taste of Honey" and "He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother," died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 53 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said his publicity agent, Carroll Conover.
        Robert William Scott was a child prodigy. By the age of 20 he had studied composition, conducted an orchestra and performed with Louis Prima, Gene Krupa and with his own group at Birdland and the New York Jazz Club. His biggest hit as a singer was "Chain Gang," in 1956.
        He composed "A Taste of Honey" for the play of the same name by Shelagh Delaney. He arranged and conducted music for the singer Bobby Darin and was the director of talent for Mr. Darin's music-publishing company. He also produced records for the Columbia and Mercury labels. Among the artists whose records Mr. Scott produced were Harry Belafonte, Michel Legrand, Dick Haymes, Aretha Franklin, Nina Simone, Marvin Gaye and Quincy Jones.
        He wrote film scores, music for television commercials, operas, symphonies, chamber music and hundreds of other compositions. His book, "Musicians on Music," is scheduled to be published this year by Oxford University Press.
        He is survived by his wife, Judy, and a daughter, Amber.
