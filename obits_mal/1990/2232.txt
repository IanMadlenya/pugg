        Mowton LeCompte Waring, who retired as an executive vice president of Consolidated Edison in 1968 after almost 35 years with the utility, died on Sunday at his home in Irvington, Va. He was 84 years old.
        He died of renal failure, his family said.
        Mr. Waring, who was known by his middle name, was born in Chicago, was a graduate of Virginia Military Institute and held advanced degrees in science and electrical engineering from Union College.
        He was with General Electric in Schenectady, N.Y., for five years before joining Con Edison in 1933. He rose through the operating ranks to executive vice president in charge of overall system planning in 1966. After retirement he continued as a consultant to the utility until 1973.
        His wife, the former Sarah Chase, whom he married in 1932, died in 1982. He is survived by two sons, Mowton LeCompte Jr., of Alexandria, Va., and Thomas, of Cambridge, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
