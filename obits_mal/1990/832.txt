        Herman Levin, a longtime lay leader of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement and the president of the Acme Dress Form Corporation of Brooklyn for 35 years, died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 89 years old.  Mr. Levin was an early exponent of Reconstructionism, which redefines Judaism not only as a religion, but also as a civilization that includes language, custom and culture. The movement, a small but influential group, was founded in 1922 by Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan, a professor at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America who died in 1983 at the age of 102.
        Mr. Levin was a former president of the Jewish Reconstructionist Foundation and of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, both of Manhattan, and a founder of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in the Philadelphia suburb of Wyncote. He was also a former president of the East Midwood Jewish Center in Brooklyn.
        He was a native and longtime resident of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and a graduate of Boys High School and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Shirley Levinstein; a son, Alan, of Maplewood, N.J.; two daughters, Helen Sacks of New Haven and Suzanne Miller of Great Neck, L.I.; a brother, Alexander, of Brooklyn; a sister, Bess, of Neponsit, Queens; 10 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
