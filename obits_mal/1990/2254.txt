        Sergei G. Lapin, a Soviet diplomat and journalist, died today, state television reported. He was 78 years old. In a career that spanned six decades, Mr. Lapin served as head of two of the most powerful Soviet press organizations - the Gostelradio television and radio agency and the official Soviet press agency, Tass.
        ''Sergei Georgiyevich Lapin put all his strength and heart into all this, and today his heart stopped,'' said an anchorwoman on Soviet television's nightly newscast, ''Vremya.''
        The obituary did not give a cause of death, mention survivors or say when memorial services were planned. Tass, where Mr. Lapin once worked, did not immediately carry a report of his death.
        Mr. Lapin headed Gostelradio from 1970 to 1985 and before that was general director of Tass for three years. He was Ambassador to Austria from 1956 to 1960 and to China from 1965 to 1967. He began his journalistic career in 1932, working for Leningrad newspapers.
