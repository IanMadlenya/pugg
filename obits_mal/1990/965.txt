        Walter Thornton, retired head of the Walter Thornton Agency in Manhattan, once one of the nation's largest modeling agencies, died of a stroke on Monday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif. He was 88 years old and lived in Jalisco, Mexico.
        Mr. Thornton opened the agency for models, artists and photographers in 1930 and was in charge until retiring in the mid-50's, said a daughter, Daryl Lunstead of Annapolis, Md.
        Mrs. Lunstead said that her father's agency, which has gone out of business, was the second largest in the country, after John Robert Powers.
        Mr. Thornton was born in Chilicothe, Ohio. Orphaned early in life, he ran away from an orphanage and joined the Army at the age of 14, at the onset of World War I. In World War II he sent thousands of photographs and calendars of models to servicemen.
        Many of his models became Hollywood stars, incuding Susan Hayward, Arlene Dahl, Peggy Ann Garner and Lauren Bacall, whom he discovered in a beauty contest in Greenwich Village.
        Also surviving are his wife, Estair; four daughters, Adriana and Nancy, of Long Beach, Roberta and Ivette, of Guadalajara, Mexico; two sons, Walter and Richard, also of Guadalajara, and two grandchildren.
