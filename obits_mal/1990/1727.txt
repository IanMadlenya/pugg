        Msgr. Thomas J. Gillhooly, a former dean at Seton Hall University and a retired priest, died on Saturday at Newton (N.J.) Memorial Hospital. He was 79 years old and had lived in Sparta, N.J., since retiring in 1987.
        He died of a stroke, a spokesman for the university said.
        Monsignor Gillhooly graduated from Seton Hall and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1937. He was appointed a Papal Chamberlain with the title of monsignor by Pope Pius XII in 1953.
        He joined Seton Hall in 1939 after serving as an associate pastor of St. Mary's Church in Plainfield, N.J.
        He was dean of the university from 1939 to 1955 and during that time founded radio station WSOU-FM. He also founded the department of communication at the university. In 1955, he was named executive dean of Seton Hall's branch in Paterson, N.J., and remained there until 1966, when he became pastor of St. Mary's Church in Dumont, where he developed programs for handicapped children.
        He is survived by a brother, Francis, of Harrison, N.J.
