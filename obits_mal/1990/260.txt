        After a brief stint as a military officer, he began his career at the Middle East News Agency in 1966. He joined The Financial Times in 1967 and moved on to The Times in 1969. He covered southern Africa from 1975 to 1981, then became Washington correspondent until 1985. From 1985 to 1986, he was diplomatic correspondent based in London.
        Mr. Ashford is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Dominique, and by his second wife, Giuliana.
