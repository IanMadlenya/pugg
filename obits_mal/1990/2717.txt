        Charles Brown MacDonald, a military historian and former deputy chief of the Army Center of Military History, died Tuesday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 68 years old.
        He died of cancer and lung disease, said his sister, Flora Gammon, of Greenville, N.C.
        Mr. MacDonald was captain of an infantry rifle company in World War II. In his first book, "Company Commander," he wrote of his battle experiences in Europe. The book became a popular item at West Point and other military academies.
        A 1942 graduate of Presbyterian College where he was in the Reserve Officers Training Corps, Mr. MacDonald received his diploma and a commission at graduation.
        He wrote or helped write more than a half-dozen books, including three Army histories of World War II. He commanded a rifle company in the last major offensive on the western front, and later wrote "A Time for Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge."
        Mr. MacDonald joined the military history section in 1948 and retired as deputy chief historian in 1980. He earned the Silver Star, a Purple Heart and five battle stars.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by a daughter, Moire Queen of Washington; a son, Bruce of Swan Island, Me.; and three brothers, Alexander of Dillon, S.C., Donald of Edinburgh, Scotland, and Robert of Lakeland, Fla.
