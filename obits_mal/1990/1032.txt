        Max Wall, the music hall dancer and comedian who became an acclaimed stage actor in the plays of Samuel Beckett, died of a fractured skull on Tuesday after a fall. He was 82 years old.  Mr. Wall fell at Simpson's Restaurant in central London on Monday afternoon, said his agent, Joan Prichard. He never regained consciousness, and died early the next morning at Westminster Hospital.
        He became famous for his Professor Wallofsky character, a double-jointed eccentric whose bizarre walk was said to have inspired John Cleese of Monty Python's Flying Circus.
        Mr. Wall, whose name was originally Maxwell George Lorimer, was born in south London on March 12, 1908. His family were entertainers, and he made his first stage appearance as a baby in a kilt.
        After he appeared in many musicals and stage comedies in the 1930's, his career went into decline, and he was reduced to working in obscure nightclubs. He re-emerged when his comic talents and clown face, having reportedly attracted Beckett's attention, won him parts in ''Waiting for Godot'' and ''Krapp's Last Tape.''
        He is survived by four sons, Michael, Melvin, Martin and Meredith, and a daughter, Maxine.
