        Johannes Teengs Gerritsen, a Dutch businessman who fought the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, died of a heart attack on Sunday after a car crash in The Hague. He was 82 years old and lived in Wassenaar, a suburb of The Hague.
        Mr. Teengs Gerritsen, a close friend of Prince Bernhard and the Dutch royal family, was the subject of an investigation in 1976 into payments of $1.1 million to Prince Bernhard by the Lockheed Corporation in connection with the sale of F-104 jets to that country in the 1950's and 60's. He was cleared of wrongdoing.
        In World War II, Mr. Teengs Gerritsen was captured by the Germans and held at a concentration camp in France and later at Dachau, in Germany. He was freed by American troops in 1945.
        In the 1970's he became a spokesman for veterans of the Dutch resistance who opposed efforts to pardon two German war criminals responsible for deporting more than 100,000 Dutch Jews. He later relented and supported the Government's decision to free the two Nazis, Ferdinand aus der Funten and Franz Fischer, who have since died.
        He is survived by his wife and two children.
