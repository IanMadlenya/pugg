        Fred V. Heinkel, a spokesman for Midwestern farmers who headed the Missouri Farmers Association for almost 40 years, died Wednesday at Boone Hospital Center in Columbia. He was 93 years old and lived in Columbia.
        Mr. Heinkel, a third-generation Missouri farmer, was president of the association, now MFA Inc., from 1940 to 1979.
        He was former chairman of the feed grains and wheat advisory committee of the United States Department of Agriculture and also served on the national advisory council of the Peace Corps.
        His wife, Dorothy, died in March. There are no immediate survivors.
