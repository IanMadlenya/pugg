        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for Newcomer's Funeral Home, said.
        He was a partner in the law firm of King & Vogt, later Schenck, Price, Smith and King, from 1918 until 1956, when he went on the bench. In 1963, after his judicial service, he returned to the partnership and continued to practice until he retired in 1985.
        He was born in Morristown and was a graduate of the New York University School of Law.
        His wife, the former Elizabeth Reed, whom he married in 1926, died last November.
        Surviving are a son, Charlton, of Kansas City; two daughters, Jane Willsea of San Francisco and Miriam Patten of South Harpswell, Me.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
