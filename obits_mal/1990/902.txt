        Morton Sunshine, the former executive director of Variety Clubs International and a show-business impresario, died of cancer yesterday at the Hospice of Palm Beach County in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Sunshine helped raise millions of dollars for Variety, a children's charity that was founded in 1944 by entertainers. After serving as president of the New York chapter, he became the organization's executive director in 1970. Mr. Sunshine organized many benefit dinners honoring celebrities like Danny Thomas, Frank Sinatra and Al Jolson, and he developed an international program called ''Sunshine Coaches'' that provided transportation for disabled children.
        Mr. Sunshine produced the Tony Award dinners for the American Theater Wing for many years, and he represented independent movie-theater owners in New York. A lawyer by training, he also published and edited the Independent Film Journal from 1947 to 1975 and was a consultant to the American Film Institute in the mid-1970's.
        Surviving are his wife, Roslyn, of Boynton Beach, Fla., and three sons, Jerry, Robert and Jimmy, all of New York City.
