        Abraham S. Halkin, who taught Jewish literature, history and culture for nearly half a century before retiring from the Jewish Theological Seminary faculty in 1977, died on Friday in Jerusalem, where he lived. He was 86 years old.
        He held the Stuart E. Rosenberg chair in history, named after the Canadian Jewish spiritual leader who died on Monday.
        Dr. Halkin began teaching at the seminary in 1930. From 1938 to 1970 he also served as professor of Hebrew at the City University of New York.
        Dr. Halkin, a native of Russia, came to the United States at the age of 11. He received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia University.
        Among the books he wrote were ''Moslem Schism and Sects,'' published in 1930, and ''Zion in Jewish Literature'' (1961). He was one of six scholars who wrote ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People,'' a 1956 survey of Jewish life from early biblical times to the mid-20th century.
        Dr. Halkin is survived by a daughter, Miriam, of Haifa, Israel; a son, Hillel, of Zichron Yaakov, Israel, and five grandchildren.
