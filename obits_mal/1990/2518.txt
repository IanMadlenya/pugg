        Robert Jay Misch, a writer on food and wine for more than four decades, died on Wednesday at St. Clare's Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Misch wrote a weekly syndicated column, "Eat, Drink and Be Merry," that was carried by more than 100 newspapers across the country, and published a series of "Quick Guides" to wine, spirits and cheese. His articles appeared in The New Yorker, Esquire, Saturday Review and other magazines. He was an officer of the Chevaliers du Tastevin and was a founder and longtime chairman of the New York Wine and Food Society.
        He was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Dartmouth. He held several posts in advertising and was a vice president of the Albert Frank Guenther Law and Al Paul Lefton agencies before devoting himself entirely to writing and lecturing on wine and food in the 1960's.
        Mr. Misch is survived by his wife, the former Janet Wolff; two daughters, Mary Newmann Smith of Manhattan and Katherine Koritzinsky of Madison, Wis., and four grandchildren.
