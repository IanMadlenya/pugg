        Dr. Francis C. Wood, a medical educator who took part in research that perfected the electrocardiogram as a diagnostic device, died on Sunday at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 89 years old.
        The University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, where he was chairman emeritus of the department of medicine, said he had died of a stroke.
        Dr. Wood's research in heart disease in the 1930's led to development of chest leads for electrocardiograms. At the time, he was teaching and practicing at the Medical Center.
        Dr. Wood, a native of Wellington, South Africa, moved to Wooster, Ohio, with his family when he was 12 years old. He was a graduate of Princeton and received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. In World War II he served as a colonel at an Army hospital in India.
        In 1947, on his return to Penn, Dr. Wood was appointed the Frank Wistar Thomas Professor of Medicine and named chairman of the department, a post he held until 1964. He assumed emeritus status in 1970 but continued to teach and to maintain an active practice until 1984.
        Dr. Wood was a former president of the Association of American Physicians and of the American Clinical and Climatological Society. He was a master of the American College of Physicians.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary-Louise Woods; two sons, Francis Jr. of Seattle and Dr. Lawrence Wood of Boston; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Boston; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
