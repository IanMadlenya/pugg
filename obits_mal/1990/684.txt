        Dr. Robert J. Flemma, a surgeon who led research into an artificial heart, died of heart disease on Wednesday at St. Luke's Medical Center. He was 56 years old and lived in River Hills, a Milwaukee suburb.
        Last August Dr. Flemma, who worked with the Milwaukee Health Research Foundation, predicted that a device known as the Milwaukee Heart would be available for human use in seven years.
        The device is to be a wholly implanted, electrically powered heart to aid patients with cardiomyopathy, the degenerative condition that led to Dr. Flemma's death.
        Dr. Flemma said that human hearts were in short supply and that a reliable mechanical device was needed for the thousands of patients who die while awaiting human heart transplants.
        He had been in Salt Lake City, awaiting a transplant at the University of Utah Hospital, when he suffered cardiac arrest in January. After the attack, he was no longer considered a transplant candidate and never regained consciousness.
        Dr. Flemma was a clinical professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin and University of Wisconsin Medical School.
        Survivors include his wife, Mary Ann, and six children.
