        Herbert L. Bruce, the first black Democratic district leader to be elected in New York City, died Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bruce died of congestive heart failure, said his great-niece, Shirley Richard.
        In 1935 Mr. Bruce was elected a district leader and won a seat on the executive committee of Tammany Hall, then the ruling body of the city's Democratic Party, by defeating Charles Conklin, the Tammany leader of the 21st Assembly District in Harlem, by a vote of 252 to 213. Ten years later he was voted out of office.
        Earlier he owned and managed the Monteray restaurant on 137th Street and Seventh Avenue in Harlem in the 1930's. It closed in the early 1940's.
        In 1952, he ran in the Democratic primary against the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, with whom he had been at odds for years, for a seat in the House of Representatives, which Mr. Powell won. The seat is currently held by Charles B. Rangel, a Democrat.
        Mr. Bruce, who had opened a liquor store on West 145th Street in 1940, took over the store's operation until it was sold in 1975, when he retired.
        He was a member of the board of Harlem Hospital, and a member of the Harlem School of the Arts.
        He was born in Barbados, West Indies, and came to Manhattan at age 12 to live with his sister and her husband.
        A widower, Mr. Bruce has no immediate survivors.
