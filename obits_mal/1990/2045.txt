        Leo Mirkovic, an opera singer in Europe before World War II, who became a well-known cantor in New York and Washington, died on Friday in Miami. He was 86 years old and had moved to Miami in 1974.
        Mr. Mirkovic died as a result of injuries sustained in a traffic accident, said Rabbi Irving Block of the Brotherhood Synagogue in Manhattan, where Mr. Mirkovic officiated for 20 years before retiring in 1974.
        Mr. Mirkovic, who was born and raised in Yugoslavia, sang in operas across Europe until he was seized by the Nazis and interned in a concentration camp. He later escaped and served with the Italian underground in Rome. After the war he came to the United States. He studied at the Hebrew Union College of Sacred Music and then joined the Washington Hebrew Congregation.
        He is survived by a brother, David Friedman of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
