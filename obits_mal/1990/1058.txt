        Mr. Waller, who was born in Broad Run, Va., was introduced to thoroughbred horses and riding at an early age. He went on to ride show horses and train steeplechasers and thoroughbreds. He was the third-leading trainer in New York racing in 1957-59. He bred thoroughbreds at Tanrackin, his 320-acre farm in Westchester County.
        He is survived by his wife, Wilhelmine.
