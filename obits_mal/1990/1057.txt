        Dr. Elliott W. Galkin, who had been a music critic for The Baltimore Sun and a director of the Peabody Institute, died at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore on Thursday after a long illness. He was 69 years old and lived in Timonium, Md.
        Dr. Galkin was born in Brooklyn and earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and a master's and doctorate from Cornell. After studying in Paris under a fellowship awarded by the French Government, he enrolled at the Paris Conservatory and became a private student of Nadia Boulanger.
        In 1956 Dr. Galkin joined the faculty of Goucher College in Baltimore, where he later became chairman of the music department. A year later he joined the faculty at Peabody, one of the oldest music schools in the country, where from 1977 to 1982 he was the director. He was also a part-time professor at Johns Hopkins University.
        A music critic for The Baltimore Sun for 15 years, he served as president of the Music Critics Association from 1975 to 1977. Dr. Galkin was also the director of the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra and appeared as a guest conductor with the Baltimore Symphony. His 1989 book, ''A History of Orchestral Conducting in Theory and Practice,'' is considered one of the most comprehensive volumes of its kind.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and a brother, Benjamin, of Cherry Hill, N.J.
