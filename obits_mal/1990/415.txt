        Eliot Frankel, a producer of news and documentary programs for NBC, died of stomach cancer on Sunday at St. Peter's Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 67 years old and lived in New Brunswick.
        After three years as a reporter for the Newark Evening News, Mr. Frankel joined NBC in 1950 as a writer for the ''Camel News Caravan,'' with John Cameron Swayze. He later became a news editor of the ''Today'' show and in 1956 went to NBC's evening news broadcast, ''The Huntley-Brinkley Report.'' Mr. Frankel was the senior producer of that program until 1963, when he moved to London and directed the network's European newsgathering for three years.
        From 1969 to 1975, Mr. Frankel was the executive producer of ''First Tuesday,'' a monthly two-hour program that was NBC's first prime-time news magazine. In the late 1970's, he was the executive producer of documentaries and weekend news programs. ''First Tuesday'' won an Emmy Award in 1972 as best news magazine. Mr. Frankel won two more Emmys and several other television journalism awards.
        Mr. Frankel left NBC in 1980 to teach journalism at New York University. From 1983 to 1988, he was associate vice chancellor for news and public affairs at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Last year, he began teaching journalism at Rutgers University in New Brunswick; he taught his last class two weeks ago.
        Mr. Frankel is survived by his wife, Charlotte, and two sons, Charles, 38, of Hawthorne, N.J., and Mark, 33, of Yonkers, N.Y.
