        Judge Veron, whose home was in Lake Charles, was on senior status and was temporarily assigned to hear cases in the Eastern District, based in New Orleans.
        A native of Smoke Bend, La., he was a graduate of McNeese State College and held a law degree from Louisiana State University. He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter in 1977.
        In 1979 he presided over the influence-peddling trial of former Representative Otto Passman, Democrat of Louisiana. Mr. Passman was acquitted of bribery, conspiracy and tax evasion.
        Judge Veron is survived by his wife, the former Verdy Heyd; two sons, J. Michael and Douglas, both of Lake Charles; two brothers, George and Louis, both of Lake Charles; a sister, Mae Bonadona of New Orleans, and four grandchildren.
