        Jose Durand, a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese of the University of California at Berkeley, died last Sunday while on a sabbatical in his native Lima, Peru. He was 64 years old.
        The university, which reported the death over the weekend, said he died of a stroke.
        Mr. Durand was a scholar with a particular interest in the blend of Spanish colonial culture and indigenous Inca traditions. He became a permanent member of the Berkeley faculty in 1975.
        Writing in Spanish, he was the author of books in his field as well as novels and short stories popular in Peru and Mexico. One of his principal subjects was Garcilaso de la Vega, known as Il Inca, the illegitimate son of a Spanish knight and an Inca princess who became one of the great 16th-century Spanish chroniclers.
        Mr. Durand is survived by his son, Carlos, of Berkeley, and two brothers, Ricardo of El Callao, Peru, and Luis, of Lima.
