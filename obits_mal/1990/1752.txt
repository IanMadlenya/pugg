        Talbert Abrams, an aviation pioneer and the developer of aerial mapping, died Saturday at a nursing home in Lansing, Mich. He was 95 years old and lived in Lansing.
        He died of respiratory failure, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. Abrams began taking pictures from airplanes when he was a gunner in World War I, and his pictures were used to plan military maneuvers.
        In 1923, he and his wife, Leota, founded the Abrams Aerial Survey Company. It was hired to photograph the route for a major north-south highway in Michigan, and that road, U.S. 27, became the first highway built using aerial photographs.
        The company did aerial mapping on almost every continent and helped to develop precise map-making and photo interpretation techniques.
        Mr. Abrams received numerous honors, including having the planetarium at Michigan State University and a mountain in Antarctica named in his honor.
        There were no immediate survivors.
