        Ben Reifel, the first Sioux Indian elected to the United States House of Representatives, died of cancer on Tuesday at Sioux Valley Hospital in Sioux Falls. He was 83 years old.
        A Rosebud Sioux, he worked for the Department of Interior for 23 years, resigning in 1960 as an area administrator for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to win a seat in Congress as a Republican. He stepped down after five two-year terms.
        He was instrumental in having the Earth Resources Observation Systems center located in South Dakota and in keeping Ellsworth Air Force Base an active military base in the state.
        He was born on a log cabin on a Sioux reservation, which he left to attend South Dakota State College. He received a bachelor's degree there and master's and doctoral degrees in economics and government at Harvard University.
        Mr. Reifel served in the Army in Europe in World War II as a lieutenant colonel.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a daughter and a stepdaughter.
