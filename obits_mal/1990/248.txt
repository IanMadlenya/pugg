        Spud Chandler, who was voted the American League's most valuable player in 1943 and was twice a 20-game winner for the Yankees, died Tuesday. He was 82 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed.
        In an 11-year career, all with the Yankees, Chandler pitched for seven pennant winners and six World Series champions. He won 109 games and lost only 43 with a 2.84 earned run average. He never had a losing season, and no pitcher with as many innings pitched for a career, 1,485, had a better winning percentage than Chandler's .717.
        In 1943, Chandler led the American League with a 20-4 record and a 1.64 earned run average, the best ever by a Yankee right-hander. That season he also won two games in the World Series as the Yankees defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in five games. Chandler pitched a 10-hit 2-0 shutout in the finale, which the Yankees won on Bill Dickey's two-run homer.

        Spurgeon (Spud) Chandler was born in Commerce, Ga., on Sept. 12, 1907. He attended the University of Georgia, where he was a halfback on the football team and pitched for the baseball team.
        He was almost 30 years old before he broke into the major leagues with the Yankees in 1937, posting a 7-4 record. He was 10-4 in 1941 and 16-5 in 1942, both pennant-winning years for the Yankees. In 1946, Chandler had a 20-8 record and a 2.10 e.r.a. In the four World Series in which he appeared, Chandler won twice, lost twice and had a 1.62 e.r.a. for 33Y innings.
        Chandler was named to the American League All-Star team four times and won the 1942 All-Star Game.
        He is survived by his wife and two sons.
