       Salim Fakhri, a prominent exiled opponent of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, died on Thursday. He was 69 years old.
        The police said on Saturday that he died of natural causes. ''There is no suspicion of any crime and there is no inquiry,'' a statement said.
        British newspapers had reported that Mr. Fakhri had been a potential target of President Hussein's Government.
        The Sunday Telegraph said its reporter Nicholas Farrell had been interviewing Mr. Fakhri when he collapsed. Mr. Farrell said Mr. Fakhri had spoken with him before going to a meeting of Iraqi opposition groups and then returned for further conversation minutes before he was stricken.
        He described Mr. Fakhri as a retired Iraqi Army colonel who became the secretary of the Democratic Rescue Movement, which aimed at establishing a Western-style democracy in Iraq.
        Mr. Farrell said Mr. Fakhri had been instrumental in engineering a coalition of secular groups like his and the two main Iraqi Shiite Muslim fundamentalist groups.
        He quoted Mr. Fakhri as having said of Mr. Hussein: ''The Iraqi opposition is powerful. With time, we can topple him. It's probably within months rather than years.''
