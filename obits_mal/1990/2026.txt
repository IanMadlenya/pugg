       Bernard Nadel, a retired New York State Supreme Court Justice, died on Sunday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of Parkinson's disease, said his son, S. Michael Nadel.
        Justice Nadel was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1968 and retired in 1984.
        In 1975, in hearing a $100 million suit that charged Howard Hughes, the reclusive billionaire, with stock fraud, Justice Nadel issued an order giving Mr. Hughes two weeks to prove that he was not dead.
        Justice Nadel had been a Civil Court judge in Manhattan for six years and from 1953 to 1963 was a Democratic district leader on the Lower East Side.
        He was a 1934 cum laude graduate of Brooklyn Law School who served on the New York State Temporary Commission on the Revision and Simplification of the Constitution. From 1946 to 1963 he was counsel to three State Senate Democratic minority leaders, Elmer Quinn, Francis Mahoney and Joseph Zaretzki.
        He was in private practice before serving as a staff sergeant in the Army during World War II.
        In addition to his son, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, the former Eve Lightman; a daughter, Marlene Stolz, also of Manhattan; a sister, Pauline Holtz of the Bronx, and two grandchildren.
