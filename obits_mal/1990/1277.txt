        Gerard Appy, for nearly two decades an executive at WNET, the major New York public television station, died on Sunday at his home in Lake Oswego, outside Portland, Ore. He was 69 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his wife, Shirley, said yesterday.
        Mr. Appy was born in Seattle and served in the Marine Corps as a dive-bomber pilot during World War II. He was a radio actor in Hollywood briefly and then the director of the continuing education program at the University of Georgia. In 1965 Mr. Appy, who was both a Shakespeare scholar and a broadcast engineer, joined National Educational Television, the forerunner to WNET. He subsequently served WNET as a vice president and director of operations, of corporate services and of administration, and was board member of the Public Broadcasting Service.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Appy is survived by his daughter, Karen Appy Bauman of Philadelphia; and his son, Christian Gerard Appy of Boston.
