        Raymond Bernstein, retired president of Northville Industries of Long Island, a heating oil distributor, died on Thursday after he was struck by an automobile while riding a bicycle in Miami. The 62-year-old Miami resident lived for many years in Sands Point, L.I.
        In 1917, Mr. Bernstein's father, Samuel, started the business that became Northville as Premium Coal and Ice, delivering sacks of coal and blocks of ice to apartments on the Lower East Side. When iceboxes were replaced by refrigerators, the company began delivering oil.
        In 1956 Raymond and his brother, Harold, set up an offshoot of Premium in the Northville section of Riverhead, L.I., where they built a marine oil terminal. Today Northville is the largest independent terminal operator on the East Coast and is in the retail gasoline business as well.
        Raymond Bernstein also supervised construction of an 81-mile oil pipeline through the isthmus of Panama to transport Alaskan crude oil to the Gulf of Mexico for transport to the East Coast.
        In addition to his brother, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., he is survived by his wife, the former Selma Gottlieb; a daughter, Ellen Fox of Manhattan; a son, Julian, of West Islip, L.I., and a granddaughter.
