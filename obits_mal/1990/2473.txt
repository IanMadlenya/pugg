        W. Gardner Barker, a former chairman of Thomas J. Lipton, who presided over a significant expansion of the food and tea company, died Friday in his home at Marblehead, Mass. He was 77 years old.
        He died of heart failure and also suffered from Alzheimer's disease, his daughter-in-law, Nancy Barker, said.
        During Mr. Barker's 19 years of leadership, the Lipton company acquired Wishbone Salad Dressing, Good Humor Ice Cream and Pennsylvania Dutch Noodles, and started the Cup-a-Soup line.
        Mr. Barker joined the Lipton Company, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., a subsidiary of the Unilever organization, in 1956 as a vice president of new products. He was named president in 1959 and chairman in 1972. He retired in 1978,
        Born in Brookline, Mass., he earned an M.S. at Harvard University in 1935 and went on to graduate business school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        He began his career in 1937 as a market research analyst at Lever Brothers Company and was made director of new products for the Pepsodent division after serving in the United States Navy in the Pacific in World War II.
        Before joining Lipton, he was vice president of the Simoniz Company, a wax and shoe polish concern in Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife, Katharine Atkinson; two daughters, Sue B. Gray and Elizabeth B. Gubersky, both of Hong Kong; two sons, W. Gardner Barker Jr. of San Marino, Calif., and Bruce A., of Riverside, Conn.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
