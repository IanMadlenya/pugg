        Ron Norman, Mr. Tan's partner in a Los Angeles film-production company, said the cause of death was hepatitis, which Mr. Tan contracted on a trip to China last year.
        Mr. Tan made three feature films: ''Dark Night'' (1986), ''Split of the Spirit'' (1987) and ''Rouge of the North,'' which was in the Museum of Modern Art's New Directors/New Films series in 1988.
        Mr. Tan studied law at National Taiwan University, and came to the United States in 1975. He was the Hollywood editor and film critic for China Times and received a Master of Fine Arts degree in film making from the University of California at Los Angeles. He returned to Taiwan to make movies.
        He was a founding member of the Directors Guild in Taiwan.
        He is survived by his father, Tan Hsiang-san; his mother, Dolly, and his brothers, Henry, of West Haven, Conn., and Hank, of Vancouver, British Columbia.
