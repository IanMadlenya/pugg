        Walter T. Ridder, a retired news executive who helped create the Knight-Ridder, Inc., communications organization, died after a long illness Saturday in his home in McLean, Va. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Ridder retired as a member of the Board of Directors of Knight-Ridder in 1989 after a career that spanned 50 years. It included being a reporter for several Ridder papers, correspondent in Europe during World War II, publisher of the Gary, Ind., Post-Tribune for five years and head of the Washington bureau of the Ridder papers for many years.
        His grandfather, Hermann Ridder, emigrated from Germany to the United States before the end of the last century and bought an interest in a German-language paper, the Staats-Zeitung. It became the basis of the Ridder publishing group, which included 19 newspapers and radio and television stations when it merged with Knight newspapers in 1974.
        Walter Ridder received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria; three daughters, Cary Alberswerth, of Washington, D.C., Stephanie Beardsley, of Bethesda, Md., and Pamela Ridder, of New York City; a son, Victor F. (Rick), of Denver, Colo., and seven grandchildren. He is also survived by three sisters, Joan Challinor, of Washington, D.C., and Gretchen Nicholas and Esther Ridder, both of New York City, and a brother, Robert, of St. Paul.
