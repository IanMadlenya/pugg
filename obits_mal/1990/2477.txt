        Cyrus Levinthal, a scientist who spent 33 years researching molecular genetics, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, Columbia University announced.
        Dr. Levinthal's work in the 1960's directly linked genes and the proteins they encode, a major advance in the understanding of molecular genetics. He was the first scientist, Columbia said, to measure the size of an organism's genome -- a pair of chromosomes.
        He was also credited with demonstrating the instability of some molecular compounds, which in turn helped explain how genetic messages could be changed quickly to help organisms adapt to environmental changes.
        Headed New Department
        Dr. Levinthal joined Columbia University in 1968 as chairman of the newly created department of biological sciences, which had been formed by uniting the departments of zoology and botany. In 1969, he was appointed William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Biophysics, a chair he held at his death.
        Dr. Levinthal, who was born in Philadelphia, started his career in science as a physicist, earning a bachelor's degree in physics from Swarthmore College in 1943 and a doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1951. He served in the Navy in World War II.
        He worked in a succession of academic posts at the University of Michigan, the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before his appointment at Columbia.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Francoise Chasseigne; three daughters, Lisa, of Manhattan, Nina, of Paris, and Sarah Chartal of Toronto; two sons, David, of Tallahassee, Fla., and Zurich, and Adam, who lives in Marin County, Calif.
