        George W. Shine, a retired vice president of Avon Products and an official in an organization pressing for information about soldiers missing in Vietnam, died on Monday at his home in Southbury, Conn.  He was 80 years old.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Helen, said.
        Mr. Shine was a 1932 graduate of Boston College and served in the Army in Europe during World War II and with the Air Force during the Korean War. He was with Dennison manufacturing in Manhattan before joining Avon, where he was a vice president when he retired in 1971. He lost two sons in Vietnam. One, Jonathan, was killed in action, and the other, Anthony, is listed as missing in action. He was affiliated with the National League of Families of American P.O.W.'s and M.I.A.'s for about 10 years and was the organization's treasurer when he died.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Alexander, of Culver, Ind.; a daughter, Lieut. Col. Sarah Shine of San Antonio, and six grandchildren.
