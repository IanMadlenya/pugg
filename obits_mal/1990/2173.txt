        John J. Tullman, a lawyer who was an expert in medical malpractice litigation, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 years old.
        A 1924 graduate of New York University Law School, Mr. Tullman was an early leader in seeking compensation for victims of negligence by doctors. Colleagues said that he was the first New York lawyer to persuade a doctor to testify against another. He was a founder of the trial section of the New York State Bar Association and a president of the Metropolitan Trial Lawyers Association.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Natalie Kreisberg; two daughters, Claire Kraiman of Redding, Pa., and Paula Ulrich of Alberta; a son, Michael Kreisberg of Missoula, Mont., and four grandchildren.
