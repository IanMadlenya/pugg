        Dr. Graham founded the Headache Research Foundation at Faulkner Hospital in 1950 and was its director until he retired in 1986. His interest in headaches and their treatment began while he was a student at Harvard Medical School.
        After graduating in 1934, he joined a team of doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital who were operating one of the first clinics to deal with headaches. He devoted the next 50 years to seeking ways to ease pain and suffering for people with severe headaches.
        Dr. Graham had been a member of the teaching staffs of both Harvard Medical School and Tufts University School of Medicine and was chief of medical services at Faulkner Hospital from 1950 to 1974. He was also a member of the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals and a regent of the American College of Physicians, which in 1982 gave him its Menninger Award for his contributions to mental health.
        He developed new pharmacological treatments for migraine headaches and also a profile of people most succeptible to cluster headaches, a severe form of migraine. He was also a member of many professional societies and lectured on headaches around the world.
        In World War II he was a major in the Army Medical Corps.
