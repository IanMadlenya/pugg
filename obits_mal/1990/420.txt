        Bernard Bernstein, a lawyer and Treasury Department official who was a financial adviser to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower in World War II, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bernstein was one of a group of finance officers identified with Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., who pressed for hard-line proposals in dealing with postwar Germany. But career military officers and State Department officials who favored softer treatment, particularly on economic issues, prevailed.
        When his faction lost, Mr. Bernstein, an Army colonel, was removed from the Control Commission for Germany and put in charge of investigating cartels. He soon requested a return to civilian status.
        Mr. Bernstein was born in New York. He had bachelor's and law degrees from Columbia University. After practicing law, he joined the legal staff of the Treasury Department in 1933. He was promoted to assistant general counsel in 1938, and from 1940 to 1942 he administered foreign funds.
        After the war Mr. Bernstein was a legal adviser to the American Jewish Conference and was chairman of a committee of Jewish organizations dealing with proposals for treaties with enemy countries. He continued practicing law until his death.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Bernice Lotwin; three daughters, Elinor Balka of Forest Hills, Queens, Dr. Kate Bernstein of Manhattan and Anne Chesnin of Seattle; a brother, Hilliard, and a sister, Blanche, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
