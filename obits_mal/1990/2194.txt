        Brother Celestine George Burke, an educator who was a member of the Brothers of the Christian Schools for 63 years, died on Thursday at Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank, N.J. He was 81 years old and lived at the Christian Brothers Academy in Lincroft.
        He died of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the religious order said.
        Brother George was a teacher and administrator at schools in the Bronx, Staten Island and Yonkers for 48 years. He served as principal at Immaculate Conception School in the Bronx, Sacred Heart School, St. John's School and St. Peter's Junior High School in Staten Island. He was principal of St. Mary's School in Yonkers for six years, moving to St. Raymond's School in the Bronx in 1963. He returned to teaching in 1968 and retired in 1986.
        He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
