        Victor J. Siegel, former adminstrative vice president of the Bank Street College of Education, a private school for teachers, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Siegel had suffered from Parkinson's disease, but he died of pneumonia, his son, Andrew, said.
        Mr. Siegel joined Bank Street in 1960 and was responsible for assembling property and building the structure to house the college and its educational functions, which included publishing, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        He negotiated the contract for the first multi-cultural textbook for children with McMillan & Company in the early 1960's. He retired in 1974.
        Before joining Bank Street, Mr. Siegel was in charge of manufacturing and operations for A. Siegel & Sons, a family-owned cigar business in Manhattan and later Camden, N.J. The business was sold in the mid-1950's.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from Williams College in 1932.
        In addition to his son, Andrew, of Burlington, Vt., he is survived by a daughter, Claire Oppenheim of Heriot Bay, British Columbia, and two grandchildren.
