        Leonard Krieger, a historian and an authority on the emergence of the modern European state who in 1962 was the first scholar given the rank of University Professor by the University of Chicago, died yesterday at a Chicago hospital. He was 72 years old and lived in Chicago.
        A university spokesman said he had died of progressive palsy.
        In 1962 Dr. Krieger, who had taught history at Yale University for 16 years, went to Chicago to become University Professor of History. The post was created by Chicago's trustees to recognize especially outstanding work by teachers joining the faculty from positions elsewhere.
        Dr. Krieger's work dealt with a wide range of political and social thought in Europe, but he specialized in the history of modern Germany. Among books he wrote were ''The German Idea of Freedom,'' an examination of German liberalism published in 1957; ''Politics of Discretion'' (1965), ''Kings and Philosophers, 1689-1789'' (1970), ''An Essay on the Theory of Enlightened Despotism'' (1975) and ''Time's Reasons: Philosophies of History Old and New'' (1989).
        He was born in Newark and received a bachelor's degree from Rutgers University before going on to Yale, where he received a master's and doctorate in history and began teaching in 1946.
        In 1969, seven years after his appointment at Chicago, Dr. Krieger left to teach at Columbia University. He returned to his post at Chicago in 1972 and retired two years ago.
        He is survived by three sons: Alan, of South Bend, Ind.; David, of Denver, and Nathaniel, of Chicago, and five grandchildren.
