        Harold S. Coleman, a stockbroker for more than half a century, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Coleman, who graduated from Pace College, was for many years a senior partner in the firm of Bruns, Nordman & Rea and most recently was a first vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities.
