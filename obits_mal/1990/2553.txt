        Robert M. Post Sr., a New York lawyer for 50 years, died on Tuesday at his home in Indiantown, Fla. He was 76 years old and lived on Hutchinson Island, Jensen Beach, Fla.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Post specialized in corporate and real-estate work. He spent his career in private practice for Walter L. and Robert M. Post in Manhattan and in Hicksville, L.I. The firm was started by his father, Walter L., in 1903. The Manhattan branch closed three years ago.
        Mr. Post moved to Florida in 1980 and divided his time between Hicksville and Indiantown, practicing law until his death.
        A native New Yorker, he was a graduate of Harvard and of St. John's Law School.
        Mr. Post is survived by his wife, the former Miriam Hall; a son, Robert M. Jr. of Stuart, Fla., and a grandson.
