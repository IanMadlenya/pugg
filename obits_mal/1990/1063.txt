        Ray Atkeson, considered the dean of Northwest nature photography for his landscape images of Oregon, Washington and the Pacific coast, died of colon cancer on Friday at his home in Portland, Ore. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Atkeson's photographs were the subject of several books, starting with ''Oregon'' in 1968. He also produced photo essays on Washington, California and the Pacific Coast, including British Columbia. His last book ''Western Images,'' a retrospective, was published last year by the Graphic Arts Center Publishing Company.
        A New York Times 1971 review of his 130 pictures in the book ''The Pacific Coast'' said in part, ''One photo of an ice cave in Mount Rainier is a technical triumph, and even a wheatfield in Oregon looks great.''
        Mr. Atkeson was born on a farm near Grafton, Ill., but moved to the West Coast, winning his first commercial photography job in Oregon at the age of 21.
        In 1988 Gov. Neil Goldschmidt of Oregon named him as the state's photographer laureate.
        Mr. Atkeson, who also took photographs of mountaineering and skiing, had an honorary doctorate in fine arts from Linfield College, in Linfield, Ore.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a daughter, Eleanor Dubois, of Portland; three stepchildren, Rick Schafer, Lauralee Pryor and Susan Miller, also of Portland, and three grandchildren.
