        Geza Charles Paikert, a Hungarian emigre who worked to resettle his countrymen in upstate New York after the 1956 revolt in Hungary, died on Wednesday at Crouse Irving Hospital in Syracuse. He was 88 years old and lived in Syracuse.
        He suffered a stroke two weeks ago and died of congestive lung failure, his family said.
        Dr. Paikert, a professor emeritus at LeMoyne College, was an authority on migration patterns of nationalities in central Europe and wrote books and articles on the German populations in Hungary, Romania and Yugoslavia and related subjects.
        He was born in Ste. Agathe, Quebec, the son of an Austro-Hungarian diplomat serving in Canada, and graduated from the University of Budapest, where he received a doctorate in law and politics. In 1936, after study at Oxford, he became head of the Division of Intercultural Affairs in Hungary's Ministry of Education. Aided Wallenberg
        When German troops invaded Hungary in 1944, he volunteered to serve with the Swedish Red Cross in Budapest, working with the diplomat Raoul Wallenberg in attempts to gain the release of Jewish prisoners bound for concentration camps.
        In 1946 he went to England, and in 1947 he came to the United States. After a year as a guest lecturer at Syracuse University, he joined the faculty of LeMoyne as professor of history and political science. He retired in 1975.
        When Soviet troops put down the Budapest uprising in 1956, Dr. Paikert arranged resettlement in Central New York State for many Hungarians who fled the country.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ilona Kuun; a daughter, Maria Theresa Collins of Syracuse, and a son, Charles, of Manhattan.
