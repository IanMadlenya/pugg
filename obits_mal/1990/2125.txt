        Paul W. Bell, superintendent of the Dade County public schools for the last seven months, died of heart failure Tuesday at Baptist Hospital. He was 57 years old.
        He had served 31 years, starting as a teacher in the Dade County system, the nation's fourth largest. The school board elected him superintendent after 16 ballots last March. He succeeded Joseph Fernandez, who had left to oversee New York City's public schools.
        Mr. Bell is survived by his wife, Barbara, and four children, including two from a previous marriage.
