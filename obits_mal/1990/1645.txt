        Chester Zardis, an original slap-style string bass player who most recently appeared with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band in New Orleans, La., on July 16, died Tuesday at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. He was 90 years old and lived in New Orleans.
        Mr. Zardis died as a result of a stroke he suffered four weeks ago, his wife, Bertha, said.
        Mr. Zardis made his first recording in 1937 and toured the world with various Preservation Hall bands. When he soloed, he sat on a stool and shot his right leg out in time to the music. In 1973, as part of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, he recorded most of the music for Woody Allen's film ''Sleeper.''
        In later years he formed his own band and a documentary film by Preston McCullahan, ''Zardis,'' dealing with the bass player's life, was completed this year.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Bertha Triggs; 6 sons and 2 daughters; 16 grandchildren; 4 great-grandchildren, and 4 great-great grandchildren.
