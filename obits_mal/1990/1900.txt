        He was captain of the basketball and tennis teams at Princeton University in the 1949-50 season. He won several New England men's singles and doubles championships in tennis and was ranked among the region's top five players over the age of 35 and then over 45.
        Mr. Raleigh, who was born in Syracuse and graduated from Phillips Andover Academy, received a bachelor's degree from Princeton and a master's degree in business administration from Syracuse University. He served in the Navy at the end of World War II.
