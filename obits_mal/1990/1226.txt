        Raymond Huntley, an actor who specialized in comedy roles deflating pompous officialdom in a career on the stage, in movies and on television, died on Friday in Westminster Hospital here. He was 86 years old.
        One of Mr. Huntley's best-known roles was that of Sir Geoffrey Dillon, the crusty family lawyer in the British television series ''Upstairs, Downstairs.''
        He made his first stage appearance in 1922 in Birmingham, where he was born. During his long career the actor played judges, bank managers, churchmen, bureaucrats and other figures of authority. He could play them straight if necessary, but in comedy his natural dryness of delivery was exaggerated to the point where the character he was playing invited mockery as a pompous humbug.
        His films included ''Passport to Pimlico,'' ''I'm Alright Jack,'' ''Room at the Top'' and ''Hostile Witness.''
