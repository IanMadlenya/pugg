        H. George Decancq, who was in charge of construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, died of Parkinson's disease last Tuesday in a nursing home in Rochester. He was 88 years old and had lived in Lakehurst, N.J., until he entered the nursing home three years ago.
        Mr. Decancq, resident engineer on the bridge between Brooklyn and Staten Island, joined what was then called the Port of New York Authority in 1923, after graduating from Tri-State College in Angola, Ind. Except for an interval when he worked on the Panama Canal, he remained with what is now known as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey until 1959.
        After working in Panama, Mr. Decancq was put in charge of enlarging the Newark Airport and Port Newark. In 1951 he became the authority's chief engineer of construction.
        After leaving the authority, he became a resident engineer for Ammann & Whitney, consulting engineers, and continued work on the Verazzano Bridge. He retired in the early 1970's.
        Mr. DeCancq is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie Trappler; a son, Dr. H. George Jr., of Pittsford, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
