        Beazley had a 21-6 record in 1942, his only outstanding season in the majors. He pitched two complete games against the Yankees in the '42 Series and his victory in Game 5 gave St. Louis the championship.
        He never regained his form after suffering an injury during Army service and had an over all record of 31-12, finishing his career in 1949 with the Boston Braves.
        He owned a beer distributorship in Nashville and served on the Metro Nashville Council from 1974-76.
