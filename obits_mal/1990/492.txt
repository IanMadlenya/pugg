        John P. Carey, founder and president of the Carey Transportation Company until it was sold to Greyhound in 1961, died yesterday at the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old and had been a lifelong resident of Manhattan.
        Mr. Carey was the son of John P. Carey Sr., who started Carey Cadillac, the limousine-rental concern. The son, after graduating from Poly Prep in Brooklyn, began taking cars to Newark Airport, then the only commercial airport serving New York City, to pick up arriving passengers. The business grew into Carey Transportation.
        He is survived by two daughters, Constance, of Califon, N.J., and Dee-Dee Gallagher of Mount Kisco, N.Y.; a son, W. Ward, of Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I.; 16 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.
