        Hugo Cohn, an electrical engineer who helped develop radio beacons for distinguishing between friendly and enemy aircraft, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 102 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Cohn, a 1909 graduate of the Columbia University School of Engineering, founded the Covic Electric Company in 1910 and manufactured dental X-Ray and arcwelding equipment during World War I. In 1922, he founded the Radio Receptor Corporation, which in its early years manufactured crystal radio sets but later developed radio beacons and navigational equipment.
        During World War II, the company developed and built communications and navigation equipment, including beacon systems for landing airplanes in poor visibility and systems for identifying friendly and enemy aircraft. In 1957, Radio Receptor was merged with the General Instrument Corporation and Mr. Cohn retired to become a management consultant.
        He is survived by a son, Richard, of Highland Park, N.J., and three nieces and nephews.
