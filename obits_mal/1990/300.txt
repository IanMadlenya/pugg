        Georges Forest, Manitoba's most prominent champion of French-language rights, died on Wednesday night, apparently of a heart attack. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Forest had been celebrating a festival at a hotel when he collapsed. He had suffered a heart attack a few years ago.
        His major push for French-language rights in Manitoba started in 1976, when he challenged an English-language parking ticket in St. Boniface, the area of the city formally designated a bilingual community.
        He contended that court documents under the 1870 Manitoba Act, Manitoba's province constitution, must be written in both English and French, Canada's two official languages. His point was upheld in 1979 by the Canadian Supreme Court, reversing 89 years of English linguistic practice in Manitoba.
