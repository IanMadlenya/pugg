        Paul B. Halstead, a longtime official of the Cotton Textile Institute who was the oldest living graduate of Harvard College, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Clermont, Fla. He was 104 years old and lived in New Canaan, Conn., before he moved to Florida in 1962.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        A statistician by training, he joined the institute in 1927 and rose to the posts of secretary and secretary-treasurer. During World War II he was a member of the textile advisory committee of the Army-Navy Munitions Board. After the war he served as chief of the statistical division of the American Cotton Manufacturers Institute. From 1951 to 1954, he was head of the statistical department of Cone Mills.
        Mr. Halstead was born in Rapid City, S.D., and attended the University of Minnesota for two years before transferring to Harvard, where he graduated with honors in 1913.
        His wife, the former Vera Colton, died in 1980. He is survived by two sons, Paul, of Oakdale, L.I., and David, of Guilford, Conn.; four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
