        In 1945, after operating a food booth at a fair in Guadalupe, Ariz., Mr. Guerrero decided to try marketing commercially prepared enchiladas, tamales and other Mexican specialties.
        He enlisted several partners and started Rosarita. The company went public in 1959 and was sold to Beatrice Foods in 1961. Mr. Guerrero retired in 1972.
        Mr. Guerrero founded Division Juvenil, a recreational and cultural organization devoted to helping Mexican-American youth acclimate to American ways while preserving Mexican culture.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rosaura Castro; three sons, Adolfo and Fernando of Mesa and Pedro E. Guerrero of New Canaan, Conn.; three daughters, Maria Teresa Jaimes, Erminia Stechnij and Katharine Bradley, all of Mesa; 28 grandchildren, and 45 great-grandchildren.
