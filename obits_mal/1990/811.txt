        Dr. Kulka, who gave up his private practice two years ago, was born and educated in Vienna. He graduated from the University of Vienna Medical School and practiced there for several years before coming to the United States in 1931.
        He joined the New York University faculty in 1933 and also joined the staff of Bellevue Hospital, with which he was affiliated until 1979. He taught at the N.Y.U. Medical School for more than half a century.
        He was active in family planning at Bellevue and in the late 1960's founded a birth-control clinic in Harlem.
        He is survived by his wife, Charlotte; two sons, Dr. J. Peter, of Boston, and Michael, of Torrington, Conn.; two daughters, Catherine, of Vinalhaven, Me., and Elizabeth Dal Molin of Oyster Bay, L.I.; three grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
