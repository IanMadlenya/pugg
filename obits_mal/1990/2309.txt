        He died of pancreatic and liver cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Mintus, who was born in Manhattan, was a magna cum laude graduate of City College and did graduate work at Columbia University. He was a clerk in the recorder's office at City College in 1941 when he was accused of Communist activities during legislative hearings and was dismissed.
        Forty years later, Mr. Mintus was among several former teachers and other employees who received an apology from the Board of Higher Education for their dismissal.
        He served with the Queens mental health group for a decade and retired in 1981.
        Mr. Mintus is survived by his wife, the former Helen Agin; a son, Paul, of the Bronx; a daughter, Lenore Green of West Nyack, N.Y.; a sister, Sally, who lives in California, and a grandson.
