        Michel Katcharoff, a dancer and former regisseur of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, died Oct. 25 at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. He was 82 years old and lived in Arlington.
        He died after a fall, said his nephew, Edward Kocharian, who said Mr. Katcharoff also had Parkinson's disease.
        Mr. Katcharoff (who sometimes used Mikhail and Michael as variants of his first name) was born in Iran of Armenian parents and studied ballet in Russia and Paris. He danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes from 1932 to 1938, when he joined the newly formed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. In 1944 he was appointed that company's regisseur, conducting rehearsals and overseeing performances.
        Mr. Katcharoff joined the Chicago Opera Ballet as stage director in 1958 and the Ballets de Monte Carlo in 1966.
        He is survived by his nephew.
