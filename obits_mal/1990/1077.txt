        Abram J. Shorin, one of four brothers who founded the Topps Chewing Gum Company and its ubiquitous line of baseball cards, died of a heart attack on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami Beach, Fla. He was 91 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        Mr. Shorin, who had studied to be a concert painist and still played for family and friends, had been vice president of marketing at the Brooklyn-based Topps company for many years and was credited with the idea for including cards that featured pictures of major league baseball players and their career statistics in packages of chewing gum.
        The cards, which were introduced in 1951, were a hit with youngsters, and the company issued other cards featuring football and hockey players, entertainment personalities like Elvis Presley, and Wacky Packs with stickers that spoofed product advertising.
        Currently, there are cards featuring New Kids on the Block, a pop musical group, and the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. Mr. Shorin was chairman when he retired in 1972 and moved to Florida. He was active in Jewish charities, including B'nai B'rith and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
        He is survived by two sons, Robert, of Syosset, L.I., and Philip, of Manhattan; a daughter, Joan Hart of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
