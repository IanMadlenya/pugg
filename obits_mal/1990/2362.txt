        Herbert B. Maw, who served two terms as Governor of Utah in the 1940's, died Saturday. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Maw died in a Salt Lake City nursing home of old age, said his son Warren.
        Mr. Maw was born March 11, 1893, in Ogden, the Territory of Deseret. Three years later, the territory became the state of Utah.
        He received a law degree from the University of Utah in 1916 and a doctorate from Northwestern University in 1927. In World War I, he was a pilot and was among the army's first Mormon chaplains.
        A Democrat, Mr. Maw was first elected Governor in 1940. He initiated measures to simplify government and for liberalizing labor laws and welfare programs. As a prominent member of the Council of State Governments, he was a strong advocate of state's rights.
        At 93, Mr. Maw was still practicing law. In an interview in 1984, he said he still walked three miles a day in a habit he developed in the days when he could not afford a trolley ride.
        He is survived by two sons and two daughters, 19 grandchildren and 31 great-grandchildren.
