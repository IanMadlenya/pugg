        Luigi Beccali, a prominent and popular long-distance runner in the 1930's and the gold medalist in the 1,500-meter run at the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, died of natural causes Tuesday in Rafaello, Italy. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Beccali, a native of Milan, won his gold medal in a dramatic and unexpected fashion, overtaking the field in the final meters. He returned to Italy as a national hero, and his winning time (3 minutes 51.2 seconds) set an Olympic record.
        In September 1933, he set the world record in the 1,500 meters with a time of 3:49.00. That record stood for nine months until it was broken by Bill Bonthron (3:48.8).
        Mr. Beccali raced many times in the United States after his Olympic victory and eventually moved to the United States and opened a wine company.
        He is survived by his wife, Aida; a son, Gene, and two granddaughters, Mireille and Jessica.
