        Roger Garlock Barker, an educator and psychologist, died Monday at his home in Oskaloosa, Kan. He was 87 years old.
        His son, Jonathan Barker of Toronto, said he died of a stroke.
        Dr. Barker was educated at Stanford University and received a Ph.D. in 1934. He taught at the University of Iowa, Harvard University, the University of Illinois, Clark University and Stanford before joining the faculty of the University of Kansas, where he was chairman of the psychology department. He retired in 1971.
        Dr. Barker was a founder of environmental psychology, a branch that focuses on the way social and physical environments influence actions and behavior. In 1948, along with Dr. Herbert F. Wright, he created a psychological field station in ''Midwest,'' the name given to Oskaloosa as part of research into life as it occurs in a town of 750 people. The laboratory continued until 1972.
        Besides his son, Dr. Barker is survived by his wife, the former Louise Shedd; a daughter, Celia Lottridge of Toronto; two sisters, Amanda Lee Knowles of Palo Alto, Calif., and Lucy Henighan of Seymour, Tenn., and six grandchildren.
