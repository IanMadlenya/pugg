        In April 1989 Mr. Verhoef landed at
        Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport en route to a gay and lesbian health conference in San Francisco.
        After the AIDS drug AZT was found in his luggage he was detained under a 1987 law that allows the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deny entry to visitors with AIDS or the AIDS virus.
        Supporters of AIDS patients intervened in his behalf, and Mr. Verhoef was released after five days and allowed to attend the conference.
