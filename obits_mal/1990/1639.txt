        Born in La-Seyne-sur-Mer on the Riviera, Mr. Vola helped found the quintet in 1934. He played bass on the first recordings by fellow group members Django Reinhardt, the guitarist, and Stephane Grappelli, the violinist.
        Mr. Vola later played bass in Ray Ventura's orchestra. He also backed up Benny Carter and Duke Ellington and the French singers Charles Trenet, Yves Montand and Georges Brassens.
