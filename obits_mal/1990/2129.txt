        Mr. Autori was born in Naples and educated in Italy. He came to the United States in 1928, and after relatively brief associations with the Chicago Civic Opera, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Federal Music Project in New York, served as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic from 1936 to 1945. After World War II, Mr. Autori, at the time conductor of the Chatauqua (N.Y.) Symphony, was invited to Poland by the Ministry of Art and Culture as a cultural ambassador.
        Mr. Autori became the associate conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1949, and held the post for 10 years, mostly under the directorship of Dimitri Mitropoulos. From 1961 to 1971 he conducted the Tulsa Philharmonic.
        Mr. Autori is survived by his wife, Ligia Berezynska Autori, a pianist.
