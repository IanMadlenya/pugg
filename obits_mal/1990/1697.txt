        Jan Stussy, a West Coast artist with works in many museums and private collections, died on Tuesday at his home in West Los Angeles. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Stussy's family said he died of a brain tumor.
        Mr. Stussy was a former chairman of the art department at the University of California at Los Angeles and the first artist to be appointed as a senior professor by the university. Although he was primarily known as a prolific painter, with some 5,000 works to his credit, Mr. Stussy frequently worked in other artistic arenas. ''Gravity Is My Enemy,'' a film he produced and directed, won an Academy Award in 1977 as best documentary.
        He is survived by a son, Dieter, and a brother, Kenneth, both of Los Angeles.
