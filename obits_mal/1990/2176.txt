        Peter Salm, professor emeritus of literature and German at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, died Sunday at University Hospitals in Clevland. He was 71 years old and lived in Cleveland Heights.
        He died after a heart attack, the university said.
        Dr. Salm was a specialist in the works of Goethe and other European literary figures. His translation of Goethe's "Faust" was first published in 1962 by Bantam and was revised by Dr. Salm in 1985.
        He was born in Hameln, Germany, and fled to Rome with his family in 1933 when Hitler came to power. In 1938 he came to the United States.
        He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles and received his doctorate in comparative literature from Yale University.
        After holding teaching fellowships at U.C.L.A. and at Yale, he joined the faculty of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., 1958. He went to Case Western Reserve in 1963 as an associate professor of German and became chairman of the German department and later chairman of the division of modern languages and literature. He retired in 1986.
        Professor Salm is survived by his wife, the former June Macy, and a son, Tony, who lives in Guatemala.
