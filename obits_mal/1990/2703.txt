        Max J. Bellest, former fashion consultant and licensing editor for Pierre Cardin, died on Wednesday at Bellevue Hospital Center. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of pneumonia, said Andrew Wargo, a business colleague for 20 years.
        Mr. Bellest joined the staff of Pierre Cardin in 1978 and remained with it until 1985, when he retired. He was responsible for developing the Cardin business in the United States, which included 30 companies manufacturing men's, women's and children's clothing.
        Before joining Cardin, he had been a representative for the fashion designer Nina Ricci since after World War II.
        He was born in Le Havre and educated in France. He came to the United States at the start of World War II and worked with the French diplomatic corps.
        He is survived by a sister, Genevieve Hanhart of Paris.
