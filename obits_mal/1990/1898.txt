       A. James Casner, the Austin Wakeman Scott emeritus professor of law at Harvard Law School, died Friday. He was 83 years old and lived in Nonquitt, South Dartmouth, and Cambridge, Mass.
        Professor Casner died after a brief illness, said a spokesman for the family, who declined to give the cause of death.
        Professor Casner joined the Harvard Law School faculty in 1938. In addition to teaching, he was associate dean from 1961 to 1967, acting dean from 1967 to 1968 and director of the Harvard Law School program of instruction for lawyers from 1953 to 1976.
        ''A. James Casner was one of the outstanding law teachers of his generation,'' said Robert C. Clark, dean of Harvard Law School. ''He played a major role in shaping American law in the fields of taxation and estate planning.''
        In the 1930's, Professor Casner began an association with the American Law Institute and over the years served as adviser for many of its projects. Among them were restatement of the law of property and trusts, the rule against perpetuities, powers of appointment and Federal income, gift and estate taxes. Many of the concepts that he helped formulate have since been incorporated in the Internal Revenue Code.
        He was a member of the Boston law firm of Ropes, Gray, Best, Coolidge and Rugg, now Ropes & Gray, from 1945 to 1958.
        He graduated from the University of Illinois and also studied at Columbia University.
        He is survived by two sons, Andrew of Weston, Mass., and Truman S. of Belmont, Mass.; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
