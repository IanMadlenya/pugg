        Gypsy Joe Harris, a welterweight contender whose boxing career ended with the discovery that he had concealed blindness in one eye, died on Tuesday. He was 44 years old.  Mr. Harris, who suffered four heart attacks in the last two years, died at Temple University Hospital, where he had been a patient since Feb. 10. His sister, Daaiyah Waheed, attributed the death to heart failure.
        Mr. Harris was born in Camden, N.J., and was raised in North Philadelphia. A street fight blinded his right eye when he was 11, but he pursued a boxing career anyway and won 24 of 25 fights.
        He lost his only fight on Aug. 6, 1968, in a decision to Emile Griffith, a former welterweight champion. A routine physical examination two months later by the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission showed that Mr. Harris was blind in his right eye, and his boxing license was revoked.
