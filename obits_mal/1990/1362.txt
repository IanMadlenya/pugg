        The last military dictator of Ecuador, Adm. Alfredo Poveda Burbano, died of a heart attack on Thursday in Miami, relatives in Quito said today. He was 64 years old.  Family members said Admiral Poveda died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami, where he had gone for treatment. His remains are to be returned to Ecuador for burial, the family said.
        Admiral Poveda headed the military junta that assumed power in 1976 from another military dictator, Gen. Guillermo Rodriguez Lara. But his junta wrote a constitution in 1978 and gave up power the next year, after the election of President Jaime Roldos.
        Born in Ambato, in the Andes, 85 miles south of Quito, Admiral Poveda received military education in the United States, Argentina and Brazil, and served as naval attache in Spain, France, Britain and West Germany.
