        Anthony D'Elia, executive director of the Adirondack Park Local Government Review Board, died of bone-marrow cancer on Saturday at Champlain Physicians Hospital in Plattsburgh. He was 70 years old and lived in Loon Lake.
        Outspoken against the Adirondack Park Agency since its creation in 1973, Mr. D'Elia began fighting after his subdivision plans for a Loon Lake property were derailed by agency restrictions.
        He joined the Adirondack Park Review Board in 1982 and became its executive director in 1983. The board was formed to advise the park agency, but spent most of its time fighting it.
        He is survived by two daughters, Andrea, of Montreal, and Barbara O'Connell of Clayburg, N.Y.; his mother, Norma, of Plattsburgh; three sisters, Theresa Gluck of Florida, Sue Vinsky, of California, and Rose Nauzey of Oregon, and a brother, Joseph, of North Carolina. He is also survived by his companion, Carol Long.
