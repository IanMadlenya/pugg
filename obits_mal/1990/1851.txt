        Augustus Dayton Clark, a retired Navy captain who played a significant role in the invasion of Normandy during World War II, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 90 years old and lived in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
        He died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.
        A 1922 Annapolis graduate, Captain Clark was commander of Force Mulberry A, a plan to build an artificial harbor just offshore of Omaha Beach at Normandy, complete with huge, pre-fabricated docks capable of handling oceangoing ships and landing craft. An outer breakwater was created by scuttling 23 ships in a row off the beach, and British-built concrete docks and caissons were towed to the site. The feat was accomplished at the height of the D-Day invasion.
        Just 10 days after the invasion began, almost 200,000 troops, 27,000 vehicles and 69,000 tons of supplies began to be unloaded there.
        Captain Clark retired from the Navy in 1945 and joined the advertising department of The Philadelphia Bulletin.
        He is survived by a nephew, the Rev. Charles H. Clark, the rector of St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H.
