        Michel Drach, a director who along with Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut helped create the New Wave style of film making, died on Thursday. He was 59 years old.
        About 200 people attended his burial today at Pere-Lachaise Cemetery here. Mr. Drach died of lung cancer at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb.
        The mourners included his wife, the actress Marie-Josee Nat, and his son, David, as well as the director Costa-Gavras and the writer Gilles Perrault, whose novel ''Le Pullover Rouge'' was adapted to film by Mr. Drach in 1979.
        Mr. Drach made his film debut in 1959 with the well-received ''On N'Enterre Pas le Dimanche.'' Working at the same time as Truffaut, Mr. Godard, and Claude Chabrol, he experimented with the fresh, freewheeling cinematic style that eventually became known as the New Wave.
        In 1974, he directed ''Les Violons du Bal,'' a dark tale based on the anti-Semitism he experienced as a child during the Nazi occupation. In ''Le Pullover Rouge,'' he turned his camera to crime in Marseilles, making a strong case against the death penalty for the killers of a young girl.
        His last film, ''Il Est Genial, Papy,'' in 1987, featured his friend Guy Bedos, who was among those attending the burial today.
