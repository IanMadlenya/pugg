        Stanley Lesse, a psychiatrist and an attending neurologist at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68 years old.
        Dr. Lesse died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He taught neurology at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Dr. Lesse was president of the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy and editor in chief of The American Journal of Psychotherapy. He maintained a private practice in Manhattan.
        He was the author of six books, the most recent of which was "The Purpose Is Tomorrow: 25 Years of Editorial Opinion About the Health Care System" published in 1989 by the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy, and many articles.
        One of the early researchers in the field of psycho-pharmacology, he was chairman of the National Academy of Practice in Medicine in Washington, a lobbying group for physicians.
        Dr. Lesse was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson Medical College. He also received a degree from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Ostrow; and a sister, Helene Sherwin of Norwalk, Conn.
