        Floyd R. Newman, an industrialist who gave millions of dollars to Cornell University, died Oct. 10 at Medina Community Hospital in Ohio. He was 99 years old and lived in Medina.
        He died of pneumonia, his secretary, Ann McFadden, said.
        Mr. Newman was a founder of the Allied Oil Company and made his fortune in oil refining and oil transportation.
        A 1912 graduate of Cornell University with a degree in chemical engineering, Mr. Newman showed his gratitude to the school for leading him into the oil industry by contributing more than $10 million for four professorships and directorships of athletics for women and the Cornell Plantations. He also contributed to the building of the F.R. Newman Laboratory of Nuclear Studies, Helen Newman Hall and the F.R. Newman Arboretum.
        Mr. Newman started in the oil business in 1912 after a Cornell professor told him of a training program being offered by Standard Oil of New York. He worked for Standard Oil in China, marketing oil until 1916, then served as a lieutenant in the Army in Europe in World War I. He was with the American Petroleum Company from 1919 to 1925, and then he and a partner, W. W. Vanderveer, founded Allied Oil. Allied merged with the Ashland Oil Refining Company in 1948, and Mr. Newman retired.
        He is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Wilds of Greenwich, Conn; a son, John, of Raywood, Tex., five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
