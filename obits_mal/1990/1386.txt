        Mr. Seaver was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Cornell. In World War I he volunteered for service in France. When the United States entered the war he became a pursuit pilot in the Army Signal Corps, and was severely injured in a crash.
        Returning home he joined Belding Heminway, now Belding Heminway Corticelli, and rose to become general manager of its mills before he retired in the mid-1970's.
        He is survived by a son, Richard, of Manhattan; a daughter, Joan Aichner of Danville, Va.; two sisters, Ann Johnston of Pompano Beach, Fla., and Abbie Jameswon of Manchester, N.H.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
