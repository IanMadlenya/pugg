        Harold McCusker, a schoolteacher who became prominent in Northern Ireland politics, died in a hospital Monday after a 16-year battle with cancer, his family announced. He was 50 years old.
        Mr. McCusker was a member of the British Parliament for 16 years, representing the Official Unionists, the mainstream Protestant party in Northern Ireland. He was deputy leader of the party from 1982.
        An eloquent speaker, he campaigned for tougher measures against the Irish Republican Army.
        Mr. McCusker strongly opposed the 1985 British-Irish Agreement that gave the Irish Republic a voice in running the province. He served a four-day jail sentence in January 1987 for not paying the annual $75 car tax to protest the accord.
        Mr. McCusker is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and three sons, Moore, James and Colin.
