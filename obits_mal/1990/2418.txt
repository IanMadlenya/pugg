        Frank Coss, a former executive vice president of the Deutsch, Shea & Evans advertising agency, died last Wednesday in Oxford, England. He was 63 years old and had lived in Weston, Conn., for many years before retiring in 1984.
        He died of throat cancer, the agency said.
        Mr. Coss, who was born in Toledo, Ohio, was a graduate of Northwestern University. He served for 33 years with Deutsch, Shea & Evans, which specializes in personnel recruitment, and rose to become executive vice president in charge of research.
        He and his wife, the former Barbara Shaw, who survives, traveled in Europe and Africa for the last six years.
