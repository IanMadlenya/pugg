        J. Wilmer Mirandon, a banker, New York State official and retired chairman of a tuition-aid program, died of lymphoma on Friday at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Canter in Hanover, N.H. He was 69 years old and had homes in Weathersfield, Vt., and Manhattan.
        Mr. Mirandon, a native of Paterson, N.J., received bachelor's and law degrees from George Washington University. He was an agent and supervisor with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Illinois, Iowa and New York for 10 years before joining Chemical Bank in 1960.
        At Chemical he rose to senior vice president for human resources in 1971. Two years later he was named president of the New York State Higher Education Assistance Corporation and in 1974 he took on added duties encompassing aid to medical schools and the state's tuition assistance program.
        He later became chairman of United Student Aid, an organization backed by banks, colleges and foundations, which made guaranteed loans to students, and achieved a markedly lower default rate than government programs. He retired in 1987.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Barbara Lewis, and a son, Peter, of Manhattan.
