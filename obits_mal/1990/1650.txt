        Dr. Frost, a 1929 graduate of the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine in Cleveland, became interested in Custer a decade later when he was studying the history of shoes and boots. He collected footwear worn by notables; a pair of boots worn by Custer in the Civil War was included in a display in his office.
        He wrote 13 books, most of them about Custer but also including biographical works on Gen. Philip Sheridan, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant and Thomas A. Edison.
        Dr. Frost, also a pioneer in foot surgery, received a medal from the French Government in 1952 for research into prevention of recurring ingrown toenails. He taught at the Illinois College of Podiatric Medicine in Chicago and at his alma mater.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Ethel Duby; a daughter, Jill Merke of Detroit; a sister, Audrey Klein, and a brother, Jack, both of Toledo, Ohio.
