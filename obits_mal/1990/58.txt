        Mr. Abe. was chairman of the Nisshin Steel Company, Ltd., of Japan and led Japanese steelmakers in investing in the steel industry in the United States. Under his leadership, Nisshin purchased a large interest in the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation in April 1984. The investment led to the establishment of Wheeling-Nisshin, Inc., a joint venture created to produce a specialty steel in Follansbee, W. Va.
        Mr. Abe began his career in the steel industry with the Nippon Steel Corporation in 1938, shortly after graduating from Tokyo Imperial University with a degree in economics. He was named to the company's board in 1965 and three years later he was named managing director. He became a vice president in 1977, but left in 1980 to join Nisshin Steel as president. In 1985 he was named chairman of Nisshin, a position he held at the time of his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Masa, and two sons, Ken of New York and Tokyo, and Tetsu of Tokyo.
