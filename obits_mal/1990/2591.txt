        Hugh S. Wertz, a patent lawyer who was with the Bell Telephone System for almost four decades, died on Dec. 8 at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. He was 81 years old and had retired to Rossmoor in Monroe Township, N.J., 15 years ago after having lived in Short Hills, N.J., and on Long Island.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Wertz, who held degrees in electrical engineering, law and business administration, joined Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., in 1934 and later moved to Western Electric in Manhattan, retiring in 1973 as assistant general counsel.
        His wife, the former Dorothy Darby, died in 1986. Surviving are three daughters, Elynor Stoughton of Virginia Beach, Va., Diana Adele of Orange, Calif., and Wendy Alexander of South Orange, N.J.; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
