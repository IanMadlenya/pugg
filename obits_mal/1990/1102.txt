        David Rappaport, a dwarf who played a win-at-any-cost lawyer known as ''Mighty Mouth'' in the television series ''L.A. Law,'' was found dead in a park of what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the police said. He was 38 years old.  The police found his body on Wednesday evening at Laurel Canyon Park in the San Fernando Valley, said Sgt. William Davidson. Mr. Rappaport's manager, Frankie Leigh, had filed a missing persons report on Monday, saying the actor was depressed.
        On March 4, the actor had attempted suicide by inhaling automobile exhaust. The police found him in a car in Hollywood and resuscitated him.
        The English-born actor, who was 3 feet 11 inches tall, appeared in several episodes of NBC's ''L.A. Law'' since late 1988. He also starred in the 1986-87 television series ''The Wizard,'' about a scientist who invented high-tech toys and gadgets.
        He also appeared in ''Time Bandits,'' a 1981 British comedy film featuring John Cleese and Sean Connery.
        In an interview in 1988, Mr. Rappaport said he had suffered discrimination because of his height and wanted simply to be treated like ''a regular, boring, normal person.''
        ''I look at boring people every day,'' he said, ''and I say, 'God, I wish I could be like that,' but my lot is to be unique, special, so I have to put up with it. It's a hard life.''
