        Wendell Scott, the only black to gain prominence in stock-car racing, died Sunday. He was 69 years old and had suffered from spinal cancer.
        Scott competed in more than 500 Grand National races and finished in the top-five standings 20 times. He won 128 races in the lower Sportsmen division.
        Mr. Scott was portrayed by Richard Pryor in the 1977 film "Greased Lightning," which focused on his racing career. He got his chance in 1949 when the owner of a Danville race track, seeking to increase attendance, went to the police station looking for names of blacks with speeding records. The police gave the owner Mr. Scott's name.
        Over the years, inspectors often made Mr. Scott repair such things as chips in his car's paint before they allowed him to race, and he said some drivers deliberately tried to make him crash because he was black.
        Even his greatest victory had a sour note. In 1963, he won the Jake 200, a race in Jacksonville, Fla., for the Grand National division, what is now the Winston Cup series. But Buck Baker, whom Scott had lapped three times, was given the winner's trophy.
        When the victory ceremony was over and photographers had left, a race official apologized to Scott and gave him the winner's check of $1,150. Mr. Scott never got the trophy.
        He retired from full-time racing in 1973, but occasionally drove in races for several years afterward.
        Mr. Scott is survived by his wife, Mary; four daughters, Willie Ann Collie of Detroit, Deborah Scott Davis and Cheryl Scott Ashley, both of Atlanta and Sybil Lynne Scott of Danville, and three sons, Willie Scott, Frank Scott and Wendell Scott Jr., all of Danville.
