        Athos Menaboni, an artist whose paintings of birds were widely admired, died Wednesday. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Menaboni painted more than 150 species of birds, landscapes, seascapes and murals. In 1950, he published ''Menaboni's Birds,'' with a text by his wife, Sara. His work has been displayed at the American Museum of Natural History, the Kennedy Gallery and the National Audubon Society in New York.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister.
