        James Barker Smith, a retired resort owner, died Thursday at a nursing home in Portsmouth, N.H. He was 82 years old and lived in New Castle, N.H. His daughter-in-law, Brenda Smith, said he died of lymphoma. Mr. Smith bought Wentworth by the Sea in New Castle in 1946, when it operated only in July and August. In the following decades he built it into a major resort, open six months a year and employing more than 350 people. The hotel was sold in 1980 and closed after several changes of ownership.
        Mr. Smith was born in Pittsburgh, Kan., and attended the University of Colorado and Cornell University. He worked at the Park Lane Hotel in Denver and managed the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs and the Plaza Hotel in Houston before joining the Army Air Force in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Tasher; a son, James Barker 3d, of Rye, N.H., and two grandchildren.
