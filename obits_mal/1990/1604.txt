        His death was attributed to cardiac arrest, his executor said.
        Mr. Singer entered the securities industry in 1928 as a $12-a-week messenger boy after graduating from Stanford University. He was with Troster, Singer until 1977, retiring when the company merged with Spear, Leeds & Kellogg.
