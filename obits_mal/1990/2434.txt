        Dr. Ernest R. Duncan, professor emeritus of mathematics at Rutgers University and the author of several mathematics textbooks, died on Sunday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. He was 74 years old and lived in Bernardsville, N.J.
        He died of leukemia, his family said.
        He was born in Clyde, New Zealand, graduated from Otago University there and served as an inspector of schools for the New Zealand Education Department before coming to the United States in 1958. He received his doctorate from Columbia University.
        He wrote "Modern School Mathematics," published by Houghton Mifflin, and other texts used in schools in the United States and abroad.
        At Rutgers, Dr. Duncan was chairman of the department of curriculum and instruction at the Graduate School of Education before he retired in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lois Grave; two daughters, Erena, of Carlsbad, Calif., and Lois Lyon of Bernardsville; a son, Basil, of Guilford, Conn., and three grandchildren.
