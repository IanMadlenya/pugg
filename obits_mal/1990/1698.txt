        Dr. Leo I. Dana, a former Union Carbide research executive who specialized in low-temperature physics, died last Thursday in Canton, Ohio, at the age of 94.
        Before moving to Canton a year ago, he lived in retirement in Boca Raton, Fla., and had previously been a resident of Manhattan and of Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
        Dr. Dana spent his entire career at Union Carbide. When he retired in 1964, he was vice president of research and development for the corporation's Linde Division in Buffalo. He developed thermal superinsulation to ease the shipment of liquefied gases used in the metallurgical and chemical industries, synthetic sapphires and automotive antifreeze products.
        A native of Boston, he was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and held a doctorate from Harvard University. After postdoctoral research at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, he joined Union Carbide and in 1931 became manager of research and engineering development at the Linde Division.
        In World War II he was assigned to the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, and to do research on components of airplane radar.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sara Cooperstein; a daughter, Elinor Livingston of Canton; a son, Robert, of Lancaster, Pa.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
