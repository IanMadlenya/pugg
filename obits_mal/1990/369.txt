        Jack Gantz, a business executive, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at Mercy Hospital in San Diego, Calif. He was 76 years old and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., and Rye, N.Y.
        Mr. Gantz was chairman of the board of Empire Brushes Inc., a manufacturer of brooms and household brushes. He joined the family business at its manufacturing plant in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1935, shortly after graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He became president of the company in 1945, and in 1985 relinquished the post to his son, Joseph. The company moved to Greenville, N.C., but Mr. Gantz kept an office in Port Chester, where he was active in civic affairs.
        Besides his son, who lives in Greenville, he is survived by his wife, the former Sarita Dizik; a daughter, Elaine Berman, of Denver; two brothers, Harry, of Palm Beach, and Emanuel, of Harrison, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
