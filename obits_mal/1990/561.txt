        Rayburn Wright, a conductor, trombonist, arranger and teacher, died of cancer on Wednesday at his home in Rochester. He was 67 years old.
        For almost 19 years, Mr. Wright taught jazz and film scoring at the Eastman School, where he directed the Eastman Jazz Ensemble. After he retired last year, the school established the Rayburn Wright Award to recognize distinguished members of its faculty.
        Mr. Wright was born on Aug. 27, 1922, in Alma, Mich. He earned a Bachelor of Music in trombone performance from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in 1943 and received a master of arts from Columbia University Teacher's College in 1950.
        He was a trombonist and arranger in the United States Army Band as well as the Tony Pastor and Glenn Miller-Tex Beneke Orchestras. In 1965 he was named, along with Will Irwin, co-director of music and conductor of the orchestra at Radio City Music Hall. He also appeared as a guest conductor with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.
        Mr. Wright was the author of ''Inside the Score,'' a 1982 book about arranging, and wrote ''On the Track: A Guide to Contemporary Film Scoring,'' published this year, with Fred Karlin.
        In 1984, he won a Grammy Award for a recording of Aaron Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait'' by the Eastman Philharmonia. In 1986 he was named New York State Professor of the Year by the National Council for the Advancement and Support of Education.
        Surviving are his wife, Doris, and two sons, Drew, of Basking Ridge, N.J., and David, of Peeksill, N.Y.
