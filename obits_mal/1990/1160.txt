        Enno Poersch, a co-founder of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, died of AIDS on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 45 years old. Mr. Poersch, a graduate of Yale, was a set designer for the stage and films and had also worked as a graphic designer.
        He was one of a small group of homosexual men in Manhattan who formed the Gay Men's Health Crisis in the winter of 1981-82 to explore the origins of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, then a mysterious disease, and to provide support services for people with AIDS.
        Mr. Poersch was a director of the organization for three years and for many years helped raise money for it.
        He is survived by his parents, Herbert and Ingeborg Poersch and a brother, Ranier, all of Portland, Ore.
        His companion was Michael Hatoff of Manhattan.
