        Nguyen Van Tam, who served as Prime Minister to Emperor Bao Dai of Vietnam from 1952 to 1953, died on Friday, his family said on Monday. He was 97 years old.
        The cause of death was not given for Mr. Nguyen, who lived in exile here since 1955, when the Vietnamese monarchy was abolished after the country won independence from France the previous year.
        Mr. Nguyen became Prime Minister after holding several ministerial posts beginning in 1946. He was nicknamed the Tiger of Cai Lay for eliminating Communist resistance groups in the Cai Lay region of the Mekong Delta.
