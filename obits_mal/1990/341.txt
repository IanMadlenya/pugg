        Mr. Lasek founded the family-owned company 25 years ago. It distributes fabric, furniture, lamps and accessories to decorators in 16 cities. The concern grew out of a nucleus of 16 fabric companies he owned, among them J. H. Thorpe, Isabel Scott and Peter Schneider in Manhattan.
        Mr. Lasek also owned two silk mills, in Paterson, N.J., and in Long Island City, Queens, and a textile-printing plant in Norwich, Conn. All are run by his family. He was born in Passaic, N.J.  Surviving are his wife, the former Elizabeth Dods; two sons, Stefan, of Centerport, and Robert Jr., of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; a sister, Gloria Tongue of West Orange, N.J., and six grandchildren.
