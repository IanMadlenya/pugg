        Michael Cheilik, associate professor of history at Lehman College, died yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, Jacob Judd, chairman of the history department, said.
        Dr. Cheilik joined the faculty at Hunter College, another City University of New York school, in 1965 and moved to Lehman in 1970. He was a linguist and spoke fluent French, German, Italian and Russian and read Greek, Latin and early Semitic languages.
        He wrote several books, including textbooks on ancient Greek and Roman history and architecture. He also wrote two books on Bronx architecture.
        He was a graduate of City College and received an M.A. and Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University.
        Dr. Cheilik is survived by a brother, Philip, of Rockville, Md. His companion for many years was George Vincent.
