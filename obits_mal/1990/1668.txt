       Roderick Cook, the British-born stage and film actor who was perhaps best known for his 1972 Off Broadway revue ''Oh Coward!'' in which he adapted and performed the works of Sir Noel Coward, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 58. Dan V. Fuller, his business manager, said Mr. Cook died of what appeared to be a heart attack.
        Roderick Cook, the British-born stage and film actor who was perhaps best known for his 1972 Off Broadway revue ''Oh Coward!'' in which he adapted and performed the works of Sir Noel Coward, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 58. Dan V. Fuller, his business manager, said Mr. Cook died of what appeared to be a heart attack.
        The revue, which won critical acclaim and was revived and updated in 1981 and again in 1986, was a culmination of a long study of Sir Noel's music, plays and performing career. In 1968, two years before ''Oh Coward!'' Mr. Cook devised ''Noel Coward's Sweet Potato,'' an anthology in a similar vein.
        Mr. Cook, who later became an American citizen, made his stage debut on Broadway in ''Kean,'' which starred Alfred Drake. Other plays in which he appeared in this country included a revival of ''The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' in which he played a Coward-like character, and ''Woman of the Year.''
        Among the films in which he had roles were ''Amadeus,'' ''9 1/2 Weeks'' and ''Garbo Talks.''
        Mr. Cook, a graduate of Queen's College, Cambridge, performed in British films, West End musicals, Shakespearean repertory and television before coming to the United States shortly before his 1961 appearance in ''Kean.''
        Mr. Cook is survived by his stepfather, Reece Clements of Grays, England.
