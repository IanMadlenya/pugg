        Helio Smidt, the president of Varig Brazilian Airlines, died of cancer yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. He was 64 years old and lived in Rio de Janeiro.
        Mr. Smidt, who was of German extraction, joined Varig, now Latin America's largest airline, at the age of 19 as an office clerk in Porto Alegre, Brazil, where the line was founded in 1927.
        He was named regional director for Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in 1957 and three years later was appointed director of administration and control. He was elected president of the employee-owned airline in 1980 and guided it through some difficult times.
        Varig's 28,500 employees own 86 percent of the voting stock of the company through a foundation created in 1945 by stockholders, who relinquished their shares of the company to the foundation.
        In 1988, while other airlines in South America were sinking in debt or struggling because of inflation, Mr. Smidt had Varig opening new routes, and adding three Boeing 747's to its fleet of 84 airplanes.
        He was also president of the Varig Group, a holding company with 25 subsidiaries and was named Brazil's Man of the Year in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma; a daughter, Eliana Pinto of Sao Paulo, and a grandson.
