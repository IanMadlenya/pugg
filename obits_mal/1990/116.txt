        Grady Lee Huffman, who was shot 17 times in 30 years of robberies, burglaries and prison escapes, died of cancer Tuesday. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Huffman was paroled in 1967 and led a quiet life since then, said his son Grady Jr., who recounted his father's life of crime.
        Mr. Huffman's first brush with the law came in Waco in 1932 when he was 16. He stole a car but collided with a car driven by the sheriff.
        He picked up the nickname ''Baby Bandit'' at 18, on a day he led Fort Worth police on a chase. He was captured after he was shot in the face.
        Sentenced to 25 years in prison, he escaped for four days in 1942, escaped for four months in 1943, tried another escape that year and escaped in 1944 and remained free for 20 months.
        In spite of his record, Mr. Huffman was one of 10 convicts pardoned in 1947 by an outgoing Governor, Coke R. Stevenson. Two years later, he was sentenced to 399 years in prison for robbery.
        He is survived by a sister and two sons.
