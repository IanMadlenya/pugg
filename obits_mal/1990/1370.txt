        Nick Kerbawy, a former general manager of the Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons, died of cancer Thursday. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Kerbawy and Coach Buddy Parker made the Lions one of the best teams in the 1950's, when Detroit won three National Football League championships and four division titles. In 1958, Mr. Kerbawy moved to basketball, taking over the Pistons a year after their move from Fort Wayne, Ind.
        After he was dismissed by the Pistons' owner, Fred Zollner, in 1961, Mr. Kerbawy sued for breach of contract, winning almost $1 million in 1967.
