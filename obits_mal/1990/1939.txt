        He died of kidney failure, his brother, William, of Brielle, said.
        Mr. Cunniff was currently a partner in the Manhattan firm of Stokes Hoyt & Company, which he joined in 1977 when it acquired Cunniff Lamm Stoutenberg & Flannagan, his prior firm. He became a member of the New York Stock Exchange in 1943 and formed Cunniff Romaine Lamm & Stoutenberg in 1967. The name changed in 1973, four years before its merger with Stokes Hoyt.
        In addition to his brother, he is survived by another brother, John, of Walpole, N.H., and a sister, Eileen Whatley of North Branch, N.J.
