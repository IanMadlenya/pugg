        Vincent Chalk, the teacher who won an important legal ruling that protects the jobs of public employees who have AIDS, died on Tuesday at Coastal Community Hospital in Santa Ana, Calif. He was 45 years old and lived in Long Beach, Calif.
        Mr. Chalk's death came more than three years after he was told that he was suffering from the disease, one of his lawyers, Marjorie Rushforth, said yesterday. He was admitted to the hospital last Thursday.
        When Mr. Chalk, who taught hearing-impaired children in public schools in Orange County, informed his superiors early in 1987 that he had AIDS, he was transferred to a desk job.
        He sued the county Department of Education, and in November 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned a lower court ruling and ordered his reinstatement as a teacher.
        Mr. Chalk's companion was John Woesner. He is also survived by his parents, Leroy and Faye Chalk of Lewis, Kan., and two sisters, Lucinda Haag of Orem, Utah, and Jocelyn Venable of Wichita, Kan.
