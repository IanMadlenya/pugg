        Mr. Sorin was also president and chairman of the Armo Air Conditioning and Cooling Company in Manhattan. It opened in 1928 and was one of the first to bring air-conditioning to New York movie theaters and to Macy's in the 1930's and 40's. The business closed when Mr. Sorin retired in 1976.
        He was also active in philanthropic affairs and was a member of the board of trustees of the Bronx Lebanon Hospital and a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
        In 1988, he established a teaching fellowship at Hofstra University's School of Business and, as part of the school's beautification program, the Amy Arzt Shakespeare Garden, in memory of his sister-in-law.
        Mr. Sorin is survived by his wife, the former Henrietta Arzt, and a brother, Murray, of Manhattan.
