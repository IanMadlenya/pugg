        William P. Slichter, a former executive director at A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., whose research contributed to the development of the semiconductor, died on Thursday at his home in Chatham, N.J. He was 68 years old.
        He died of cancer, a company spokesman said.
        Dr. Slichter's 37-year career was devoted to research on polymers and semiconductors, components of the electronic chips used in computers and telephones. He received the American Physical Society Prize in 1970 and the Earle Barnes Award for Research Management from the American Chemical Society in 1988.
        He joined Bell Laboratories in 1950 as a member of the technical staff in the polymer research department. He was also involved in studies of semiconductor crystals.
        Dr. Slichter was appointed head of the chemical physics research department in 1958 and became chemical director in 1967. He was named executive director of research in the material science and engineering division in 1973. He retired in 1987.
        He was a member of the National Materials Advisory Board, chairman of a study on engineering research centers for the National Science Foundation and a member of the human rights committee of the National Academy of Science.
        He was a member of the editorial board of Science Magazine, the Journal of Polymer Science, and Advances in Polymer Science. In 1976 he was named Charles Hurd Lecturer for the chemistry department at Northwestern University.
        He was born in Ithaca, N.Y., and was a graduate of Harvard University, where he also received a master's degree and a doctorate.
        A widower, he is survived by three daughters, Carol Dougherty of Larchmont, N.Y.; Catherine Slichter-Aiuto of Manhattan, and Margaret Van Cott of Nantucket, Mass.; a brother, Charles, of Champaign-Urbana, Ill., and two grandchildren.
