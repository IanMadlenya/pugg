        Charles J. Scanlon, a former banking executive and financial officer for General Motors, died on Thursday at his home in Essex, Conn. He was 75 years old.
        He died of liver failure after a brief illness, a spokeswoman for the family said.

        Before joining General Motors, Mr. Scanlon was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
        He was born in Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University and from the Sonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Peggy Hemmens; two daughters, Barbara Brodt of Muncie, Ind., and Lisbeth Fairfield of Convent Station, N.J.; a sister, Mary Louise Hendrickson of Oak Brook, Ill., and five grandchildren.
