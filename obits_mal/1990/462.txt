        Lord Maclean, the former chief official of Queen Elizabeth II's household and organizer of the 1981 wedding of the Prince of Wales, died on Thursday, his family announced today. He was 73 years old.
        Lord Maclean died at Hampton Court Palace, a former royal residence in London, where he was chief steward since 1985. The announcement gave no cause of death.
        The Scottish baron, who was chief of Clan Maclean, was Lord Chamberlain from 1971 until his retirement in 1984.
        He established a reputation as a perfectionist in royal ceremonies while overseeing the Queen's household.
        The wedding of Prince Charles, the Queen's eldest son, and Lady Diana Spencer in St. Paul's Cathedral was a highlight of his term.
        Officer in World War II
        Lord Maclean served as a Scots Guards infantry officer in World War II, fighting in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. After the war, he became a sheep and cattle farmer.
        In 1959, he became leader of the Boy Scouts in Britain and the Commonwealth, and remained in that post until 1975.
        Lord Maclean's first ceremonial assignment as Lord Chamberlain was the 1972 funeral of the Duke of Windsor, who as King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson. The assignment was difficult because of the bad feeling engendered by the abdication among members of the royal family. But Lord Maclean was judged to have handled the arrangements with great skill.
        Lord Maclean also organized the silver wedding celebration of Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, that year.
        There was no immediate word on funeral arrangements.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Mann, and two children.
