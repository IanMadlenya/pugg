        Mr. Wayne and Frank Shuster had a long career as Canada's best-known comedy team, starting with a Boy Scout fund-raising show they did on radio in 1930.
        In 1950, they began appearing as guests on various American television programs. They made 67 performances on the Ed Sullivan show.
        John Louis Wayne was born May 28, 1918, one of seven children of a Toronto clothing manufacturer.
        Of the team's experiences entertaining troops during World War II, Mr. Wayne said, ''We had the distinction of being the only military unit in World War II that was fired on deliberately by all sides.''
        By 1947, the team had a regular CBC show with a live audience. In 1985, its comedy specials began playing on television in 22 countries, and was dubbed in French, German, Italian and Spanish.
        He is survived by three sons. His wife, Bea, died in 1982.
