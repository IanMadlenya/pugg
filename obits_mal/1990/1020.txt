        Morris Levy, an owner of record companies and nightclubs who was under a Federal sentence of 10 years in prison on an extortion conviction, died of liver cancer on Monday at his home in Ghent, N.Y. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Levy was the owner of the Manhattan jazz club Birdland in the 1940's and 50's. At his death he was the president of Roulette Records, one of the largest independent companies in recorded music. Among the hit records he produced were ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love?'' and ''Peppermint Twist.''
        Though relatively unknown to the public, Mr. Levy was a longtime power behind the scenes in the music industry. In 1988 a Federal jury in Camden, N.J., convicted him of conspiring to extort money from John LaMonte, a Philadelphia-area record distributor. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $200,000.
        Free on bail, Mr. Levy appealed, but the conviction was upheld last October by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia. The United States Attorney's Office in Newark said yesterday that no date had been set for Mr. Levy to surrender.
        In the 1970's Mr. Levy entered the retail record business, opening a chain of Strawberries record shops in the Northeast. Early last year he sold the chain, reportedly for $40.5 million.
        Mr. Levy, who was born in the Bronx, was a longtime resident of Ghent, in Columbia County, where he bought a 1,200-acre farm in 1968. He raised dairy cattle, hay and corn for several years before converting the property into a horse-breeding farm.
        Mr. Levy is survived by three sons, Adam, Simon and Daniel, all of Manhattan.
