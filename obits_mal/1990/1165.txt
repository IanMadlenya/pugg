        John W. Hanson, a businessman who imported industrial oils, died of lymphoma on Tuesday at his home in Huntington, L.I. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Hanson was the founder of the J. W. Hanson Company, a Manhattan-based importer of carnauba wax and oils used in manufacturing. In 1974, he acquired two other companies, the Industrial Oil Products Corporation and George Degen and Company, both importers of industrial oils, including tung oil from South America and rapeseed oil from Europe. In 1984, he also acquired A.C.T., a manufacturer of pollution-control devices for the metal-plating industry.
        The companies are now on Long Island, in Hicksville and Jericho, and he was active in them at his death.
        Mr. Hanson graduated from Princeton in 1939 and served in the Navy in the Pacific theater in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Polly Greenberg of Brooklyn; a son, John, of Huntington; two stepdaughters, Jennifer Burian of Manhattan and Allyson Burian of Chicago, and two sisters, Lorraine Babcock Wallace and Marion Smith, both of Springfield, Vt.
