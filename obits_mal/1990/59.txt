        Yvon C. Dihe, an advertising agency executive and a fashion industry publicity director known for his extravagant presentations, died of complications of AIDS yesterday at Doctor's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Born in Metz, France, and educated in Algiers, Mr. Dihe came to the United States about 20 years ago. He began his career with Bidermann Industries and became known for his flair and exuberance. He staged events with whimsical themes, like a party he presented in 1984 at the Seventh Regiment Armory celebrating Bidermann's 10th anniversary. It featured live camels, chefs brought from Morocco and celebrities sitting on cushions on the floor and eating with their fingers. He later represented the fashion house of Yves St. Laurent in New York and the Joffrey Ballet.
        About six years ago he formed his own advertising agency, L'Agence, and was its president.
        He is survived by his father, Christian Dihe of Metz.
