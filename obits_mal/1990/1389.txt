        Hubert J. O'Gorman, professor of sociology at Wesleyan University, died suddenly on Thursday at his doctor's office in Middletown, Conn. He was 64 years old and lived in Middletown.
        Dr. O'Gorman's specialty was pluralistic ignorance, in which a widely held view about a group of people proves to be erroneous. Before joining the faculty at Wesleyan in 1967 he taught at Hunter College, the City University of New York, Columbia University and the New York School of Psychiatry.
        He was the editor of several books, among them ''Sex and Morality in the U.S.: An Empirical Enquiry Under the Kinsey Institute'' (Wesleyan University Press; 1989), which challenged the notion that a sexual revolution took place in the 1960's, and ''Surveying Social Life'' (Wesleyan Press; 1987), a compilation of works by various social scientists.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from Columbia University, where he also received an M.A. and a Ph.D.
        Dr. O'Gorman is survived by his wife, the former Marion Holaves; a son, Hugh, of Middletown, and a granddaughter.
