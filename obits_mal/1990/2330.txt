        Benjamin Clapp, an engineer who helped develop television in the mid-1920's, died Monday at his home in Warlingham, England. He was 96 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his son, Gerald, said.
        Mr. Clapp worked closely with John Logie Baird, a Scot who was one of the pioneers of television. In February 1928 he took part in the first trans-Atlantic transmission of television pictures, from Covent Garden in England to Hartsdale, N.Y.
        In addition to his son, who lives in Surrey, he is survived by two grandchildren.
