        Professor Benson was on the Amherst faculty from 1947 until his death. From 1957 to 1967 he was also an associate in physics at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and from 1977 to 1990 he was an associate editor of the publication Marine Chemistry.
        His oceanographic research, in collaboration with a colleague, Daniel Krause, focused on the thermodynamics of the solubilities of gases.
