        Bradford Norman Clark, an engineer who was New York City's public works commissioner from 1963 to 1966, died Nov. 19 at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 83 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Clark was the administrative partner of Eggers & Higgins, the architectural firm with which he had been associated since 1924, when he received the appointment from Mayor Robert F. Wagner. The job was considered one of the toughest in city government because it involved walking a delicate line among contractors, architects, union leaders, city planners, bureaucrats and politicians.
        From 1958 to 1962 he was president of the New York Building Congress, whose members represented every area of the construction industry.  Served in Naval Reserve
        As an administrator of Eggers & Higgins, Mr. Clark supervised the construction of such buildings as Canada House at 680 Fifth Avenue and Manhattan College in Riverdale.
        He was born in Armonk, N.Y., and graduated from Pratt Institute in 1926 with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering. He later gained a second degree in civil engineering from New York University.
        From 1943 to 1946 he was on active duty with the Naval Reserve Civil Engineers Corps, with the rank of commander.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betty Hudson; three daughters, Eleanora Bell of Allentown, Pa., Phoebe Kline of Washington, and Sara Reeves of Alpine, N.J.; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
