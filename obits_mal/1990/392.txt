        Dr. Buckler joined N.Y.U.'s English department in 1953. He became a full professor in 1961 and was dean from 1960 to 1969 and vice chancellor for academic planning from 1969 to 1970. In 1965, he introduced one of the first undergraduate programs in Russian studies in the New York area. He went on medical leave in 1980.  Dr. Buckler was the author and editor of many works on 19th-century English writers. Among his books were ''The Victorian Imagination'' (1980, New York University Press), ''Mathew Arnold's Prose'' (1983, AMS Press), and, most recently, ''Walter Pater'' (1987, New York University Press).
        For a number of years, he edited The Victorian Newsletter, a publication for English language teachers and scholars. He was also a founder of the Thomas Hardy Society at N.Y.U. He was a frequent lecturer on ''Sunrise Semester,'' a long-running WCBS-TV program produced in cooperation with N.Y.U.
        Dr. Buckler was born in Loretto, Ky. He was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and received his doctorate from the University of Illinois.
        He is survived by five sisters: Martha and Sister Mary Rhodes, both of Louisville, Ky., Nancy, of Chicago, Susan Davis of Memphis, Tenn., and Sister Joyce of St. Louis.
        A memorial service will be held on Saturday at 1 P.M. at New York University's Catholic Center, 58 Washington Square South.
