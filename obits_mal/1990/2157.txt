        Frank Sinkwich, the University of Georgia football player who won the 1942 Heisman Trophy, died today in his home here after a long illness. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Sinkwich became the first player from the Southeastern Conference to win the Heisman, an award that is given annually by the Downtown Athletic Club to the college football player voted the best in the nation.
        "We've lost one of the great legends in football history," said Vince Dooley, Georgia's athletic director. "He was not only a great player but a wonderful person and citizen of Athens."
        Mr. Sinkwich, a halfback, led Georgia to an 11-1 record in 1942 and a 9-0 victory over U.C.L.A. in the Rose Bowl. In that season, he set S.E.C. records for passing and total offense, rushing for 795 yards and 17 touchdowns and completed 84 of 166 passes for 1,392 yards and 10 touchdowns. In his three-year college career, he ran for 2,271 yards and 30 scores and passed for 2,331 yards and 30 touchdowns.
        He was an All-Pro player for two years with the Detroit Lions. Then, after his playing days, Mr. Sinkwich, a Pennsylvania native, owned a beer and wine distribution business in Georgia.
        He is survived by a son, Frank Sinkwich Jr. of Athens; a daughter, France Minshew of Atlanta; and two sisters, Violet Flask of Youngstown, Ohio, and Eleanor Shuffelbager of Lehigh, Fla.
