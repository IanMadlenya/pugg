        Brother Urban Gonnoud, a member of the Order of St. Francis and a former teacher and president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn, died of heart failure on Saturday at the college faculty residence where he lived. He was 70 years old.
        Brother Gonnoud was president of St. Francis from 1958 until he retired in 1969. He continued to teach management courses at the college and was named professor emeritus in 1985. He had served as chief financial officer for the college from 1953 to 1958 and had previously taught history there.
        Brother Gonnoud, a 1950 graduate of St. John's University with a Ph.D. in American history, had previously taught at several high schools in Brooklyn and Long Island, including St. Anthony's, St. Francis Prep and St. Francis Xavier. He earned his master's degree from New York University. He had taken his perpetual vows in the Franciscan Order in 1942 and had served in many capacities, including assistant superior general.
        Under his guidance, the college began a two-phase relocation program, moving from the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn to Brooklyn Heights and the construction of several classroom and residence buildings.
        He is survived by four sisters, Mary Pahl of Centerreach, L.I., Agnes Coleman and Florence, both of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Helen Piccola of Catskill, N.Y., and two brothers, Walter, of Fairfax, Va., and Andrew, of Catskill.
