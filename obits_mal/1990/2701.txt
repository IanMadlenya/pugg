        He served with the Czechoslovak resistance in World War II and later was an editor of history books in Prague. He also served in the Government but was ousted in 1952 in the Stalin purges. He was active in the European Jewish Congress and in the International Conference of Christians and Jews and had recently traveled to Israel with President Vaclav Havel.
        He is survived by a son, Jan.
