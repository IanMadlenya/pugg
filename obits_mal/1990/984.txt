        On Tuesday, Pastor Larsen had a heart attack followed by bypass surgery, a spokesman for the refugee service said.
        Pastor Larsen headed one of 11 agencies resettling refugees here. He became executive director in 1985, after almost a year as director for policy and programs.
        From 1964 to 1988, Pastor Larsen was an executive of the National Lutheran Council and its successor, the Lutheran Council in the United States, where he worked in urban-church planning and mission research.
        He was born in Detroit and graduated from Concordia Seminary in St. Louis in 1947, when he was ordained. From 1957 to 1964, he was pastor in Seaside, Ore.; Spokane, Wash., and Detroit.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Rhoda Birner; three sons, Dan, of Peshawar, Paskistan, Donald, of River Edge, Timothy, of Deltona, Fla.; two daughters, Kristen Dufenberg of Columbia, Md., and Sue Ruth, of Kalamazoo, Mich., and five grandchildren.
