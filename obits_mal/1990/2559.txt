        He was born in Texas, reared in Gallup, N.M., and graduated from San Jose State University with a degree in journalism and public relations. After serving in the Air Force, he began his career in the sugar industry in the mid-1950's.
        Survivors include his wife, Alice, of Derwood; two daughters, Kathleen Gorman of Ellicot City, Md., and Jennifer Tighe of San Francisco,; and two grandsons.
