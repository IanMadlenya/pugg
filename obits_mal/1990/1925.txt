        He died of the effects of injuries suffered in a fall a year ago, his family said.
        Mr. McGrath wrote poems in a highly personal style about his own life and social concerns over the years from the Depression to the recent past. His ''Letter to an Imaginary Friend'' appeared in parts from 1957 to 1985. Other collections included ''The Movie at the End of the World'' (1973) and ''Passages Toward the Dark'' (1982).
        He was born in Sheldon, N.D., was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of North Dakota and attended Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. He taught at Colby College in Waterville, Me., and at Los Angeles State College.
        Mr. McGrath is survived by his estranged wife, Eugenia Johnson, of Oneonta, N.Y.; a son, Thomas S. McGrath of Minneapolis; two brothers, Martin, of Chaska, Minn., and Joseph, of Sheldon, N.D., and a sister, Kathleen Walter of Huntington Beach, Calif.
