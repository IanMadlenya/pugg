        Ahmed Kadry, chairman of the Eqyptian Antiquities Organization from 1982 until his abrupt dismissal in 1988, died Thursday in Pittsburgh. He was 59 years old. Friends said he had liver cancer and was awaiting a transplant. Mr. Kadry, an army officer who took part in the 1952 coup that toppled King Farouk and installed Lieut. Col. Gamal Abdel Nasser as head of a republican Government in Egypt, joined the Antiquities Organization in 1962 and became chairman in 1982.
        He was named to the top post when a stone fell from the decaying Sphinx and his predecessor was dismissed. Six years later, another rock fell from the huge statue's right shoulder, and the Culture Minister, Farouk Hosni, called Mr. Kadry to account.
        Mr. Hosni blamed the accident on restoration in progress under Mr. Kadry, who retaliated by accusing agents of the minister of loosening the stone to embarrass him. After heated public argument, Mr. Hosni dismissed Mr. Kadry.
        At the Antiquities Organization Mr. Kadry shifted its emphasis from excavation to preservation. He restored ancient mosques and other Islamic monuments, including the sultan Saladin's fortress overlooking Cairo.
        After his dismissal in 1988, Mr. Kadry joined the faculty of Waseda University in Japan.
        No information on survivors was available.
