        Mr. Sharpe underwent surgery for throat cancer last spring, but he recovered enough to perform at the club Zanzibar in Manhattan. In June, he performed in France on a concert bill with Jackie McLean and Phil Woods.
        Mr. Sharpe's distinctive approach was described by Peter Watrous, a critic for The New York Times, as ''the missing link between Charlie Parker and Ornette Coleman.'' His phrasing and sense of harmony were rooted in be-bop, while his unconventional, highly personal intonation presaged free jazz.
        The Start of His Career
        Mr. Sharpe was born in St. Louis and grew up in Philadelphia, where he worked with leading musicians, including the pianist McCoy Tyner, the bassist Jimmy Garrison and the drummer Philly Joe Jones. During the flowering of hard-bop in New York City at the turn of the 1960's, he appeared as a sideman on an early album by the trumpeter Lee Morgan, and in 1969, he performed as part of a big band on Archie Shepp's album ''For Losers.''
        But Mr. Sharpe did not establish his own career, and for many years he performed as a street musician in New York, at jam sessions and as a sideman. From the late 60's to the present, he taught improvisation at the University of the Streets on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
        He is survived by his mother, Louise Sharpe; a sister, Desiree Crafton; two brothers, Perry Lawrence Sharpe and Lonnie Boyd Sharpe, all of Philadelphia; his wife, the former China Lynn Perrault, and two sons.
