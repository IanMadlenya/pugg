        Robert Hugo Woodworth, a retired professor of biology at Bennington College, died last Thursday at his home in North Bennington, Vt. He was 88 years old.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Woodworth, who earned a Ph.D. in biological sciences at Harvard University in 1928, was a curator of the Harvard Botanical Gardens there until 1935. He then joined the faculty at Bennington, where he was professor of biology until 1989. He was interim president of the college in 1976, coordinating construction of a science building and a visual arts and performing arts center.
        He is survived by three sons, Robert of Shelburne, Vt., Ronald of Bennington, and Barry of Essex Junction, Vt.; a brother, Leverett of Los Gatos, Calif; eight grandchildren and two great-grandchidren.
