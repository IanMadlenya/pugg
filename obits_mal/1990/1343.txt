        George Girard, a pastry maker whose shop, La Vie en Rose in Long Island City, Queens, supplied prominent restaurants and airlines for a quarter-century, died on May 22 at his home in Long Island City. He was 83 years old. Mr. Girard died of heart disease, his son Pierre said yesterday.
        Mr. Girard opened his store in 1952, attracting a wide clientele including La Caravelle and Cafe Chauveron. He retired in 1976 and closed his business when the building was sold, saying, ''I'm too old to move to another place, so I'll just retire.''
        Mr. Girard was born in Lodeve, France, and came here in 1923. He started in the candy business and became a general chef before specializing in pastry. Of his success, he said: ''I only used real ingredients. No Reddi-Whip. American pastry, if made with good ingredients, can be good.''
        Surviving are three sons, Pierre and Jacques, of Staten Island, and George, of Westerville, Ohio; 13 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
