        Dr. Bernard L. Diamond, a professor emeritus of law and psychiatry at the University of California at Berkeley, died on Sunday at the Marin General Hospital in California. He was 77 years old and lived in Ross, Calif.
        He died of emphysema and heart failure after surgery, a university spokesman said.
        Dr. Diamond, a specialist in criminal law as applied to the mentally ill, developed the "diminished capacity" defense, in which less severe punishment is sought for a defendant who is legally sane but mentally disabled.
        A frequent expert witness, he testified for the defense in the trial of Sirhan B. Sirhan for the murder of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. He contended that Mr. Sirhan had been in a self-induced trance at the time of the 1968 shooting. The defendant was convicted and is serving a life term in prison.
        Dr. Diamond graduated from Berkeley and received his medical degree from the University of California at San Francisco. In 1963 he joined Berkeley's law school faculty and also served as clinical professor of psychology at the San Francisco medical school. He retired in 1980 but continued teaching until last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; five daughters, Joan, of Mendocino, Calif., Lisa, of Hackensack, N.J., Judy, of Lincoln, Neb., Jan, of Berkeley and Lynn Feiger of Denver; a son, Larry, of Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.
