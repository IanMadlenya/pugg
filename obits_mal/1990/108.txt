        Allen Collins, one of the original members of the rock group Lynyrd Skynyrd, died of pneumonia on Tuesday. He was 37 years old.
        Mr. Collins suffered respiratory failure, said Karen Bowling, a spokeswoman for Memorial Medical Center. He had been hospitalized since September, she said.
        Mr. Collins was a guitarist in the Jacksonville band, which was formed in 1966 by a group of high school students. The band achieved national fame in the 1970's with hits like ''Free Bird,'' ''Gimme Three Steps'' and ''Sweet Home Alabama.''
        In 1977, the band's lead singer, Ronnie Van Zant, the guitarist Stevie Gaines and his sister, Cassie, were killed in a plane crash. Mr. Collins and other band members were severely injured.
        Two years later, Mr. Collins, Gary Rossington, Bill Powell and Leon Wilkeson, all founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, joined with Barry Harwood and Dale Krantz to form the Rossington-Collins band. The group broke up in 1982, and Mr. Collins formed the Allen Collins band.
        In 1986, Mr. Collins's car ran off a road and crashed into a culvert, paralyzing him from the waist down and killing his girlfriend, Debra Jean Watts. He pleaded no contest to a charge of drunken driving.
        When Lynyrd Skynryd began a reunion tour in 1987, Mr. Collins took to the stage in his wheelchair and told his story. His message was videotaped and played to audiences throughout the tour.
        Surviving are two daughters, Amie and Allison; his mother and father, and a sister, all of Jacksonville.
