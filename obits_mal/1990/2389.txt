        Eldon A. Grimm, a securities analyst, financial writer and money manager, died on Monday at his home in Riverside, Conn. He was 78 years old.
        He died of a heart attack while gardening, his family said.
        In a career in the securities business that spanned 60 years, Mr. Grimm began work in a San Francisco brokerage house when he was 17 years old. In 1935 he graduated from the University of California at Berkeley and joined Walston, Hoffman & Goodwin, later Walston & Co., in San Francisco.
        After service in the Army in World War II, Mr. Grimm began writing Walston's daily market letter and moved to New York with the firm in 1949. He rose to senior vice president before Walston was merged into DuPont Glore Forgan in 1973 and later joined Birr Wilson & Company, where he continued to write a market letter until last year and to manage investments for pension funds until his death.
        Mr. Grimm is survived by his wife, the former Helen Jean McNaughton, whom he married in 1944; two sons, Richard, of Manhattan, and Roydon, of Noank, Conn.; a daughter, Georgia Walters, of Riverside, Conn., and three grandchildren.
