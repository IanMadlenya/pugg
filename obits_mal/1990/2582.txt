        Paul C. Darling, a professor of economics at Bowdoin College for 27 years before he retired in 1983, died Thursday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was 74 years old and lived in Cape Elizabeth, Me.
        He died of pulmonary complications, his family said.
        Dr. Darling was born in Pleasantville, N.Y., and was a graduate of Yale College. After service in the Army in Europe in World War II, he taught economics at Rutgers and later at Carnegie Tech.
        He earned a master's degree from New York University and a doctorate from Columbia University before joining the Bowdoin faculty as an associate professor in 1956. He became a full professor in 1960 and twice was chairman of the economics department for two-year terms.
        In the early 1960's Dr. Darling was a member of a research team that developed the Brookings Quarterly Econometric Model of the United States under the auspices of the Social Science Research Council.
        His first wife, the former Frances Koss, died in 1967. He is survived by his second wife, the former Elizabeth Johnsen; a daughter, Gail, of Cape Elizabeth; a stepdaughter, Susanna, of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Dudley, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
