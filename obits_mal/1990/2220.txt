        Raymond DiSalvo, an atomic safety specialist who was part of the team that sought to control damage at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979, died Friday at the Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus. He was 44 years old and lived in Upper Arlington, Ohio.
        His mother, Helen, said she had been told that the cause of his death was an unspecified bone ailment.
        Dr. DiSalvo was in charge of safety and security systems for Battelle Memorial Institute, an independent organization that engages in technical research and development for industrial and government clients.
        Richard Denning, senior research leader for reactor safety at Battelle, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that although Dr. DiSalvo was an expert in reactor safety, he was also conducting research in ways to prevent and limit damage in toxic chemical accidents.
        Last year Dr. DiSalvo was elected chairman of the reactor safety division of the American Nuclear Society, an organization of nuclear engineers.
        He is survived by his parents, Helen and Frank; a daughter, Erin, and a son, Jason, all of Upper Arlington.
