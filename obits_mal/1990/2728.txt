        Jack J. Catton, a retired Air Force general who led the first B-29 bomber groups to the Mariana Islands for World War II bombing missions over Japan, died of heart failure Tuesday at his home in an Air Force retirement village near here. He was 70 years old.
        In 1946 and 1947, then a lieutenant colonel, he took part in the first two atomic weapons tests in the Pacific. He also flew combat missions against North Korea.
        He retired from the Air Force in 1974 after a 34-year military career in which he headed the Military Airlift Command and the Logistics Command. He then worked for the Lockheed Corporation, retiring as a senior vice president in 1984.
        He is survived by a son, two daughters and six grandchildren.
