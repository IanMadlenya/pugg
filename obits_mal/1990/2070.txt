        Jason L. Honigman, a corporate lawyer and the founder of one of Michigan's most powerful law firms, died Wednesday at his home in Beverly Hills, Mich. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Honigman died of congestive heart failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        In 1948, with Milton J. Miller, Mr. Honigman formed what is now the Detroit firm of Honigman, Miller, Schwartz & Cohn, one of the largest in Michigan. He retired five years ago.
        In 1949 he wrote ''Michigan Court Rules Annotated,'' a courtroom guide for lawyers that is a standard reference work in law offices throughout the country. A lifelong Republican, he was the party's nominee for State Attorney General in 1958.
        Mr. Honigman, who was born in Russia, came to the United States with his mother in 1911. His father had emigrated from Russia earlier. In 1916, the family moved to Detroit. Mr. Honigman graduated from the University of Michigan in 1926 at the head of his class. While a student, he went to work for the Detroit law firm that had been headed by Alexander J. Groesbeck, then Governor of Michigan.
        From 1960 to 1968 Mr. Honigman was chairman and chief executive of Allied Supermarkets, a national chain, and remained chairman until 1975. He had also been associated with Detroit's First National Building on Kennedy Square, and was chairman of the Gold Bell Stamp Company and president of the Michigan Mortgage Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Edith Horwitz; a son, Daniel, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; a daughter, Julie Levy, also of Bloomfield Hills; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
