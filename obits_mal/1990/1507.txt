        Mr. Harvuot's family said he died of pancreatic cancer.
        Mr. Harvuot was born in Norwood, Ohio, on Sept. 10, 1912. His father was his first vocal coach, and Mr. Harvuot began formal music study at 19. He won the Metropolitan Opera Auditions of the Air in 1942, shortly before he was drafted into the Army. He served in the Philippines in World War II.
        Mr. Harvuot made his debut at the Metropolitan on Nov. 14, 1947, as a guard in ''Die Zauberflote,'' and took part in almost 1,300 performances there, in 57 roles. He won critical praise over the years for his versatility and for characterizations that went beyond mere vocalism. His voice was said to be well controlled, though not large.
        Mr. Harvuot took part in the opening performance at the new Metropolitan Opera House on Sept. 16, 1966, playing the role of Rustic in Samuel Barber's ''Antony and Cleopatra,'' which was composed for the occasion. His final performance there was in his most familiar role, Angelotti, in ''Tosca,'' on Dec. 3, 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, Nellis De Lay, and a daughter, Susan Glenn Harvuot, both of New City, L.I., and a son, Clifford Allen Harvuot, of Suffern.
