        Under Mr. Muller, Boys High football teams won 183 games, lost 79 and won nine city championships. Mr. Muller, a graduate of Boys High and Columbia University, kept in close touch with his former players and many responded to his invitations to join in celebrating both his 80th and 90th birthdays at dinner parties in New York for which he insisted that he bear the expenses.
        ''They've done so much for me,'' Mr. Muller said at the time. ''There was never a dull moment in my life because I was coaching them. I changed a lot of boys' lives, but they added greatly to mine, too.''
        Mr. Muller is survived by a sister, Elsie, of Pompano Beach.
