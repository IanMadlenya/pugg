        Slavomir Stracer, Czechoslvakia's Minister of Foreign Trade, died of a heart attack Tuesday. He was 55 years old.
        Mr. Stracer fell ill at a luncheon in his honor, just hours after arriving in Brazil.
        He was appointed to his post after democratic elections in June following the toppling of Communist rule. Mr. Stracer had been expelled from the Communist Party in 1970, apparently for sympathizing with the 1968 ''Prague Spring'' reforms that were squelched by a Warsaw Pact invasion.
        He was active in Public Against Violence, the political movement that spearheaded the anti-Communist upheaval late last year, along with its Czech counterpart, Civic Forum. The two parties form the parliamentary majority.
