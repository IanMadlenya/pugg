        Tadeusz Kantor, an internationally known avant-garde theater director, author and painter, died last Sunday in Cracow, it was announced today on Polish radio. He was 75 years old.
        The cause of death was not reported by Polish radio.
        Mr. Kantor was known for creating dynamic, inventive theater based on historical and personal themes. He was present in his productions not as an actor but sitting on stage, watching along with the audience. He used scenery of his own creation.
        He was especially popular in France, where a Paris premiere was scheduled in January for his newest play, "Today is My Birthday."
        Mr. Kantor was born April 6, 1915, in Wielopole in southern Poland and studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow.
        In World War II, he founded the underground experimental Independent Theater. He organized the first postwar modern art exhibition in 1948 in Cracow and organized his Cricot 2 Theater there in 1956.
        Among his productions were "In the Little Country House" in 1961; "The Madman and the Nun," in 1963 and "Water Hen" in 1967.
        His "Theater of Death" started with the 1975 premiere of "The Dead Class," which won international prizes.
