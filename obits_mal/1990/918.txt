        Edward L. Fireman, an astrophysicist who was an authority on the analysis of space debris, died of a heart attack on Thursday. He was 68 years old and lived in Newton, Mass.
        Mr. Fireman served as a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island before joining the Smithsonian's Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., in 1956.
        His analysis of radioactive isotopes in meteorites revealed how long these objects had been traveling in space. He also devised a method for measuring the ages of Antarctic ice samples, which helped refine the Earth's climatic record over the last 200,000 years.
        He was a graduate of Carnegie Instaitute of Technology, now Carnegie-Mellon University, and received his doctorate from Princeton University in 1948.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita; two sons, Bruce of Berkeley, Calif., and Gary of Brooklyn; a daughter, Ellen, of Urbana, Ill.; two brothers, a sister and four grandchildren.
