        John F. Pollard, a lawyer, a retired police lieutenant and a former judge in Family Court in the Bronx, died on Monday at New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in New Rochelle.
        He died of cardiac arrest, a funeral home representative said.
        Judge Pollard was in private practice when he was nominated to the Family Court by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1978. He retired from the court in 1985 after serving for seven years. Before that, he had been legal counsel to Sanford D. Garelik, who was City Council President, and had been an assistant United States Attorney in New York.
        He was a 1951 graduate of Brooklyn Law School, and he retired as a lieutenant in the New York City Police Department in 1968. For many years he was active as a youth worker and football coach with youngsters in New Rochelle.
        He was a member of the Bronx County Bar Association and the Metropolitan Black Bar Association. He had also been active as a trustee of the New York City Retirement System and as a member of the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council.
        He is survived by his wife, Iris, and one grandchild.
