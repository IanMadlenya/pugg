        Gilbert W. Lindsay, the first black member of the Los Angeles City Council, died today at Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Lindsay, who had served on the Council since January 1963, was hospitalized from a stroke on Sept. 2.
        He was born on a Mississippi cotton plantation in 1900, and served in cavalry and infantry units in the Army. After leaving the military he moved to Los Angeles and became a janitor in the city's Department of Water and Power.
        In 1952 Mr. Lindsay joined the campaign of Kenneth Hahn as Los Angeles County Supervisor, and Mr. Hahn made him the nation's first black deputy supervisor.
        After a decade in that job Mr. Lindsay was appointed to the vacant Ninth District Council seat in 1963, becoming the first black Councilman in the city's history. He was re-elected in 1963 and served seven subsequent terms. In the last primary election for his seat Mr. Lindsay won 73 percent of the vote.
