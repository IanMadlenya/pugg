        Chris Silva, a swimmer and a leading force in attracting blacks to American competitive swimming, was killed Sunday when the car he was driving crashed into a tree. He was 29 years old.
        The police said Mr. Silva was driving at an estimated 80 miles an hour when he lost control of the car. A passenger was seriously injured, the police said.
        Mr. Silva was a nationally ranked swimmer at the University of California and in 1984 was the first black to compete in the United States Olympic swimming trials. He tried and failed to make the team in 1984 and 1988.
        Mr. Silva was later director of minority programs at the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., working to interest blacks and members of other minority groups in competitive swimming.
        He is survived by his mother, Dessie Silva.
