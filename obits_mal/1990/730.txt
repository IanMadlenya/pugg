        Born in 1912 in the town of Vicovaro, near Rome, he was ordained a priest in 1942 and became a close adviser to Pope Pius XII, for whom he acted as a liaison with politicians in the early years of the Italian republic after World War II.
        In 1950 he founded Oasis, a spiritual movement that spread to 17 countries, including Poland, Brazil and Portugal.
