        Carl Barus, professor emeritus of engineering at Swarthmore College, died Monday at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 71 years old and lived in Swarthmore, Pa.
        He died of complications after heart surgery, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        Professor Barus joined the faculty at Swarthmore in 1952 and became a full professor in 1972. He retired in 1985 but remained active on campus, particularly on political matters.
        He was a member of the Swarthmore Faculty Seminar on Central America, which he helped to found after the United States invaded Grenada.
        He was born in South Orange, N.J., and graduated from Brown University. After serving in the Navy in World War II, he received an M.S. degree in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1948.
        In 1966 Professor Barus ran for a seat in the House of Representatives, but was defeated in the Democratic primary.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Sage; three sons, William of Horsham, Pa., Peter of Pasadena, Md., and Maxwell of Leeds, Me., and five grandchildren.
