        Alfonso Cata, artistic director of the Ballet du Nord in Roubaix, France, died on Sept. 15 at the Hospital of Tourcoing, near Roubaix. He was 53 years old.
        The cause of death was a brain tumor, said Bernard Allombert, general director of the company.
        Mr. Cata, born in Havana, trained at the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet. He danced with Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris, the Joffrey Ballet, the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, the Stuttgart Ballet and the City Ballet.
        He left City Ballet in 1967 and opened a boutique in New York City called Yasny (for ''You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet''), where he sold dresses he had designed and Mexican and Latin American pottery and jewelry.
        From 1969 to 1973, Mr. Cata was the director of the Geneva Ballet, a company he reformed at the suggestion of George Balanchine, who served as its artistic adviser. He directed the Frankfurt Ballet from 1973 to 1976, assuming the directorship of the Ballet du Nord in 1983.
        He was also a popular ballet teacher in New York City and a choreographer described by one critic as ''proficient'' and ''interesting in the way he uses allusions to George Balanchine's ballets to his own purposes.''
        Mr. Cata's companion was Wilhelm Burmann. He is survived by a brother.
