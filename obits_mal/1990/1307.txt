        Steven Robert Gordon, a concert pianist best known as half of the piano duo he formed with his wife, Nadya, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 45 years old and had homes in Los Angeles and New York.
        The cause of death was lymphoma, Mrs. Gordon said.
        Mr. Gordon was born in Santa Monica, Calif.; studied piano with Sergei Tarnowsky, the teacher of Vladimir Horowitz, and at age 9 performed in the Hollywood Bowl. He later was a competitor at the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.
        Mr. Gordon was a soloist before marrying the pianist Nadya Cataldo in 1971. The two performed extensively as a piano duo. Their career was the focus of a two-hour television documentary, ''Virtuoso Pianist,'' produced in 1985 by the Arts & Entertainment Network.
        Mr. Gordon recorded solo piano works for Klavier and Reference Recordings, and with Mrs. Gordon made the first recording of the complete two-piano music of Maurice Ravel.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his father, Claude, of Big Bear Lake, Calif.
