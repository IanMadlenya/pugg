        Lee Castle, a trumpeter who led the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, died on Friday at Hollywood (Fla.) Memorial Hospital. He was 75 years old and lived in Elmsford, N.Y.
        Mr. Castle's wife, Virginia, said he died after a heart attack.
        Mr. Castle, whose real name was Aniello Castaldo, was born in the Bronx. In the early 1940's, when he started his own band, he adopted the name Lee Castle. He played with the Artie Shaw and Jack Teagarden ensembles and was with the Jimmy Dorsey band when it merged with Tommy Dorsey's in 1953 and became the Fabulous Dorseys. When that ensemble played for Jackie Gleason's television shows in 1955, Mr. Castle was the featured trumpet soloist.
        After the death of the Dorsey brothers, Mr. Castle acquired the Jimmy Dorsey band and led it until his death.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Castle is survived by two sisters, Rose LaVacca of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Julia Mauriello of Yonkers, and three brothers, John, of Yonkers, and Louis and Pat, both of the Bronx.
