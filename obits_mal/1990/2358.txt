        Irving L. Janis, a retired Yale University psychology professor whose research on decision-making, stress and attitude changes spanned more than four decades, died on Thursday at his home in Santa Rosa, Calif. He was 72 years old.
        Dr. Janis died of lung cancer, his wife, Marjorie, said.
        He was best known for coining the term "group think" to describe the sometimes risky way decisions are made in high-powered political and corporate circles. Among his half dozen books are "Crucial Decisions: Leadership in Policy Making and Crisis Management," (The Free Press, 1989); "Groupthink," (Houghton Mifflin, 1983), and with Leon Mann, "Decision Making: A Psychological Analysis of Conflict, Choice and Commitment," (The Free Press, 1977).
        In 1981, he was awarded the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award of the American Psychological Association, and before his death, he learned that he had won the Distinguished Scientist Award for 1991 of the Society of Experimental Social Psychology.
        He was also an adjunct professor at the University of California.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Charlotte, of Santa Rosa, Calif., and Cathy Wheeler of Cincinnati; a brother, Harvey, of Wailuku, Hawaii; a sister, Patricia Lyon of Pacific Grove, Calif., and three grandchildren.
