        Monsignor Krug was named principal of Stepinac in 1947, after completing several parish and teaching assignments and serving as vice principal of Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx.
        Trained at St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, N.Y., he was ordained in 1928 and later studied at the North American College in Rome and at Fordham University. In 1957 he was appointed pastor of St. Bernard's Church in White Plains and retired in 1970. He was also a Papal Chamberlain.
        He is survived by two sisters, Mary Ann Greene and Sister Gertrude Marie, both of the Bronx, and three brothers, Gus, of Suffern, N.Y., George, of the Bronx, and Vincent, of Dumont, N.J.
