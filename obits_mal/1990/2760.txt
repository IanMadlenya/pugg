        Mike Mazurki, a wrestler turned actor, died Sunday at Glendale Adventist Medical Center. He was 82 years old and had been in poor health in recent years, said a hospital spokesman, Kevin Edgerton.
        Mr. Mazurki was born in Austria. His family settled in Cohoes, N.Y., when he was 6 years old. He played football for Manhattan College before becoming a professional heavyweight wrestler.
        His first break as an actor came in the 1941 film "The Shanghai Gesture." He seemed destined to play small roles until he was cast as the dullard Moose Malloy, an ex-convict pathetically seeking his lost love, in the 1944 film "Murder, My Sweet."
        He also appeared in "Some Like It Hot" (1959), "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" (1963) and "Requiem for a Gunfighter" (1965).
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia, and two daughters, Mannette and Michelle.
