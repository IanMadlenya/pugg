        Professor Kain retired in 1975 as an English professor specializing in Irish literature at the University of Louisville, where he taught for 35 years.
        Richard Watts Jr. wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1947 that Professor Kain's book ''Fabulous Voyager: James Joyce's 'Ulysses' '' was ''a genuine labor of love and understanding'' and an ''illuminating critical study.''
        The other books of which Professor Kain was the author or a co-author included ''Joyce: The Man, the Work, the Reputation'' (1956) and ''Dublin in the Age of W. B. Yeats and James Joyce'' (1962).
        Professor Kain's work in the Joyce field included serving as a trustee of the James Joyce Foundation and as a member of the editorial board of James Joyce Quarterly.
        Born in York, Pa., he graduated from Swarthmore College in 1930 and earned a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1934.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Kinsey Yerkes, whom he married in 1931; a brother, William H. Kain of York; a daughter, Constance K. Milner of Bethesda, Md.; two sons, Richard Y. Kain of Minneapolis and David H. Kain of Pittsburgh, and nine grandchildren.
