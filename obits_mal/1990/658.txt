        Mr. Marzullo was an ardent supporter of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, whom he once called ''the best Mayor Chicago ever had.''
        He was elected to the Illinois Legislature for seven terms, the first in 1941. In 1953 he was elected to the Chicago City Council, serving nine terms. He retired in 1985.
        Mr. Marzullo is survived by his wife, Letizia; 2 sons; 4 daughters, 19 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
