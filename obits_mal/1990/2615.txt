        Karl Rolvaag, a former Governor of Minnesota and later an Ambassador to Iceland, died today at his home in Northfield. He was 78 years old.
        He had been ill with a heart condition and died in his sleep at home, according to his niece, Torild Homstad of Northfield.
        A member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, he was Governor from 1963 to 1967 after winning election by 91 votes in 1962. He did not take office for five months while a recount was under way.
        In 1966 the party denied him renomination, favoring A. M. Keith, his lieutenant governor. He defeated Mr. Keith in a primary but lost the general election to Harold LeVander.
        Mr. Rolvaag had served as lieutenant governor for eight years before running for governor in 1962.
        Mr. Rolvaag was appointed Ambassador to Iceland in 1967 by President Lyndon B. Johnson after losing his re-election bid. He returned to Minnesota in 1970 and won election to the state Public Utilities Commission, resigning in 1975, stating later that he was being treated for alcoholism.
        Survivors include his wife, Mariom; a son, a daughter, a sister and three grandchildren.
