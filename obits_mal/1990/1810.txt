        Morris Ginsberg, a retired steamship company executive who helped buy ships to settle Jews in Palestine in the 40's, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83 years old.
        He died of a brain tumor, his son, Daniel, said.
        Mr. Ginsberg's family ran the American Foreign Steamship Corporation in New York, and he was named its president in 1966.
        Mr. Ginsberg backed the purchase of several ships that took 33,000 Holocaust survivors to Israel, including the Exodus, the subject of the Otto Preminger movie. His efforts were memorialized in books like ''Exodus 1947,'' by David C. Holly, and ''Destination Palestine,'' by Ruth Gruber.
        Besides his son, Daniel, of Greenwich, Conn., his survivors include a daughter, Susan Snider of Brookline, Mass., a brother, Calmon, and a sister, Sylvia Kaplan, both of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
