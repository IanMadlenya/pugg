        Clinton C. Thomas, who played center field in the Negro leagues from 1920 to 1937, when black players were barred from the major leagues, died on Monday at the Charleston (W. Va.) Area Medical Center after a long illness. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Thomas, who was born in Greenup, Miss., was credited with a career batting average of .333, including his high figure of .407 in 1924. He spent his best seasons with the New York Black Yankees.
        After leaving baseball, he was the chief messenger for the West Virginia State Senate until his retirement in 1978.
