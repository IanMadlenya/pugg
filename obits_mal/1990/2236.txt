        He died of complications of hepatitis, said his companion, Jeffry Weisman.
        Mr. Pfister, who called his designs ''opulence without waste,'' produced interiors for corporate offices, hotels and boutiques in the United States and in Europe that often combined antique furniture with modern detailing.
        A 1961 graduate of the University of California at Berkeley with a degree in architecture, Mr. Pfister completed graduate work at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design and joined the San Francisco firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1965. He resigned in 1981 to form his own firm, Pfister Partnership.
        He is survived by his parents, Charles and Elinor Pfister of Santa Rosa, Calif.
