        Maurice N. Richlin, an Oscar-winning screenwriter of "Pillow Talk" who helped create the clumsy Inspector Clouseau in "The Pink Panther," died Tuesday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center. He was 70 years old.
        He died of cancer, said a nursing supervisor, Ruth Brymer.
        Mr. Richlin and his writing partner, Stanley Shapiro, won an Academy Award for the 1959 romantic comedy "Pillow Talk," which starred Rock Hudson and Doris Day. That same year, they received a second nomination in the same category, best story written for the screen, for "Operation Petticoat," starring Cary Grant and Tony Curtis.
        With Blake Edwards, Mr. Richlin wrote "The Pink Panther," the 1963 comedy featuring Peter Sellers as a bumbling French detective.
        Mr. Richlin, a native of Omaha, attended the University of Missouri and served in the Army in World War II. After the war he moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as a reporter for The Los Angeles Times and The Hollywood Citizen News.
        Before taking up screenwriting, he worked in radio, writing scripts for popular series like "Burns and Allen," "The Edgar Bergen Show" and "The Amos and Andy Show."
        He is survived by his wife, Louise, six children and three grandchildren.
