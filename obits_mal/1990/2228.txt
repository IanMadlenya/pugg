        Dilworth Walker, a retired executive of Lever Brothers, died last Thursday at his home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 72 years old, and his family said death was apparently caused by a heart attack.
        Mr. Walker was with Lever Brothers from 1964 until he retired in 1983 as director of distribution and data services. He had previously been a partner in the management consulting firm of Cresap, McCormick & Paget and commercial research manager for the Continental Can Company.
        He was born in Driggs, Idaho, and graduated from the University of Utah and the New York University Graduate School of Business, where he later taught economics. He was a major in the Army in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Karen Wilke; two daughters from a previous marriage, Donna Janning of St. Louis and Sharon Pratt of Naples, Fla.; his mother, Ada, of Salt Lake City; four sisters, Callie Reneker of Placentia, Calif.; Jeanne Tannehill of Santa Cruz, Calif.; Ada Lou Peterson of Oakland, Calif., and Martha Reynolds of Salt Lake City, and two grandchildren.
