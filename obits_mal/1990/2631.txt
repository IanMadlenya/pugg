        John J. Cardwell, a former president of what is now the Sara Lee Corporation and later a general partner in a private investment group in Manhattan, died yesterday at Glenbrook Hospital in Chicago. He was 59 years old and lived in Winnetka, Ill.
        He died of cancer, his son-in-law, John McCarthy, said.
        Mr. Cardwell was president and chief executive officer of the Consolidated Food Corporation, now the Sara Lee Corporation, from 1976 to 1982.
        He then became president of Bessemer Securities Corporation, a private investment company and at his death was a managing general partner with Cilluffo Associates.
        A 1953 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, he served in the submarine service for five years and in 1960 earned a master's degree in business administration at Harvard University. He then spent 17 years with McKinsey & Company, a management consulting firm, and was managing director of the Chicago office before joining Consolidated Foods.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jean; four daughters, Mary Louise Hebard, Susan Boehm, Anne Cardwell and Katie McCarthy; two sons, Michael and Joseph; his mother, Anne Cardwell, all of Chicago, and three grandchildren.
