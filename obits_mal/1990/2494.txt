        Henry H. Hoyt, a retired chairman of Carter-Wallace, the pharmaceutical and toiletry company, died on Monday at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 95 years old.
        Mr. Hoyt became managing director of the Carter Medicine Company in 1929 and at his death he and his family owned most of the stock of Carter-Wallace. He was the company's chairman until 1972 and retired four years ago, at the age of 91, as chairman of the executive committee.
        Perhaps the company's best-known product was Carter's Little Liver Pills, which had been developed in the 1870's by Dr. Samuel J. Carter, a druggist in Erie, Pa. Mr. Hoyt changed the name to Carter's Little Pills in 1959 after the Federal Trade Commission objected to advertising claims that the pills increase the flow of bile from the liver, and the United States Supreme Court refused to intervene.
        The company also marketed Miltown and other tranquilizers.
        Mr. Hoyt is survived by two sons, Henry Jr. and Charles; a daughter, Suzanne Garcia; 10 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
