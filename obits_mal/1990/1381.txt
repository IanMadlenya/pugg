        Angus McBean, the best-known British photographer of actors and other entertainers, died of undisclosed causes on Saturday at Ipswich General Hospital in eastern England. He was 86 years old and died a day after his birthday.
        David Ball, his assistant, said Mr. McBean had become ill in February at his winter home in Marrakesh, Morocco.
        ''He had assignments there for Harper's & Queen and Vogue,'' Mr. Ball said. ''Despite his age, he was very much in demand.''
        Mr. McBean's portraits of the stars and of scenes from plays hung outside the West End theaters in London. Some stars refused to be photographed by anyone else. He was the official photographer for the Old Vic, Sadler's Wells and the Shakespeare Memorial Theater at Stratford-on-Avon.
        It was Mr. McBean's portrait of Vivien Leigh that was sent to Hollywood for talent searchers who were looking for an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind'' in the 1930's.
        In 1974, Mr. McBean sold several tons of his glass-plate negatives, covering 700 stage productions over 30 years, to the Harvard Theater Collection in Cambridge, Mass.
        Mr. McBean was briefly married to Helena Wood in 1925. They had no children.
