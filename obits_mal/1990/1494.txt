        Nathaniel Field, a certified public accountant in Manhattan, died on Thursday in Providence Hospital in Anchorage. He was 84 years old.
        He died of a stroke, a family spokesman said, after suffering a heart attack aboard a cruise ship on July 11. He was taken off the vessel at Homer, Alaska, and flown by helicopter to Anchorage.
        Mr. Field maintained his accounting firm from 1940 to 1971, when it was merged with the firm of Yohalem, Gillman, Field & Agler, and he remained a senior partner until 1981, when he retired.
        He was an award-winning photographer and also a founder of the Bruno Walter Memorial Foundation, an organization that promotes arts competitions.
        Surviving are his wife, Dorothy; two sons, Stephen, of Manhattan, and Robert, of Queens; two brothers, Stanley and Robert, both of San Diego, and three grandchildren.
