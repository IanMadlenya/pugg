        Peter-Adolf Thiessen, the East German scientist who was taken from the ruins of Nazi Germany to play a major role in developing the Soviet atom bomb, has died at the age of 90, the official A.D.N. press agency said today. The agency said he died on Monday.
        Mr. Thiessen was one of a small group of German scientists recruited in 1945, when Stalin ordered an emergency program to match the United States atomic bomb. The group worked largely at a secret base in southern Russia before returning to East Germany in 1956.
        After his return to East Germany, Mr. Thiessen continued research in physics and chemistry and served as chairman of the state research council.
