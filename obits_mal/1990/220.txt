        A former state representative, Judge Tunick was appointed to the Superior Court in 1972, after serving for 12 years on the state Circuit Court and the Court of Common Pleas. In 1974, he became a senior judge, and in 1977, a state trial referee.
        He was born in Port Chester, N.Y., and was a graduate of St. Lawrence University. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1933. He was assistant prosecutor of the Greenwich Town Court. He resigned to enter the Army, and was a captain in World War II. He resumed practice in 1945 and was Town Court judge for two years.
        A Republican, he was a state representative from 1951 to 1953. In 1960, Gov. Abraham Ribicoff, a Democrat whom Mr. Tunick had supported, appointed him to the new Circuit Court, which replaced many town courts.
        A widower, he is survived by two brothers, David H., of Greenwich, and Moe, of Stamford, Conn.
