        Eddie Cotton, a light-heavyweight boxer for 20 years who lost close decisions in his two championship fights, died on Sunday at the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle. He was 64 years old. He died from an infection in his blood and lungs that developed two days after a second liver transplant, performed on June 11, the hospital reported.
        Cotton, a lifetime resident of Seattle, had 83 bouts in a career beginning in 1947. He won 58 fights, lost 23 and drew twice. In a 1961 title bid, he dropped a split decision to Harold Johnson, the National Boxing Association champion. In his second title bid, in 1966, he lost a close decision to Jose Torres.
        ''Even if he didn't win a title, he was a champion in my mind,'' said Archie Moore, the former light-heavyweight champion who beat Cotton in 1957 in a nontitle fight.
        Cotton, who retired from the ring in 1967, was later a Washington State boxing commissioner. He is survived by his wife, June Lombard-Cotton of Seattle, a son and two daughters.
