        Accountant, 84 Ream V. Miller, a tax accountant and former general tax manager of the Shell Oil Corporation, died on Thursday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 84 years old and lived in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, his wife, Joyce, said.
        Mr. Smith was a 1929 graduate of Stanford University and was with Shell for 30 years, from 1934 until his retirement in 1966. He was an adviser to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and was chairman of the Committee on Federal Taxation of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Russell, of Sandpoint, Idaho; four daughters, Pamela L. Niesley of Loomis, Calif., Marie and Julie, both of Ho-Ho-Kus, and Victoria, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
