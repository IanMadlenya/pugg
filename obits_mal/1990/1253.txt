        Paul Josef Crost Friedlander, retired editor of The New York Times Travel section, died on Thursday at Arlington (Va.) Hospital. He was 79 years old and had recently moved to Falls Church, Va., from his home in Roslyn, L.I.
        He died of complications from a stroke, his daughter, Rebecca Shaw of Falls Church, said.
        From 1946 to 1970, Mr. Friedlander was first a writer, then the travel editor. He then became a columnist, writing The Traveler's World, until he retired from The Times in 1974.
        From Schooner to Safari
        His columns and articles covered vacation opportunities from riding a ''noisy, smelly'' snowmobile in the Adirondacks to fighting sea-sickness aboard a 143-foot, three-masted schooner during an eight-day motor-sail through the Grenadine Islands.
        He also poked around in the subterranean corridors beneath Disney World in Orlando, Fla., bounced along on safari in Africa and gave a vacationer's eye-view to travel through most of the world's major cities.
        Mr. Friedlander was born in Utica, N.Y., on July 17, 1910. He joined The Times in 1943 as an editor on The New York Times Magazine. Before that, he had been a feature editor for The Associated Press and a rewrite man for The New York Post. He had also worked for nine years at The Utica Daily Press after graduating from Hamilton College in 1931.
        Mr. Friedlander was a founder and past president of the New York Travel Writers Association.
        Besides his daughter Rebecca, he is survived by another daughter, Susan Gutow of Nashville; three sisters, Syra Friedlander of Utica, Ruth Berman of Hudson, N.Y., and Miriam Enright of Boca Raton, Fla., and five grandchildren.
