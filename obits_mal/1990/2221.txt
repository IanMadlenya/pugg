        Shin Hasegawa, who was named Justice Minister in February and stepped down months later because of illness, died of heart failure on Sunday. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Hasegawa had been hospitalized since Sept. 3, when he collapsed before an Imperial Palace ceremony for a new Supreme Court judge. He died at Toranomon Hospital.
        He was succeeded as Justice Minister by Seiroku Kajiyama, who created a controversy by comparing foreign prostitutes in Tokyo to American blacks who move into white neighborhoods and "ruin the atmosphere," a remark for which Mr. Kajiyama later apologized.
