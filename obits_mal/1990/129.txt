        In 1978, during Mr. Reese's stewardship of the historic Town Hall, one of his primary concerns was saving the auditorium, which he said had superb acoustics, for continued use as a concert hall. At that time the building's owners were considering its sale.
        Mr. Reese's career as an arts administrator began in 1962, when he became manager of the Orchestral Society of Westchester. Later he was the founding director of the North Carolina Arts Council and director of the Hartford Arts Council's first fund-raising campaign.
        His wife, Jean Muller Reese, a concert pianist, died in 1988. Surviving is a stepdaughter, Mrs. Michael Kornik, of Hempstead, Quebec.
