        William Muschenheim, a modernist architect in New York in the 1930's who later taught at the University of Michigan, died of an aneurysm on Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 87 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.
        Among his designs were the facade of the New School for Social Research in Greenwich Village and the Marine Transportation Building at the 1939 New York World's Fair.
        Professor Muschenheim was born in Manhattan and grew up near Times Square in a brownstone attached to the old Astor Hotel, which was then owned by his family. He attended Williams College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before studying architecture with Peter Behrens at the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts.
        While still a student, he designed several projects for his father, F. A. Muschenheim, including the renovation of the Astor Bar in Bauhaus style and the installation of the noted Astor Clock.
        He began teaching at the University of Michigan in 1950 and rose to a full professorship before formally retiring in 1973. He continued to teach, however, until last summer.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Bodanzky; a son, C. Arthur Muschenheim of London; a daughter, Anneli Arms of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
