        Lyle Wheeler, an art director who won five Academy Awards for such classics as ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' died of pneumonia on Wednesday at the Motion Picture Country Home and Hospital in Woodland Hills. He was 84 years old.
        Widely recognized as the dean of Hollywood art directors from the late 1930's through the 1950's, Mr. Wheeler was nominated for the Academy Award on 24 other occasions.
        Between his first Oscar nomination for ''The Prisoner of Zenda'' (1937) and his last, for ''The Cardinal'' (1963), his career spanned some 400 films.
        He also received Oscars for ''The Robe,'' ''The King and I'' and ''Anna and the King of Siam,''
        Other Academy Award nominations came with ''Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,'' ''Journey to the Center of the Earth,'' ''David and Bathsheba'' and ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro.''
        In recent years Mr. Wheeler lost his five Oscars when he could not pay a storage bill to house them. A sympathetic fan bought his 1959 Oscar for ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and gave it to him last year.
        He was born on Feb. 12, 1905, in Woburn, Mass., and attended the University of Southern California School of Architecture. He eventually received an honorary degree there.
        His first art direction credit in a film came in 1936 for ''The Garden of Allah,'' an early color experiment. His last was in 1975 for ''Posse.''
        Surviving are 6 children, 13 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.
