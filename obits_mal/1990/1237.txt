        He died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Elisabeth Nardine.
        Mr. McElvenny was the former chief executive of the American Natural Gas Company and a former chairman of the American Gas Association. In 1959 he helped start Detroit's rebirth by building a $20 million headquarters for the utility in a rundown section of the city and by serving as chairman of the Detroit Tomorrow Committee.
        He earned a law degree from Stamford University in 1930 and worked for the Federal Government before entering the utility industry in 1945. He later became executive vice president of American Natural Gas and its subsidiary, Michigan Consolidated Gas. In 1953 he was named president of the utility. He retired in 1973.
        Surviving in addition to Mrs. Nardine, of Milwaukee, are his wife, Elisabeth; a son, Ralph Jr. of Houston; another daughter, Alice Oldham of Grosse Pointe Farms, and six grandchildren.
