        Aldo Fabrizi, an Italian actor who sprang to international fame in the 1940's with his portrayal of a courageous priest executed by Nazis in Roberto Rossellini's film ''Open City,'' died on Monday. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Fabrizi, whose death was announced by his family, had been suffering from heart problems for the last year.
        A native Roman from a poor family, Mr. Fabrizi never lost his common touch. He started out as a music hall comedian in the 1930's and began playing character roles in films in the 1940's.
        In 1945, Rossellini chose Mr. Fabrizi to play Don Pietro, a Roman priest who defied the Fascists during the German occupation of Rome and was tortured and executed because he would not betray partisans. In his review in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote: ''The outstanding performance is that of Aldo Fabrizi as the priest, who embraces with dignity and humanity a most demanding part.''
        After ''Open City,'' Mr. Fabrizi appeared in many films, including ''To Live in Peace,'' ''Escape Into Dreams,'' ''Father's Dilemma'' and ''We All Loved Each Other So Much.''
        He also appeared on Broadway in 1964 in ''Rugantino,'' a musical presented in Italian with English supertitles.
        Mr. Fabrizi was the author of several cookbooks and liked to recite his favorite recipes in verse.
        He is survived by a son, Massimo.
