        Luis Trenker, a film maker whose career spanned five decades, died in his sleep early Friday at a hospital here, his family said. He was 97 years old.
        Born in 1892 in South Tyrol, of German parents, Mr. Trenker served as a pilot in World War I before he embarked on his film career. He made his acting debut in 1921 in Arnold Fanck's ''Marvels of Ski.''
        In the early 1930's, Mr. Trenker became a film director and writer. His first film was ''Mountains in Flames'' in 1932, inspired by his wartime experiences.
        One of Mr. Trenker's best-known works was ''Il Figlio Perduto'' (The Lost Son) made in 1934 and set in New York.
        Mr. Trenker was an accomplished mountain climber, with many first ascents to his name. Mountains were his first love and formed the backdrop for many of his films.
        He was also the author of many books, including ''Brothers of the Snow,'' an account of his climbing adventures.
