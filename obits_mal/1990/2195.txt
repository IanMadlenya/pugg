        Rabbi Daniel I. Kamesar, regional director of Mazon: A Jewish Response to Hunger, collapsed and died on Wednesday while waiting for a train in Philadelphia. He was 35 years old and was commuting from his home in Philadelphia to his office in Manhattan.
        The cause of death has not been determined.
        A recent graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia, Rabbi Kamesar had been appointed in August as New York regional director of Mazon, an organization that raises money for anti-hunger efforts. He graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1977 and from New York University School of Business in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, Cynthia; three children, Nathan, Sophie and Henya; his parents, Armon and Barbara Kamesar of San Diego, and a brother, Adam, of Cincinnati.
