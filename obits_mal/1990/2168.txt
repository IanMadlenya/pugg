        Harold Loren, a leader in international camping, died on Sunday at White Plains Hospital. He was 69 years old and lived in Ardsley, N.Y.
        He died after a stroke, his family said.
        He was the founder of the Lincoln Farm Camp in Roscoe, N.Y., where teen-agers developed skills through work-education programs. He promoted the exchange of staff members and children with camps in many parts of the world.
        Mr. Loren, who was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University, taught industrial arts in the New York City public schools. In World War II, he served in the Army Air Force in the China-Burma-India theater.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Fykin; two daughters, Shelly Majidy of Glastonbury, Conn., and Susan Keiser of Liberty, N.Y.; two brothers, Jeffrey Hayden of Los Angeles and Bert Levine of Clearwater, Fla; a sister, Fay Levine of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
