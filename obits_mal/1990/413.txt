        Calvert Coggeshall, an abstract painter and a designer, died of heart failure on Thursday at his home in Newcastle, Me. He was 82 years old and had maintained a studio in Manhattan until recently.
        His last New York exhibition was sponsored by the Rothko Foundation in 1987 at Artists Space, a nonprofit gallery on West Broadway. The paintings he showed were glowing, monochromatic canvases that echoed the colors of Maine skies, trees and earth.
        From the early 1950's, Mr. Coggeshall exhibited regularly with the avant-garde Betty Parsons Gallery and later with its successor, the Jack Tilton Gallery. In 1978 a retrospective of his work was mounted by the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in Maine.
        Mr. Coggeshall designed interiors and houses for clients in New York City and its suburbs. At one time he was a consultant on ship interiors for American Export Lines.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Susanna Wilson; two sons, John, of Morrisville, Pa., and Tomlin, of Newcastle; two daughters, Kate Hammatt of Kailua, Hawaii, and Pleasance Factor of Sea Cliff, N.Y.; a sister, Virginia Swan of Ormond Beach, Fla.; five grandchildren and two great-granchildren.
