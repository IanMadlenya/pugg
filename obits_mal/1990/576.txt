        Elliott S. M. Gatner, who retired in 1981 from Long Island University after helping to shape that institution in a 45-year career as a history professor, librarian and administrator, died of lung cancer on Friday at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 75 years old and lived in Bellerose, Queens.
        Dr. Gatner rose from a library clerical assistant in 1936 - the same year he received his bachelor's degree from the university - to become an English instructor in 1939, a history professor in 1953 and director of libraries in 1965. He was also assistant to the provost in the mid-1960's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Golden; two daughters, Alice Molinaro of East Meadow, L.I. and Deborah Schlesinger of Great Neck, L.I.; a sister, Anita Eliot of Van Nuys, Calif., and a grandson.
