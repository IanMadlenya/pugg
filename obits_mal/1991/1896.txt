        Charles H. King, a figure in the civil rights movement who conducted boot camp-style seminars to help both whites and blacks change their racial attitudes, died Saturday at his home in Atlanta. He was 66 years old.
        He died of liver cancer, said an employee of the funeral home engaged by his family.
        Mr. King, who was not related to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., was the founder and president of the Urban Crisis Center, which he ran from his home in southwest Atlanta. Mr. King was hired by companies and Government agencies to run two-day "encounter" seminars in which he virtually forced whites and blacks to confront and cope with their prejudices.
        He sometimes had black men kiss white women to catalyze emotional responses. In 1973, the Navy canceled a $27,000 contract with Mr. King when he kissed a white female assistant during a seminar at the Charleston (S.C.) Naval Base. Worked for Kerner Commission
        He took part in the major civil rights demonstrations of the 1960's and was a staff member of the 1967 National Advisory Committee on Civil Disorders, known as the Kerner Commission.
        Mr. King was born in Pottsville, Pa. After education in various schools, he entered the ministry and was pastor of a Baptist church in Evansville, Ind., from 1956 to 1966. Later, he served as executive director of the Civil Rights Commission in Gary, Ind.
        He moved to Atlanta in 1974, after Maynard Jackson, the Mayor of the city at that time, attended one of his seminars.
        He is survived by his wife, Annese King; a son, Karl, of Los Angeles; a brother, and four sisters.
