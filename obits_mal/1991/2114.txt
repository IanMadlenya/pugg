        Ray E. Johns, a retired Y.M.C.A. executive who had been prominent in the United Service Organizations in World War II, died Thursday at the Pheasant Wood Nursing Home in Peterborough, N.H. He was 91 years old and a longtime resident of Hancock, N.H.
        He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease but the immediate cause of his death was unclear, said his wife, the former Rebecca Kittredge, to whom he was married in 1970.
        Dr. Johns was with Y.M.C.A. organizations in Chicago, Boston and elsewhere before and after World War II.
        During the war he was the Manhattan-based director of field operations for the United Service Organizations, or U.S.O.  His first wife, the former Florence Glasgow, died in 1967. In addition to his second wife, he is survived by two children from the first marriage, a son, Robert Johns of Northport, L.I., and a daughter, Anne J. Johns of Silver Bay, N.Y.; six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
