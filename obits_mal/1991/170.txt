        He died of a heart ailment and pneumonia, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Rippel, a quietly authoritative man, was the first president and chief executive officer of the family foundation. It was established in 1953 primarily to aid hospitals and other organizations for research and treatment involving heart disease and cancer and for the care of elderly women.
        Mr. Rippel headed his investment banking concern, Julius A. Rippel Inc., later Rippel & Company, in Newark from 1939 to 1982, when he retired. A former president of the New Jersey Bond Club, he was also an officer of the Investment Bankers Association of America and the National Association of Security Dealers.
        He was born in Newark and graduated in 1923 from Dartmouth College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.
        He received the 1943 outstanding citizen award of the Advertising Club of Newark, several honorary doctorates and other awards from many health-care, philanthropic and educational groups for which he had also been a trustee.
        Surviving is his wife of 66 years, Carol; a son, Eric, of Milford, N.J., now president of the foundation; a daughter, Susan, of Rome; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
