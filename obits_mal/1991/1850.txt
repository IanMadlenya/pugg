        Joe Bartelme, a former vice president of NBC News and a pioneer in television's local news operations, died on Saturday at White Plains Hospital. He was 61 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said a spokesman for the family.
        As vice president of network news in 1978, Mr. Bartelme revamped the "Today" show format and staff, after which its ratings rose. From 1981 to 1986, he was responsible for the NBC network's domestic news coverage. He retired as director of news administration in January.
        Mr. Bartelme was born in Sioux City, Iowa, and was a graduate of the University of Iowa. He began his broadcast career in 1958 at WCCO-TV, the CBS affiliate in Minneapolis, where his investigative reporting and documentary productions won George Foster Peabody and Alfred I. du Pont-Columbia University Awards.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, Tony, of Charleston, S.C., and Peter, of San Francisco; a daughter, Nicole, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Elizabeth, of New York City, and a brother, Ken, of Berkeley, Calif.
