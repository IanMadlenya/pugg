        Bernard I. Blickman, a civil engineer and inventor, died on Sunday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Blickman was the former chairman of S. Blickman Inc., of Weehawken, N.J., a stainless steel fabricator founded by his grandmother, Sophia Blickman. The company designed and built restaurant kitchens and laboratories for hospitals and manufacturers. He retired when the company closed about five years ago.
        Mr. Blickman held several industrial patents and was honored by the National Space and Aeronautics Administration for his part in producing "all the highly complex stainless-steel biological and geological containment enclosures in which the Apollo 11 lunar samples were quarantined and studied."
        Mr. Blickman is survived by his wife of 50 years, Nan Tarshis Blickman; three daughters, Sophia Weinert and Frances Schuster, both of Manhattan, and Myrna Kresh of Yardley, Pa.; two sisters, Gloria Horwitz of Rochester, and Beverly Yunich of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a brother, Newton, of Pearl River, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
