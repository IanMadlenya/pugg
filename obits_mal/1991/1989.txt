        Roger Forsythe, head designer for the Perry Ellis Group, the men's wear company, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. He was 36 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lymphatic cancer, a company spokesman said.
        Mr. Forsythe, who was born in Missouri and raised in Texas, was recruited by the group in 1988 as vice president and men's design director. His assignment was to restore the humor and verve in sportswear that had characterized the originals of Perry Ellis.
        Mr. Forsythe's design direction proved so successful, the company said, that its sales of men's wear had soared from a yearly rate of $15 million to more than $100 million since his arrival. Revenues for Perry Ellis, a division of the Salant Corporation, had slumped after Mr. Ellis's death in 1986.
        Mr. Forsythe earned a business degree from the University of Houston and then moved to the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City, where he graduated with an associate degree in applied sciences, specializing in men's wear, in 1982. He worked for Jean Paul Germaine, Kenneth Gordon and D. D. Dominick, and was director of men's, women's and children's sportswear collections at Basic Elements before he joined the Ellis Group.
        His companion was Peter Fressola of Manhattan.
        Mr. Forsythe is survived by his father, John, of Dallas, and two brothers, Bill, of Des Moines, and Brad, of Houston.
