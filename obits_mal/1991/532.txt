        Frederic Ives Carpenter, an authority on Eugene O'Neill, Robinson Jeffers and Ralph Waldo Emerson, died Saturday at the John Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek, Calif. He was 88 years old and lived in Walnut Creek.
        He died of pneumonia, said his daughter-in-law, Betsy Carpenter.
        Mr. Carpenter's book about the playwright, "Eugene O'Neill," (1964), has been translated into several languages. He also wrote "Robinson Jeffers" (1962). Twayne published both works. His 40 years of correspondence with O'Neill and Jeffers are colleted in the University of California's Bancroft Library in Berkeley.
        He also wrote, "American Literature and the Dream" (Philosophical Library, 1956), "Emerson and Asia" (Harvard University Press, 1930), "Emerson: Representative Selections" (American Book Company, 1934) and "Emerson Handbook" (Hendricks House, 1953).
        Mr. Carpenter taught at the University of Chicago, Harvard University and the Unviersity of California at Berkeley. In 1953 he resigned his teaching position at Berkeley, objecting to a requirement that faculty members sign loyalty oaths. He remained a research associate at Berkeley until 1971.
        Survivors include two daughters, Barbara C. Fleischman of Kirkland, Wash., and Anne C. Robertson of Redwood City, Calif., and two sons, Dr. Alan F. Carpenter of Los Altos, Calif., and John R. Carpenter of Ann Arbor, Mich.
