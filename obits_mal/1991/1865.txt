        Allan W. McMillan, longtime columnist for The Amsterdam News and the first black syndicated columnist, died on Saturday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        His niece, Marlene McMillan, said he died of prostate cancer.
        Mr. McMillan started writing in Chicago, came to New York some 50 years ago and made his reputation as an entertainment writer, Broadway columnist and publicist. During his many years with The Amsterdam News, he wrote a column called Allan's Alley, later adding a similar column for The New York Voice, a weekly published in Flushing.
        A native of Valdosta, Ga., he attended Morris Brown College in Atlanta and played two seasons as a shortstop with the Nashville Elite Giants of the Negro National League before taking a bellhop's job in Chicago in 1927. He appeared in the Baltimore Afro-American with a column called "Chicago By Day And Night." In 1933, he went to work as a reporter for The Chicago Defender, beginning his career with an interview with Al Capone.
        In Chicago, Mr. McMillan developed a friendship with Joe Glaser, a promoter, and began to mingle with the likes of Louis Armstrong, B. B. King, Lionel Hampton and Billie Holliday. After his former managing editor at The Defender, Julius Adams, became editor of The Amsterdam News in 1938, he recruited Mr. McMillan. It was at The Amsterdam News that his column went into syndication.
        In addition to his niece, a Manhattan resident, Mr. McMillan is survived by a sister, Esther Williams of Valdosta, and a brother, the Rev. Joseph T. McMillan Sr. of Winston-Salem, N.C.
