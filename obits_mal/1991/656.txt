        Aaron Berkman, former director of the art center at the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue, died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his son, Peter, said.
        Mr. Berkman was appointed director of a W.P.A. art center at the Y in 1932. When that project was canceled in 1938, he helped establish the Y's art center, serving as director, art teacher and lecturer on art history until his retirement in 1965.
        He had one-man shows at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and at New York galleries including the Kaufman Art Gallery; ACA Galleries, which he helped establish as an artists' cooperative in 1932, and the Bercone Studio Gallery, which he founded in 1966 with Janet S. Cohen, and which closed in 1986. His work was also exhibited at institutions including the Brooklyn Museum and the Roerich Museum, the New School and the American Watercolor Society, all in New York City.
        Mr. Berkman, who was born in Hartford, Conn., studied at the Connecticut League of Art Students, the Hartford Art School and the Museum Art School of Boston.
        In addition to his son and his wife, Victoria, both of New York, he is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
