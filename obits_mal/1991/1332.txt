        William A. McCarty-Cooper, an interior designer and art collector, died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 53 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, his lawyer, John Hutchinson, said yesterday.
        William (Billy) McCarty-Cooper, who was born and raised in Florida, became one of the most prominent decorators in London in the 1960's. He moved there in 1963 to work for the decorator David Hicks. Two years later he opened his own firm, William McCarty Associates, to design interiors and furnishings.
        In the late 1970's the designer was associated with the Paris-based art and antiques gallery Didier Aaron, creating interiors for the concern in Paris, London and New York.
        Mr. McCarty-Cooper was adopted in 1972 by Douglas Cooper, the British historian of the Cubist period and an art collector, and thereafter devoted an increasing amount of time to collecting and philanthropy. After Cooper died in 1981, his rarely exhibited collection of Cubist art was made available by Mr. McCarty-Cooper to scholars and the public.
        In 1986, Mr. McCarty-Cooper donated an important proto-Cubist Picasso painting, "Three Women Under a Tree," to the Picasso Museum in Paris. The Cooper Collection has been widely exhibited over the last decade in Europe and the United States, most recently at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in a show that ended in late April. In recent years Mr. McCarty-Cooper formed a major collection of African art. In February, he was awarded the Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government.
        Mr. McCarty-Cooper's companion was David Johnson of London.
        He is survived by his parents, Eugenie and William A. McCarty of Miami Springs, Fla.; two brothers, Terrence, of Palm Bay, Fla., and John, of Miami, and two sisters, Patricia Hawkins of Conyers, Ga., and Denise Black of Los Angeles.
