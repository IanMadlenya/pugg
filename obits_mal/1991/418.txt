        William Hess, a tenor and voice teacher, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Manhattan. He was 75 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his daughter Toni.
        Mr. Hess, who was born in Wilkes Barre, Pa., came to New York in the early 1930's to study voice with the soprano Florence Easton. He made his debut with the Philadelphia Opera Company, in the title role of Gounod's "Faust," and also performed with the St. Louis Opera Company.
        After service as an instructor pilot in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he became known particularly as an interpreter of baroque and contemporary music. He appeared as a soloist with the Dessoff Choirs, the Cantata Singers, and the NBC Symphony under Arturo Toscanini.
        He taught many students privately in Manhattan.
        In addition to Toni Hess, he is survived by another daughter, Ann Schultz of Monterey, Calif., and two grandchildren.
