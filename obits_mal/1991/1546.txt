        Henri-Georges Doll, an engineer and inventor, died on Thursday in the Montfort-l'Amaury Medical Center, near Paris. He was 89 years old and had lived in Manhattan until six months ago, when he moved to Paris.
        Mr. Doll died of a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        From 1940 until his retirement in 1967, Mr. Doll headed the research and development department at Schlumberger Ltd., the worldwide oil-field services company based in New York.
        Mr. Doll held more than 70 patents and is credited with many of the advancements that elevated Schulmberger to pre-eminence in oil exploration.
        Born in Paris, Mr. Doll graduated from Ecole Polytechnique. Shortly after graduation, he went to work with Conrad Schlumberger, the physicist and co-founder of the company. Mr. Doll married Mr. Schlumberger's daughter, Anne, who was caring for him at his death. The marriage had ended in divorce.
        During World War II, Mr. Doll was awarded a Certificate of Appreciation from the United States Government for his contribution to the technology of mine detection. For his lifetime achievements in oil research, he was promoted to Officer of the Legion d'Honneur, France's highest decoration, in 1987. He also received the first Gold Medal Award from the Society of Professional Well Log Analysts in 1966.
        Mr. Doll became an American citizen in 1962, having made his home here since 1941.
        His second wife, the former Eugenia Delarova of Manhattan, died in December 1990. He is survived by three daughters, 10 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.
