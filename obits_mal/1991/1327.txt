        Philip Gollnick, a physiologist and professor at Washington State University, died Wednesday after suffering a heart attack at his home here. He was 56 years old.
        For more than 25 years, Dr. Gollnick conducted research that showed, among other things, how and why muscles adapt to levels of high activity. Most recently he conducted research on the muscles of astronauts who flew on the space shuttle Columbia.
        When the Columbia returned from an 11-day mission in January, Dr. Gollnick took fingernail-sized muscle samples from the astronauts to study the effect of weightlessness on muscle tissue.
        He received a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin at LaCrosse and masters and doctoral degrees at Washington State, where he became an assistant professor in 1963.
        Survivors include his wife, Doris, and three sons.
