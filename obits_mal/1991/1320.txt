        Leonard B. Schlosser, a leader in the paper industry and an avid collector of manuscripts and artifacts on papermaking, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Schlosser, a 1946 graduate of Williams College, was president of Selections Limited and a director of its parent company, Mohawk Paper Mills in Cohoes, N.Y. He was a former president of the Schlosser Paper Company, former chairman of the Lindenmeyr Paper Corporation and senior vice president of Central National-Gottesman Inc. He had also been active in the National Paper Trade Association and the Paper Merchants Association of New York.
        Mr. Schlosser's collection of books, artifacts and tools on the history of papermaking included more than 3,000 items. Many were shown at a recent exhibit, "On Paper: The History of the Art," at the New York Public Library. He served on committees of the Pierpont Morgan Library, the New York Library and the Library of Congress's Center for the Book.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, Frederick and William; a daughter, Sarah, and a brother, Alfred, all of Manhattan.
