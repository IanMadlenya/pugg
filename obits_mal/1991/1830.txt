        Hy Rensin, a music teacher at the Bronx High School of Science for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 87 years old and lived in Lenox, Mass., and Miami Beach.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Rensin taught music at the Bronx High School of Science from 1939 until he retired in 1974. For most of that time, he was chairman of the music department. He also taught music and mathematics in the evening division of the City University of New York.
        A violinist and violist, he had played in symphony orchestras in Westchester; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Miami Beach, and Stockbridge, Mass. He often served as an usher at Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts at Tanglewood.
        He collaborated with Folkways Records to produce a series of recordings of folk instruments of the world and, with his wife, Helen, developed a program in which summer campers built their own versions of these instruments and learned to play them.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Edward, of Yonkers; a sister, Florence Kantorovsky of Jackson Heights, Queens, and several nieces and nephews.
