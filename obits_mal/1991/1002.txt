        Roger N. Metz, a professor of physics at Colby College in Waterville, Me., died Tuesday at a hospital in Cleveland. He was 52 years old and lived in Fairfield, Me.
        He died of complications after surgery, the Staton Funeral Home in Warren, Ohio, said.
        Dr. Metz, a native of Bedford, Ohio, and a graduate of Oberlin, was an Andrew Mellon Fellow at the University of Pittsburgh and received his doctorate from Cornell University. He joined the Colby faculty in 1968 and was chairman of the college's physics department from 1974 to 1989.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy, a lawyer in Fairfield.
