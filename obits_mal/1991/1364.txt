        William Michael Berta, senior vice president and director of advertising and sales promotion for Saks Fifth Avenue, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 56 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Berta joined Saks in 1977 and remained with it until he became too ill to work. Before that he worked for Grey Advertising, Revlon and Bloomingdale's. He was a founder of Berta, Grant & Winkler, a Manhattan advertising agency.
        He was born in McKeesport, Pa., and graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago.
        As an avocation, he created theatrical posters, including the poster designs for the Broadway shows "Mame" and "La Cage Aux Folles."
        Mr. Berta is survived by his mother, Ida Berta Stter, and a sister, Candice Berta, both of Elizabeth, Pa.
