        Win Stracke, a folk singer, songwriter and pioneer of Chicago television, died on Saturday. He was 83 years old and lived in Chicago.
        He died of unspecified natural causes, his family said.
        After a stint as a migrant worker in the early 1930's, he became a regular guest on such Chicago-based radio shows as "National Barn Dance" and "The Chicago Theater of the Air."
        He was a labor organizer later in the 1930's, then served in a World War II antiaircraft battery in Europe and resumed his radio career after the war.
        He appeared on early television shows with Studs Terkel and Dave Garroway. He had several children's shows of his own, including "Animal Playtime" and "Time for Uncle Win."
        He was blacklisted in the McCarthy era because of his activities in the labor movement, and that prevented him from performing on television for years.
        In 1957, he helped found the Old Town School of Folk Music on the North Side of Chicago.
        He is survived by two daughters and two grandchildren.
