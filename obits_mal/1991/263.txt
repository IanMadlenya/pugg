        The Rev. Francis Joseph Heyden, a Jesuit priest and astronomer who was an authority on solar eclipses, died Feb. 8 at Cardinal Santos Memorial Hospital in Manila. He was 83 years old and lived in Manila.
        He had been suffering for some time with heart disease, said officials at Georgetown University, where Father Heyden had been director of the astronomical observatory.
        Father Heyden joined the faculty at Georgetown in 1945 as a professor of astronomy. Before that, he was a teacher and the chief of the astronomical division of the Manila Observatory at the University of Manila and had taught at St. Peter's College in Jersey City.
        From 1942 to 1944 he was a teaching fellow at Harvard University, where he received a Ph.D. in astronomy. He was named director of the observatory at Georgetown in 1948 and served in that capacity until he retired in 1971. He then went to Manila, where he was a lecturer at the Ataneo de Manila, a Jesuit college.
        Born in Buffalo in 1907, Father Heyden joined the Jesuits in 1924 and was ordained in 1937. He was an adviser to the United States Air Force and to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. From 1947 to 1963 he took part in seven expeditions to photograph and investigate solar eclipses in, among other places, Brazil, China, Iran, the Sudan, and the United States.
        There were no immediate survivors.
