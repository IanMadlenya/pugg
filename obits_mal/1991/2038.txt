        Reynold Abel Dorris, a young Sioux Indian who became the subject of a best-selling book on alcohol-related birth defects, died in Lebanon, N.H., on Sept. 22 of injuries suffered earlier when he was struck by an automobile. He was 23 years old and lived in Lebanon.
        The book, "The Broken Cord," was written by his adoptive parents, Michael Dorris and his Louise Erdich, both of whom are professional writers and part American Indian.
        Mr. Dorris adopted Reynold Abel when the boy was 3 years old. He was told only that the boy was retarded and that his mother had been a heavy drinker. Gradually the boy developed more and more of the emotional and physical effects of fetal alcohol syndrome. Mr. Dorris, who was single at the time of the adoption, later adopted three other Indian children. After he married Ms. Erdich, she adopted them, too.
        While Reynold was the central figure in the book, its theme was Mr. Dorris's chilling documentation of the tragedy of fetal alcohol syndrome and its devastating effect on American Indians.  Reynold contributed the last chapter.  The book, published in 1989 by Harper Perennial, won a National Book Critics' Circle Award.
        The Lebanon police said the young man was struck as he walked along a road on Sept. 8. They said they did not expect charges to be filed against the driver.
        Besides his adoptive parents, Reynold is survived by three sisters, Persia, Pallas and Aza.
