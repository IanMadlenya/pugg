        Horace Sutton, one of the pre-eminent American travel writers during the years of the greatest expansion of tourism, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 72 years old and died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sutton was indefatigable as a traveler and prolific as a writer. He traveled at least 100,000 miles a year at the peak of his career and wrote 11 books, including the "Footloose" series, which began with "Footloose in France" in 1948.
        His syndicated column continued until his death. He was with the Saturday Review for more than 30 years, first as travel editor and later as editorial director of the magazine. He also began travel sections for Sports Illustrated and McCall's and was the editor of Citicorp's publication, Signature magazine, from 1981 to 1985, and editor in chief of Citicorp Publishing Company, Signature's parent, from 1984 to 1987.
        Neither his energy nor his pen ever flagged. In a 1980 review of his work "Travelers: The American Tourist From Stagecoach to Space Shuttle" (William Morrow), The New York Times Book Review said: "Mr. Sutton approaches his subject with the enthusiasm of a busload of Rotarians at the Place Pigalle." Won Press Club Award
        Before World War II, Mr. Sutton worked in the advertising department of The New York Post. After the war, from which he emerged as a captain in Army Intelligence, he returned to The Post as a reporter and travel writer. He joined the Saturday Review in the late 1940's.
        Mr. Sutton won many awards for his travel writing, and in 1965 he received an award from the Overseas Press Club for his coverage of a military counter-coup in Indonesia.
        Surviving are his wife, Patricia Diamond Sutton; a son, Patrick, of Baltimore; a daughter, Miranda, of Hoboken, N.J., and a son by a previous marriage, Andrew, of Los Angeles.
