        Leonard S. Sheriff, a pioneer in investing in companies facing merger or takeover bids, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Sheriff died of complications after kidney surgery, his family said.
        He founded the Sheriff Securities Corporation in Manhattan in 1959 and at his death was chairman of the investment firm, which specialized in trading in companies undergoing mergers or buyouts in hopes of profiting from rising stock prices. Practiced Corporate Law
        Time magazine in 1977 said his company "is generally considered to be the biggest of all arbitrage traders." It then held positions in some 300 stocks, trading for its own gain as well as on the behalf of other investors.
        Before his investment career, he worked for about 15 years in the Manhattan law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and Hamilton. He practiced corporate law and rose to partner in the firm.
        He was also a noted collector of stamps and wine. When the Robert A. Siegel Auction Galleries sold much of his stamp collection in 1985, auctioneers described it as "one of the best one-man assemblages offered in years." He specialized in 19th-century stamps and covers and was a trustee of the Philatelic Foundation.
        A native of Manhattan, he entered City College at the age of 14, the youngest student to have enrolled there at that time. He earned a master's degree in business administration from Harvard and a law degree from Yale.
        He is survived by two daughters, Margaret, of Washington, Conn., and Marina, of Manhattan; a son, Antony, also of Manhattan, and a brother, Seymour, of Bethesda, Md.
