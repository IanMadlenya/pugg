        Jonas Eli Halperin, a public relations specialist and an independent movie producer, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his son, Daniel, said.
        Mr. Halperin attended the University of Southern California and in the early 1950's joined the public relations staff of Warner Brothers, where he worked on publicity for films starring James Dean. He briefly had his own public relations firm, but in the early 1960's he became a vice president with Rogers & Cowan in Los Angeles.
        In 1968, he joined Alan J. Lerner as an associate producer on the film version of "Paint Your Wagon" at Paramount Pictures. He returned to Rogers & Cowan in 1969 to head its New York office. From 1976 to 1983 he was director of communications for Warner Communications, and later handled publicity for Yugo Motors and for David Wolper television productions.
        In addition to his son, of Manhattan, Mr. Halperin is survived by his wife, Eve; his father, Irving, and a brother, Michael, both of Los Angeles.
