        Dr. George L. Bowen, a New York obstetrician and gynecologist and a founding trustee of Pace University, died last Thursday at his home in Bluebell, Pa., where he had retired in 1985. A former resident of Huntington, L.I., he was 95 years old.
        He died of heart failure, according to a university spokesman.
        Dr. Bowen, a native of Osborne, Kan., was a 1918 graduate of the Naval Aviation School at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received a medical degree from George Washington University. He began his career in 1928 on the staff of Women's Hospital, now a division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, and, over the years, held positions at nine other hospitals. He served on the faculty of New York University for 35 years and was a Pace trustee until two years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Elizabeth Pace-Russell, and their daughter, Barbara Pace Zimany, of Carlinville, Ill.
