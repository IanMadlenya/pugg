        S. Edward Peal, formerly Liberia's Ambassador to the United States and dean of the African diplomatic corps in America, died yesterday in a hospital in Arlington, Va. He was 68 years old.
        His family said he died of complications from hepatitis, which he had contracted this summer while on a trip to Liberia to deliver a check for relief aid.
        Graduating from Liberia College in Monrovia in 1945, Mr. Peal entered the foreign service. He was stationed in Paris, London and Hamburg before he was promoted to Ambassador, serving in the Netherlands and Guinea.
        He was Ambassador to the United States from 1961 to 1976, eventually ranking No. 2 in seniority in the international diplomatic corps in Washington. As acting dean, he represented the corps at ceremonies in which Gerald R. Ford assumed the Presidency from Richard M. Nixon.
        The Liberian Government reassigned Mr. Peal to the Soviet Union in 1977, but he declined the post. He returned home and won election to the Liberian Senate.
        When Master Sgt. Samuel K. Doe staged a coup in Liberia in 1980, killing the President and many other officials, Mr. Peal was out of the country at a conference. He spent the next two years in exile in Washington, hiding part of the time at the home of an American friend.
        In subsequent years he divided his time between the United States and Liberia, returning to his country when political conditions there permitted. He went on speaking tours across the United States and abroad to seek donations for the needy in Liberia.
        Mr. Peal is survived by his wife, Florence; a daughter, Dr. Rhoda Peal; three sons, S. Allen and S. Edward Peal, all of Alexandria, Va., and S. Audiway Peal of Lawrenceville, N.J.
