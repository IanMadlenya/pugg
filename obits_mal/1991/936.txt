        Henry Glover, a producer, arranger and talent scout for King Records, died in St. Albans, Queens, on Sunday. He was 69 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his daughter, Leslie Glover, said.
        Mr. Glover, one of the most influential recording executives of the 1950's, supervised blues, rhythm-and-blues and country recordings, cross-fertilizing rhythm-and-blues and country repertories. He wrote "Drown in My Own Tears," recorded by Ray Charles in 1956, and co-wrote "Annie Had a Baby," "Peppermint Twist" and other songs.
        Mr. Glover was born in Hot Springs, Ark. He dropped out of Wayne University in Detroit to work as a trumpeter in the Buddy Johnson big band, and also worked in the mid-1940's with the Tiny Bradshaw and Lucky Millinder bands before moving to King Records. For that label, he produced Roy Brown, Wynonie Harris, John Lee Hooker, Little Willie John, Champion Jack Dupree and Moon Mullican, often hiring top jazz musicians for the sessions. In 1956, he moved to Roulette Records, where he and Joey Dee wrote "Peppermint Twist," a huge hit in 1961. He returned to King in 1963 and worked there through the 1970's.
        In addition to his daughter, of Syracuse, he is survived by his wife, Doris, and a son, Ware, of St. Albans.

        An obituary on Saturday about the record producer Henry Glover described his education incorrectly. He received a bachelor's degree from Alabama Agricultural & Mechanical University and had nearly completed a master's degree at Wayne State University when he left to join the Buddy Johnson big band.
