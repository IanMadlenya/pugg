        Tsung Chen Tsao, the former chief of the Chinese language translation service at the United Nations, died Friday at St. John's Hospital in Elmhurst, Queens. He was 74 years old and lived in Flushing, Queens.
        He died of cardiogenic shock, said his daughter, Barbara Tsao of Manhattan.
        Mr. Tsao joined the United Nations in the mid-1940's as a translator and was with the international organization until he retired around 1981. A graduate of Ching Hua University in Bejing, he studied for a doctorate in economics at Harvard University after coming to the United States from China around 1943.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Annie Chi Hsuen Tsao; a son, Frank of Seattle; and several brothers and sisters who live in China.
