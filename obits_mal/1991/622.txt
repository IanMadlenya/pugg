        James Edward Gahagan, a founding member of the first local of the Transport Workers Union, Local 100 in Manhattan, died March 18 at Marian Medical Center in Santa Maria, Calif. He was 86 years old and lived in Santa Maria.
        The family was uncertain of the cause of death, his son James said, adding that his father suffered from Parkinson's disease.
        When the union was founded in 1934, he became vice president of Local 100, which represents New York City transit workers. Later, he became a member of the union's international executive board. In 1949, after a falling out with Michael J. Quill, international president of the union, he was voted out of the union in a rift between conservatives led by Mr. Quill and left-wing members including Mr. Gahagan.
        In 1951 he moved to California where he became an organizer for the United Automobile Workers Union. He retired in the early 1970's.
        He was born in Brooklyn and served as a machinist in the Navy during World War II.
        His wife, the former Anna Biondi, died in 1963.
        He is survived by two sons, James E. Jr., of Woodbury, Vt., and Martin P., of St. Johnsbury, Vt.; two daughters, Anne Goch of San Fernando, Calif., and Peggy Spidel of Moor Park, Calif., and nine grandchildren.
