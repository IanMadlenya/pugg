        Armand C. Litman, a certified public accountant and an oil-drilling engineer, died on Saturday while walking in Aberdeen, Scotland, where he was vacationing. He was 62 years old and lived in London.
        He died of a heart attack, a brother said.
        Mr. Litman was a 1951 graduate of City College of New York. He entered the oil industry after serving with the Marine Corps in Korea. He was a senior sales executive with several major companies, including American Coldset, Hughes Tool Company, Baker-Hughes Corporation and Baker Industries. In the late 1960's he helped develop deep-water drilling techniques for oil fields in the North Sea and in Eastern Europe. During much of his career he helped to extract oil from fields in Europe, the Middle East and in Asia, where there were difficult drilling conditions. He retired in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; two sons, David and Jonathan, both of Dallas; a sister, Denise Gold of Roslyn, L.I.; two brothers, John, of Forest Hills, Queens, and Jack T., of Manhattan, and one grandchild.
