        George I. Bloom, a longtime Republican leader in Pennsylvania, died Sunday at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, Pa., after a short illness. He was 92 years old.
        He served in the administrations of two Republican governors, Edward Martin and William W. Scranton, headed the state Republican committee from 1956 to 1962, a period in which the party regained the governorship, and served as chairman of the state Public Utility Commission from 1965 to 1975.
        Mr. Bloom's wife, Louella, died two years ago.
