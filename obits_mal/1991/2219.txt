        Prof. Raymond Madiford Peardon Donaghy, a neurosurgeon known for his work in microsurgery, died on Tuesday at the Heaton House nursing home in Montpelier, Vt. A former resident of Burlington, he was 81 years old.
        His family said he died of complications from Alzheimer's disease.
        Dr. Donaghy, a native of Canada, was professor emeritus of neurosurgery at the University of Vermont College of Medicine and a former director of neurosurgical research at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, both in Burlington. He retired in 1977.
        He trained in neurology and neurosurgery in Montreal and Boston, where he studied brain abscesses. Serving as a captain and combat surgeon with the United States Army in Europe during World War II, he won five battle stars and treated many types of brain injuries, using methods of microsurgery that he developed further after the war.
        His laboratory research also encompassed neurovascular surgery and trauma of the spinal cord. He was the author and co-author of dozens of articles in his field.
        Dr. Donaghy is survived by his wife, the former Frances Mary Smith, of Montpelier; two sons, Peardon Jr., also of Montpelier, and John, of Meriden, N.H.; two daughters, Elisabeth Garrett of Manhattan and Margaret Huseby of Portland, Ore., and eight grandchildren.
