        Mario Siletti, an acting teacher who helped found the National Shakespeare Conservatory, died on Jan. 7 at New York University Medical Center. He was 65 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.
        He died of pneumonia, said Albert Schoemann, a co-founder of the Conservatory.
        For 25 years, Mr. Siletti taught acting at the Stella Adler Studio, New York University and the National Shakespeare Conservatory, which he, Mr. Schoemann and Philip Meister founded in 1974.
        At the age of 4, on the Lower East Side, Mr. Siletti began acting in productions by the Italian Theater, which his father, Mario Sr., had founded.
        Mr. Siletti created the role of Uncle Oscar in the original New York production of "Little Mary Sunshine" and acted and directed in regional theaters.
        His companion was Robert P. Smith.
        He is survived by two brothers, Tirzio, of Los Angeles, and Joseph, of Oahu, Hawaii.
