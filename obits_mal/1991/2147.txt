        Frank G. Binswanger, a developer and civic leader in Philadelphia, died last Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 88 years old.
        Associates said he had cancer, heart disease and pneumonia.
        Mr. Binswanger, who was born and reared in Philadelphia, began working as a courier for a real estate concern. He eventually became a broker and formed the Binswanger Company, which now operates in 16 cities in the United States, Europe and Japan.
        Among the major projects he helped develop were the Penn Center, the Mall Building in the the Independence Mall area, the KYW radio and television center and Philadelphia National Bank Building.
        Mr. Binswanger helped create the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporationn and the Philadelphia Industrial Park. In 1941 he founded the forerunner of the National Society of Industrial and Office Realtors.
        He was a former chairman of the Civic Center Board and helped create several tourist attractions, including the Fairmount Park historic houses and the Japanese House and Garden. For four decades, mayors appointed Mr. Binswanger the city's good-will ambassador to foreign cities.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and three sons, Frank G. Binswanger Jr. of Philadelphia, Robert B. Binswanger of Rockport, Me., and John K. Binswanger of Meadowbrook, Pa.
