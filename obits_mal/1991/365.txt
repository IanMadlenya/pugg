        Etan Manasse, a New York industrial and graphics designer, died last Thursday. He was 48 years old and lived in Manhattan and New Hope, Pa.
        He died of injuries suffered in a traffic accident in New Hope, a family spokesman said.
        In recent years his work included projects for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the American Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Department of Energy.
        A native of Haifa, Israel, he came to the United States in 1957 and became a citizen in 1962. He was a graduate of Pratt Institute and received a master's degree in fine arts from the University of California at Los Angeles.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Michele Scemama; a daughter, Melina, and a son, Evan, both of Manhattan; a sister, Michele Manasse of Seattle, and his mother, Helen Reiss Manasse of Portland, Ore.
