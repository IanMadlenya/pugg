        Edward Grimes Breen, a former Mayor of Dayton who served four years in the House of Representatives, died Wednesday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Dayton, where he had been a patient since 1986. He was 82 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        In 1945, when he was 37 years old, Mr. Breen, a Democrat, became Dayton's youngest Mayor. He resigned to run successfully for Congress in 1948 and was re-elected in 1950. He resigned a year later because of poor health.
        Mr. Breen was elected to the Montgomery County Commission in 1956 and served twice as its president.
        He is survived by his wife, Constance; two sons, a daughter, a sister and three grandchildren.
