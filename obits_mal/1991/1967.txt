        He was a friend and speech writer for Raul Alfonsin, the former President of Argentina, and wrote two books on Mr. Alfonsin's presidency. He recently wrote a book on the current President, Carlos Saul Menem, titled, "Menem: His Secret Logic."
        Mr. Giusssani, who grew up in Bolivia, his birthplace, and in Britain, had written for several Buenos Aires newspapers, and had been a columnist for The Associated Press in Buenos Aires.
        He is survived by his wife, Julia Constenla de Giussani, three daughters and a son, Pablo Giussani Jr., a translator for The Associated Press in New York.
