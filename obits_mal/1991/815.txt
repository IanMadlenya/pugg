        Willi Boskovsky, a master waltz violinist and conductor, died here on Sunday. He was 81 and lived in Visp, a mountain town 100 miles east of Geneva.
        Friends said he died after a third stroke, Swiss newspapers reported today.
        Mr. Boskosvky was born in Vienna on June 16, 1909, and joined the Vienna Philharmonic in 1933. Three years later, he was named concertmaster.
        He did not achieve world fame until he succeeded Clemens Krauss as conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic's New Year's concerts in 1954. He continued conducting the concerts until his retirement in 1979. His double role as violinist and conductor revived a tradition set by Johann Strauss himself.
        Broadcasts of the New Year's concerts made Mr. Boskovsky famous. He frequently worked with Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and with the London Philharmonic.
        A spokesman for the Vienna Philharmonic said funeral arrangements were incomplete.
