        Dr. Harold Trapido, an expert on tropical medicine and viruses who worked in South America, India and Louisiana, died Thursday at Touro Infirmary in New Orleans. He was 74 years old.
        Dr. Trapido died of colon cancer, said Ed Bordes, administrator of the New Orleans Mosquito Control Board, which Dr. Trapido served as chairman.
        As a young biologist, Dr. Trapido went to work for the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama in 1944. There, he took part in the first field testing in the Western Hemisphere of the insecticide DDT to kill malaria-carrying mosquitoes. During 12 years in Panama and Colombia, he also conducted research on controlling yellow fever.
        In 1956, Dr. Trapido became deputy director of the Rockefeller Foundation's Virus Research Center in Poona, India.
        From 1970 to 1984, Dr. Trapido headed the department of tropical medicine and medical parasitology at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine, where he was named professor emeritus.
        He was born in Newark and earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Cornell University. Dr. Trapido served on the editorial board of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and the board at the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory.
        He is survived by his wife of 38 years, the former Jean Litchman of New Orleans; a son, Paul Trapido of Bethesda, Md., and a brother, Joel Trapido of Hawaii.
