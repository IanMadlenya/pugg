        Joseph Lovinger, a Jewish official in Greece for the last quarter-century and a vice president of the European Jewish Congress since 1985, died on April 9 at a clinic in Athens. He was 77 years old and lived in Athens.
        He died of cancer of the bile duct, his family said.
        Mr. Lovinger, a native of Vac, Hungary, immigrated to Greece in 1933. He was a leader in the Jewish resistance to the Nazis, arranging for passage of refugees from Europe through Greece to Palestine and later helping Greek Jews to escape into the mountains during the Italian and German occupation. He was arrested twice by Axis forces but escaped both times and eventually made his way to Haifa, where he remained until the war's end.
        After the war, Mr. Lovinger established a pharmaceutical business in Athens. Since 1967 he was president of the Central Jewish Board, the umbrella organization covering all Jewish congregations in Greece.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Berta Gross; a son, Andrew, of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
