        Warren H. Bacon, a civic leader in Chicago, died Wednesday at his home there. He was 68 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Mr. Bacon, active in black and interracial organizations in Chicago, was often mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate. He was a former director of community relations for the Inland Steel Company and a member of the Chicago Board of Education from 1963 to 1973, when desegregation was a heated issue.
        He retired in 1990 after five years as president of Chicago United, a multiracial consortium of business and professional leaders.
        A graduate of the University of Chicago, Mr. Bacon was a vice president at the Supreme Life Insurance Company before joining Inland Steel in 1966.
        He was also chairman of the education committee of the American Iron and Steel Institute, a former trustee and secretary of the Russell Sage Foundation and a former chairman of the Business Research Advisory Council of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He also served on numerous Chicago civic organizations.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Lou; three sons, Warren Jr. of Newton, Mass., and Roger and Randall, both of Chicago; three sisters, and four grandchildren.
