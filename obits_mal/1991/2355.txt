        Maurice C. Brigadier, a lawyer in New Jersey since 1923, when he also began to teach what became the state's prime bar review course, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        A law graduate of New York University, Mr. Brigadier was the original partner of what is now the Jersey City firm of Margulies, Wind, Herrington & Katz, where he was of counsel at his death.
        For more than 54 years, until 1977, he taught the Brigadier law review course and, later, in association with Seymour Margulies, the Brigadier-Margulies law review course at various locations in New Jersey. Among his students were retired Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the United States Supreme Court and generations of state judges, governors and other public officials.
        Mr. Brigadier is survived by his daughter, Jane Howland of Williamstown, Mass., and three grandchildren.
