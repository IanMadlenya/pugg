        Bishop George H. Guilfoyle, retired head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Camden, N.J., and a former Auxiliary Bishop of New York, died on Tuesday at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden. He was 77 years old.
        He died of complications from a respiratory ailment, for which he had been hospitalized for a month, a spokesman for the diocese said.
        Bishop Guilfoyle, who retired two years ago and was succeeded by Bishop James T. McHugh, was installed as the fourth Bishop of Camden in 1968.
        Bishop Guilfoyle, a native New Yorker, was a graduate of Georgetown University, held a law degree from Fordham and was admitted to the New York bar in 1939. He attended St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, N.Y., and was ordained to the priesthood in 1944. Led Catholic Charities
        He served with the New York Archdiocese until his Camden appointment, and earned a Master of Law degree from Columbia in 1949. He held a number of administrative posts in the church and from 1956 to 1966 was executive director of Catholic Charities for the archdiocese.
        In 1964, he was consecrated as Auxiliary Bishop of New York and from 1966 to 1968 he served as episcopal vicar of Staten Island and pastor of St. Peter's parish there.
        During Bishop Guilfoyle's 21 years in Camden, he made several innovations in diocesan administration, including establishing the first Office of Pastoral Planning in a Roman Catholic diocese in the United States and an Office of Evangelization, one of the first in the country.
        He is survived by a sister, Mildred McGuirl of Pelham Manor, N.Y.
