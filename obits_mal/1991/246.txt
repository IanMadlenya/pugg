        Daniel B. Dodson, professor emeritus at Columbia University, died on Sunday at his home in Sollies-Ville, France. He was 72 years old.
        He died of liver failure, said Dean Morgan Schmitter, a friend.
        Professor Dodson, a specialist in drama and contemporary comparative literature, began teaching at Columbia in 1947. He retired in 1980, and was awarded the 1980 Bancroft Distinguished Retiring Professor Award.
        In 1964, he testified on behalf of the comedian Lenny Bruce at his trial on charges of giving obscene monologues at a Greenwich Village coffeehouse. Professor Dodson said that Mr. Bruce's performances were in the tradition of Swift and Rabelais.
        Professor Dodson wrote six books. His first novel, "The Man Who Ran Away," a story of intrigue in the Caribbean, was published in the late 1950's by Dutton. His most recent, "The Last Command," is about the French fleet in Toulon Harbor during World War II and was published in paperback last year.
        Professor Dodson was born in Portland, Ore., and graduated from Reed College there.
        In World War II, he flew B-24 bombers over the Himalayas into China. After the war he received an M.A. and a Ph.D. from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Judith Ware of Sparkill, N.Y.; two daughters, Dorian Valde of Santa Fe, N.M., and Elizabeth Fontana of Newton, Mass.; two sisters, Cordelia Hood of Damariscotta, Me., and Lisbeth Fisher of New Harbor, Me., and two grandchildren.
