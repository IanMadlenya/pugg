        Norton J. Bramesco, a medical writer and advertising-agency executive, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Bramesco, a native of the Bronx and a graduate of the Columbia University School of Pharmacy, was a sales representative for the pharmaceutical manufacturer A. H. Robins before becoming a medical writer.
        In 1982 he was a founding partner of Sutton Communications, a pharmaceutical advertising agency that is now part of Medicus Intercon International, which handles medical advertising.
        Under the pseudonym Daedalus, Mr. Bramesco wrote the "Wit's End" column for Diversion, a magazine for physicians, for more than a decade. He was co-author with Dr. Martin Ecker of "Radiation: All You Need to Know to Stop Worrying . .  . or to Start," published by Vintage Books in 1981.
        Mr. Bramesco is survived by his wife, the former Ronnie Zolondek; a son, Clint, of Salem, Mass.; a daughter, Erica Stull of Denver; a brother, Ronald, of Mahopac, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
