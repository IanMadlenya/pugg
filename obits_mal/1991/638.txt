        Nathan Tannenbaum, an accountant active in Jewish causes, died on Thursday at the Jewish Home & Hospital in Manhattan. He was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Tannenbaum, a certified public accountant, founded his own firm in the 1930's. He was also a life-long Zionist and helped U.S.A Israel Bonds, the American Friends of the Hebrew University and similar groups.
        At Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, contributions ranging from the Tannenbaum Conference Hall to the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit were made by Mr. Tannenbaum and his wife, the former Bernice Salpeter, chairwoman of the American section of the World Zionist Organization.
        Mr. Tannenbaum was a native of Tarnopol in what is now the Soviet Union. He came to the United States at the age of 10.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two children from a former marriage, a son, Morton, of Somers, N.Y., and a daughter, Sylvia Ander of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
