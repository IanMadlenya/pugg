        Donald F. Young, a stockbroker who helped develop a leading risk-analysis system for stock option trading, died on Tuesday at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 39 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his wife, Dianne, said.
        Mr. Young was a partner in the Wall Street firm of Wagner & Stott Company, which he joined in 1977 as head of its options and derivative markets division. He was named a general partner in 1978 and joined senior management in 1985.
        He was a 1975 graduate of the University of Chicago School of Business and had been with A. G. Becker Securities in Manhattan before joining Wagner & Stott. At Becker, he developed the "plot" system, a computer model for estimating exposure to risk in stock option trades. He served on many advisory committees of the New York Stock Exchange and of the New York Futures Exchange.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Brian; his parents, Howard and Merle Young of Cayuhoga, Ohio; a sister, Janet Kershaw of West Lake, Ohio, and a brother, Daniel, a student at the University of California-Los Angeles.
