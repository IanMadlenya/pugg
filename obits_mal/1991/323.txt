        Mordechai Ish-Shalom, a former Mayor of West Jerusalem, died on Thursday, Israeli officials announced today. He was 90 years old.
        The cause of his death was not given.
        Mr. Ish-Shalom was Mayor of the Israeli sector of Jerusalem from 1959 to 1965, a period when the city was divided with the Arabs and administered by Jordan. Israel captured the Arab sector in the 1967 war.
        Mr. Ish-Shalom was born in Lithuania in 1902 and came to British Palestine in 1923. His political career began in the Stonecutters' Union in 1935, and he rose through the Histadrut labor federation, which was a backbone of Jewish politics before Israeli independence in 1948.
