        Leo A. Weiss, who founded a multimillion-dollar manufacturing company and later ran programs to help struggling entrepreneurs, died on Wednesday at Alexandria Hospital in Alexandria, Va. He was 73 years old and lived in Alexandria.
        He died after suffering a stroke, his family said.
        He founded Avien Inc., in Woodside, Queens, and served as its chief executive for 27 years. The company, which has since closed, employed up to 1,000 workers, making generic prescription drugs and products for electronics, instruments, controls, hydraulics and military ordnance arming and safety devices. Earlier he was an assistant to William P. Lear, chairman of Lear Inc., and also worked on early unmanned aircraft before the advent of guided missiles.
        After retiring in 1975, he worked with two nonprofit organizations in which business experts critique and advise new and expanding enterprises, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Venture Clinic in New York and the Long Island Technology Forum. Later he helped found and was chairman of the M.I.T. Enterprise Forum of Washington-Baltimore, founded the Venture Clinic of Alexandria and created a public access television series, "The Venture Game."
        He was also a columnist for The Washington Business Journal.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mildred Ramsay; three sons, Steven, of Ann Arbor, Mich., Scott, of Alexandria and Randolph, of Cape Coral, Fla.; a daughter, Robin Weiss Lanier of Alexandria; a brother, Jerome of Los Angeles; eight grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
