        Dr. A. Damien Martin, one of the founders of Harvey Milk High School and a social-service agency to assist young homosexuals and their families, died on Thursday at his home. He was 57 years old and lived in New York.
        He died of complications of AIDS, said Frances Kunreuther, executive director of the Hetrick-Martin Institute.
        The institute was founded in 1979 by Dr. Martin and his companion, Dr. Emery S. Hetrick, as the Institute for the Protection of Lesbian and Gay Youth. In 1988, a year after the death of Dr. Hetrick, the chief of psychiatric emergency and crisis treatment services at Harlem Hospital, the institute was renamed for its two founders.
        The Harvey Milk High School was established by the institute and the New York City Board of Education as an alternative secondary school program created, Dr. Martin said, "for gay youths, partly because violence inflicted on young homosexuals made it impossible for some to stay in other schools."
        Dr. Martin was affiliated with many gay-rights organizations and was a member of the Governor's Task Force on Teen Suicide, the Child Welfare League of America's Task Force on AIDS, the New York City Task Force on AIDS and the New York City Board of Education's Multicultural Advisory Committee.
        A Philadelphia native, Dr. Martin taught speech pathology at New York University's School of Education.
        He is survived by three sisters, Anne and Therese Martin and Rosemary Edwards, all of New York City, and two brothers, John Lambert of Blackwood, N.J., and Charles Lambert of Philadelphia, and a niece, Eileen McGrath.
