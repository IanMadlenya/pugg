        Somers Hayes Sturgis, a pioneer in birth control research who was a founder of the first abortion clinic in Massachusetts, died Wednesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 86 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said his daughter, Joan Sturgis Mann.
        Dr. Sturgis was an advocate of abortion rights for many years. In 1973, six weeks after the Supreme Court ruling legalizing abortion, he opened the Crittendon Hastings clinic in Boston.
        In the 1930's and 40's, Dr. Sturgis collaborated on a series of reports from the Harvard School of Medicine that demonstrated that estrogen inhibits ovulation. Information from his research with Dr. Fuller Albright formed the basis of the contraceptive pill.
        Dr. Sturgis was born in Groton, Mass., and attended the Groton School. At Harvard University, where he graduated in 1927, he majored in fine arts. He then entered the medical school, and graduated in 1931. He received his post-graduate training at Massachusetts General Hospital.
        He was chief of the department of gynecology at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, now Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, from 1951 to 1969, and a professor of gynecology at Harvard from 1951 to 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances Ann; three daughters, Ms. Mann, of Brooklyn; Ann F. Watt, of Cambridge; and Margaret Ratheau, of Marlboro, Vt.; seven grandchildren; a sister, Susan B. Goodale, of Ipswich, Mass., and a brother, Warren, of Southbury, Conn.
