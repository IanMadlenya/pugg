        He later served as chaplain at Cabrini Hospital and at the Rusk Rehabilitation Center, both in Manhattan. He had also served on the Jewish Welfare Board in New York and California and was a founder and past president of the National Young Israel movement. He retired in 1979.
        He is survived by two daughters, Atarah Siegel of Buffalo Grove, Ill., and Levia Santoro of Latham, N.Y., two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
