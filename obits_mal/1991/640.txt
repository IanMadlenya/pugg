        Alexander Gotfryd, a photographer and a former art director of the Doubleday Publishing Company, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 59 years old and resided in New York City and in Bellport, L.I.
        He died of complications following pneumonia, a spokesman for the family said.
        After 30 years with Doubleday, Mr. Gotfryd retired last year as vice president and executive art director. At the time of his death, he was art director emeritus at the publishing company.
        Mr. Gotfryd "may have designed more book jackets than any individual in modern publishing history," said the Doubleday president and publisher, Stephen Rubin. He oversaw the jacket direction of some of the biggest best sellers of the last three decades, including "The Agony and the Ecstasy," "Airport," "Jaws" and "Roots."
        In January Mr. Gotfryd received the Literary Market Place Award as designer of the year.
        Mr. Gotfryd was both author and photographer of the book "Appointment in Venice," published by Doubleday in 1988. He described this collection of images and reflections as "a confrontation with the subconscious."
        His romantic vision of an imaginary Egypt accompanied a text by Allen Drury in "Egypt: the Eternal Smile," published by Doubleday in 1980. Also a playwright, he was the author of two plays produced Off Broadway, "The Blasphemy of Arthur Rimbaud's Sister," in 1973, and "An Absence of Heroes," in 1974.
        Born in Warsaw, he was interned with his father in the Vaihingen camp until liberation. His mother, who had been held in Auschwitz, died shortly after her release.
        Mr. Gotfryd came with his father to the United States in 1946. He graduated from Queens College, attended the Sorbonne and Ecole des Beaux-Arts and did post-graduate work at Yale.
        He is survived by his stepmother, Sala Gotfryd of Forest Hills, Queens.
