        Michael Kuhnen, Germany's top neo-Nazi leader, died today at a hospital in the western German city of Kassel. He was 35 years old.
        Medical officials refused to disclose the cause of death. Mr. Kuhnen had been hospitalized for two weeks, and German newspapers said he had been ill for several months.
        Mr. Kuhnen was the most prominent leader of the small but fanatical neo-Nazi movement in Germany. Since 1983, the former West German Army officer had led various outlawed groups.
        His West German organizations never drew many members but his disciples were blamed for numerous violent attacks on foreigners and homosexuals.
        Since unification, neo-Nazi radicals increasingly have waged attacks on foreigners, including the stoning attack on Polish visitors two weeks ago when Germany relaxed visa restrictions on Poles.
        There was no immediate word on funeral plans or survivors.
