        Bishop Walter McCollough, who preached to poor and middle-class inner-city residents as leader of the United House of Prayer for All People, died of heart ailments on Thursday at Howard Uiversity Hospital. He was 76 years old.
        Bishop McCollough presided over an organization with as many as three million members in 132 cities in 23 states. It operates six churches, low-rent apartment buildings in several cities, day-care centers, homes for the elderly and cafeterias.
        A native of Great Falls, S.C., Bishop McCollough came to Washington in the 1930's and later became chauffeur for Bishop Charles M. Grace, who founded the church in 1926. After Bishop Grace died in 1960, Bishop McCollough succeeded him, and adopted his nickname, Sweet Daddy.
        He is survived by his wife, Clara, and four children.
