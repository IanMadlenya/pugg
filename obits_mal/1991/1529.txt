        Asdrubal Villanueva, a self-educated engineer who held 184 patents and who founded a solar-energy appliance company, died on Wednesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lymphoma, the family said.
        Mr. Villanueva was the president of Solar Retrofit Consortium, which develops and manufactures residential solar-energy appliances.
        He was born in Porta Plata in the Dominican Republic, came to this country at the age of 25 and worked simultaneously in many blue-collar jobs while studying mathematics, sciences and engineering in the main reading room of the New York Public Library.
        He held 184 patents in solar energy appliances and components and had applied for 31 more.
        Mr. Villanueva founded the family-owned consortium in 1978 and managed it from his research headquarters at 1040 First Avenue at 56th Street in Manhattan. The association manufactures and distributes advanced solar energy units for residences in 17 Latin American countries under such brand names as Rural Solares in Mexico, Energia Solares in Venezuela and USA-SOL in Panama.
        He is survived by three sisters, Norma and Mynoan, of Santa Domingo, and Anna Mandracchia of Brooklyn.
