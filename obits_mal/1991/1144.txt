        Lewis Bruce Carr, a real-estate lawyer for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. He was 76 years old and lived in Westhampton Beach.
        He died of cancer, a daughter, Amy, said.
        Mr. Carr was an expert in shopping-center law, an area that became important in the 1960's. Among his clients were Norman K. Winston, a real-estate developer, and the Corland Corporation, a Manhattan real-estate holding company for which he was counsel.
        He retired from private practice in 1981 as general counsel to Mr. Winston and as a lawyer for clients like James Rosenquist, the artist, and Jane Holzer.
        He then taught courses in real-estate brokerage law at New York University, Hofstra University and Suffolk Community College.
        Mr. Carr, a native New Yorker, graduated from Long Island University and received a degree from Brooklyn Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jeanie Harris; two daughters, Amy, of Manhattan, and Susan, of Manhattan; a sister, Zelda Rubin of Hollywood, Fla., and a granddaughter.
