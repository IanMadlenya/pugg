        The Rev. Dr. Philip A. Johnson, an internationally known Lutheran minister who worked to enlist businesses in social action, died on Sunday at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of leukemia, said his wife, Cecile, an artist and illustrator who is known professionally as Cecile Ryden.
        In the late 1940's and early 50's, Dr. Johnson spearheaded a drive to integrate peacefully a racially tense section of Chicago's South Side, where he was the pastor of Salem Lutheran Church. He integrated the church and promoted harmony in the area by founding the Park Manor Neighborhood Association.
        His efforts, chronicled in his book "Call Me Neighbor, Call Me Friend" (Doubleday, 1965), brought threats on his life and awards from the City of Chicago, the Urban League and the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        From 1975 on, he worked closely with inter-faith groups to make business executives aware of their social responsibilities. He also served as interim director of the Lutheran Office for World Community at the United Nations and previously was executive director of the World Association for Christian Communication and associate executive secretary of the World Council of Churches in New York.
        He was director of public relations for the National Lutheran Council from 1958 to 1966, and from 1949 to 1958, he was the pastor of Salem Church. A graduate of the Augustana Theological Seminary, he was ordained in 1941.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Stevan, of Seattle; a daughter, Pamela, of Washington; a brother, Paul, of Green Valley, Ariz; a sister, Helen, of Milwaukee, and a grandson.
