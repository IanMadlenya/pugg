        Alfred F. Havighurst, professor emeritus of history at Amherst College, died Wednesday at a convalescent home in Leeds, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Amherst, Mass.
        He died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the college.
        Dr. Havighurst, who received his doctoral degree from Havard University, joined the faculty at Amherst in 1931 and retired in 1970. His best-known work, "Twentieth Century Britain," published by Harper & Row and the University of Chicago Press, went into four editions.
        He was a member of the American Historical Association and the British Records Association and was a Fellow of the Royal Historical Association.
        He is survived by a sister, Miriam Johnson of Batavia, Ill.; a brother, Walter of Richmond, Ind., and a stepson, Arthur Porter, who lives near Bordeaux, France.
