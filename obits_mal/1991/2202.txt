        Fred Perlberg, a retired manufacturer of women's evening dresses in New York, died yesterday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla.  He was 90 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his son, Edward, said.
        A native of New York City, Fred Perlberg worked in the garment industry from the time he left high school at the age of 16. At 19, he founded Fred Perlberg Originals, known for moderate-priced dance dresses that young women wore to proms and weddings. His clothes were sold in major stores throughout the United States and Canada. He was named Man of the Year by the fashion industry when he retired in 1968.
        With his wife, Gertrude, Mr. Perlberg donated an auditorium to the Peninsula General Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens. His other philanthropies included the United Jewish Appeal, St. John's Hospital in Far Rockaway, the Philips Academy and the Addison Museum of American Art in Andover, Mass.
        In Palm Beach, where he moved after retiring, Mr. Perlberg's philanthropic interests included the Morse Geriatric Home, the Kravis Music Center, St. Mary's Hospital and the Good Samaritan Hospital.
        In addition to his wife and son, who resides in New York, he is survived by a sister, Mae Goldberg, of Miami; a daughter, Judith Chasanoff, of New York, and four grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
