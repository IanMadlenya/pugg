        Arthur Herschman, an official of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for 17 years, died Wednesday at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 62 years old.
        He died of liver and prostate cancer, said a spokeswoman for the family.
        Dr. Herschman, who received a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Yale University in 1954, joined the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1974. As head of meetings and the publications center, he was responsible for the organization's annual meetings and for the publication of books and journals. He retired earlier this year.
        Previously he had been director of information programs for the American Institute of Physics, where he developed a computerized information retrieval system for scientists. He had also been editor of The Physical Review, the journal of the American Physical Society, and had taught at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts.
        He is survived by his wife, Beth; two sons, Noah and Ethan, both of Boston; and a brother, Stanley, of Los Angeles.
