        Samuel H. Reis, a former lawyer with the United States Department of Justice in Manhattan and in Washington, died yesterday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 93 years old.
        He died of complications from a stroke, said his son, Dr. Donald J. Reis.
        As an assistant United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Mr. Reis gained recognition in the early 1940's for his role in investigations of Nazi-linked activities of the German-American Bund. In 1949 he joined the Department of Justice in Washington and served in the criminal and civil rights divisions and was deputy to the Attorney General.
        Mr. Reis, a native New Yorker, attended City College and received a law degree from New York University.
        Besides his son from a former marriage, Mr. Reis is survived by his wife, the former Maria Luisa Pinero Loys, a lawyer and former diplomat from Cuba.
