        John V. Burns, an advertising and marketing executive, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 65 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Burns, a resident of Greenwich, Conn., for many years before he moved to Naples in 1981, attended Notre Dame and graduated from the University of Illinois. He served with Procter & Gamble and the Alberto-Culver Company before joining the Wells Rich Greene advertising agency in 1967, where he became executive vice president for marketing.
        In 1975 Mr. Burns was named president of the Conahy & Lyon agency. For the last 10 years, he had operated his own marketing company, Showtime Commuunications, in Naples.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Cassidy; three daughters, Valerie Burns Winningham, Bridget Bucknall and Kathleen Burns, all of Greenwich; two sons, John Jr. and Richard, both of Greenwich, and four grandchildren.
