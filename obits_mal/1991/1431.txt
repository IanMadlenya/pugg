        Dr. Edgar Alsop Riley, professor emeritus of clinical medicine at the Cornell University Medical College, died on Sunday at his home in Tesuque, N.M., near Santa Fe. He was 72 years old.
        He died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Riley, a specialist in internal medicine and pulmonary disease, had a private practice and was an attending physician at New York Hospital and an associate professor at Cornell's Medical College from 1951 to 1984, when he retired to New Mexico and became a volunteer doctor with the Indian Health Service.
        A native of Manhattan, he graduated from St. Paul's School, Yale University and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. He was an intern and resident at Bellevue Hospital.
        Dr. Riley served in the Army Medical Corps in the late 1940's, rising to the rank of captain, and was a former president of the New York State Trudeau Society and the Manhattan branch of the Society of Certified Internists.
        He is survived by his wife, Daphne; a son, Robert, of Spofford, N.H.; two daughters, Sally Roll ofArlington, Mass., and Nancy Carson of Kennett Square, Pa.; a stepson, Robin MacLaury of Noank, Conn.; three stepdaughters, Diana Johnson of Pasadena, Calif., Timothea Comstedt of Boulder, Colo., and Celia Strebendt of Plattsburg, N.Y.; a sister, Mary Patton of St. Louis, and 11 grandchildren.
