        Dr. Reuben Straus, a retired pathologist who directed laboratories in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., died Saturday at his home in Lake Oswego, Ore.  He was 84 years old.
        He died in his sleep of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Straus, an accomplished violinist, founded the Los Angeles Doctors' Symphony Orchestra in 1954 and later was president of the Portland Chamber Orchestra Association. In 1987 he wrote a book, "Illnesses and Mortality of Famous Composers."
        He was born in Philadelphia and received a bachelor's degree and a medical degree from Western Reserve University. He was director of laboratories at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, at Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calf., and, from 1950 to 1971, at St. Joseph Hospital in Burbank, Calif. In 1971 he took a similar post at Providence Hospital in Portland.
        After retiring in 1976, Dr. Straus volunteered his services for a year to the new Soroka Medical Center at Ben Gurion University in Beer-Sheva, Israel. He stayed for four years as senior pathologist at the medical center and as visiting professor at the university's medical school.
        Dr. Straus was a founding Fellow of the College of American Pathologists and of the Association of Clinical Scientists. He was a diplomate of the National Board of Medical Examiners.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Miriam Cooper; a son, Alan, of Oxford, Ohio; a daughter, Patricia Manville of Norman, Okla.; a sister, Sylvia Heschel of Manhattan; a brother, Jack, of Encino, Calif., three grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
