        George L. Haskins, a retired professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania, died last Friday at his home in Hancock, Me. He was 76 years old.
        He died of natural causes, said a paralegal with his estate.
        Professor Haskins was born in Cambridge, Mass., and was graduated from the Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University and Harvard Law School.
        After serving in the Army in World War II, he was a member of the United States delegation to the conference in San Francisco that organized the United Nations.
        He joined the University of Pennsylvania law school faculty in 1946 and taught courses in property law, commercial-land transactions, decedents' estates, wills and legal history. He held the school's oldest endowed chair, the Algernon Sydney Biddle Professorship.
        He wrote more than 80 articles on legal and historical subjects and was the author of numerous books. He was one of eight scholars assigned to produce a history of the Supreme Court of the United States that was authorized by Congress pursuant to the will of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. His assigned volume, "John Marshall: Foundations of Power," was published in 1981.
        Professor Haskins is survived by his wife, Gertrude Haskins of Hancock, Me., and a stepdaughter, Harriet Nicol.
