        Ralph E. Kennickell Jr., chief of the Government Printing Office in the second term of the Reagan Administration, was killed in an auto accident in Bland County in southwestern Virginia on Sunday. He was 45 years old and lived in Wexford, Pa.
        A car driven by Mr. Kennickell, who was on vacation, left the road at a curve on U.S. 52 and struck an embankment, the Virginia state police said.
        Mr. Kennickell worked in his family's printing business in Savannah, Ga., before going to Washington in 1981 as a consultant to the Treasury Department. He headed the Government Printing Office from 1984 to 1988, then left to become executive director of the Graphic Arts Technical Foundation, a scientific, technical and educational organization based in Pittsburgh for the international graphic communications industry. In 1989 he became a consultant to the printing industry.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara Davis Kennickell, and his sons, Ralph 3d and Jason R., all of Wexford, Pa.; his mother, Nancy Kennickell, and his father, Ralph E., of Savannah, and two brothers, Arthur Barry of Washington and Robert L. of Garland, Tex.
