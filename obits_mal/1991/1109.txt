        Edward F. D'Arms, a former classics professor and an executive with the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, died on Tuesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 87 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        From the late 1940's through the 1960's, before the National Endowments brought public financing to the humanities and the arts, Dr. D'Arms directed private efforts to pay for scholarly and creative projects.
        He was assistant and associate director of humanities for the Rockefeller Foundation from 1947 to 1957 and served with the Ford Foundation from 1957 to 1969, when he retired as program officer.
        Dr. D'Arms, a native of Buffalo, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Princeton and, as a Rhodes Scholar, received bachelor's and master's degrees from Oriel College, Oxford. He also held a doctorate from Princeton.
        He taught classics at Princeton and the Universities of Minnesota and Colorado before serving as an Army major in France and Germany in World War II. After the war he was chief of education and religious policy in the Army's Civil Affairs Division.
        His wife, the former Cristina Coney, died in 1987. He is survived by three sons; John, of Ann Arbor, Mich., Edward Jr., of Seattle and Philip, of Syracuse, and four grandchildren.
