        Arthur H. Konvitz, a fund-raiser who was an early developer of the charity telethon, died on Jan. 26 at his home in Inverrary, Fla. He was 78 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        In 1952, he staged a telethon starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, which raised $500,000 for the New York Cardiac Home. Among those he later arranged telethons for were the American Heart Association, the Association for the Help of Retarded Children and the City of Hope in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Konvitz, a native of Brooklyn, was a field representative for the Jewish Welfare Board before starting his own public-relations firm.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Florence Karp; a son, Jeffrey, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; a daughter, Cheryl Lippman of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a sister, Rosalie Reider of Santa Barbara, Calif., and three granddaughters.
