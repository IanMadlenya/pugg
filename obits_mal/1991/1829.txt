        Benjamin A. Smith 2d, who filled John F. Kennedy's seat in the United States Senate for two years after Mr. Kennedy became President, died Thursday at Addison Gilbert Hospital in Gloucester, Mass. He was 75 years old. Mr. Smith died after a long illness. The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Smith, who had been Mr. Kennedy's roommate at Harvard and an usher at his wedding, was appointed by Gov. Foster Furcolo of Massachusetts at Mr. Kennedy's suggestion. He agreed when he took the post that he would not run for the seat in 1962, the year of the next regular election. By then the President's youngest brother, Edward M. Kennedy, would be eligible to run. Senators must be at least 30 years old.
        Edward Kennedy was elected in 1962, then ran successfully again for a full six-year term in 1964, when President Kennedy's Senate term normally would have ended.
        Mr. Smith later served on the United States Senate campaign committees for Robert F. Kennedy in New York in 1964 and was with the Robert Kennedy presidential campaign in 1968.
        He was the Mayor of Gloucester in 1954 and 1955 and served on the Gloucester City Council. He was the chief executive for many years of the Merchants Box Company, a family business in Gloucester. During World War II, he served in the Navy, reaching the rank of commander.
        Surviving are his wife, Barbara Mecham Smith, two sons and three daughters.
