        He died of complications from a perforated colon, his parents, Jack and Betty Hardesty, said.
        Mr. Hardesty was born in Ashland, Kan., and studied music in London as a Fulbright Scholar.

In 1977, Leonard Bernstein invited him to sing the Bach "Magnificat" at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
        Mr. Hardesty made his New York debut in 1979 in the United States premiere of Steffani's 18th-century opera "La Liberta Contenta" with the Clarion Opera Society. Among his other operatic appearances were those in Monteverdi's "Coronation of Poppea" with the Long Beach, Calif., and Washington Opera companies, and Peter Sellars's production of Handel's "Julius Caesar" at Pepsico Summerfare in Purchase, N.Y.
        As a recitalist, he performed the premieres of works by Daniel Pinkham, Robin Holloway and Ned Rorem.
        In addition to his parents, who live in Ashland, he is survived by a sister, Beverly Harms of Colorado Springs, Colo.
