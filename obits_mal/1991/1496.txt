        Archbishop Sion Manoogian, a former primate of the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, died on Tuesday in Etchmiadzin, Armenia. He was 85 years old and lived in Armenia and in Florida.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the diocese said.
        Archbishop Manoogian headed the diocese from 1958 to 1966, after which he became pontifical legate in charge of the Armenian communities in Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. Since 1955 he had been a member of the Supreme Spiritual Council, the highest Armenian ecclesiastical body, and for several years until his death he had served as its chairman.
        The Archbishop was born in the village of Kirashen, near Van in Turkish Armenia. His parents and his brothers and sisters were killed during the mass deportation and massacre of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915. He was taken to safety in the Caucasus but returned to Armenia when Russian forces occupied Van. Ordained in 1930
        In 1918 he was part of a group of refugees who fled to Iran and Iraq, and in 1922 he was among 850 Armenian orphans taken into the Armenian community of Jerusalem. He began studies for the priesthood, and in 1930 was ordained.
        In 1938 Father Manoogian came to the United States to serve as a pastor in Providence, R.I., and the following year he became vicar general of the of the American diocese and chairman of its governing body, the Diocesan Council.
        He was consecrated as a bishop and appointed pontifical legate in charge of the church's South American dioceses in 1952. Six years later he was elected primate of the American Diocese. During his two four-year terms in that post, he began fund raising for construction of the St. Vartan Cathedral and its adjoining administrative complex on Second Avenue in Manhattan.
        Archbishop Manoogian has no immediate survivors.
