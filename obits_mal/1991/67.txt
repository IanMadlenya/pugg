        James Augustus Clendinen, who in 27 years as the editor of The Tampa Tribune in Florida helped bring about many government reforms in his city and state, died Friday at Tampa General Hospital. He was 80 years old.

        Mr. Clendinen worked for The Tribune for half a century. As its editor from 1958 until his retirement in 1985, he campaigned for open government, election reform and a code of ethics for elected officials. A moderate conservative, he developed a reputation as a man with the power to make or break political candidates.
        He also took part in the successful battle to restructure Florida's judicial system and served as a member of the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission from 1975 until last year.  Joined Tribune in 1935
        Born in Eufaula, Ala., he graduated as class valedictorian from his high school in Clearwater. Fla., then attended the University of Florida. He went to work for The Clearwater Evening Sun in 1930 as a reporter, quickly becoming managing editor.
        He joined the staff of The Tribune in 1935 and remained with the newspaper until retirement, except for three years during World War II, when he served in the Army Air Forces.
        Mr. Clendinen was a former president of the National Conference of Editorial Writers and founder and first president of the Florida Society of Editors. He was awarded first prize for editorial writing by the Florida Daily Newspaper Association 13 times.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Harrison; a son, James Dudley Clendinen, a freelance writer in Atlanta and former reporter for The New York Times; a daughter, Melissa Louise Spring, an account executive with the American Home Shield real estate company in Tampa; two sisters, Bessie Clendinen and Carolyn Clendinen Smith of Tampa, and two grandchildren.
