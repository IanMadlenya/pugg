        Webb Pierce, a flamboyant singer who dominated country music in the 1950's and 60's, died at his home here on Sunday. He was 65 years old.
        He had pancreatic cancer, a family spokesman, Max Powell, said.
        Cash Box magazine, a music-industry weekly, named Mr. Pierce the top male vocalist every year from 1952 to 1956 and again from 1961 to 1963. "In the Jailhouse Now," a hit in 1955, was one of 50 songs Mr. Pierce carried into the top 10 of the country music charts. Among his other hits were "Love Love Love," "I Don't Care," "Teen-Age Boogie," "Tupelo County Jail" and "Bye Bye Love."
        Mr. Pierce promoted himself in the early 1960's by driving a car decorated inside and out with some 1,000 silver dollars. In the early 1970's, he built a $75,000 guitar-shaped swimming pool at his home; it attracted so many tourists that neighbors obtained a court order barring them.
        A native of Monroe, La., Mr. Pierce left a job as manager of a men's furnishings section of a department store to pursue a music career. He had been in semi-retirement for several years.
