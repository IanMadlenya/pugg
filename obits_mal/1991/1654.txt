        Frederick H. Schneider, the president of Roosevelt Savings Bank from 1967 to 1983, died on Monday at his home in La Canada, Calif., where he was living in retirement. He was 73 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said a spokesman for the bank, which is based in Garden City, L.I.
        Mr. Schneider, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1939 and attended the Harvard and St. John's University Law Schools, receiving his law degree from St. John's in 1947. In between, he spent four years as an officer in the Navy, seeing action in the campaigns in Sicily, Salerno, Omaha Beach in Normandy, and Okinawa.
        He was elected to the Roosevelt board in 1951 and became president to succeed his father, Adam Schneider Jr., who had served in that post for 25 years. He is a past president of the Savings Bank Association of New York State as well as a former mayor and trustee of the Village of Garden City.
        Mr. Schneider is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Ruth Oswald; a daughter, Edith Roshe of Toulouse, France; a son, Fred Jr., of Pasadena, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
