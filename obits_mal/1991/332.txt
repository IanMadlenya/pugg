        Bishop Leo T. Maher, the former head of the Roman Catholic Diocese in San Diego, died at his home on Saturday. He was 75 years old.
        Bishop Maher had two operations last year for a malignant brain tumor. His health worsened early this month, said his brother, the Rev. Raymond Maher.
        Father Maher said his brother died peacefully while he read him passages from the Bible. "
        In 1989, the Bishop barred a California Assemblywoman, Lucy Killea, from taking Communion because she supported the right to abortion. He told her that her views amounted to "a grave scandal against the Church."
        The action drew nationwide attention to a bid by Mrs. Killea for a seat in the State Senate. It also created voter sympathy for Mrs. Killea, a Democrat, who won the seat in a heavily Republican district.
        Bishop Maher was born in Mount Union, Iowa, and studied for the priesthood in California. He was a clergyman for 47 years, including 21 years leading the San Diego diocese. He retired last year.
