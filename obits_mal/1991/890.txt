        Norman Cohen, former president of the Cohen Brothers Dress Corporation in Manhattan and a Florida real-estate developer, died on Wednesday at the Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Miami. He was 67 years old and lived in Miami.
        Mr. Cohen died of cancer, his daughter, Jacqueline, said.
        In recent years Mr. Cohen had been a real-estate developer in North Miami Beach, working on condominiums like the Royal Bahamian, Century 21 and Commodore Plaza as well as projects on Willams Island, Biscayne Cove and elsewhere.
        After World War II, Mr. Cohen joined the family-owned business, one of the oldest dress manufacturers in Manhattan, established in 1917. He became president on his father's death in 1960. His first development venture in real estate was in 1962, building dress factories in the South. In the late 1960's he devoted himself to real estate, but stayed a partner in the family business.
        He was a 1941 graduate of the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania and served in the Navy in the Pacific.
        Mr. Cohen was separated from his wife, the former Marion Gerrick. His companion was Michele Kapp.
        Besides his daughter, Jacqueline Chaplin of Great Neck, L.I., Mr. Cohen is survived by two sons, Gary, of North Miami Beach, and Andrew, of Hewlett Harbor, L.I.; two brothers, Irwin and Sanford, both of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.
