        Henry B. Hansteen, a retired electrical engineering professor who did research under the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi, died on Tuesday at age 86.
        Mr. Hansteen, who jumped off a bridge on the Cornell University campus into Fall Creek, had been ill and suffering from depression for several years, his daughter, Beatrice Brownell, said.
        Mr. Hansteen, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn with a degree in electrical engineering in 1924.
        He received a master's degree and doctorate in physics from Columbia University. While a graduate student at Columbia in 1941, he worked on fission, seeking how to split the uranium nucleus to create atomic energy, in a group led by Fermi, who later produced the first nuclear chain reaction.
        Mr. Hansteen joined the staff of City College of New York in 1950, remaining there for 17 years. He was chairman of its electrical engineering department from 1952 to 1955. From 1960 to 1963, he was on leave from the college to serve with the International Atomic Energy Headquarters in Vienna.
        In 1967, he joined the staff of the Brookhaven National Laboratory, for which he had been a consultant since 1948. He retired in 1969.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Emmi; a son, Robert, of Philadelphia; a sister and several grandchildren.
