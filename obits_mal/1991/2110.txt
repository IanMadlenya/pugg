        Carl I. Friedlander, a former president of the Aeronca Aircraft Company, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, his family said.
        A native of Cincinnati and graduate of Harvard University, Mr. Friedlander and his brother, John W., bought Aeronca, an early manufacturer of light aircraft based in Middletown, Ohio, in 1932. Its planes were used to train pilots throughout the world. The company was sold in the late 1950's and is now a subsidiary of Fleet Aeronautics Corporation of St. Catherines, Ontario.
        When he sold his company, Mr. Friedlander became a member of the New York Stock Exchange, a seat he held until 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Oppenheimer; a sister, Mary Plaut of Boston; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
