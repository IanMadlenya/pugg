        Solomon Kunis, a retired publicist and college journalism professor, died on Wednesday. He was 75 years old and lived in Queens.
        Mr. Kunis was stricken with heart failure while teaching at Queens College, his family said.
        He was born in Russia and came to New York City as a child. A graduate of City College and the New York University School of Journalism, he taught at City College from 1950 to 1970, then ran an advertising and public relations company, S. R. Kunis & Company. He retired from the business in 1989 and resumed teaching part-time.
        He is survived by his wife, Rena; two brothers, Sidney, of Hallandale, Fla., and Seymour, of Manhattan; and three stepdaughters, Joyce Schmid of Palo Alto, Calif., Dolly Gordon of Los Angeles, and Candy Morgen of Bayside, Queens.
