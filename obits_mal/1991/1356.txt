        Charles J. Amick, a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago, died Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 39 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Megan Beardsley, a spokeswoman for the university.
        A 1977 Ph.D. graduate of the University of Cambridge, Dr. Amick joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 1979, after postgraduate fellowships at St. Johns's College in Cambridge. He was named a professor in 1984.
        He was an expert in applied mathematics. His work centered on mathematical problems in fluid dynamics, particularly the behavior of waves in water.
        He is survived by his wife, Joanna Hawthorne; a daughter, Alexandra; a son, Charles; his parents Charles and Janet Amick of Grantham, N.H.; and two sisters, Joan Toomey of Carmel, Ind., and Carol Amick of Bedford, Mass.
