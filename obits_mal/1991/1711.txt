        Elias Friedensohn, a painter, watercolorist and sculptor and professor emeritus of art at Queens College, died on Monday at his home in Leonia, N.J. He was 67 years old.
        He died of cancer, said a spokesman for the college.
        Mr. Friedensohn's work was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Smithsonian Institution. His paintings are in the permanent collections of the Whitney, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the Los Angeles County Museum, among others.
        Symbols of human suffering were a frequent theme in his work. Writing in The New York Times about an exhibition of Mr. Friedensohn's paintings at Jersey City State College in 1982, Vivien Raynor said "his talent is for light, color and intimate scale."
        Mr. Friedensohn was born in New York City. He graduated from the High School of Music and Art, studied at Temple University in Philadelphia, graduated from Queens College, and did postgraduate work at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University. He joined the Queens College art department in 1959 and retired in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; a daughter, Shola; a son, Adam; a sister, Marsha Worby of Reno, Nev., and a granddaughter.
