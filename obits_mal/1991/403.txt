        Leonard Norman Backer, a textile engineer for almost 40 years, died yesterday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 65 years old and died of cancer, his wife, Sylvia, said.
        Mr. Backer, who graduated from Tufts University in 1951 with a degree in civil engineering, worked for the Fabric Research Laboratory in Dedham, Mass., and Burlington Industries in Manhattan before founding his own consulting firm, Tex-Tyle Associates Ltd., in the early 1970's. In 1981 he became marketing director for Automated Textile Systems in Charlotte, N.C. He was a registered professional engineer in Massachusetts and held several patents for textile machinery.
        Mr. Backer was an aerial gunner with the Army Air Forces during World War II.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Scott, of Potomac, Md.; a daughter, Carol Clemett of St. Louis, and two brothers, Morton and Stanley, both of Newton, Mass.
