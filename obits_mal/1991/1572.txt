        The Rev. Dr. Ralph N. Mould, a Presbyterian minister and peace advocate, died on Wednesday at Waveny Care Center in New Canaan, Conn. He was 83 years old and lived in New Caanan.
        Dr. Mould died of kidney failure, his sister, Jean Lillis, said.
        He began his career as a pastor in Loma, Colo., then moved to Pennsylvania, where he led a succession of churches, in Garland, Irwin, Erie and Germantown, where he was pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church.
        In 1946 he joined the board of Christian education of the Presbyterian Church as director of children's education. He remained with the board until 1965, when he was named secretary general of the World Council of Christian Education in Geneva.
        Dr. Mould negotiated the merger of the World Council of Christian Education with the World Council of Churches, where he continued to work until he retired in 1973.
        From 1976 on he was a member of board of the Coalition for Nuclear Arms Control. A conscientious objector during World War II, he was active in the cause of peace, disarmament and international understanding throughout his life.
        In 1980 he was awarded the Annual Peace Seeker Award by the Presbyterian Peace Fellowship.
        In addition to his sister, of Erie, Dr. Mould, a widower, is survived by a daughter, Sibyl Martin of Ithaca, N.Y.; a son, Christopher M. of Oak Park, Ill., and six grandchildren.
