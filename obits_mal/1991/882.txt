        Robert Schoelkopf, a dealer in 20th-century American art, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 63 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Chappaqua, N.Y.
        Mr. Schoelkopf died of leukemia, his wife, the former Jane Nease, said.
        In 1962 he founded the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery here and was its president until his death. The gallery specializes in contemporary figurative art and early-20th-century modernism. It represents the Lachaise Foundation, the estate of John Storrs, a sculptor, and the estate of Jan Matulka, a painter. Contemporary painters represented at the gallery include William Bailey, Leland Bell, Gabriel Laderman and Louisa Matthisdottir.
        He is survived by two sons, Robert 3d, of Pasadena, Calif., and Andrew, of Manhattan; and a sister, Bettina Collins, of Washington.
