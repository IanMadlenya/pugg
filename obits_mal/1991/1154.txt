        Dr. Joel C. Kleinman, an authority on the causes of infant mortality who was director for analysis at the National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., died on Thursday at Morgan County War Memorial Hospital in Berkeley Springs, W. Va. He was 44 years old and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        He died of complications from diabetes while on a business trip, said Sandra Smith, a spokeswoman for the United States Public Health Service, of which the center for health statistics is a part.
        Dr. Kleinman was prominent in the health service's campaign to make women aware of the danger that smoking by expectant mothers poses to infants. A mathematician by training, he became a specialist in biostatistics and wrote and lectured extensively on the subject.
        He was born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of City College of New York and held master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard, where he was an assistant professor of biostatistics before joining the Public Health service in 1975.
        Dr. Kleinman is survived by his wife, Dr. Hynda Fisher; two daughters, Dana and Ruth, both of Bethesda; his parents, Rose and George, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and a brother, Leonard, of Taunton, Mass.
