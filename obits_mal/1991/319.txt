        Joel R. Wells Jr., chairman of SunTrust Banks Inc., died of cancer Thursday at Emory University Hospital. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Wells was named president of SunTrust when the regional banking company was formed from a merger in 1985 of SunBanks Inc. of Orlando, Fla., where he was chief executive, and Trust Company of Georgia. He became board chairman in April 1990.
        In his tenure, SunBanks grew from an organization with $1.7 billion in assets into a significant part of SunTrust, the nation's 17th-largest bank holding company, with assets of $33.4 billion.
        Mr. Wells received law and business administration degrees at the University of Florida. He practiced law in Orlando before becoming a banker.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betty Stratton, of Leesburg, Fla.; a son, Joel R. Wells 4th of Atlanta, two daughters, Linda Bishop and Martha S. Hill of Orlando, and five grandchildren.
