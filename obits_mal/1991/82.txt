        Robert G. Levy, founder of the one of the nation's largest producers of tape-recorded books for blind people, died in Houston on Friday. He was 91 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        In 1967, Mr. Levy, who was then the owner of two Houston clothing stores, was reading for a blind student at the University of Houston when it occurred to him it might be possible to extend such a service nationally.
        The following year, he started Taping for the Blind, financing it with a personal, no-interest, $500 loan.
        In 1978 he received a Jefferson Award from the American Institute for Public Service, which said his organization was a prototype for the Talking Books program of the Library of Congress.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marian Stein; a daughter, a son and five grandsons.
