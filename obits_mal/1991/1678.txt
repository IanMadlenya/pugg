        The Rev. Carl J. Peter, a prominent theologian who for the last 27 years was professor of systematic theology at Catholic University in Washington, died suddenly Tuesday at his campus residence. He was 59 years old.
        A university spokesman said the cause of death was apparently a heart attack.
        Father Peter, a native of Omaha, was the author of more than 120 monographs, articles and books. He served the Holy See as an adviser on theological matters and since 1980 had been a member of the Pope's International Theological Commission.
        Bishops throughout the country as well as in Rome consulted Father Peter, whose field, systematic theology, comprises the study of the established tenets of the Roman Catholic Church. Among his many honors was the John Courtney Murray Award for distinction in theology, bestowed by the Catholic Theological Society in 1975.
        Educated at the North American College in Rome, Father Peter was ordained in 1957. He served as assistant vice rector at the Rome institution from 1960 to 1964, when he joined the faculty of Catholic University.
        Father Peter is survived by two brothers, Dr. James B. Peter of Los Angeles and the Rev. Valentine Peter, executive director of Father Flanagan's Boys' Home in Boys Town, Neb., and a sister, Mary Anne Hohman, the development officer at Georgetown University in Washington.
