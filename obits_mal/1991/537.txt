        Reinhard Bendix, a sociologist who was professor emeritus of political science at the University of California at Berkeley, died Thursday after a heart attack outside a classroom where he had given a seminar. He was 75 years old and lived in Berkeley.
        He was pronounced dead at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley, a spokesman for the university said.
        Dr. Bendix, a native of Berlin, was active in the anti-Fascist underground movement after Hitler came to power in 1933. He came to the United States as a political refugee in 1938 and, after receiving a doctoral degree from the University of Chicago, began teaching at Berkeley in 1947.
        He was president of the American Sociological Association in 1970 and vice president of the International Sociological Association from 1966 to 1970. His books included "Work and Authority," published in 1956; "Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait" (1960) and "From Berlin to Berkeley: "German-Jewish Identities" (1985), an account of his life and that of his father, Ludwig Bendix, a labor lawyer in the Weimar Republic.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jane Walstrum, a painter and author of children's books; a daughter, Karen Yano of Bethesda, Md.; two sons, Eric, of Asheville, N.C., and John, of Portland, Ore.; a sister, Dr. Dorothy Bendix of Philadelphia, and six grandchildren.
