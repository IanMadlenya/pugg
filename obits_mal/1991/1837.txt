        Donald J. Chipman, a New York businessman and investor, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, family members said.
        Mr. Chipman, who attended Columbia University, was a former taxi-fleet owner and a prominent member until the late 1970's of the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents New York City medallion-fleet owners. He served on its board of directors for 20 years and as chairman of its executive committee, working with the Police Department to set up a special taxicab squad and to develop procedures to reduce criminal acts against drivers.
        Mr. Chipman is survived by his wife, Jan; two daughters, Barbara and Irene, both of Manhattan; a son, Richard, also of Manhattan, and two sisters, Jeanette Weisenthal and Harriette Shapiro, both of Boca Raton, Fla.
