        Donald Lubin, a former deputy secretary general of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, died on Saturday at his home in Cliffside Park, N.J. He was 68 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Lubin worked for Planned Parenthood for 25 years, most of that time at its world headquarters in London.  After retiring, he returned to the United States two years ago.
        He held Planned Parenthood's No. 2 post for about eight years, serving as its chief administrator. Before joining Planned Parenthood, he was the national field director for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of America.
        Mr. Lubin was born in Orange, N.J., and was a graduate of George Washington University.
        He is survived by his wife, Gloria; three sons, Andrew, of Trumbull, Conn., Peter, of Austin, Tex., and David, of London, and two grandchildren.
