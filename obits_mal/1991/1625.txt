        Michael F. Dillon, the Presiding Justice of the State Appellate Division in Rochester, suffered a fatal heart attack Tuesday night while speaking at a farewell dinner for a Cuomo administration official. He was 64 years old and lived in Lackawanna, N.Y.
        Justice Dillon was speaking at a dinner for John J. Poklemba, the outgoing Commissioner of the Division of Criminal Justice Services. The judge was taken to Albany Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
        He was appointed an associate justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975 and became a Presiding Justice four years later.
        From 1963 to 1973, he was District Attorney of Erie County and gained a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of even petty crime. Among the cases he reported investigating was a school for welfare chiselers in Buffalo that he said charged $5 a class and accepted only young pregnant students.
        In another case, when the high school in Lackawanna noticed constant shortages of food, he had a hidden camera installed and uncovered large-scale theft by employees.
        Gov. Mario M. Cuomo recently appointed Justice Dillon's son Kevin the Erie County District Attorney.
        Justice Dillon is survived by his wife, Elaine; five sons, Kevin, Patrick, Michael Jr., John and David, and three daughters, Doreen, Moira and Jennifer.
