        James Henry Hawkins Sr., a grocer in the Watts section of Los Angeles who was widely praised for standing up to local gangs and drug dealers, died Thursday of prostate cancer. He was 80 years old.
        For years, gang members threatened to chase Mr. Hawkins, who owned the Slater Market, and his family out of the neighborhood, said his son, Elton Hawkins.
        They firebombed the Hawkins home, fired up to 40 bullets into the house and once tried to ram it with a car. Seventeen gang members were convicted of crimes against the Hawkins family.
        Once, in his 70's, Mr. Hawkins kept assailants from beating a woman.
        He is survived by his wife, 13 children, 75 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.
