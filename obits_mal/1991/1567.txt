        Robert M. Bock, a molecular biologist and a former graduate school dean at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, died Tuesday at University Hospital and Clinics in Madison. He was 67 years old and lived in Madison.
        Mr. Bock died of injuries suffered Sunday after falling in a pond while clearing weeds at his property in rural Wisconsin, a spokesman for the family said.
        While he was dean of the graduate school from 1967 to 1989 the university's research programs grew to nearly a $300-million-a-year enterprise.
        As a scientist he conducted basic studies that helped to decipher the genetic code and was the first to crystallize tRNA, a keystone molecule in the process of protein synthesis. He retired in 1989.
        He was born in Preston, Minn., and served in the Army in World War II. After the war he was warden of the War Crimes Interrogation Center and the Nuremberg Trials.
        He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1949 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He became an assistant professor in the university's department of biochemistry and received a doctorate in physical chemistry in 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Golbien; two daughters, Karen Sue Irwin and Susan Celeste Anderson, both of Verona, Wis.; a sister, Virginia Collette of Lavonia, Mich., and two grandsons.
