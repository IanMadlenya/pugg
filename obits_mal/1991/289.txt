        George A. Follini, a contractor whose companies did road construction in New York City, died on Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 80 years old.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, his daughter Nancy said.
        Mr. Follini helped start the Edenwald Contracting Company in 1944, and the Metropolitan Asphalt Company of Whitestone, Queens, in 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nilda Baldante; three daughters, Barbara Colombo of White Plains, Judy Paletta of Bedford, N.Y., and Nancy Follini of Stonington, Conn., and seven grandchildren.
