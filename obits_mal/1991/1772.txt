        Joe Bowen, who supervised the buying, screening and editing of theatrical feature films for CBS Entertainment, died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 56 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said a CBS spokeswoman, Liza Rindge.
        Mr. Bowen's career with CBS started in New York City at WCBS-TV, where he began work as a program assistant in 1960. He was promoted to film-continuity editor and then held a variety of positions with the network, including supervisor of feature-film productions, program executive for late-night movies and associate director of prime-time features.
        In 1979, he moved to Los Angeles where he became director of feature films and late-night program director.
        His longtime companion was Patricia Walker. He is survived by his son, Scott, of New York City.
