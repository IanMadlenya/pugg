        William (Billy) Butler, a jazz guitarist who co-wrote the rhythm-and-blues instrumental classic "Honky Tonk," died on Wednesday at his home in Teaneck, N.J. He was 66 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his son, Littleton B. Gamby, said.
        Mr. Butler wrote "Honky Tonk" in 1956 with Clifford Scott while they were members of Bill Doggett's band. He recorded with Dizzy Gillespie, Eddie (Lockjaw) Davis, William (Wild Bill) Davison, Houston Person and Dinah Washington.
        As a band leader in the late 1960's, Mr. Butler made five albums for Prestige Records. More recently, he worked in the pit for Broadway musicals.
        Mr. Butler's wife of 29 years, Marion Wise Butler, died last June.
        Surviving, in addition to his son, are two sisters, Carrie Black and Cora Reed, both of Philadelphia.
