        William Benjamin Heller, an architect, philanthropist and member of the Lindsay administration, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 75 years old and a lifetime New Yorker, with residences in Manhattan and Bedford, N.Y.
        His death was apparently caused by a heart attack, the family said.
        As a partner of the architectural firm of Carson Lundin & Shaw, he worked on the design or interiors of a number of prominent buildings in the city, among them the original Citibank building on Park Avenue, the CBS building on the Avenue of the Americas and the Paramount building at Columbus Circle.
        He served under Mayor John V. Lindsay beginning in 1968, first as Assistant Commissioner of Commerce and Industry, then Assistant Administrator for Economic Development. He left city government in 1974.
        At his death he was a member of various boards, including the board of managers of the New York Botanical Garden, the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services and the Ramapo Anchorage Camp for emotionally disturbed children in Rhinbeck, N.Y.
        He had also served as president of the Nightingale-Bamford School, Bennett College, the New York Thoroughbred Breeders Association and the Eastern Breeders Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne C., a son, James A., and a daughter, Susan K., all of Manhattan; a sister, Kathryn Speert of Keene, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
