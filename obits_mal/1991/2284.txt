        Samuel H. Dawson, a prominent criminal defense lawyer in New York City, died Monday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 49 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Dawson was a founder and treasurer of the New York Council of Defense Lawyers and had been chairman of the City Bar Association's Criminal Advocacy Committee.
        He was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Brooklyn College and St. John's Law School. He began working for the Legal Aid Society in 1965 and eventually served on its board of directors. In 1974 he was appointed an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District and two years later was promoted to chief of special prosecutions and official corruption cases.
        In 1978 he helped found a Manhattan law firm now known as Gallop, Dawson, Clayman & Rosenberg. Among his clients were Jacinto Vasquez, a top-ranked jockey who was suspended as a result of an investigation into race-fixing charges, and John Buettner-Janusch, who was convicted of sending poisoned candy to a Federal judge who had sentenced him in a prior case. In 1980, Mr. Dawson won a change of venue for a sewer contractor by using an opinion poll that showed he could not get a fair trial in Suffolk County.
        He is survived by his wife, Joy, and their sons, Keith, of Brooklyn and Richard, of Manhattan.
