        Richard Mardus, a public relations specialist and a founder of the American Publicists Guild, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Richmond, S.I. He was 87 years old and had moved to Staten Island in December after living in Manhattan for more than 40 years.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his niece, Alice Wolfson, said.
        Mr. Mardus received his early education in Mexico and Germany and later attended Columbia University. He was self-employed as a press agent and published a show business newspaper for many years.
        He is survived by a brother, Frederick, of Guadalajara, Mexico, and two sisters, Clorinda McAteer of Staten Island and Alice Mathews of Los Angeles.
