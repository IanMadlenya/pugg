        Sidney Silverman, the founding president of one of New Jersey's largest community colleges, died on Tuesday at Englewood Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Hackensack, N.J.
        He died of complications resulting from a kidney disease, his so, Michael, said.
        In 1967, Dr. Silverman became the first president of the then newly created Bergen Community College in Paramus, N.J. He oversaw the college's opening in makeshift operations, its move to a new, six-block multilevel structure on the site of the former Orchard Hills Country Club. The college now has 12,000 students, double the number in 1975. When Dr. Silverman retired he was designated president emeritus.
        During his retirement, the New Jersey Department of Higher Education asked Dr. Silverman to serve as interim president of Ramapo College, in Mahwah, N.J., which he did, for 18 months, ending in June 1985.
        Dr. Silverman created the Bergen Community College Foundation and was first chairman of the Israel Cancer Research Fund.
        Before he went to Bergen Community College, Dr. Silverman had been dean of administration at Bronx Community College. There, he helped found a pre-college enrichment program and the college's nursing school. Earlier, he had been a teacher and principal of the Taft Youth and Adult Community Center in the Bronx.
        In addition to his son, Michael, of Hackensack, Dr. Silverman is survived by his wife, Esther; another son, Richard, of Philadelphia, and a sister, Frances Riveira of Hollywood, Fla.
