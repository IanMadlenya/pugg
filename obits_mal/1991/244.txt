Subsequently he played opposite Ingrid Bergman in "Joan of Lorraine" and was in several productions with Helen Hayes.

        In Hollywood, Mr. Kroeger, an actor with an imposing presence, often portrayed villains. His movies include "The Iron Curtain," "The Dark Past," "Act of Violence," "Down to the Sea in Ships," "Chicago Deadline," " Gun Crazy," "The Sword of Monte Cristo," "Blood Alley," "The Mephisto Waltz" and "Atlantis, the Lost Continent."
