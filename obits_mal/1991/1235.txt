        Mortimer H. Dubovsky, a doctor who specialized in the care of the mentally retarded, died on Tuesday at his home in Queens. He was 77 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        At his death, he was medical director of the Association for Children with Retarded Mental Development in Manhattan.
        In 1950, Dr. Dubovsky helped found the mental retardation clinic at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in Manhattan, one of the first clinics in the country devoted to the care, treatment and rehabilitation of the mentally retarded and their families. He was a professor of pediatrics at New York Medical College and president of the division of medicine of the American Association on Mental Retardation.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gladys Levy; two sons, Dr. Steven Dubovsky of Boulder, Colo., and Daniel, of Philadelphia; a brother, Dr. Herbert Dubow of Westport, Conn.; a sister, Doris Stowens of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
