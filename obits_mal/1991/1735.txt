        He also had major residential projects in Florida, including the Roney Plaza Hotel in Miami Beach, as well as developments in Delaware, Ohio and New Jersey. He was active in philanthropic causes, including the Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia, Weitzmann Institute and Ben Gurion University in Israel.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; three sons, William of Wynnewood, Pa., Leonard of Bal Harbor, Fla., and Benjamin of Jupiter, Fla.; nine grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
