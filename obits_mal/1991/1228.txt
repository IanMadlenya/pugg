        Frank B. Sawdon, an advertising executive, died on Tuesday at the Villa Pomerado Convalescent Hospital in San Diego. He was 87 years old and lived in San Diego.
        He died of complications of diabetes, a family spokeswoman said.

He was a vice president of the company, which in the mid-1950's had more than 200 outlets. He started Frank B. Sawdon, Inc., an advertising agency in Manhattan, in the late 1950's, and retired in 1975.
        He is survived by two daughters, Lynne Candotti Russo of Westhampton Beach, L.I., and Francine Cook of Westport, Conn.; a son, Stuart, of Poway, Calif.; a brother, Richard, of Hilton Head, S.C.; and nine grandchildren.
