        Dr. Frederick L. Hipp, executive director of the New Jersey Education Association for 32 years, died on Sept. 17 at his home in Lawrenceville, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        He joined the education association in 1942 and was named executive director four years later. During his career, he worked with seven New Jersey governors and saw the state's financial commitment to public education rise from $4 million to $1.3 billion.
        In his tenure with the association, its membership grew from 27,000 to 110,000 members. In 1976, in a New York Times article about "the 15 most powerful people in New Jersey," which cited him as one, he was described as having moved the group "from a nice association of schoolteachers to a tough union of 78,000 members who usually get what they want in Trenton and most other places."
        Dr. Hipp, who was born in Ohio, graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio with a degree in education. He earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Syracuse University.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Glosick Hipp; a son, Frederick Jr., of Fanwood, N.J.; a daughter, Linda Thomson of Bethlehem, Pa.; a sister, Kathryn McLain of Wauseon, Ohio, and four grandchildren.
