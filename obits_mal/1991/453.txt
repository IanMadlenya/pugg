        Walter Klien, a pianist known for his interpretations of Mozart, Brahms and Schubert, died on Saturday in Vienna. He was 63 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his manager, Mariedi Anders of San Francisco.
        He had an international performing career spanning five decades. He performed solo recitals, chamber music and concertos with major orchestras, among them the Vienna Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic, the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, the Cleveland Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, under the batons of Herbert von Karajan, Eugene Ormandy, Erich Leinsdorf and others.
        He frequently performed as a soloist at many summer festivals, including the Salzburg Festival and the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center.
        Mr. Klien, who was born in Graz, Austria, studied with Joseph Dichler at the Vienna Academy of Music, and later with the pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli and the composer Paul Hindemith.
        At an early age, he won prizes in a number of important competitions, including the Busoni Competition in Bolzano, Italy, and the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competiton in Paris.
        In 1953, he won the Bosendorfer Prize in Vienna and was honored with the 1987 Joseph Marx Music Prize, named for the late 19th- and early 20th-century Austrian composer, and the honorary gold medal of Vienna in 1989.
        He is survived by his wife, Chizuko, of Vienna.
