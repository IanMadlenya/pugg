        Arthur J. Quinn, former chief executive officer, president and chairman of the New York Bank for Savings, died on Saturday at his home in Southold, L.I. He was 77 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a heart attack, said his son Kieran P. Quinn of Atlanta.
        Mr. Quinn worked for the New York Bank for Savings from 1943 to his retirement in 1982, the year the bank merged with the Goldome Bank for Savings. During his years as a banker he also held appointive positions in the public sector. In 1975, he represented Perry B. Duryea, then the New York State Assembly minority leader, on the New York City Municipal Assistance Corporation. And when Arthur Levitt was State Comptroller he named Mr. Quinn to serve on the state's Real Estate Investment Advisory Committee.
        From 1973 to 1989, Mr. Quinn was a trustee of St. John's University. He received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York in 1934 and his law degree from Fordham Law School in 1938. During World War II he served as a lieutenant in the Navy.
        In addition to Kieran, Mr. Quinn is survived by his wife of 51 years, Greta Butler Quinn; his son, Kevin A., of Westport, Conn.; his daughters, Kathleen Q. Murray of New York City, and Kerry Q. Stumpf of Phoenix, Ariz., and eight grandchildren.
