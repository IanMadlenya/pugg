        Warren E. Hyde, retired president of Warren Hyde Associates in Manhattan, a consulting firm in health and social services, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, his wife, the former Virginia Parrott, said.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Phillip W., of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Duane, of King City, Calif., and two sisters, Phyllis Grove of Richmond and Thelma Klingensmith of Mandan, N.D.
        Correction:  January 9, 1991, Wednesday
        An obituary yesterday about a consultant specializing in health and social services rendered his first name and that of his firm incorrectly. He was Laurin E. Hyde, not Warren, and his firm was Laurin Hyde Associates.
