        John P. Spiegel, an expert on combat fatigue and urban violence, died on Wednesday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 80 years old.
        His family declined to give the cause of death.
        From 1966 until retiring in 1979, Dr. Spiegel was a professor of social psychiatry and director of the Lemberg Center for the Study of Violence at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.
        Dr. Spiegel gained national attention in 1945 with the publication of "Men Under Stress," written with Dr. Roy Grinker. The book, based on their experiences as medical officers in World War II, said that under stress, anyone could fail to carry out a military assignment. That opinion challenged the view that combat fatigue and other war-related symptoms could be ascribed to character faults.
        At Brandeis, he published a study in 1967 showing that urban riots resulted from the buildup of frustrations that could be touched off by ordinary events.
        After in World War II service in the Army Air Force Medical Corps, he taught at the University of Chicago and Harvard University and held clinical positions at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago and Children's Hospital Medical Center in Boston.
        Dr. Spiegel, a native of Chicago, graduated from Dartmouth College and received a medical degree from Northwestern University. He was a former president of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Psychoanalysis.
        His wife, the former Babette Shiller, died in 1975. He is survived by a son, Adam, of Baltimore; three daughters, Heli Meltsner of Cambridge, Mamie, of Lake Hill, N.Y., and Polly, of Clayton, Mo., and eight grandchildren.
