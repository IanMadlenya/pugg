        Benjamin J. Wolf, a labor-management mediator and arbitrator, died on Friday in an automobile accident outside his home in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 82 years old.
        He served for many years with the New York State Board of Mediation and the New York State Labor Relations Board. He was instrumental in writing the Taylor Law, intended to prevent work stoppages by public employees, and helped to settle disputes between management and labor in several industries.
        He was born in Brooklyn and received bachelor's and law degrees from Cornell University.
        Mr. Wolf's wife, the former Paula Davis, died in 1987 after 53 years of marriage.
        He is survived by two daughters, Vicki Cobb, a children's book author, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Eleanor Zabb of New Rochelle, N.Y.; two brothers, Gilbert and Oscar, both of New Jersey; four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.

        An obituary yesterday about a labor-management mediator rendered part of his name incorrectly. He was Benjamin H. Wolf.
