        The Rev C. B. Gladwin Fraser, pastor of the Union Congregational Church for 31 years and a civic leader in Harlem, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 73 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Fraser was born in Guyana and was a graduate of the University of London. He came to the United States in 1959 and became pastor at Union Congregational in 1960. He also served as chaplain of the Harlem Hospital Center and of the Manhattan Rehabilitation Center for Women.
        He was a past president of the Harlem Interfaith Housing Council and was an official of the Council of Churches of New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Enid Skeete; a sister, Doris, and a brother, Llewellyn, both of Guyana.
