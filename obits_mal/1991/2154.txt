        Gaston Monnerville, President of the French Senate from 1948 to 1968 and a political foe of Charles de Gaulle, died Thursday at his Paris home. He was 94 years old.
        His death, after a lengthy illness, was announced today in the National Assembly. Prime Minister Edith Cresson praised Mr. Monnerville today as a "man of courage, a humanist and a Resistance member."
        Mr. Monnerville strongly but unsuccessfully opposed the referendum held in 1962, at de Gaulle's urging, that approved a constitutional amendment establishing direct, popular election of France's President.
        Mr. Monnerville even challenged the referendum, which he believed eroded the powers of France's parliament, in the courts. But the referendum was upheld, and although he was No. 2 in the line of succession to the French presidency, Mr. Monnerville and de Gaulle rarely spoke thereafter.
        In 1968, Mr. Monnerville refused to seek re-election as President of the Senate to protest de Gaulle's plans to transform further the upper chamber of the French parliament into a simple economic and planning council.
        Born in French Guiana in 1897, the son of a colonial administrator, Mr. Monnerville worked as a lawyer in Paris during the 1920's. He was elected to Parliament in 1932 and served as Undersecretary of State for Colonial Affairs in 1937-38.
        During World War II he served in the Resistance. In 1947, as a member of the centrist Radical Party, he was elected President of what was called the Council of the Republic under the Fourth Republic and became the Senate in 1959 under the Fifth Republic.
        Retired from public life since 1983, Mr. Monnerville was honorary president of a nationwide human rights group, the League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism.
