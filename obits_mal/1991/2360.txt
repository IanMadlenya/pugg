        Moshe Castel, an Israeli artist who made contemporary imagery from ancient Jewish and Arabic letters and archeological artifacts of the Middle East, died on Thursday in Tel Aviv. He was 82 years old and also maintained studios in Paris and New York.
        The cause of his death was not released.
        Born in Jerusalem in 1909, to a Jewish family of Spanish descent that had lived in Palestine since 1492, Mr. Castel studied art in Israel and Paris. His early work reflected the School of Paris influence. Fleeing Paris at the outbreak of World War II, he settled in Safed, an artists' community in what was then Palestine. He helped to found the New Horizons group, which had an important impact on the modernization of Israeli art.
        From the 1950's on, he produced relief paintings, inspired by what he called "ancient predecessors of the Hebrew civilization." A visit to the ruins of an ancient synagogue in Galilee, consisting of basalt blocks into which images and ornaments were cut, led him to use ground basalt, molded into shapes, as his basic material. He embellished the basalt with archaic forms, derived from ancient script, symbolism and mythological signs from Hebrew and Sumerian culture.
        Mr. Castel carried out two major commissions for the Israeli Government, massive reliefs inspired by Assyrian motifs, for the Israeli parliament building and the residence of the President of Israel.
        He is survived by his wife, Bella.
