        Inonga Lokonga l'Ome, the Foreign Minster of Zaire, died in a Johannesburg hospital last Thursday after suffering a stroke in Kinshasa, the Zairian capital, a South African Government spokesman said. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Inonga, a lawyer, served as Ambassador to Morocco and Belgium and delegate to the United Nations in a government career that began in 1965. He was first appointed Foreign Minister in 1972, and was named to the post again this spring.
        Survivors include his wife and a son.
