        Karl-Heinz Kopcke, who brought the main evening television news into the living rooms of millions of Germans for more than 28 years, died on Saturday. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Kopcke died of cancer at his home in Hamburg, the ARD television network said today.
        He began in broadcasting with Radio Bremen, immediately after being released as a prisoner of war in 1946. On March 2, 1959, he started as ARD's national news anchor, and he kept the job until retiring on Sept. 10, 1987.
        During nearly three decades of delivering the nightly 8 P.M. news, Mr. Kopcke became known for his calm, in-depth reporting. That marked a clean break with the World War II era, when German radio news was barked out in the tones of an angry field marshal.
