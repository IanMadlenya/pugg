        James S. Abrams Jr., a co-founder of a New Jersey natural gas utility and an investment banker, died on Thursday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Abrams, a resident of South Salem, N.Y., and Ocean Ridge, Fla., died of complications from surgery and a coma, his family said.
        Born in Chester, Pa., he moved with his family to Staten Island and after high school began working in the securities industry on Wall Street.
        For 51 years he was at Allen & Company, an investment banking firm in Manhattan, where he rose to vice president. In 1952 he co-founded the New Jersey Natural Gas Company and was chairman of its successor, the New Jersey Resources Corporation, until retiring in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Marguerite; their son, James 3d, of Woodstock Vt.; a brother, Robert, of Atlantic Highlands, N.J., and five grandchildren.
