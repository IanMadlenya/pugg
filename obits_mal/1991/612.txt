        Arnold S. Anderson, executive vice president and general counsel of the Woolworth Corporation, died yesterday at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 56 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Anderson, a native New Yorker and a graduate of City College and the Columbia Law School, was with the Manhattan law firm of Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts before he joined Woolworth in 1979 as vice president and general counsel. He became executive vice president for administration as well as general counsel in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Sapkowitz; a son, Dr. David J. Anderson of East Setauket, L.I., and a daughter, Randi, of Manhattan.
