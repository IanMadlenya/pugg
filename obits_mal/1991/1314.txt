        Philip Rastelli, a reputed head of the Bonanno organized-crime family, died on Monday at Booth Memorial Hospital in Queens. He was 73 years old and lived in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.
        He died of liver cancer, his lawyer, Stanley Teitler, said.
        Mr. Rastelli had been released from Federal prison in Springfield, Mo., on June 4. He had begun a 12-year sentence in January 1987 after his conviction on charges of directing a huge labor racketeering conspiracy from 1964 to 1985.
        He had recently undergone surgery at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield and was ordered released by Judge Charles P. Sifton of Federal District Court -- the judge who had sentenced him -- because he was believed to be dying, his lawyer said.
        Mr. Rastelli, who listed his occupation as a radio dispatcher for a taxi company, took over the reins of the Bonanno family in the early 1970's after its founder, Joseph Bonanno, went into retirement in Arizona. Mr. Rastelli was later convicted of antitrust violations and sentenced to a 10-year prison term. He directed the operations of the family from prison, but its influence waned.
        Mr. Rastelli's wife, Connie, was believed to have been killed in 1962 after she became a Federal informer. Mrs. Rastelli, who had been angered over her husband's suspected infidelities, began telling Federal investigators about the family's criminal activities. Her body was never found, Mr. Rastelli's lawyer said.
        Mr. Rastelli is survived by three brothers, Carmine, of Queens, who was convicted with his brother in the conspiracy case and who is in a Federal prison in Allenwood, Pa.; Marinello, of Queens, and Augustus, who lives in Florida, and two sisters, Justina Devita and Grace Iacomini, both of Queens.
