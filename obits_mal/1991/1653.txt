        Allen Barnett, an author and AIDS educator, died on Wednesday at his home in New York City. He was 36 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said a spokesman for St. Martin's Press, his publisher.
        Mr. Barnett was the author of "The Body and Its Dangers" (1990), a collection of stories in which many of the characters are afflicted with AIDS. The book was a winner of the PEN/ Ernest Hemingway Citation. Mr. Barnett worked for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, helped to establish the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, and taught AIDS education to students of English as a second language at the 23d Street Y.M.C.A.
        He is survived by his mother, Margaret Barnett of Joliet, Ill.; four sisters, Debby, Cindy, Donna and Rhonda, and two brothers, Dale and Ricky.
