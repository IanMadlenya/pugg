        Dr. David Shemin, a noted biochemist who was a retired Northwestern University professor, died Tuesday at his home in Woods Hole, Mass. He was 80 years old.
        He died of colon cancer, said a friend and co-worker, Dr. Irving London.
        A former student and co-worker of Dr. Shemin's, Dr. Jonathan Wittenberg of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said research that Dr. Shemin had carried out in the 1940's at Columbia University had greatly expanded scientists' knowledge of how some important large molecules, present in blood and elsewhere, are formed in the human body.
        A crucial part of that research was set out in a 1948 paper by Dr. Shemin, Dr. London and Dr. David Rittenberg, describing experiments that had yielded important information on how the body makes hemoglobin, the essential red constituent in the blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body.
        Dr. Shemin earned his doctorate from Columbia and was on its faculty from 1944 to 1968. He was a professor at Northwestern from 1968 until his retirement in 1981 and had been chairman of the university's department of biochemistry and molecular biology and deputy director for basic sciences of the university's cancer center.
        He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and was a Guggenheim Fellow.
        His first wife, the former Mildred B. Sumpter, died in 1962 after 25 years of marriage. He is survived by his second wife, the former Charlotte Norton, whom he married in 1963; a brother, Jacob of Baldwin, L.I.; two daughters from his first marriage, Louise Homberger of Glencoe, Ill., and Elizabeth Shemin-Garneau of Roxbury, Mass., and five grandchildren.
