        Junius Jay Bleiman, a former Mayor of Princeton Township, N.J., and an administrator at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, died on Thursday. He was 68 years old and lived in Princeton Township.
        Mr. Bleiman (pronounced BLY-man) died of cancer, said a university spokesman, Justin Harmon.
        A graduate of the United States Military Academy and an Army officer for 21 years, Mr. Bleiman joined the Woodrow Wilson School as a professor in 1968. In 1978, he became an assistant dean for graduate placement, nondegree programs and alumni services.
        He was elected to the Princeton Township Committee in 1970. In that post, he helped bring a majority of Democrats to the committee for the first time. The Committee elected him Mayor in 1973, and he was re-elected in 1974 to a second three-year term.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Yvonne Nelson, and a daughter, Rebecca, of New York City.
