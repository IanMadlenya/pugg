        Frank Valentino, a leading baritone with the Metropolitan Opera for more than 20 years, died on Friday in Fairfax, Va. He was 84 years old.
        He died of renal failure, a family spokesman said.
        From the time of his Metropolitan Opera debut as Lord Ashton in "Lucia di Lammermoor" in 1940, Mr. Valentino appeared in almost 300 of the company's productions in New York and on tour. He sang such major roles as Figaro in "The Barber of Seville," Count di Luna in "Il Trovatore," Rodolfo in "La Boheme" and the title role in "Rigoletto." Studied in Italy
        Mr. Valentino, whose real name was Francis Valentine Dinhaupt, was born in New York City. His family moved to Denver when he was 11, and it was there that he began studying music. In 1926 he went to Italy and, a year later, made his operatic debut in Parma under the name Francesco Valentino, in the role of Germont in "La Traviata." Throughout the 1930's he sang at the major European opera theaters, including La Scala in Rome and Glyndebourne in England.
        Upon returning to the United States in 1940, Mr. Valentino began singing with the Metropolitan Opera, where he appeared in 26 different roles during the next 21 seasons, never missing a scheduled performance. He also sang with the San Francisco Opera, the Central City (Colo.) Opera and in concerts with orchestras, among them Toscanini's. After his retirement from singing in 1962, Mr. Valentino joined the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, where he taught for 15 years.
        He is survived by two daughters, Marion Newman of Hermitage, Tenn., and Judith Sardella of Fairfax; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
