        Lawrence W. Hill, a music-theater director and conductor, died last Friday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was bacterial pneumonia, said his former wife, Meredyth Rawlins.
        Mr. Hill was the music director and conductor for many New York shows, including the Triangle Theater Company's 1990 production of "Two by Two" and the York Theater Company's stagings of "On the Twentieth Century" (1985) and "Lost in the Stars" (1988).
        Mr. Hill was born in Seymour, Ind., and received a bachelor's and a master's degree in music from Indiana University in Bloomington. In addition to his theater work, he taught voice at the HB Studios in New York, and was the pianist for a number of music-theater concerts. At the time of his death, he was the organist and choir director of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Glen Cove, L.I.
        He is survived by a half-sister, Barbara Baturka of Villanova, Pa.
