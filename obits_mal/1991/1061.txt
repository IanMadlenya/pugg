        Robert John Landry, who worked for the trade paper Variety for more than 50 years as a reporter, reviewer, office manager and managing editor, died Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, said his nephew, Syd Silverman, the chairman of Variety.
        Mr. Landry managed Variety's Chicago and Hollywood offices and was the paper's first radio editor.
        From 1942 to 1948 he was the director of program writing at CBS, where he won a Peabody Award for a 90-minute version of "Richard III" with Laurence Olivier.
        He returned to Variety and was managing editor from 1952 to 1983.
        He wrote two books, "Who, What, Why Is Radio?" (1942) and "This Fascinating Radio Business" (1946).
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Monro.
