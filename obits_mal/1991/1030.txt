        Harold O. Toor, former chairman of the United States Shoe Corporation, died on Sunday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Toor was also a director of the Cincinnati-based shoe company. He retired from the company in January, after spending his entire career in the shoe business.
        In 1934 he founded the H. O. Toor Company, a shoe manufacturer in Chicago. In 1963 he acquired the Freeman Company of Beloit Wis., a leading manufacturer of men's footwear. The Freeman-Toor Corporation grew to have 11 factories in four states and 270 retail outlets and, in 1966, merged with United States Shoe. Mr. Toor was elected chairman and chief executive officer of the newly formed company. He was chairman for two years and a director for 25 years.
        Mr. Toor, a native of Rensselaer, N.Y., was a past president of the American Footwear Industry Association. During World War II he served on the War Production Board and the War Manpower Committee.
        Mr. Toor was also a member of the Shoe Manufacturing Advisory Committee of the United States Department of Commerce. He was a delegate to the International Labor Organization in Geneva and a member of the first American trade mission to the Soviet Union to discuss a potential bilateral trade agreement.
        Mr. Toor was also active in charitable affairs. He provided financing for an endowment in law and government at Brandeis College; established a research fund at the Mayo Clinic and a nursing scholarship fund at Beth Israel Hospital, and was a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ethel Trost; two daughters from a former marriage, Suzanne Karpas of Manhattan and Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Joanne Cummings of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
