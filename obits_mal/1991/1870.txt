        Marvin Oliv, co-founder and retired publisher of Recycling Today, died Monday at the Cherry Nursing Home in Montclair, N.J. He was 76 years old.
        His family said he died after a long illness.
        Mr. Oliv, a graduate of Paterson State Teachers College who was a major in the Army Air Forces in World War II, became interested in recycling in the 1950's.
        In 1967 he helped found Recycling Today, a monthly magazine covering solid-waste management for government agencies and the scrap-metal market. He was its publisher from 1967 until his retirement in 1987.
        Mr. Oliv, who lived in Cedar Grove, N.J., is survived by his wife, Lucienne; a son, Robert Olive of Manhattan, and a sister, Ruth Rosenblatt of Montclair.
