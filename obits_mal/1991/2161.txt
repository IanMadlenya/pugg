        Rufus Z. Smith, a retired American diplomat, died Thursday at his home in Annandale, Va. He was 69 years old and died of heart failure, his family said.
        He was in the United States foreign service from 1946 to 1974, retiring as a deputy assistant Secretary of State. He had postings to Canada, Panama, Thailand and the Netherlands and he served in Washington as the State Department's officer in charge of Burmese and Malaysian affairs and as director of Canadian affairs. He was a founder of the Foreign Service Grievance Board for staff members' complaints and of the Association of Canadian Studies in the United States.
        From 1974 to 1983, he headed the Meridian House International's program to help foreign visitors meet Americans in the same occupations.
        He was born in Toledo, Ill., graduated from Illinois College and served as a first lieutenant in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy, two sons, Matthew B. and Timothy R., both of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
