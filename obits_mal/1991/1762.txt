        Edward T. McCormick, a former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission and former president of the American Stock Exchange, died on Monday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Green Valley, Ariz.
        He died of a heart attack while attending a family reunion in Ridgefield, Conn., his son, Edward Jr., said.
        Mr. McCormick, who was a certified public accountant and received a Ph.D. from Duke University, was a securities analyst, chief accountant and assistant director at the S.E.C. from 1934 to 1949 and served as a commissioner from 1949 to 1951.
        He was then named president of the New York Curb Exchange, presided over its change of name to the American Stock Exchange and left in 1961 in the midst of a furor over administrative lapses. He became president of the National Stock Exchange in 1965 and retired in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Ione Reese; two sons, Edward Jr., of Ridgefield, and Michael, of Salt Lake City; a brother, J. B. McCormick of Phoenix; a sister, Isabelle McCormick of Petaluma, Calif., and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  August 9, 1991, Friday
        An obituary on Wednesday about Edward T. McCormick, a former president of the American Stock Exchange, misidentifed his sister. She is Isabel Wadsworth. It also misstated the length of his marriage, to the former Ione Reese, who survives him. They were married for 57 years.
