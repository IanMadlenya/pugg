        Thomas F. Fennell 2d, a retired lawyer who was an expert in labor arbitration, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died of cardiac arrest, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Fennell joined the Manhattan firm of Shearman & Sterling in 1943, and had been of counsel to it since 1987. He was an innovator in arbitration and represented several private bus companies in New York City.
        From 1972 to 1988, he handled arbitration involving the Algerian National Oil Company and the construction of a pipeline by a consortium of French and Italian companies.
        A 1929 graduate of Cornell University Law School, Mr. Fennell was named to Cornell's Athletic Hall of Fame two years ago for his national renown as an end on its football team in 1925 and his three years as university heavyweight boxing champion.
        He is survived by five sons, Thomas 3d, Rupert and Philip, all of Manhattan, Daniel, of Philadelphia, and John of Tucson, Ariz., and eight grandchildren.
