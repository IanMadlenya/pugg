        Richard Wilson, a director, producer, writer, actor and longtime associate of Orson Welles, died Wednesday at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 75 years old.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said Myron S. Meisel, one of his co-producers.
        Mr. Wilson joined Welles and John Houseman at the founding of the Mercury Theater in the 1930's, working as a stage manager and an actor for such productions as "Julius Caesar," "The Cradle Will Rock," "Native Son" and "Heartbreak House," as well as for "Mercury Theater of the Air" on radio, including the legendary broadcast of "The War of the Worlds."
        Mr. Wilson worked in several capacities on such Welles film classics as "Citizen Kane" (1941), "The Magnificent Ambersons" (1942) "Journey Into Fear" (1942) "The Lady From Shanghai" (1948) and "Macbeth" (1950 and 1980).
        In 1946 he co-produced Welles's production of the Cole Porter musical based on Jules Verne's "Around the World in 80 Days." When Welles went to work abroad, Mr. Wilson became a staff producer at Universal, working on the Ma and Pa Kettle series.
        He also directed films of his own, including "Al Capone," starring Rod Steiger (1959), "Pay or Die" (1960), "Invitation to a Gunfighter" (1964) and "Three in the Attic" (1968).
        At his death he was producing a feature film based on his experiences with Welles during the 1942 production of the unfinished film project "It's All True." The Wilson feature, to be completed by his partners and collaborators, is to include a reconstruction of a Brazilian sequence from that project.
        Surviving are his wife, Betty; a brother, John D., of Bronxville, N.Y.; a sister, Gail Wilson Shay of Phoenix; a son, Christopher, of San Francisco, and four grandchildren.
