        The Rev. Robert Elwin Terwilliger, the retired Suffragan Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Dallas, died Monday at a nursing home in Hurst, Tex. He was 73 years old and lived in Dallas.
        He died of a stroke, said a spokeswoman for the family.
        Bishop Terwilliger was suffragan, or assistant bishop, of Dallas from 1976 until his retirement in 1986. Before that he served nine years as director of Trinity Institute, a center for continuing education for clergy at Trinity Church in Manhattan.
        He was ordained a priest in 1943 and served in parishes in Massachusetts, Connecticut, California and New York. He wrote or co-wrote four books on religion, including "Christian Believing," and "To Be a Priest."
        He is survived by his daughter, Anne Elizabeth Terwilliger, of Huntington, L.I.
