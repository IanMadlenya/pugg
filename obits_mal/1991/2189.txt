        Bryden Thomson, a Scottish conductor who specialized in the music of British composers, died in Dublin yesterday. He was supposed to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra this week, but he collapsed during rehearsals last Friday. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Thomson died of cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Thomson was best known in the United States through his many recordings on the Chandos label. He revived the works of Arnold Bax, and was considered a communicative conductor of music by Vaughan Williams, Elgar and Hamilton Harty. His concert repertory, however, ranged more broadly.
        Mr. Thomson was born in Ayr, Scotland, and studied at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and at the Staatliche Hochschule fur Musik in Hamburg, Germany. He was the principal conductor of the Scottish National Orchestra from 1988 until last summer.
        He was also a principal conductor of the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra. He was the artistic director of the Ulster Orchestra, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from 1977 to 1985.
        He is survived by his wife and two sons.
