        Joseph Abeles, a theatrical photographer who befriended dozens of aspiring actors and actresses, including some, like Tony Curtis and Marlon Brando, who went on to become stars, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, his nephew, Jerome Abeles, said.
        In 1935, Mr. Abeles founded his own photography business, Talbot Studio, and in 1957 joined Leo and Sy Friedman to create Friedman-Abeles, photographers of stage productions and personalities. They also produced magazine photo stories about theatrical subjects. He retired about 10 years ago. Mr. Abeles graduated from New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn, and was in the Army in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II.
        He is survived by a brother, Oscar, of Boynton Beach, Fla., and a sister, Ruth Shepard, of Jackson Heights, Queens.
