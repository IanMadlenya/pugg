        Luigi Zampa, a film director, screenwriter and author whose career spanned four decades, died on Thursday. He was 86 years old.
        A close friend reached at home said the director had died in a Rome hospital from complications of surgery. He had broken a leg in a fall earlier this year.
        Mr. Zampa, whose films presented slices of Italian life, was perhaps best known for his 1946 neorealist film, "To Live in Peace."
        Among his other screen credits are "Woman of Rome," "City on Trial," "The Policeman" and "The Doctor From the Public Health Service," a comedy starring Alberto Sordi.
        He also published three novels and wrote numerous screenplays and plays.
        He is survived by two sons and a daughter.
