        Marv Owen, who was the third baseman for the 1935 World Series champion Detroit Tigers, died on Saturday at a nursing home. Mr. Owen, who was 85 years old, had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Owen had a lifetime batting average of .275 in a nine-year career. He set one record that still stands: 31 consecutive trips to the plate without a hit in World Series play.
        In 1934, he was involved in the first ejection of a player from a World Series game Owen accidentally stepped on Joe (Ducky) Medwick's foot as Owen was fielding a throw. Medwick starting kicking at Owen and the two players got ready to exchange punches.
        No blows were thrown, but angry Detroit fans refused to let Medwick take the field. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who was attending the game, ejected Medwick.
        Mr. Owen is survived by a son, three sisters and a grandson.
