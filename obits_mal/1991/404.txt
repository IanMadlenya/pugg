        Jan M. Minkowski, professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, died on Tuedsay at his home in Baltimore. He was 74 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Minkowski came from a family in Poland whose members were active in the country's resistance in both World Wars. He was born in Zurich, where his mother had gone to deliver him in 1916. He was a graduate of the Warsaw Institute and was a cavalry officer when Poland was overrun at the outbreak of World War II.
        Interned first by the Russian forces, from whom he escaped, then by the Germans, he was liberated by United States forces in 1945 from a prison camp in Bavaria. He returned to Zurich to complete his education at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.
        Dr. Minkowski came to the United States in 1950 and joined the Johns Hopkins Radiation Laboratory in 1952. He received a doctorate in physics from the university in 1963. He retired in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Anne Hastings Shreve; four sons, Dr. John S. Minkowski of Baltimore; Andrew, of Virginia Beach, Va., Christopher, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Mark, of Palo Alto, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
