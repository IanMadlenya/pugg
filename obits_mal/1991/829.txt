        Menke Katz, a poet who gained note for his personal lyrical style in both English and Yiddish, died on Wednesday at his home in Spring Glen, N.Y. He was 85 years old and was the author of 18 books of poetry, 9 in each of the two languages.
        He died of a heart attack, his son, Dovid Katz, said.
        The poet won two Stephen Vincent Benet Narrative Poetry Awards, in 1970 and 1974, and his English version of his two-volume Yiddish epic poem, "Burning Village," had been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
        Mr. Katz, who for nearly 20 years until his death was editor of Bitterroot, a poetry magazine, wrote in a style that contrasted with the orotund realism embraced by literati during the years between the world wars. He created an unrhymed "Menke Chant Royal," and his opposition to rhyme was expressed in "Aspects of Modern Poetry," published in 1967. Experiences of Immigration
        Mr. Katz was also a scholar of Kabbala, a Jewish mysticism. He immigrated to the United States from his native Lithuania in 1920 and soon became a prominent figure in Yiddish literary circles. In 1936, "Burning Village" ("Brendik Shtetl") appeared, a well-received work that recounted the experiences of immigration from his ancestral village, a bucolic riverside hamlet populated by dreamlike figures, to the overcrowded, impoverished Lower East Side of New York.
        In the 1950's, he began writing in English, and made his debut in English in The Atlantic Monthly. In the 1960's, his creations made frequent appearances in the poetry columns of The New York Times.
        In addition to his son, who heads the Oxford University Yiddish studies program, he is survived by his wife, Rivke, an artist, and a daughter from a previous marriage, Mrs. Troim Handler, a teacher of Yiddish who lives in West Islip, L.I.
