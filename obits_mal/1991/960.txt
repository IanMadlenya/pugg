        Israel Tabak, a retired Baltimore rabbi who was a former president of the Rabbinical Council of America, died April 17 at Shaarei Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem. He was 86 years old.
        A resident of Jerusalem, he died of injuries received in a fall, said his daughter, Judith Goodman.
        In the late 1940's Rabbi Tabek was president of the rabbinical council, the umbrella body of Orthodox religious leaders in the United States and Canada. He was later honorary president.
        Born in Rumania, he was educated there and in Poland and completed rabbinical studies at Yeshiva University in Manhattan in 1928. He received a Ph.D. in philosophy from Johns Hopkins University in 1942.
        Rabbi Tabak joined Congregation Shaarei Zion in Baltimore in 1931 and remained there until 1976, when he moved to Jerusalem. His books included "Treasury of Holiday Thoughts," published by Bookman Publishers in 1958.
        He was a past national chairman of Religious Zionists of America.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gerta Wall; a son, Dr. Ya'acov Tabak of Jerusalem; two daughters, Ms. Goodman of Manhattan and Ruth Ungar of Baltimore; a sister, Hinda Herz of Ramat Chen, Israel; seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
