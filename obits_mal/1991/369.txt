        Nathan Ehrlich, a retired bakers' union official, died on Friday at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 87 years old and lived in Palm Desert, Calif.
        He died of cardiac arrest, said his daughter, Sandra Banner of Los Angeles.
        Mr. Ehrlich was a longtime official of the Bakery and Confectionery Workers International Union in New York. In 1937 he was acquitted of racketeering charges brought by Thomas E. Dewey, then a special prosecutor and later Governor of New York. Four other defendants were convicted of preventing bakers from selling below prices fixed by the conspirators.
        Mr. Ehrlich retired in 1973.
        In addition to his wife, the former Lilly Baczkowski, and his daughter, he is survived by a son, Allan, of Hollywood, Fla., 10 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
