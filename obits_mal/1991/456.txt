        Dr. Ellis P. Leonard, professor emeritus of veterinary surgery at Cornell University's Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, died on Feb. 7 at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 86 years old.
        He died of cancer, university officials said.
        Dr. Leonard, a graduate of Rutgers and of Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine, taught at Kansas State University and practiced in Summit, N.J., before joining Cornell as head of the small-animal clinic at the hospital.
        He wrote several textbooks and was credited with introducing aseptic surgery techniques and with pioneering methods to treat fractures in small animals and techniques in treatment of spinal-cord injuries, including the design of orthopedic carts.
        Dr. Leonard, a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons, received the Mark L. Morris Award of the American Animal Hospital Association in 1963. He retired in 1969.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alice Brown; a son, Lee; two sisters, Evelyn Stark of Youngstown, N.Y., and Elisabeth Crabb of Charlotte, N.C., and two grandchildren.
