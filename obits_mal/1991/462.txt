        Harold Blumenfeld, former executive editor for news pictures at United Press International, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach. He was 85 years old and lived in Hallandale, Fla.
        He died of complications stemming from heart disease, his daughter, Judith, of Manhattan, said.
        Mr. Blumenfeld was among the first to use the small, easily maneuvered hand cameras that enabled news photographers to take unposed, natural pictures. After he retired in 1968, he became special projects editor for U.P.I. for two years, administering a program to train minority youths.
        He was named editor of the year by the National Press Photographers Association in 1959, and in 1969 he received its Joseph A. Sprague Award, one of the highest in the field.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, the former Gerry Krasner; a brother, William, of Yucaipa, Calif., and two grandsons.
