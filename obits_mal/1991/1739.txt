        The Rev. Finian Kerwin, a Franciscan friar and former head of the Holy Name Province, the largest province in the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor
        , died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the Franciscans said.
        Father Kerwin entered Fordham University in 1946 after serving in the Navy in World War II. After graduation, he entered the Franciscan Seminary and earned a degree in theology from Holy Name College in Washington. He was ordained in 1955.
        He served as pastor of St. Francis of Assisi Friary from 1964 to 1967. He was then elected Minister Provincial of the Holy Name Province, which covers all Franciscan operations on the Eastern seaboard, and held that post for nine years. Since 1976 he had been head of the Franciscan Missionary Union.
        He is survived by a brother, Raymond, of Montauk, L.I.
