        Devereux Butcher, an author, editor and former conservation executive who fought to preserve the national park system, died Wednesday at his home in Gladwyn, Pa. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Butcher died of complications from a fall, a spokesman for the family said.
        He campaigned against a number of projects that he saw as threats to the parks, including proposed hydroelectric power dams at the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and Colorado and a proposal to log a primeval rain forest in Olympic National Park in Washington State.
        He was a founding editor of National Parks magazine and executive director of the National Parks Association, now the National Parks and Conservation Association, from 1942 to 1950.
        With his wife, Mary Taft Butcher, he published an environmental newspaper, National Wildlands News. He was the author of four books about park systems, including "Exploring Our National Parks and Monuments" (Oxford University Press, 1947), which was republished in eight revisions through 1985.
        He was a member of the Interior Department's advisory committee on conservation.
        A native of Devon, Pa., Mr. Butcher was a graduate of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Russell D. of Cottonwood, Ariz.; a sister, Constance Heckscher of Chestnut Hill, Pa., and two grandchildren.
