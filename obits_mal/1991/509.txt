        Maurice Zolotow, whose hundreds of magazine articles and several books on show business personalities earned him the designation "the Boswell of Broadway," died Thursday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 77 years old.
        He had been hospitalized for influenza and died of cardiac arrest, said his former wife, Charlotte Zolotow, of Hastings-on Hudson, N.Y.
        Mr. Zolotow went to work in 1936 for Billboard, the theatrical trade weekly. He was one of the first theatrical writers to delve into the lives of stars rather than merely portray them as fan magazine idols, going to his subjects for first-hand information.
        He was the author of "Marilyn Monroe," "Confessions of a Race Track Fiend," "Billy Wilder in Hollywood," "Shooting Star: A Biography of John Wayne," "Stagestruck: The Romance of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne," "No People Like Show People," "It Takes All Kinds" and "Never Whistle in a Dressing Room." His fictional works were "The Great Balsamo" and "Oh Careless Love."
        Recently, Mr. Zolotow wrote articles for Reader's Digest and Los Angeles Magazine. He was founder and first president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors.
        He is survived by a son, Stephen, of New York; a daughter, Crescent Dragonwagon, of Eureka, Ark., a writer of children's books, and two sisters, Gloria Jacobs, of Los Angeles, and Rozlyn Zolotow.
