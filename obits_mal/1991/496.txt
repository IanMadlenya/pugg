        H. Adams Ashforth, who headed the Manhattan real-estate concern of Albert B. Ashforth Inc., for more than five decades before he retired as chairman in 1981, died on Wednesday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 89 years old.
        He died of kidney failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ashforth spent his entire business career with the family company, which he joined in 1921 while still a student at Yale. He graduated from Yale in 1923, and in 1929 he became president of the company on the death of his father, who had founded it in 1896.
        In 1973 Mr. Ashforth founded Ashforth Properties to develop business and residential properties in Fairfield County, Conn. He was a founder and director of the First Natinal Bank of Greenwich, which later merged with the Union Trust Company.
        He is survived by his wife, Elsie; two daughters, Eleanor Harvey of Stonington, Conn., and Marna Geoffroy of Napa, Calif; two sons, Henry A. Jr., of Greenwich, who succeeded him as president of the Ashforth concern, and Alden, of Los Angeles; two stepsons, Michael Madden of Stamford, Conn., and Peter Madden of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Christina Whitman of Manhattan; a brother, George, of Greenwich, 14 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
