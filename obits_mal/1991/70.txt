        Darrell Barnett, a dancer with the Harkness and Joffrey ballet companies in the 1970's, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. He was 41 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Barnett died of liver cancer, a longtime friend, Lee Minskoff, said.
        Mr. Barnett moved to New York City from Miami, Okla., when the Martha Graham school gave him a full scholarship. He danced with the modern-dance troupes of Erick Hawkins, Pearl Lang and Yuriko. He also performed with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. He received special notice in principal roles from 1972 to 1974 with the Harkness Ballet. He later joined the Joffrey Ballet. Mr. Barnett presented his own choreography at the Riverside Dance Festival in 1983 and 1986.
        He is survived by his mother, Ada Waers; his father, W. L. Barnett, and his brother, William Barnett Jr., all of Oklahoma.
