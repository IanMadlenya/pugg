        Albert H. Gaynes, a retired steel executive and an advocate for political and social causes, died on Monday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 73 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        From 1949 to 1979 he worked for the Capitol Steel Company, fabricators of reinforcing steel for concrete construction. He served as a vice president and director for most of that period and was a one-third owner. From 1980 to 1990, he was a marketing and management consultant and also ran Gaynes Enterprises, a sales company dealing in minerals and ores.
        In the 1980's he made several trips to El Salvador and Nicaragua, working with groups trying to change United States policy. He also aided efforts to improve relations between blacks and Jews in New York City. He was a director of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, the Fund for New Priorities in America, and Curbstone Press, which publishes material on Latin America. Last year he became a part-time community liaison for Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester.
        Born in Staten Island, Mr. Gaynes grew up in Manhattan and the Bronx. He graduated from City College and for two years was an economics instructor there. He served five years in the Army in World War II, reaching the rank of first lieutenant. After the war he taught for four years at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Deborah Libert; two daughters, Elizabeth of White Plains, and Susan of Cazenovia, N.Y.; a brother, Sanford of Plainview, L.I., and two grandchildren.
