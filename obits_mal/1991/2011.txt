        Melville Wakeman Hall, a fourth-generation member of a New York City real-estate family who had homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla., died on Friday in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hall, 87 years old, died of cancer, his family said.
        He was an executive in the family firm, Harvey M. Hall. Among the projects he worked on were the construction of apartments in Riverdale in the Bronx and on West End Avenue. Family legend says his great, great grandfather built the city's first five-story building in the early 1900's.
        Born in New York, Mr. Hall graduated from the Lawrenceville Academy in New Jersey and served in the Navy in World War II as a lieutenant commander.
        He is survived by his wife, Evelyn Annenberg Hall; a son, Harvey M. Hall 2d, and a daughter, Constance P. M. Saffelle, both of Raleigh, N.C.
