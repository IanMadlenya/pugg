He was professor of biblical studies at Weston for about 40 years and, after retirment in 1974, continued his studies and wrote articles.
        In 1956, he was a co-founder and later assistant editor of New Testament Abstracts, a scholarly journal that presents summaries of articles from biblical and theological publications.
        He was also a lecturer in biblical Greek and Hebrew at Boston College from 1967 to 1973. He was a charter member of the Catholic Biblical Association of America and served as president of the organization in 1960.
        He is survived by a brother, Edward T. Collins of Springfield, Mass.
