        Samuel J. Cohen, who played an important role in several strikes as a lawyer representing major unions in the New York region, died on Wednesday at Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, L.I. He was 83 years old and had residences in Tucson, Ariz., and Shelter Island, L.I.
        His death was caused by heart failure, his family said.
        For most of his 49 years as a labor lawyer, he represented several locals of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. He was the Teamsters' lead lawyer in a series of contract negotiations in the milk industry. Three times the talks broke down in strikes that cut off milk supplies to millions of customers, for one day in 1951, six days in 1953 and 13 days in 1961.
        He also represented the union in a 1937 strike of cafeteria workers at Horn and Hardart, a 1944 strike of pie and bread deliverers, a 1945 strike of United Parcel Service drivers, a 1947 strike of Railway Express Agency workers and a 1948 strike of 9,400 area truck drivers that lasted nearly three weeks.
        Over the years, he specialized in pension and health benefits. In 1950 he was instrumental in winning a $50-a-month company pension for milk-truck drivers, which was considered a breakthrough. As a Teamster spokesman, he analyzed rate increases requested by Blue Cross and appeared before state regulators to oppose or support the changes.
        Representing the national Airline Pilots Association, he unsuccessfully opposed the Federal Aviation Agency's imposition of mandatory retirement for pilots at age 60. He also represented local Teamster officials in internal disputes over pension funds when the international union was ousted from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for corruption.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Minnie Mayer; a son, David, of New York City; two daughters, Tamra Stoller of Port Jefferson, L.I., and Carol Levine of Tucson, and five grandchildren.
