        Thomas Atherton Dickey, an aircraft engineer and aeronautical innovator, died on Nov. 2 at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 74 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said his wife, the former Barbara Morris.
        Mr. Dickey was a principal engineer at Textron Lycoming, a company in Stratford, Conn., that makes gas turbine engines. He had six patents related to gas turbine engines for aircraft or helicopters.
        He joined the company, then named Avco Lycoming, in 1954, and came to play a free-wheeling role within its 700-person engineering organization, tackling novel or esoteric engineering problems. He also did liaison work with aircraft makers.
        Mr. Dickey was born in Baltimore and earned bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from Princeton University.
        His first marriage, to Anne Tredick in 1950, ended in divorce in 1966.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three children from the first marriage: a son, Tim, of South Wellfleet, Mass., and two daughters, Tina, of Boston, and Marcia Basine, of Provincetown, Mass., and two daughters from the second marriage: Eleanor, a graduate student at Oxford University, and Frances, a senior at Harvard College; a brother, Parke, of Owasso, Okla., and two grandchildren.
