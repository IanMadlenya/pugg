        Ralph Harvey, a former Representative from Indiana, died Thursday at North Beach Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 90 years old and lived on his family farm near Mount Summit in east central Indiana.
        Mr. Harvey, a Republican who had been on the House Agricultural Committee, died from a stroke that he suffered last week at his winter home in Fort Lauderdale, said Sam Hall of the Macer-Hall Funeral Home in New Castle near Mount Summit.
        Mr. Harvey was born on the family farm, and graduated from Purdue University. He became a high school teacher of agriculture in Mount Summit for some years before turning to farming full time.
        He was a state legislator before he entered Congress in 1947 from the 10th District to replace Raymond S. Springer, who had died.
        Mr. Harvey went on to serve in Congress for all but two years from 1947 to 1966. After being elected to five successive terms, he lost his seat in the 1958 election, but won it back in 1960, then was re-elected twice more. He is survived by his wife, the former Charline Bowers, to whom he was married in 1925.
