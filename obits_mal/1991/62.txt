        Jonathan Etra, a writer, died on Thursday while vacationing in Key West, Fla. He was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He apparently suffered a heart attack while swimming, said his brother Donald.
        Mr. Etra was the co-author of a childrens' book, "Aliens for Breakfast," published in 1989 by Random House. He was also the editor of an anthology, "Junk Food," published in 1980 by Dial Press.
        Mr. Etra, a graduate of Yale University, also wrote articles for Harper's and Vogue.
        He is also survived by his mother, Blanche, and two other brothers, Aaron and Marshall, all of Manhattan.
