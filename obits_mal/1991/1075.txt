        Edgar Bonjour, a Swiss historian, died on Sunday night, his family said today. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Bonjour died of a heart attack, the family said.
        His nine-volume "History of the Swiss Neutrality," published from 1967 to 1970, became a standard reference work on Switzerland's foreign and defense policy before and during World War II.
        Mr. Bonjour also wrote hundreds of other publications. Survivors include his wife and four children.
