        Hyman Ashman, a physician for 50 years who retired in 1985, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        He was a graduate of Columbia College and of Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons. In World War II he served as an Army major at field hospitals in the Pacific. In 1948, when Israel was established, he volunteered at a hospital in Haifa to treat tropical diseases and injuries from the fighting with Israel's Arab neighbors.
        Dr. Ashman, a wood sculptor, had had his works on biblical subjects and on the Holocaust shown in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Wyle, and a sister, Roslyn Beiser of Manhattan.
