        Earl B. Pardon, an artist and craftsman who was best known for his colorful enamel mosaic jewelry, died on Wednesday at the New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. He was 64 years old and lived in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
        He died of cardiac arrest, said his son, Tod.
        Mr. Pardon, who was born in Memphis, joined the faculty of Skidmore College in 1951, retiring in 1989 as professor emeritus of art.
        His jewelry, mainly abstract collages of gold, silver, enamel and colored gemstones, was featured in solo and group exhibitions throughout the country and is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Craft Museum in New York, the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts. He was on the board of trustees of the New York State Craftsman's Council.
        In his most recent work, he used enamel like an artist's canvas, painting abstract patterns on it. Mr. Pardon also designed a sculptured metal wall for the Prudential Life Insurance Company in Newark. A retrospective exhibition of more than 300 of his drawings, paintings, sculpture, enamels and jewelry was held at Skidmore in 1980.
        Besides his son, of Wilton, N.Y., he is survived by his wife, Eunice, a fiber artist; a brother, W. Henry of Memphis, and a sister, Louise Ingram Bell of Lakewood, Calif.
