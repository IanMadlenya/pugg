        Phil Zwickler, who directed documentaries and wrote articles about gay and lesbian issues, including the AIDS crisis, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 36 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his father, Seymour.
        Mr. Zwickler's films included "Rights and Reactions: Lesbian and Gay Rights on Trial," an account of the 1986 New York City Council hearings on the gay rights bill. He produced and directed the film with Jane Lippman.
        The film, which was shown at Film Forum in 1988, won awards including a Gold Plaque at the 1987 Chicago International Film Festival and a special jury prize at the 1988 San Francisco Film Festival. 'Silence Equals Death'
        Mr. Zwickler collaborated with the experimental German film maker Rosa von Praunheim on "Silence Equals Death" and "Positive," films about the rage and frustration of people with AIDS. They were shown at the Public Theater as part of the 1990 Documentary Festival of New York.
        Also shown in that festival were "Fear of Disclosure," a five-minute film by Mr. Zwickler and David Wojnarowicz about the dating problems facing gay men in the age of AIDS. "Positive" presented portraits of Mr. Zwickler and two other men living with the HIV infection. All three films had been shown earlier in the year at the Berlin International Film Fesival.
        For several years, Mr. Zwickler was the editor of People With AIDS Coalition Newsline, an international publication written by and for people with AIDS and HIV infection.
        He is survived by his mother, Sandra Lewin of Floral Park, Queens; his father, Seymour, of Hollywood, Fla.; a brother, Allen, of Lindcroft, N.J.; a sister, Caren Levine of Briarwood, N.Y., and his grandmothers, Bertha Zwickler of Brooklyn and Lillian Levine of Woodbury, L.I.
        A funeral service will be held today at the Riverside Chapel, West 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, at 12 noon.
