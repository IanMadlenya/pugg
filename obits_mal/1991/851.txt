        Bishop Thaddeus A. Shubsda of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey, died of cancer on Friday. He was 66 years old.
        In his nine years as head of the Monterey Diocese, Bishop Shubsda worked to improve the lives of farmworkers and support people with AIDS.
        He acted as a mediator in frozen-food strikes by farm workers in Watsonville several years ago, helping to settle the dispute and urging that field workers receive better living conditions.
