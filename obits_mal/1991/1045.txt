        Lino Brocka, a director whose films had a strong social content, died here early today. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Brocka was killed when the car in which he was riding hit a utility pole, the police said.
        William Lorenzo, a local actor who was driving the car, suffered leg injuries, a police investigator said.
        Mr. Brocka, a human rights advocate, won international critical acclaim for his films depicting social ills in the Philippines. His 1989 movie "Fight for Us" expressed disillusionment with the human-rights situation under President Corazon C. Aquino's Government.
        The director was active in street demonstrations and was jailed during the 20-year rule of the former President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
        Mr. Brocka was named to a special commission in 1986 that drew up the present Philippine Constitution.
