        Stephen B. Hitchner Jr., public policy analyst and former senior vice president of the Urban Institute, died Thursday at the Washington Hospital Center. He was 46 years old and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        He died of stomach cancer, said his wife, Valentine V. Craig.
        Mr. Hitchner served as an executive with the institute, a nonprofit research organization, from 1986 until last year when illness forced him to resign. Before that, he was vice president for issue development at Common Cause, a Washington lobbying group.
        He was a founding director of the Office of Policy and Management Analysis in the criminal division of the Justice Department, where he worked from 1979 to 1982. He began his career on the faculty of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1974, and he taught public policy and directed the first case studies program for public management research until 1979.
        Born in Somers Point, N.J., he graduated in 1967 from Swarthmore, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and an all-American lacrosse player. A Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford University, in 1967-1968, he received a master's degree in public policy from the Kennedy School in 1974 and an M.B.A. from the Harvard Business School the same year.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David Craig, and a daughter, Katharine Walley, both of Bethesda; his parents, Mariana and Stephen B. Hitchner of Chestertown, Md.; three brothers, Roger E. of Adelphi, Md., Robert of Tokyo and Thomas of Baltimore, and a sister, Sarabelle of Craftsbury Common, Vt.
