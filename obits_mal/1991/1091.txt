        Alfred E. Simon, a historian of theater music, author and pianist, died on Tuesday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        He died of heart failure after surgery, said his brother, George T. Simon.
        Mr. Simon served for more than 20 years as a director of light music for WQXR, the radio station of The New York Times. With Richard Lewine, he wrote three books devoted to the musical theater: "The Encylopedia of Theater Music" (1961), "Songs of the American Theater" (1973) and "Songs of the Theater" (1984).
        With Robert Kimball, he wrote "The Gershwins" (1973), which traced the lives of George and Ira Gershwin in words and pictures. Mr. Simon had served as a rehearsal pianist for the original Broadway production of the Gershwins' musical "Of Thee I Sing" and had accompanied their sister on her record album "Frances Gershwin -- For George and Ira With Love."
        Since 1975, Mr. Simon had served as chief musical consultant for the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn.
        He was a member of the Players Club and at the time of his death had been living at the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood, N.J. In both places, he frequently entertained members and residents with informal piano concerts devoted to theater songs.
        Besides his brother, the big-band historian, he is survived by his sister, Elizabeth Seligmann of Harrison, N.Y., seven nieces and two nephews.
