        Robert W. Ponte, an urban planner who helped design major developments in New York City and Tehran, Iran, died on Jan. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his brother, Joseph, of Falls Church, Va., said.
        Dr. Ponte was an expert on zoning regulations and the economic consequences of urban development projects. While with the planning firm of Cooper, Eckstut Associates in Manhattan he helped prepare master plans for Battery Park City and the 42d Street Redevelopment Project.
        In the early 1970's he served in the Mayor's Office of Midtown Planning and Development. Later, he was part of a four-person team that created a master plan for the Shah of Iran for the redevelopment of the center of Tehran.
        From 1984 until his death, he directed real-estate and market analysis for Buckhurst Fish Hutton Katz Inc., a Manhattan architectural firm. He also lectured on urban planning at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1971.
        In addition to his brother, he is survived by his parents, Joseph and Grace Ponte of Cornwall, Pa., and a sister, Arlene Clanton of West Lynn, Ore.
