        John Zorek, a travel agent who specialized in travel plans for symphony orchestras and others in the music world, died on Friday at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Zorek died of a heart attack, his son, Jeff, said.
        Beginning in 1945, when he opened Mayfair Travel Service in Manhattan, Mr. Zorek made travel plans for many major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony and the Pittsburgh and Cleveland symphonies. University choirs were also among his clients, as were music lovers going to music festivals like the Spoleto Festival in Italy. His individual clients included Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie.
        Born in Posen, Germany, he received a law degree from the University of Berlin and came to the United States in 1936. He served in Army intelligence in World War II. He was also a board member of Self Help Charities, an organization formed by German refugees to aid the indigent.
        Besides his son, Jeff, of London, Mr. Zorek is survived by his wife, the former Lisl Perl; and a sister, Kate Hirsch of Manhattan.
