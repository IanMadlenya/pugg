        Rear Adm. Richard Helsden Phillips, retired, a highly decorated veteran of World War II, died last Tuesday at the National Hospital for Orthopedics and Rehabilitation in Arlington, Va. He was 84 years old and lived in Arlington.
        The cause of death was cancer, the hospital said.
        Admiral Phillips, a native of Pittsfield, Mass., was a 1927 graduate of the United States Naval Academy.
        During World War II, he was the commander of Destroyer Division 108 in the western Pacific.
        He was awarded the Navy Cross for his leadership of the division in 1944 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, in the eastern Philippines, where American forces destroyed the Japanese fleet in history's largest naval engagement. The medal is second only to the Medal of Honor among decorations for valor.
        Admiral Phillips was deputy commandant of the National War College when he retired from the military in July 1962.
