        Dr. Henry K. Silver, a pediatrician who developed pioneering programs in the 1960's to ease the shortage of doctors and nurses and who later studied abuses of medical students by their teachers, died Sunday at University Hospital in Denver. He was 72 years old and lived in Denver.
        He died of cancer, said his son, Andrew, a doctor in St. Louis.
        Dr. Silver joined the faculty at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in 1957 after teaching pediatrics at the University of California Medical School and at Yale University Medical School.
        He was a 1942 graduate of the medical school of the University of California at Berkeley. In 1964 he developed a program for nurse-practitioners, the first of its kind in the nation. He also created a program at the University of Colorado in 1969 to train students as physicians' assistants specializing in pediatrics.
        In 1985, he conducted a pioneering study of abuse of medical students by faculty members and supervisors, and in 1990 he was a co-author of a more thorough study that found that 80 percent of the students in one medical school reported some form of verbal or physical abuse or sexual harassment.
        Since 1978 he had served as associate dean of admissions at the Colorado University Medical School.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Harriet.
