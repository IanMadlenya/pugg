        Edmond F. Chapus, former president and chief executive of Alsthom Inc., one of the world's largest engineering conglomerates, died on Saturday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 66 years old.
        He died of complications resulting from prostate cancer, his son, Jean-Marc, said.
        Mr. Chapus, a French citizen, began his career as an engineer with Neyrpic Company, a French engineering concern. His early assignments included naval projects in South America and working on water development for the United Nations in Pakistan and Iran.
        In 1958 he was appointed head of Neyrpic's United States subsidiary, which became the American arm of Alsthom Group. He became president and chief executive of Alsthom Inc. in 1977.
        Under his direction, the company undertook major projects in the United States, including hydroelectric systems on the Columbia and Ohio Rivers, and transportation systems in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Washington. He retired in 1988.
        Mr. Chapus was born in St.-Marcellin, France, and graduated from the University of Montpellier. He held masters degrees from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Mines and the University of Minnesota.
        Besides his son, Jean-Marc, of Beverly Hills, Calif., he is survived by his wife, the former Mary Gemma Kawamura; two daughters, Camille Fancy Roy of Pepperell, Mass., and Elisabeth Tippens of Dallas, and four grandchildren.
