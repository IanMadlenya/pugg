        Robert R. Preato, an art historian, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 49 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his brother, Dennis, said.
        For many years, Mr. Preato was director of the American Masters department at the Grand Central Art Galleries in Manhattan. He wrote many works on 19th and 20th century American art, many of them published by the galleries.
        At his death, he was writing and working as an art dealer in his home.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Preato graduated from the School of Art and Design in Manhattan in 1959.
        Besides his brother, he is survived by his parents, Anna and Robert Preato, and two sisters, Anna and JoAnne, all of Manhattan.
