        Sidney E. Cohn, a lawyer whose half-century-long career included a key role in helping workers in New York City organize and join unions, died on Sunday at his Manhattan home. He was 83 years old.
        He died of heart disease, his stepson, David Garfield of Los Angeles said.
        In the late 1930's, after passage by Congress of the National Labor Relations Act, known also as the Wagner Act, which protected workers attempting to organize unions, and immediately after World War II, Mr. Cohn represented workers and unions organizing various industries. These included the hotel industry, Horn & Hardart Automats, the United Office of Profesional Workers Union and banks, insurance agents and radio station technical workers.
        Mr. Cohn also represented the American Newspaper Guild and unions representing pocketbook makers, restaurant workers and sheet metal workers.
        With the advent of the McCarthy anti-communist hearings, Mr. Cohn counseled numerous Hollywood personalities forced to appear before Congressional committees investigating communism in Hollywood.
        Mr. Cohn, a partner in the law firm of Cohn, Glickstein & Lurie, was a member of the advisory council of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, the governing council of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the Empire State Arts Commission.
        In addition his stepson, Mr. Cohn is survived by his wife, Roberta Garfield Cohn; a daughter, Janet Nechis, a lawyer with her father's firm; a stepdaughter, Julie Garfield of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.
