        Morris Rokowsky, a real-estate executive, died on Monday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 89 years and lived in Monsey, N.Y.
        Mr. Rokowsky, who suffered from cancer, died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.
        From 1941 to 1954 he owned and operated the Royal Rubber Corporation in Manhattan, which made raincoats. In 1954 he founded the Morris Rokowsky Management Company, which owned and managed apartment houses in the New York area.
        Mr. Rokowsky also helped found Beth Jacob of Borough Park, a Jewish day school for girls in Brooklyn, and the Beth Joseph Rabbinical Seminary in Borough Park.
        Mr. Rokowsky was born in Basel, Switzerland, and came to the United States in 1941. He helped Jewish refugees from Germany and Eastern Europe flee to Switzerland in the late 1930's, efforts that he continued in New York in the 1940's through Vaad Hatzoloh, a Jewish rescue organization with connections in Switzerland.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rachel Bollag; three daughters, Miriam Schwab and Ruth Lehman of Brooklyn and Deborah Levinson of Monsey; two sons, Isaac and Rabbi Israel Rokowsky, both of Monsey; 35 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. He is also survived by three sisters, Ida Finkel and Martha Stefansky of Brooklyn and Selma Kirzner-Galed of Jerusalem.
