        Dr. George D. Eastman, an authority on law enforcement who drew on his experience as a former police chief in his later career as a professor and consultant, died Wednesday at his home in Tucson, Ariz.
        He was 79 years old and died of a heart ailment, said a spokeswoman for Kent State University in Kent, Ohio.
        Dr. Eastman retired from Kent State in 1987 after 20 years as a professor of criminal justice and political science and as former director of its Institute of Government Research and Service.
        He served as Chief of the Seattle Police Department from 1946 to 1952 and superintendent of the police at the Port Authority of New York from 1955 to 1957.
        Professional police training was Dr. Eastman's specialty. He was a consultant on police affairs in more than 40 cities and wrote and edited numerous textbooks and articles.
        He was a graduate of the University of Washington in Seattle and obtained a master's degree in public administration at New York University and a doctorate in higher education from Michigan State University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Esther Middleton; two sons, John, of Kent, and George D., of Everett, Wash.; a daughter, Margerite MacArthur of St. Louis, and four stepchildren, B. J. Bess of Tempe, Ariz., Fred M. White of Tucson, George A. White of Hackettstown, N.J., and Carolyn Sampson of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I.
