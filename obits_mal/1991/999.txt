        Joseph C. Hartney Jr., a photographers' representative and former director of development for the San Francisco and Joffrey Ballets, died Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 44 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his mother, Adelaide Lammers, said.
        In 1988, Mr. Hartney founded Photographers and Friends United Against AIDS, an organization that has raised $1.4 million for AIDS research and service organizations.
        With works contributed by photographers, it organized "The Indomitable Spirit," a show that opened in New York last year and then moved to Los Angeles and Chicago. The show raised money by issuing limited edition portfolios of some the works and by auctioning off other works.
        Mr. Hartney was born in Philadelphia. After serving four years in the Navy during the Vietnam War, he received a B.A. degree from Williams College in 1973 and a master's degree in business administration from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1976.
        He worked as a stockbroker in New York for two years, then became director of development of the San Francisco Ballet and then of the Joffrey. For the last seven years, he represented photographers and was affiliated principally with the John Bean Studio in New York.
        Surviving besides his mother, of Folsom, Pa., are three sisters, Jean of Drexel Hill, Pa., Adelaide Bracalenti of Thornton, Pa., and Maureen of Media, Pa., and a brother, Michael, of Drexel Hill.
        Services will be held today at noon at Our Lady of Peace Church in Milmont Park, Pa., and at a date to be determined at the Church of the Ascension in Greenwich Village.
