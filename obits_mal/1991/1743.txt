        Michael Arceneaux, a producer and director of fashion shows, died on Sunday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 47 years old.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Mark Hummel, a spokesman for the family.
        Mr. Arceneaux, a graduate of Pratt Institute, began his career as a fashion illustrator. But his metier proved to be production of fashion shows. Among his clients were Calvin Klein, Oscar de la Renta, Carolyne Roehm, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.
        He is survived by a brother, Charles L., of Lake Charles, La., and two sisters, Peggy Woods of Lutcher, La., and Joan Granger of Slidell, La.
