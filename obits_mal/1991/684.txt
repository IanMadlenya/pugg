        Dr. Luther Atwood Cloud, a physician who was an authority on alcoholism in the work place, died on Tuesday at Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was 70 years old and lived in Auburn, Me.
        He died of complications of heart disease, said his wife, Charlotte.
        From 1969 to 1971 and again from 1978 to 1979, Dr. Cloud was the president of the National Council on Alcoholism, an organization dedicated to educating the public about alcoholism's nature as a treatable and preventable disease. He wrote extensively and lectured widely on the subject.
        Dr. Cloud, a 1949 graduate of New York University Medical School, was chief supervisory physician at the New York Telephone Company before becoming vice president and associate medical director of the Equitable Life Assurance Society in Manhattan in 1957. He retired from Equitable in 1978 and founded a treatment center in Lewiston, Me. He had previously been affiliated with hospitals in New York City and with the Strang Preventive Medicine Institute in Manhattan.
        He was a member of many professional organizations, including the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Addictive Medicine.
        His wife is the sole survivor.
