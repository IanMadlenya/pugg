        Howard Edward Butt, founder of a chain of 175 supermarkets and 31 video stores, died Tuesday at a hospital in Corpus Christi. He was 95 years old.
        His chain of H. E. B. grocery stores in Texas employs 30,000 people.
        In 1988, Forbes magazine ranked the H. E. Butt Grocery Company as the 36th-largest private company in the United States, with annual sales estimated at $2 billion.
        Mr. Butt began in the grocery business as a child, helping his mother in a store that she started with $50. He took over the family business after World War I and expanded it. In 1971 he turned over the operation of the chain to his son Charles.
        In 1961 President John F. Kennedy appointed Mr. Butt to the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Mr. Butt also helped establish the University of Corpus Christi, now Corpus Christi State University, and was a lay minister in the Southern Baptist Church.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, Howard and Charles, and a daughter, Eleanor Crook.
