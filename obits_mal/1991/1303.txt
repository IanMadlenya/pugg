        Tom P. Peters Sr., a hatmaker who sent his products to Presidents and other celebrities, died of liver cancer on Sunday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital-Cityview. He was 100 years old.
        Mr. Peters and his brother Jim came to Fort Worth from Greece in 1911 and ran shoeshine parlors before they began making hats.
        He and Amon Carter Sr., a former publisher of The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, worked together to design the Shady Oaks hats, wide-brimmed western models that Mr. Carter distributed to movie stars, political leaders and foreign dignitaries.
        Mr. Peters is survived by a daughter, Helen Peters; four grandchildren; five great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.
