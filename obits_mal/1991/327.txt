        Tom Haas, artistic director of the Indiana Repertory Theater, died Thursday at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. He was 53 years old and lived in Indianapolis.
        He died of a pulmonary embolism three weeks after being struck by a van while jogging, Becca Seitz, a spokeswoman for the theater, said.
        Mr. Haas directed three-dozen productions at the Indiana Repertory Theater since he became artistic director in 1980. Previously, he was artistic director at the Weathervane Theater in Whitefield, N.H., which he helped found, and at the Play Makers Repertory Theater in Chapel Hill, N.C. He also directed graduate studies in the theater arts department at the University of North Carolina.
        At Yale University, he was associate director of the Repertory Theater and head of the drama school's acting and directing department.
        He is survived by a son, Colin Haas, and his mother, Dorothy Fuchs, of Nutley, N.J.
