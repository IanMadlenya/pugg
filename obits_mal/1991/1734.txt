        Robert Battey Troutman Jr., a lawyer who in the 1960's developed a voluntary approach to opening industrial jobs for blacks, died Tuesday at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. He was 73 years old and lived in Atlanta.
        He died of cancer, said a son, W. George Troutman, of Arlington, Va.
        Mr. Troutman, a 1942 graduate of Harvard Law School, where he was a roommate of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., John F. Kennedy's older brother, joined his father's law firm upon graduation but left after a few years to enter his own practice and pursue business ventures.
        It was as a member of President Kennedy's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity that he developed the Plans for Progress, a program to induce many of the nation's largest corporations to hire and promote black employees. Despite some initial successes, the effort was sharply criticized by civil-rights groups as a "go slow" approach that ran counter to compulsory measures spelled out in an executive order that prohibited racial discrimination by Government agencies and by companies with Government contracts.
        Mr. Troutman was most recently involved in land development in Fort Myers, Fla.
        In addition to his son, W. George Troutman, he is survived by his wife, Lois; another son, C. Bruce of Atlanta; a daughter, Nell Ridley Troutman of Atlanta; a sister, Eleanor Bockman, also of Atlanta, and nine grandchildren.
