        Former Justice Alfred H. Joslin, who served on Rhode Island's highest court for 16 years and wrote more than 600 opinions, died Wednesday at his home in Bristol, R.I.
        He was 77 years old and died of Parkinson's disease and pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Joslin, a Republican, sat on the State Supreme Court from 1963 to 1979. Each of his written opinions was "a superbly crafted, thoroughly researched document that now serves as an everlasting legacy," said a former colleague, Justice Thomas F. Kelleher.
        Born in Providence, Mr. Joslin was a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Law School. He specialized in corporate law before being appointed to the bench.
        Mr. Joslin served on the boards of several hospitals and social service organizations. He was also a former board member and vice chancellor at Brown.
        His survivors include two daughters, Susan Leader of Manhattan and Elizabeth Poirier of Warwick, R.I; a brother, Robert, of Boca Raton, Fla., and a sister, Joyce Salinger of Cincinnati.
