        William C. Liedtke Jr., who co-founded the Pennzoil Company and helped turn it into one of the nation's largest oil companies, died of cancer on Friday. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Liedtke (pronounced LIT-key) headed the Pogo Producing Company, an exploration and production company that was spun off from Pennzoil in 1977. Pogo, which took its name from Pennzoil Offshore Gas Operators, was set up to look for natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico.
        Mr. Liedtke, a native of Tulsa, Okla., began his career as a lawyer and oilman in Midland, Tex.
        He and his brother, John Hugh, started in the oil business after serving as naval officers in the South Pacific in World War II. In the mid-1950's they teamed with George Bush and John K. Overbey to form Zapata Petroleum Company.
        President Bush and his wife, Barbara, said in a statement on Saturday that they were "deeply saddened at the loss of our very dear and close friend."
        In 1960 the Liedtke brothers began a cooperative drilling program with the South Penn Oil Company and set up Stetco Petroleum, of which William Liedtke was president. In 1963 Zapata Petroleum and Stetco merged with South Penn, which was renamed Pennzoil after its nationally known lubrication oil trademark. Pennzoil is the nation's 14th largest oil company.
        William Liedtke served as president of Pennzoil from 1967 to 1977, when he became chairman and chief executive of Pogo.
        Besides his brother, who lives in Houston, Mr. Liedtke is survived by his wife, Bessie Johns Smith Liedtke of Houston; two daughters, Laura Bucholz of Saratoga, Wyo., and Claire Alexander of San Antonio; two sons, William Liedtke 3d of Oklahoma City and Cadell S. Liedtke of Midland, and nine grandchildren.
