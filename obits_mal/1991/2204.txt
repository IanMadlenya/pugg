        Leon G. Telsey, a retired Manhattan lawyer and a former rear admiral in the United States Coast Guard Reserve, died Nov. 8 at United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 84 years old and lived in Mamaroneck.
        His death was apparently caused by heart failure, his family said.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Telsey was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Cornell University and got his law degree at Harvard. He worked for the Federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation for about 12 years until the early 1940's, then joined a family law firm, Telsey & Lowenthal.
        In 1943 he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the reserve and during World War II served in a New York City district office and on a transport ship.
        In 1946 he returned to the law firm, specializing in wills, trusts, estates and patents. He continued in the reserves as commander of volunteer training at New Rochelle. President Johnson appointed him rear admiral in 1966. He retired in 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, Evelyn; a son, Steven, of Concord, Mass.; a sister, Nadia, of Eugene, Ore., and one granddaughter.
