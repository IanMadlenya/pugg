        Dr. Malcom E. Phelps, a founder of the American Academy of Family Physicians, died Friday. He was 85 years old.
        Dr. Phelps was president of the organization, then the American Academy of General Practice, in 1957. The organization now has 71,000 members.
        In 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Dr. Phelps field director of Project Vietnam, a joint effort of the State Department and the American Mecical Association to provide volunteer doctors to care for sick and wounded Vietnamese civilians.
