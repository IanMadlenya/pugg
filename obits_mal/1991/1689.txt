        Richard Maltby, a composer, arranger and band leader, died on Monday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Maltby was an arranger for Artie Shaw's big band, and conducted or arranged for such recording stars as Ethel Merman, Vaughn Monroe, Peggy Lee, Vic Damone and Sarah Vaughan. He had his first hit recording with "St. Louis Blues Mambo" in 1954, the beginning of the mambo craze. Hit records of "Stardust Mambo" and the theme from "The Man With the Golden Arm" followed. Over the next decade he recorded more than a dozen singles and albums for RCA Victor, Columbia and other labels.
        He was born in 1914 in Evanston, Ill. He began playing the trumpet as a young boy, studied music at Northwestern University and toured with bands, as performer and arranger. His original composition "Six Flats Unfurnished" became a Benny Goodman hit. In 1940, he became the staff arranger and conductor for WBBM radio in Chicago, where he began an association with the orchestra leader Paul Whiteman, who brought him to New York in 1945 as staff arranger, composer and conductor at ABC. He later formed his own dance band with which he toured college campuses.
        He moved to California in 1967 and continued recording, composing and guest conducting until the early 1980's, when declining health forced him to gradually end his career.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a daughter, Marilynn Smith of New York City; a son, Richard Maltby Jr., who is a Broadway director and lyricist, and four grandchildren.
