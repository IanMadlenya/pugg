        Guy B. Johnson, a scholar of black culture and longtime advocate of improved race relations, died Thursday at his home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 90 years old.
        He died of chronic anemia, the University of North Carolina reported.
        Dr. Johnson was a former professor of sociology and anthropology at the university, where he was a member of the faculty for 45 years.
        He began studying black culture, including folk music and dialect, in the 1920's, and from demographic data he forecast the increase in black nationalism.

        In 1953, forecasting the course of desegregation, he wrote:
        "Anyone who thinks that the transition from segregation to racial coeducation can be made without problems, tensions and even personal tragedies is a fool. Anyone who thinks the transition means the end of civilization is a fool. The operation may be serious, but the patient will recover. And when he recovers and looks back over his experience, he may say, 'Well, it wasn't half as bad as I thought it would be.' "
        In the 1950's Dr. Johnson directed studies in Negro education for the Fund for the Advancement of Education. Some of his other research focused on race relations in Africa.
        He was a fellow of the Social Science Research Council and the American anthropological and sociological associations. For 37 years he was a trustee of Howard University in Washington.
        A native of Caddo Mills, Tex., Dr. Johnson graduated from Baylor University and received a master's degree from the University of Chicago and a doctorate from the University of North Carolina.
        He is survived by two sons, Benton of Eugene, Ore., and Edward of Chapel Hill, and five grandchildren.
