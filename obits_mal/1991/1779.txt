        Joseph Insalaco Sr., a builder who took part in the construction of more than 1,500 high-rise buildings, including the World Trade Center, Co-op City and the Pan Am Building, died on Tuesday at North Shore Hospital in Great Neck, L.I. He was 80 years old and lived in East Meadow, L.I.
        He died of complications of prostate cancer, said his son Anthony.
        Mr. Insalaco was a founder of the Dic Concrete Corporation in 1949 and served as vice president until his retirement in 1972. His company served as a subcontractor on scores of major projects in the metropolitan area and at one time had 5,000 employees. In the early 1940's he headed a 3,000-member labor force in Georgia that built one of the first factories for the construction of B-29 bombers.
        He is survived by his wife, Antonina, three sons, Joseph Jr., of Queens, Anthony, of Garden City, L.I., and Robert, of North Bellmore, L.I.; two brothers, Michael, of West Islip, L.I., and Salvatore, of St. Augustine, Fla.; three sisters, Mary Scarella and Margaret Porto, both of Lynbrook, L.I., and Rose De Marinis of Huntington, L.I., and nine grandchildren.
