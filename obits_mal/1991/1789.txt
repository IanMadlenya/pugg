        Graham B. Ford, founder of The New York Construction News and its publisher for 31 years, died on Monday at the Bayview Nursing Home in Beaufort, S.C. He was 87 years old and had lived in Mountain Lakes, N.J., and in Manhattan for many years.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ford, who was born in Needham, Mass., was a graduate of Dartmouth. He started the weekly newspaper, which reports on construction, real estate and related industries in the New York metropolitan area, in 1953. When he retired in 1984 the publication was acquired by Charles J. Urstadt, a former New York State Housing Commissioner, its present owner.
        His survivors include a daughter, Barbara Wickwire, of Townsend, Ga.; a son, Graham Jr., of Los Angeles; nine grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
