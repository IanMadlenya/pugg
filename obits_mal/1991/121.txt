        Nikolai V. Talyzin, who helped introduce President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of economic restructuring in the mid-1980's, died on Wednesday, Tass, the official press agency, said on Thursday. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Talyzin was picked by Mr. Gorbachev in October 1985 to help start the program of economic change known as perestroika after serving five years as the Soviet representative at Comecon, the Eastern European trade bloc.
        He was appointed head of the State Planning Commission, or Gosplan, at a time when central control of almost every sector of the Soviet economy was still firmly in place. At the same time he became one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers and a nonvoting member of the Communist Party Politburo.
        But as Mr. Gorbachev pressed his goal of switching to a market economy, the planning commission's task shifted in 1987 from setting production targets to mapping out economic strategy. Mr. Talyzin came under strong criticism, and was moved to the post of head of the Bureau for Social Development in 1988. Blamed for Slowing Reforms
        In September 1989, with perestroika still failing to produce the promised results, he was dismissed along with many other conservatives in the Government whom Mr. Gorbachev blamed for slowing the pace of reforms.
        An obituary signed by Mr. Gorbachev paid tribute to Mr. Talyzin's contribution to developing communications in the Soviet Union and enhancing its defense capabilities, Tass said.
        Mr. Talyzin, an engineer and communications specialist, was sent to Afghanistan before the Soviet military intervened there in 1979, and Western analysts assume that he organized military communications there. He had previously served as Communications Minister.
