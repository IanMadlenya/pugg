        Jean Mantelet, the French industrialist who built Moulinex, one of France's most successful household appliance companies, out of a potato masher, saying he was freeing women from cooking chores, died at his home here on Saturday, a company spokesman said today.
        He was 90 years old and had been ill for several years, the spokesman said. He had retired as company chairman a month ago.
        Mr. Mantelet became famous in France 58 years ago when he invented a machine to help his wife mash potatoes.
        He went on to found Moulinex, which coined the slogan "Moulinex frees women" and developed a range of electrical appliances to grind, chop, mince and slice. It also produces hair dryers and vacuum cleaners. The company, which has 12,000 employees, two-thirds of them woman, claims sales of more than $1 billion a year.
