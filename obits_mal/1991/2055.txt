        Alan A. Harper, a television producer who was the arts editor of "CBS News Sunday Morning," the weekly 90-minute newsmagazine program, since its inception in 1979, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital, a spokeswoman for the program said. He was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lung cancer, said the spokeswoman, Jill Bernstein.
        Mr. Harper, who had studied at the Yale University School of Drama and at the New School, played a major role in the arts coverage of the program, which Ms. Bernstein said reaches 5 million viewers. A typical program includes a segment of perhaps 10 minutes on one subject in the world of the arts, but such segments are sometimes considerably longer.
        The program's executive producer, Linda S. Mason, said that though Mr. Harper's cancer was diagnosed in January he kept working until early this month. The last segment that he produced was about the exhibition of works by the 19th-century French neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat at the Metropolitan Museum.
        His work ranged widely among the arts and included accompanying the Russian-born ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev on a trip back to his homeland to perform there.
        Mr. Harper was born and reared in Manhattan and worked in the OffBroadway theater before joining CBS in 1958. He began working for CBS News in 1967 and was a writer and producer on religion programs before he joined "Sunday Morning" as a producer and the arts editor.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Alicia CastroLeal, and two sons, Philip C. and Harold C.
