        Andre Baruch, a radio and television announcer whose career spanned almost 60 years, died on Sunday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 83 years old.
        He died of natural causes, said his son, Wayne Baruch.
        In the 1930's, Mr. Baruch's voice was the familiar signature on countless radio series, including "The Shadow," "The Kate Smith Hour" and "Your Hit Parade," for which he was the announcer throughout its 25 years on the air. During World War II, he was a founder of the Armed Forces Radio Network. He was discharged from the Army as a major.
        Before the war and throughout the 1950's, he was the voice of Pathe News newsreels.
        While working on Kate Smith's show, he met his wife, the singer Bea Wain. They were married in 1938. In 1945, the Baruchs began a husband-and-wife disk jockey show, "Mr. and Mrs. Music," on WMCA Radio in New York City. They continued to work in radio together periodically over the next 40 years.
        In 1954, Mr. Baruch was hired to do play-by-play coverage of the Brooklyn Dodgers alongside Vin Scully. When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, Mr. Baruch remained in New York.
        In 1971, theBaruchs moved to Palm Beach, Fla., where they did a daily radio talk show for eight years.
        Mr. Baruch was born in Paris and came to the United States as a teenager. He was one of the original staff announcers for the CBS Radio Network.
        He was founding member of the American Federation of Television andRadio Artists, and in 1979 he was inducted into the National Broadcasters Hall of Fame.
        In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by a daughter, Bonnie Antosz, of Los Angeles; a sister Yvette Davison, of Tamarac, Fla., and two grandchildren.
