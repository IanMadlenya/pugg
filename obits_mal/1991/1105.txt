        Warner Lee Wells Jr., a surgeon who translated and edited "Hiroshima Diary," an eyewitness account of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima that became a best seller, died Monday after a stroke. He was 77 years old.
        Dr. Wells, who had served as a consultant to the United States Surgeon General, went overseas in 1950 to work as a consultant to the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission in Japan.
        There he met Dr. Michinika Hachiya, a Japanese doctor who had kept a diary about the Hiroshima bombing, in August 1945, and its aftermath. Dr. Wells translated the journal into English and edited it as "Hiroshima Diary," which was released in 1955 and became a best seller.
        Dr, Wells was a professor of surgery at the University of North Carolina Medical School.
        He is survived by his wife, Rebecca; four daughters, a son, a brother, six granchildren and a great-grandchild.
