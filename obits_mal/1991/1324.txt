        Coleman Parsons, professor emeritus of English at City College of New York, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 years old.
        He suffered a stroke last year and had been in declining health since then, his family said.
        Dr. Parsons, an authority on the works of Sir Walter Scott, joined the City College faculty as a part-time instructor in 1937 and began teaching there full time in 1947. He had previously taught at Long Island University, Vassar and American University.
        He was born in Ripley, Va., was a graduate of Columbia College and held a doctorate from Yale. He was the author of "Witchcraft and Demonology in Scott's Fiction," published in 1964, and wrote extensively for academic journals in the United States, Scotland, England and Germany.
        He is survived by a daughter, Eleanore, of Los Angeles, and a brother, William, of Maui, Hawaii.
