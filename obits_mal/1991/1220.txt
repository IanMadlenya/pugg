        Herbert B. Woodman, retired chairman of the Inmont Corporation, once one of the world's largest manufacturers of printing inks, died on Monday at his home in West Arlington, Vt. He was 87 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his niece, Jean B. Angell, a Manhattan lawyer, said.
        Mr. Woodman joined Inmont, formerly the Interchemical Corporation, in 1936 and was chairman and chief executive officer when he retired in 1978. Inmont has since been bought by BASF A.G., which has its headquarters in Ludwigshafen, Germany, and North American offices in Parsippany, N.J. The BASF Corporation manufactures a broad range of chemical products.
        A Manhattan resident for 50 years, Mr. Woodman was a former chairman of the New York Urban Coalition and the Greater New York Fund. He also headed the board of managers of the Vocational Service Center of the Young Men's Christian Association of Greater New York.
        He was an officer and director of the New York chapter of the Arthritis Foundation and of the James Weldon Johnson Community Center in East Harlem. And he was president of the Economic Club of New York from 1959 to 1961 and of the University Club of New York from 1970 to 1973.
        Mr. Woodman was born in Cheyenne, Wyo., and graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1925. He attended Harvard Law School from 1925 to 1927 and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, where he received a degree in jurisprudence in 1929. Before joining Inmont, he was an associate at the law firm of what is now Cravath, Swaine & Moore from 1929 to 1935.
        After his retirement, Mr. Woodman was active in Arlington civic affairs. He was a director of Arlington Townscape, a group dedicated to beautifying the local area, and also a director of the Bennington Museum.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jean Maw; a daughter, Sarah W. Stopford of London, and two grandchildren.
