        Mr. Follari also performed with the Brooklyn Philharmonic and the orchestras of the New York City Ballet, the Metropolitan Opera, the American Ballet Theater and the New Jersey State Opera.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan, a daughter, Lissanna, and a son, Mickey, all of Park Ridge; a brother, Pino, of Cannobio, Italy, and two sisters, Maria Butera and Nunzia Liga, both of Castel D'Accia.
