        Richard J. Flamson 3d, who led the Security Pacific Corporation during its aggressive expansion as one of the nation's largest banking companies, died on Thursday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 62 years old and lived in Corona Del Mar, Calif.
        Mr. Flamson died of leukemia, his family said.
        Security Pacific's assets quadrupled and its rank rose from 11th to fifth nationally during the 12 years Mr. Flamson served as chief executive. During that period he also held the titles of president and chairman. He resigned as chief executive last year but remained a board member and executive committee chairman.
        This year, hurt by some bad loans, the company agreed to a $4.7 billion purchase by the BankAmerica Corporation in a merger that will form the nation's second largest bank. Security Pacific reported a $508 million loss in the third quarter and reserved $1.2 billion for troubled loans.
        He began his 36-year career at Security Pacific as a repossessor of automobiles. A native of Los Angeles, he graduated from Claremont McKenna College and the Pacific Coast Banking School at the University of Washington in Seattle. He served in the United States Army in Korea.
        He is survived by his wife, Arden, and four children, Leslie Flamson Moore, Scott A. and Michael J., all of Newport Beach, and Richard J. 4th, of Mammoth, Calif.
