        Graham W. Irwin, a historian of Africa who directed Columbia University's African Institute from 1974 to 1983, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 71 years old.
        He died of stomach cancer, a university spokeswoman, Suzanne Trimel, said.
        He joined Columbia in 1963 and was vice dean of its School of International and Public Affairs from 1983 to 1988, when he became professor emeritus.
        He was born in Australia and earned bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees at Cambridge University. He wrote two books on Africans outside Africa and was a co-editor of the "Harper Encyclopedia of the Modern World" (1970).
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Nora Bayly.
