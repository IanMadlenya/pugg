        Miodrag Bulatovic, a Yugoslav novelist whose books were known for their graphic portrayals of sex, violence and decay and for their black humor, died on Thursday. He was 68 years old.
        The official Tanyug news agency said that Mr. Bulatovic, whose work has been extensively translated in the West, died of a heart attack in Igalo, a Montenegrin spa.
        His novel "Hero on a Donkey" was set in an Italian Army camp in Montenegro during World War II. Other books include "The Red Cock Flies to Heaven," "The Devils Are Coming" and his most famous novel, "The Four-Fingered People," which was about violence and intrigue among emigres.
        He was known for his fierce Serbian nationalism, which earned him the enmity of other ethnic groups in Yugoslavia, and he was an official of Serbia's Socialist Party.
