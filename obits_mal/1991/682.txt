        Robert Elliott Scher, a lawyer who specialized in labor and health law, died on Friday at Delray Community Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 64 years old and had moved to Boynton Beach, Fla., in October from Rockville Centre, L.I.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, the former Judith Bleden.
        Mr. Scher was a partner in Raphael, Searles, Vischi, Scher, Glover & D'Elia, a Manhattan law firm, from 1962 to 1977, when the firm was dissolved. He set up his own practice, which included representing the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and Brookdale Hospital, both in Brooklyn. He retired in October 1990.
        He was a graduate of Harvard College and New York University School of Law, and was a trustee and past president of the Rockville Centre Library Board and a trustee at Kingsbrook.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Andrew, of Santa Monica, Calif., Peter, of Manhattan, and Matthew, of Annapolis, Md.; and a sister, Arlene, of Manhattan.
