        William Wright Bryan, former editor of The Atlanta Journal and The Cleveland Plain Dealer, who earlier broadcast an eyewitness account of D-Day as a World War II correspondent, died of pneumonia Wednesday at the Clemson Area Retirement Community. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Bryan was editor of The Atlanta Journal from 1946 to 1954. On June 6, 1944, he covered the invasion of France from a plane that dropped airborne troops. When the plane returned to London, Mr. Bryan, who was also a part-time correspondent for NBC, went on the air.
        While covering the Allies' further advance across Europe, Mr. Bryan was wounded and captured by the Germans. He spent six months in hospitals and in a prisoner of war camp in Szubin, Poland, before he was freed by Soviet troops in January 1945.
        After the war, he was named editor of The Journal.
        He was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1953. In 1954 he left The Journal for The Plain Dealer, where he was editor from 1954 to 1963. For the next seven years he was vice president for development of Clemson University, his alma mater.
        His is survived by his wife, Helen Hillyer Newell Bryan; a son, William Jr. of Atlanta; two daughters, Newell Tozzer of Atlanta and Mary Lane Sullivan of Cleveland Heights, Ohio; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
