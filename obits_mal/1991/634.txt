        Jack Davis, Canada's first Minister of the Environment, died of cancer on Wednesday. He was 74 years old.
        Elected to Parliament as a Liberal in 1962, he held the portfolios of Energy, Fisheries and Transport and was parliamentary secretary to Prime Minister Lester Pearson in the 1960's.
        Mr. Davis, an engineer and economist, was later elected to the British Columbia legislature in 1975 as a member of the Social Credit Party. He resigned in 1978 but was re-elected in 1979 and held the seat until his death. At the time of his death, he was the province's energy minister.
