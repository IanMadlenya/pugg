        William G. Vorhaus Jr., a retired business executive, died Thursday at his home in Burke, Va. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Vorhaus died of cancer, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, he was a graduate of New York University and the University of Virginia Law School. As a bombardier-navigator in World War II, he was shot down and imprisoned in Hungary.
        He joined a family law firm in Manhattan in the late 1940's, then for most of the next decade worked for the Navy in the general counsel's office in Manhattan and the Naval Research Special Devices Center in Port Washington. He held four business posts in California, starting in 1959 as a contract negotiator for the Hughes Aircraft Company in Pacific Palisades. In 1962 he became vice president of Wyle Laboratories, an electronics and aerospace company in El Segundo. In 1971 he became vice president of Compucorp, a desktop calculator and computer company in Los Angeles.
        He returned to Hughes in 1976 as business manager of overseas operations. In 1979 he moved to Virginia and became deputy general manager of HBH, a Hughes joint venture. He retired in 1989.
        Mr. Vorhaus is survived by his wife, Catharine; three sons, Steven of Lyons, Colo., Michael of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Richard of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a daughter, Katharine of Boulder, Colo., three granddaughters and a brother, Larry of Bala Cynwyd, Penn.
