        Joseph Vincenzo Spagna, a lawyer who was New York City's commissioner of purchasing in the 1950's, died on Dec. 26 at Peninsula Hospital Center in Queens. He was 86 years old and lived in North Woodmere, L.I.
        He died of cardiac arrest, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Spagna was appointed to the purchasing job by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in January 1954. He resigned from the $20,000-a-year post in August 1960 after the State Investigation Commission accused him of manipulation of contract procedures and favoritism in awarding a longtime friend a contract for rock salt used to clear ice from city streets.
        No charges were ever filed, and Mr. Spagna denied any wrongdoing. The commissioner who replaced him, Roger J. Brown, called him "a victim of a series of unfortunate circumstances."
        Before his city service, Mr. Spagna, a 1926 graduate of Fordham University Law School, worked for the National Recovery Administration and for the Public Works Administration.
        After he resigned from his city post, he returned to the practice of law in Brooklyn and helped run the family real-estate business there. He retired from active practice in 1980.
        Mr. Spagna was a founder of the Columbus Citizens Committee in Manhattan and was active in two other Italian-American groups, the Brooklyn Columbian Lawyers Association and the Italian Board of Guardians.
        He is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Margherita Bono; two daughters, Dolores Caruso of North Woodmere and Margaret Bamonte, a retired teacher, of Lawrenceville, N.J.; a son, Joseph Jr., head of a sanitation company in North Valley Stream, L.I.; a brother, Arthur, of Brooklyn; a sister, Virginia Amen, also of Brooklyn; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
