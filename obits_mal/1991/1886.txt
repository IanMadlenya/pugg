        George Ashley, an arts administrator who worked with many of the leading figures of the New York avant-garde performance world, died on Monday at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 66 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Rosemary Quinn of Performing Artservices, an arts management organization he joined 13 years ago.

        Before joining Artservices, where he was responsible for publicity for all the clients, he was an administrator of Robert Wilson's Byrd Hoffman Foundation for seven years, including one year as its president. During that period, he was also a dancer and actor in all of Mr. Wilson's productions. As a tour manager, he led Mr. Wilson's troupe on five tours to South America, Europe and the Middle East.
        From 1961-69 he was secretary and treasurer of the Bread and Puppet Theater, in which he also performed as a puppeteer.
        He was in the Army in 1944-45 and was imprisoned by the Germans.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne, and his son, David, both of Brighton, Mass., and by a brother and sister.
