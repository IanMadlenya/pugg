        Leonard A. Harper, vice president and dean of Westchester Community College, died on Sunday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, apparently of a heart attack. He was 70 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson.
        As the college's vice president, Mr. Harper was director of the Educational Opportunities Center of Westchester in Yonkers for 19 years. Before that, he was assistant principal at Ossining High School and a teacher at Plainedge High School on Long Island.
        From 1955 to 1957, he was with the Tuskegee-Indonesia Project, a State Department program. From 1946 to 1950, he collaborated in writing five books for the Training Thru Sight Association.
        He was chairman of the Yonkers Y.W.C.A. and the Rockland County Psychiatric Center and vice president of Harlem Interfaith Counseling Services.
        Surviving are his wife, Lovette; a daughter, Radiah Amy H. Sumler of Croton; a son, Peter, of New York, and three grandchildren.
