        Lawrence Ronald Jacobs, an architect and the design principal for several corporate buildings in New York City, died on Thursday at New York University Hospital. He was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Jacobs died of AIDS, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Jacobs was a founding partner of the Manhattan architectural firm Jacobs-Nicolaides Architects PC, which designed the group and health division headquarters of the Equitable Life Assurance Society in Manhattan. He was also a designer of the City University of New York's graduate center, the St. John's University Law School and the Bank of Tokyo Trust Company in the Waldorf-Astoria. His firm has designed buildings ranging from a pizza restaurant chain prototype in Manhattan to suburban homes in Westchester County, New Jersey and on Long Island.
        Born in Detroit, Mr. Jacobs majored in architecture at the University of Michigan and received his master's degree from Yale.
        After working as a designer in several New York architectural companies, he began his own firm in 1977. He received a Architecture Record House award in 1977 for the Leito residence in Bedford, N.Y., a wood-frame shingled home nestled in the woods.
        Mr. Jacobs's companion, Herbert Greene, a former vice president of the advertising company McCann Erickson Worldwide, died in January.
        Mr. Jacobs is survived by an aunt, Beryl Winkelman, a cousin, Harriet Winkelman, and a half-sister, Janet Jacobs, all of Detroit.
