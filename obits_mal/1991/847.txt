        Jean-Baptiste Cerrone, who managed several major dance companies from the 1930's through the 80's, died on Wednesday at North Broward Hospital in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 79 years old and lived in Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Nice, France.
        Mr. Cerrone was known to generations of dancers in Europe and the United States as a consummate professional with an unusual understanding of the needs of both management and performers, particularly in organizing long tours.
        He began his career in 1936 as the property man and assistant stage manager of Rene Blum's Ballets de Monte Carlo. He was general manager of the Ballet Russe of Monte Carlo from 1938 to 1954 and of American Ballet Theater from 1954 to 1959.
        That year Jerome Robbins invited him to become general manager of Ballets: U.S.A. He returned to Ballet Theater in 1962 and went on to manage the Joffrey Ballet two years later. Mr. Cerrone helped to form the Harkness Ballet in 1964 and was its general manager for 11 years.
        From 1975 to 1980, he managed the Music Box Theater on Broadway. He also worked with the Maryland Ballet and with Princess Grace of Monaco in an attempt to found a ballet company there. He was general manager of the Houston Ballet from 1980 to 1987, when he became managing director of the Harid Conservatory for dance and music in Boca Raton, Fla., a post he held at his death.
        Mr. Cerrone won the Dance Magazine Award in 1983 and was named a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Government the following year.
        He is survived by his wife, Yvette; two sons, John and Larry, of New York City, and a sister, Emelie Montanera, of Monte Carlo.
