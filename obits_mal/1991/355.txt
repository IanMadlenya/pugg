        The Rev. Dr. Howard E. Spragg, former executive vice president of the board for homeland missions of the United Church of Christ, died yesterday at his home in Deering, N.H. He was 73 years old.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Spragg, who was a leader in the formation of the United Church of Christ, was ordained in the Congregational and Christian Churches in 1942 after graduating from Tufts University and after serving a year in prison for refusing to register for the draft in 1939.
        He was pastor of the South Congregational Church in Chicago and earned a Doctor of Divinity degree at Chicago Theological Seminary in 1947. He was director of Puerto Rico missions for the Congregational and Christian Church from 1948 to 1952 and later was named general secretary for administration for the board of home missions.
        From 1959 to 1969, he was first treasurer and then executive vice president. He retired in 1983. He was also on the board of the National Council of Churches.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; three daughters, Susan, Martha and Deborah; and two sons, Peter and Paul.
