        Harry T. Marks, retired chairman and chief executive officer of the Ferro Corporation of Cleveland, a large manufacturer of industrial materials, died Wednesday at Lakewood Hospital in Lakewood, Ohio. He was 83 years old.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Marks was born in Canada and went to school in England. He began working for a Canadian subsidiary of Ferro in 1933, and spent the next 43 years with the company.
        Mr. Marks managed the company's operations in Brazil and Argentina, and in 1939 was named manager of its international division. He served in several other positions before becoming president in 1958 and chief executive officer about two years later, said his son, Dr. Kenneth E. Marks. He retired in 1976.
        Mr. Marks, who lived in Rocky River, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, was a trustee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, the Cleveland Zoological Society, the Cleveland Playhouse, the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs.
        He is survived by his wife, Marcelle; two sons, Ronald of Atlanta, and Kenneth of Pepper Pike, Ohio; two sisters, Kathleen and Patricia Marks Blyth, both of England; a brother, Erik, also of England; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
