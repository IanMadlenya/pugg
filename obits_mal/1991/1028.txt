        Joseph J. Maraziti, a former United States Representative who gained national recognition as a staunch defender of President Richard M. Nixon during the Watergate investigation in Congress, died on Monday at St. Clare's-Riverside Hospital in Boonton, N.J. He was 78 years old and lived in Boonton.
        He died of a stroke, his son Joseph Jr. said.
        Mr. Maraziti, a Republican, had spent 15 years in the New Jersey Legislature. He was a freshman Representative from the 13th Congressional District when, as a member of the House Judiciary Committee, he voted consistently against impeaching Mr. Nixon. That support, and President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent pardon of Mr. Nixon, were widely regarded as responsible for Mr. Maraziti's defeat by Helen S. Meyner, a Democrat, in the 1974 election.
        Mr. Maraziti then returned to his law practice. Several later attempts to revive his political career were unsuccessful.
        A graduate of Fordham University Law School, Mr. Maraziti served in the New Jersey Assembly for 10 years and then in the State Senate for five years before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1972. He had also been an assistant Morris County prosecutor, a magistrate in Boonton and an adviser to the Morris County Board of Freeholders.
        He is survived by his wife, Eileen; two sons, Joseph Jr., of Chatham Township, N.J., and Charles, of Boonton Township, N.J.; five daughters, Mary Ellen Baldwin of Boonton, Margaret Patterson of Manasquan, N.J., Maria Wilhelm of Cranston, R.I., Catherine Bennett of Warwick, N.Y., and Eileen Wren of Long Valley, N.J.; three sisters, Rose and Amalia Maraziti, both of Boonton, and Inez Meola of Morris Plains, N.J., and 16 grandchildren.
