        Pio Cabanillas Gallas, a conservative member of the European Parliament and a Cabinet minister during Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy, died on Thursday of a heart attack. He was 67 years old.
        Mr. Cabanillas, a lawyer, helped write the press law of 1966, abolishing censorship. He also served as Minister of Information and Tourism and was a member of the Council of the Realm, Franco's highest advisory body.
        Mr. Cabanillas continued his political career in various ministerial posts after Franco died in 1975, and later joined the opposition Popular Party, serving as a deputy in the European Parliament.
