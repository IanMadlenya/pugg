        Ellis P. Steinberg, a former research director of the Argonne National Laboratory's chemistry division, died Sunday at Bernard Mitchell Hospital in Chicago. He was 71 years old and lived in Park Forest, Ill.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, his wife, Esther, said.
        Dr. Steinberg directed Argonne's chemistry division from 1982 to 1988. After retiring, he remained active in educational programs at the laboratory, which is in Lemont, Ill., and worked to stimulate interest in science among students in the Chicago area, said James Gindler, who was assistant director of the chemistry division.
        Much of Dr. Steinberg's work focused on the physics of nuclear fission. He studied fission reactions from 1943 to 1946 at the University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory, the secret World War II project in which Enrico Fermi, Arthur Compton and other physicists produced the first controlled nuclear chain reaction at the University of Chicago in 1942.
        After receiving his doctoral degree from the University of Chicago in 1947, Dr. Steinberg returned to the metallurgical laboratory, which had become the Argonne National Laboratory.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Dr. David Steinberg of Fiddletown, Calif., and two daughters, Sheri Steinberg of Chicago and Deborah Steinberg of Madison, Wis.
