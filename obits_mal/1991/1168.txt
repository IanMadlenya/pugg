        James B. Lile, a knifesmith whose customers included Presidents and movie stars, died of a heart attack Sunday at his home here. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Lile created the knife wielded by Sylvester Stallone in the first two "Rambo" movies. Other owners of Lile knives included Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan, King Carl Gustav IV of Sweden and the actors John Wayne and Fess Parker.
        Mr. Lile's patented Lile-lock knife is on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
