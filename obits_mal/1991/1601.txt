        Mr. Hershaft died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        A native of Austria, he came to this country at the age of 14. At 15, he began working with the Meyer Labels Company in Manhattan. Three years later he joined the Jackmeyer Label Company, now known as Paxar Corporation, which is based in Pearl River, N.Y. He rose to become chairman and remained in the post until his resignation in 1987, then acted as a consultant until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Scharfstein; a son, Arthur, of Greenwich, Conn.; two brothers, Fred, of Bronxville, N.Y., and Philip, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
