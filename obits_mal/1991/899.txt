        David Meyers, the founder of the Meyers Brothers Parking System Inc., which once operated more than 200 garages and parking lots in the United States, Britain and Puerto Rico, died on Saturday at Hollywood Hospital in Florida. He was 85 years old and lived in Hollywood.
        He died of a stroke, a son said.
        Mr. Meyers was one of six brothers in the parking lot business. He started the company in Newark in the early 1920's, and saw it grow into one of the largest in the Northeast, providing parking for more than 25 million cars a year by the 1960's. Mr. Meyers was a pioneer in off-street parking and multistory parking garages. In 1964, the company was sold to the Hertz Corporation.
        He contributed to many organizations, including the Jewish Community Center in Providence, R.I., and the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        He is survived by his wife, Anna; four sons, Charles, of Providence, William, of Manhattan, Leonard, of Fairfield, Conn., and Victor, of Hudson, N.Y.; two brothers, Irving, of Hollywood, Fla., and Louis, of West Palm Beach., Fla.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
