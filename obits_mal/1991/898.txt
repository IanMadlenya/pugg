        Daniel R. Ginsberg, a lawyer and real-estate developer, died on Saturday in a glider accident in Wurtsboro, N.Y. He was 41 years old and lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        Mr. Ginsberg was an experienced glider pilot, his family said. He was the son of the late Morris Ginsberg, a shipping executive who bought the Exodus and other vessels that carried 33,000 Holocaust survivors from Europe to Israel in the late 1940's.
        Mr. Ginsberg, who held dual American and Israeli citizenship, fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur war against Israel's Arab neighbors.
        He was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Brandeis University and the Boston University Law School.
        He was a member of the Manhattan law firm of McLaughlin, Stern, Ballen & Ballen and was president of the Mansfield Capital Corporation, an investment firm.
        Mr. Ginsberg was national commissioner of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and a member of the New York Holocaust Memorial Commission.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Karyn Rapoport; a daughter, Jessica, of Greenwich, and a sister, Susan Snider of Brookline, Mass.
