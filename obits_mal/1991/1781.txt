        Richard C. Hess, a prize-winning graphic designer, illustrator and painter who began his career by creating pictures for the paint-by-the-numbers kits in the 1950's, died Monday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. He was 57 years old and lived in Norfolk, Conn.
        He died of complications from septic shock syndrome, his son Mark said.
        Mr. Hess designed magazine, corporate and packaging graphics for many corporations, including the American Broadcasting Company and Xerox. His illustrations appeared on the covers of Time, TV Guide, New York and Esquire magazines. For Esquire's June 1967 issue he created a partly filled-in paint-by-the-numbers drawing of President Lyndon B. Johnson.
        He was 18 years old when he was hired by the Palmer Paint Company, which specialized in children's coloring books, to work on mass producing the paint-by-the-numbers drawing kits.
        Mr. Hess worked as an art director at advertising agencies including J. Walter Thompson, N. W. Ayer and Benton & Bowles. In 1965 he founded his own design studio.
        He made posters for the New York City Opera and the television sports series "The Way It Was." Exhibitions of his work have been held in Paris, Venice, Milan, Italy and Detroit, and his paintings are in the permanent collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art.
        A founding member of the Illustrators Guild, Mr. Hess was active in many art and design professional groups. Elected to the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame this year, he will be inducted posthumously in the fall.
        In addition to his son, of Katonah, N.Y., he is survived by another son, Adam, and a daughter, Sarah, both of Norfolk; his parents, Evelyn and Cletus Hess, of Ortonvile, Mich; two sisters, Jacqueline Nowicki, of Ortonville, and Patricia Massey, of Seattle, and three grandchldren.
