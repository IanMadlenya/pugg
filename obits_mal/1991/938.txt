        Jim Forsberg, a printmaker and painter, died on April 7 at his home in Provincetown, Mass. He was 71 years old.
        The cause of death was chronic obstructive lung disease, his daughter said.
        Mr. Forsberg's recent collage-paintings, exhibited ealier this year at the Stuart Levy Gallery in Manhattan, are expressive and lyrical works in which scraps of paper and color climb through or remain suspended in space in ways that suggest the gestures and energy of Abstract Expressionism.
        In the 1950's, Mr. Forsberg, a student of the famous Abstract teacher Hans Hofmann, was affiliated with the Printmakers, an influential printmaking group. He exhibited with them at the Museum of Modern Art, as well as in Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Brazil and Germany.
        His prints are in the collections of the Modern, the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Va., and in the Museum of Modern Art in Sao Paulo.
        He moved from New York to Provincetown in 1954 and was one of the founders of the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center. In 1986 he had a retrospective exhibition at the Provincetown Art Association and Museum.
        He is survived by his daughter, Carol, of Cambridge, Mass., his son, Stephen, of Provincetown, his ex-wife, Joan Wye, of Vinalhaven, Me., and his longtime companion, Diane Ray.
