        The Rev. Lowell P. Beveridge, a choral conductor, organist and teacher who was on the music faculty of Columbia University for 22 years, died on Tuesday at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 86 years old.
        The cause of death was not known, but he died suddenly, his son, Thomas, said.
        Dr. Beveridge was born in Dorchester, Mass., on Sept. 19, 1905, and studied conducting with Archibald I. Davidson and Sir Malcolm Sargent. After completing a Ph.D. in musicology at Harvard, he became a professor of music at Columbia University. He taught there from 1930 until 1952 and at the Union Theological Seminary starting in 1944. During those years, he conducted the Columbia Glee Club and Chapel Choir, the Barnard Glee Club and the Greenwich (Conn.) Choral Society.
        In 1951, Dr. Beveridge took a leave of absence from Columbia for studies at the Virginia Theological Seminary, in Alexandria. During that year, he decided to become an Episcopal priest, and after his ordination in 1952, he joined the faculty of the Virginia Theological Seminary, where he taught speech and music until his retirement in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, Ida Gatrell Beveridge; two sons, Lowell Jr., of Brooklyn, and Thomas, of Potomac, Md.; a brother, Lyford, of Rockland, Me., and a grandson, Jesse T. Beveridge, of New York.
