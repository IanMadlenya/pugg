        Gottfried E. Noether, the chairman of the department of statistics at the University of Connecticut, died on Thursday at Windham Community Memorial Hospital in Windham, Conn. He was 76 years old and lived in Storrs, Conn.
        Dr. Noether died of complications from prostate cancer, his wife, Emiliana, said.
        The chairman of the statistics department for 14 years, Dr. Noether was an authority on non-parametric statistics, a method of performing calculations using small, random samples.
        Born in Karlsruhe, Germany, Dr. Noether came to the United States in 1939. He earned a bachelor's degree at Ohio State University in 1940 and a master's degree at the University of Illinois in 1941. After serving in the Army in Europe in World War II, he earned a doctorate from Columbia University in 1949.
        Before joining the faculty at the University of Connecticut in 1968, Dr. Noether taught at New York University and Boston University. He served on the statistical advisory committee for the Federal Office of Management and Budget from 1973 to 1976 and was associate editor of The American Statistician from 1976 to 1980. He also was the author of six books, including "Introduction to Statistics: The Non-Parametric Way."
        Besides his wife, a retired history professor at the University of Connecticut, Dr. Noether is survived by a daughter, Monica, of Medford, Mass., and two grandchildren.
