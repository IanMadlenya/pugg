        Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma, one of the last of the former maharajas from pre-independence India, died today in his former kingdom in the southern state of Kerala. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Varma, who ascended the throne of the old princely state of Travancore at the age of 12 in 1924, died of complications from a stroke in a hospital in the state capital, Trivandrum, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
        During his reign, which ended in 1947 with India's independence from Britain, he introduced sweeping political and social reforms in his ancient kingdom, which had grown prosperous over centuries of spice trade with the West.
        He was most known for his epochal Temple Entry Proclamation allowing low-caste people and untouchables to worship in Hindu temples. The proclamation, issued in 1936, electrified the country. Jubilant untouchables went by the thousands in ceremonial processions to worship in temples.
        After independence, Mr. Varma became Governor of the new Indian state of Kerala, an office he held until 1956.
        He became an ordinary citizen in 1972 when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi stripped all of India's former maharajas and princely rulers of their titles and privileges.
