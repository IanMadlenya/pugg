        Roy R. Dince, a deputy Controller of the Currency in the Carter Administration and retired professor of banking and finance at the University of Georgia, died last Thursday at his home in Athens, Ga. He was 66 years old and lived in Athens.
        His family said he died of Lou Gehrig's disease.
        Professor Dince, a native of New York City, joined the university's business faculty in 1953 and was head of the department of banking and finance for 10 years, starting in 1965. He served in the post at the Department of the Treasury in Washington from 1976 to 1980, then returned to the University of Georgia until his retirement three years ago. Over the years, he testified at many trials as an expert witness in his field and conducted seminars in Greece, Mexico, Italy, Venezuela and Britain.
        He was a collector of prints and American Indian artifacts. He bequeathed the bulk of his print collection to Cornell University, his alma mater.
        Professor Dince is survived by his wife, the former Mimi Konvitz; a daughter, Anna D. Crosby, also of Athens, and a granddaughter.
        Correction:  January 2, 1992, Thursday
        An obituary on Tuesday about a former deputy Controller of the Currency and retired professor at the University of Georgia misstated his name. He was Robert C. Dince, not Roy.
