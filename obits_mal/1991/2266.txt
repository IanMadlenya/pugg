        Angel Fernandez, Minister of Justice in Cuba's first revolutionary Government and a former Supreme Court Justice in Havana, died Tuesday in Mercy Hospital in Miami. He was 75 years old and lived in Coral Gables, Fla.
        Mr. Fernandez died of a heart attack after suffering complications from an automobile accident four years ago, family members said.
        On Jan. 3, 1959, after the successful rebellion against the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, Provisional President Manuel Urrutia appointed Dr. Fernandez as Minister of Justice and named Fidel Castro as head of the armed forces. Dr. Fernandez, a former district attorney in Santiago, had been an outspoken critic of the Batista dictatorship.
        When Mr. Castro assumed the post of Prime Minister scarcely a month later, Dr. Fernandez resigned from the Cabinet and was appointed to the Supreme Court. Early in 1961, he and several other justices resigned, accusing the Castro Government of corruption and dictatoral practices.
        In May 1961, Dr. Fernandez fled to the United States to join his two sons, who had fled six months earlier. He taught law and Latin American history at Fairfield University in Connecticut for about 10 years. He became an American citizen in the late 1960's.
        In 1978, he and his sons set up a real estate business in Miami.
        He is survived by his wife, Mercedes; two sons, Angel Jr. and Federico; a sister, Georgina, all of Coral Gables; a brother, Rafael of Miami; and four grandchildren.
