        John Musilli, a producer and director of television documentaries, died on Saturday at his home in Kinnelon, N.J. He was 55 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Linda.
        Mr. Musilli was the executive producer of "In Performance at the White House," the Public Broadcasting Service series of live concerts for which President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, and later President Bush and his wife, Barbara, served as hosts.
        In 1970, Mr. Musilli joined the production team for "Camera Three," WCBS-TV's weekly series of documentaries on the arts. He later became the show's executive producer. His films on the Pompidou Center in Paris won a Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting in 1977, and two years later won an Emmy.
        When CBS canceled the program in 1979, Mr. Musilli and his partner, Stephan Chodorov, founded Camera Three Productions and the series moved to public television. Among their productions were "Mario Lanza, the American Caruso" and "Rodgers and Hammerstein, the Sound of American Music," along with portraits of Irving Berlin, Philip Johnson and Frank Sinatra.
        Mr. Musilli was born in Haledon, N.J., and received a master's degree in communications from Boston University. In 1958 he joined CBS Television, where he produced and directed programs in the news, sports and cultural affairs departments. He was also a senior producer of drama for CBS Cable, for which his credits include a television version of Athol Fugard's play "Sizwe Banzi Is Dead" and "The Resurrection of Lady Lester," based on the life of the jazz saxophonist Lester Young.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Paul, and a sister, Marion Miller of Forked River, N.J.
