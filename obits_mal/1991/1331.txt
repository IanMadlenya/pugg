        He was a graduate of Long Island University and was a founder and past president of the International Societies of Cosmetics Chemists. He was also a member of the New York Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, three daughters, Patricia Toglia of West Caldwell, N.J., Kathleen Lawrence of Caldwell, and Carol Sylvia of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; four brothers, three sisters and seven grandchildren.
