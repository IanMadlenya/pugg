        Jerry Davis, a writer and producer of "The Odd Couple" and other television series, died last Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 73 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.
        He died of complications from a stroke, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Davis, who was born in Manhattan, wrote or produced such long-running comedy series as "Bewitched," "That Girl" and "House Calls" and the adventure series "77 Sunset Strip" and "The Roaring Twenties." He won five Emmy nominations. He also co-wrote scripts for a dozen films, including "Kind Lady," a 1951 melodrama that starred Ethel Barrymore and Maurice Evans.
        Mr. Davis is survived by four sons: Jeffrey, a short story and television writer, Matthew, a musician, and Joshua, all of Los Angeles, and Anthony, of San Luis Obispo; a brother, Lewis, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
