        August Ihlefeld, an official of the Savings Bank Trust Company of New York from its founding in 1933 until he retired as chairman in 1965, died on Tuesday at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont in Burlington. He was 82 years old and lived in Essex Center, Vt.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ihlefeld was New York State Deputy Superintendent of Banks when he was chosen to become executive vice president of the trust company, which was created in the depth of the Depression as a depository for the state's mutual savings banks. He later became president and chairman and was also chairman of a companion organization, the Institutional Securities Corporation.
        He was born in the Bronx and studied at Cooper Union, Pace College, the Alexander Hamilton Institute and Columbia before joining the Mechanics and Metals National Bank in 1919. In 1926 he was named an examiner for the State Banking Department and rose to deputy superintendent in 1929.
        After he retired from the Savings Bank Trust Company, Mr. Ihelfeld served as a trustee of the Union Dime Savings Bank. A longtime resident of New Rochelle and Bronxville, N.Y., he moved to Vermont in 1982.
        Mr. Ihlefeld's wife, the former Mary Ellen Harvey, died in 1985. Surviving are a daughter, Janet Grant of Baltimore; two sons, Gerard, of Scottsdale, Ariz., and August, of Essex Center; 17 grandchildren, and several great-grandchildren.
