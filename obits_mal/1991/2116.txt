        Edward M. Lynch, a veteran union leader who retired as international president of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, died Friday at his home in Gaithersburg, Md. He was 71 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        He was born in Brockport, N.Y., and went to public and parochial schools in Rochester. Mr. Lynch served in the Army in World War II, rising to staff sergeant in the Signal Corps. After the war, he became a control-room engineer at radio station WHEC in Rochester in 1946 and served as president of his union's Rochester local from 1947 to 1952.
        He joined the staff of his union, which is part of the AFL-CIO, in 1952 and was a regional director, with his office in Buffalo, until 1968, when he became the union's network co-ordinator, based in Bethesda, Md. Mr. Lynch was elected president in 1971 and was re-elected three times, retiring in 1986.
        In 1973, he was named by George Meany, then AFL-CIO president, to mediate in internal disputes in the federation.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gloria Jeanne Mangano; two brothers, Warren of Hamlin, N.Y., and Bernard J. of Rochester; and three sisters, all of Rochester, Gertrude Amesbury and Sister Mary Ida Lynch and Sister Mary Lynch, both Roman Catholic nuns in the Sisters of St. Joseph.
