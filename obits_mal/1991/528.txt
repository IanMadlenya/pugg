        Brad Crandall, a talk-show host on WNBC Radio in the 1960's, died last Thursday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was 62 years old and lived in Redondo Beach, Calif.
        He died of kidney failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Crandall was an announcer on half a dozen radio stations after attending Millsaps College in Mississippi. He joined WNBC in 1964 and stayed for about six years. Most recently he was a freelance narrator and announcer.
        He is survived by a son, Mark, of Los Angeles.
