        Paul Ecke Sr., a German immigrant who turned the poinsettia into a traditional Christmas plant, died Friday at his home. He was 96 years old.
        Mr. Ecke (pronounced EH-kee) was nicknamed "Mr. Poinsettia" for developing varieties of the plant that could be grown during Christmastime and for promoting the Yuletide merits of a relatively obscure plant.
        Most of more than 40 million poinsettias sold annually in the United States can be traced to Mr. Ecke's ranch in San Diego County, where he developed 30 strains that are grown across the nation.
        Born in Magdaburg, Germany, Mr. Ecke immigrated with his family in 1902 to the United States. They settled in Los Angeles, where his father established the family business after discovering bright red poinsettias being cultivated in the Hollywood Hills.
        In 1970 Mr. Ecke was inducted into the Society of American Florists' Floriculture Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by a son, Paul Jr.; two daughters, Crix Dealy and Barbara Winter; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-granchildren.
