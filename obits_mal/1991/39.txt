        Dr. Richard B. Nolan, a surgeon, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 69 years old and had moved from Manhattan to Paris about a year and a half ago.
        Dr. Nolan, a thoracic, or chest, surgeon, died of kidney failure due to diabetes, his brother, Dr. Thomas Nolan of Madison, Conn., said.
        He was chief of surgery at Beekman Downtown Hospital from 1966 to 1979, and had earlier served as director of cardiovascular surgery at St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains.
        He was a graduate of the New York University Medical School.
        He was president of the New York Thoracic Surgical Society. He was a former president of the New York County Medical Society and former chairman of the public relations committee of the State Medical Society.
        He is also survived by his daughter, Maureen-Giselle Ely of Boone, N.C., and a grandchild.
