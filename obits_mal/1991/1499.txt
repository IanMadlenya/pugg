        Mr. Johnson attended public schools in Harlem and served in World War II as an Army Air Force fighter pilot in the all-black 100th Squadron, which trained at Tuskegee Institute and earned many honors in North Africa and Europe. He earned bachelor and master's degrees in architecture at Harvard University and held many civic posts, including member of the board of 100 Black Men and the Network of Black Professionals.
        Surviving are his wife of 40 years, Clivetta; a son, Conrad 3d, and two daughters, Karen and Kim, all of Manhattan; a sister, Ernestine of New Rochelle, and a grandson, Conrad 4th.
