        John Mullen, vice president and assistant general manager of the Atlanta Braves, was found dead in his hotel room on Wednesday. He was 66 years old.
        The cause of death was undetermined after a preliminary autopsy report, said a spokesman for the Palm Beach Gardens police.
        Mr. Mullen worked for the Braves' franchise for 31 years and was responsible for signing Hank Aaron, baseball's career home run leader. Mr. Mullen began working for the Braves in 1947 in Boston, remaining with the team until 1966. He worked for the Houston Astros for 13 years before returning to the Braves in 1979 as general manager, a title he held until 1985.
        Mr. Mullen is survived by his wife, Clair; a daughter, Kathleen, and two sons, Christopher and Richard.
