        Donald R. Cotter, a retired atomic energy and Pentagon official and a nuclear weapons strategist, died Tuesday at a nursing home in Arlington, Va. He was 68 years old and died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Cotter drew national attention in 1983 when, speaking as a private consultant, he publicly criticized the Administration of President Ronald Reagan. He charged that it had drastically underestimated the number of missiles and launchers deployed in Europe by the Soviet Union and its allies.
        Earlier, as a Federal official, he had helped plan missile weaponry for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
        Mr. Cotter worked for the Atomic Energy Commission from 1948 to 1970 in Albuquerque, N.M., and later in Washington, where he was a consultant from that agency to the Pentagon. Aide to 3 Defense Secretaries
        He eventually switched full-time to the Defense Department, where from 1973 to 1978 he was the special assistant on nuclear policy to three Defense Secretaries, James R. Schlesinger, Donald H. Rumsfeld and Harold Brown. He also had assignments with the Central Intelligence Agency.
        He received several awards and commendations for his Federal service.
        After a brief stint in 1978 with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Cotter left Government to head his own consulting firm, DRC Limited, and later directed the Center for Strategic Concepts, another consulting firm.
        He is survived by his wife, Pauline, of Arlington, and three children from a previous marriage, Douglas Cotter and Elaine Dix, both of Albuquerque, and Jeffrey Cotter of Honolulu.
