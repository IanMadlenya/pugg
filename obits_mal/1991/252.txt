        Lee Hazen, a lawyer and one of the leading players and personalities in the world of bridge, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 85 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications after a heart attack, family members said.
        Mr. Hazen twice represented the United States in world team championship matches, against France in Paris in 1956 and against Italy in New York in 1959, but did not win. He was the nonplaying captain of the American World Championship Team in Taiwan in 1971, where his team won, and in Miami Beach in 1972.
        He had a remarkable record in major national team championships, winning the Vanderbilt Knockout in 1939, 1942, 1949 and 1958, and the Spingold Knockout in 1942, 1947 and 1955. He also won the Board-A-Match Teams in 1945 and 1949, the National Men's Pairs in 1945, and the Masters Individual in 1941. He was runner-up in seven national events.
        Mr. Hazen was also noted as a bridge administrator. In 1942 he became the counsel for the American Contract Bridge League and a member of its Laws Commission, continuing in both positions for more than 30 years. He was a driving force in the modernization of the league in the late 1940's. In 1958 he was named honorary member of the league, and later served as trustee and treasurer of its Charity Foundation. He was also a founder of the Greater New York Bridge Association.
        As a teen-ager Mr. Hazen was a pitcher at Boys High School in Brooklyn and played semi-professional baseball. He graduated from New York University Law School in 1930.
        Mr. Hazen was the senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Dannenberg Hazen & Lake, and had been associated with the firm and its predecessors for more than 40 years. He was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, and handled many civil rights cases in the 1930's and 1940's. He was a founder of the National Lawyers Guild.
        He was a director of the Michigan General Corporation in California for more than 20 years.
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia; a son, Thomas, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and a grandson.
