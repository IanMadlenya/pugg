        Ralph M. Paiewonsky, who served eight years as Governor of the Virgin Islands in the 1960's, died Nov. 9, on his 84th birthday, at St. Thomas Hospital in St. Thomas, V.I.
        Mr. Paiewonsky died of congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Joyce Adolfsen.
        Born into one of the territory's most prominent families, Mr. Paiewonsky became successful in his own right as a leading businessman and as a politician with strong ties to the Democratic Party. President John F. Kennedy appointed him Governor of the territory in 1961, inaugurating a period of substantial growth in tourism and economic development.
        His ties to Washington in the admininstrations of Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson helped win the island a far greater measure of autonomy. Mr. Paiewonsky led the successful efforts to provide fresh water and electrical power to homes throughout the island and to build low- and moderate-income housing for island residents.
        Mr. Paiewonsky, who earned a bachelor's degree from New York University in 1930, was proudest of his role in founding the University of the Virgin Islands in 1962. The university library now bears his name.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in New York City, Mr. Paiewonsky is survived by his wife, Ethel, of St. Thomas; a son, Dr. Bernard Paiewonsky, of Bethesda, Md.; a brother, Isidor, and a sister, Paulina Puritze, and four grandchildren.
