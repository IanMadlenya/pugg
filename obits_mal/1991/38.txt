        Phelps H. Adams, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Sun and later an adminstrative vice president for United States Steel, died Sunday in Maryvale Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix. He was 88 years old and lived in Litchfield Park, Ariz.
        Mr. Adams died of emphysema, said his wife, the former Ruth Hollinger.
        Mr. Adams joined the staff of United States Steel (now USX) in 1950 as a special assistant to the chairman. In 1957 he was appointed a vice president and in 1964 was named administrative vice president of public relations, his title when he retired in 1967.
        Mr. Adams was a reporter for The New York Herald before he joined The Sun. In 1928 he became chief Washington correspondent, a post he held until 1950, when The Sun went out of business.
        He was born in Boston, attended the University of Colorado and received a bachelor's degree from the Columbia University School of Journalism in 1924.
        His wife is his only immediate survivor.
