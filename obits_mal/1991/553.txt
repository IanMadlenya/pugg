        Daniel Joseph Murphy, professor emeritus of English literature at Baruch College of the City University of New York, died on Tuesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 69 years old and lived in Suffern and Dublin.
        He died as a result of a stroke, his daughter Kathryn D'Amico said.
        He joined the staff of City College in 1959 as a part-time lecturer, and when Baruch College was founded in 1968 as part of the City University system, he became professor of Anglo-Irish literature there. He retired in 1985.
        Professor Murphy was a graduate of Columbia University, where he also received a Ph.D. He was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1965 and, later, received several grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities enabling him to annotate the letters of such prominent literary figures as J. M. Synge, W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory.
        Among his writings was a two-volume edition of "Lady Gregory's Journals" (Colin Smythe, 1978 and 1987).
        Besides his daughter Kathryn D'Amico of Wyckoff, N.J., he is survived by his wife, the former Eileen Ryan; another daughter, Deirdre Murphy of Upper Saddle River, N.J.; two brothers, Charles, of New Hyde Park, N.Y., and Edward, of East Northport, L.I.; a sister, Eleanor, of New Hyde Park, and two grandchildren.
