        Jack Resnick, a real-estate investor and developer who helped reshape New York City's skyline by putting up dozens of towering apartment and office buildings, died on Saturday in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 83 years old and for the last several years had lived in a building named in his honor at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale.
        In 1928, Mr. Resnick opened a real-estate business in the Bronx with one employee, a secretary who was paid $8 a week. With an aggressive flair for buying, renovating and selling office buildings, he built Jack Resnick & Sons Inc. into one of the city's premiere real-estate businesses. Along the way, he became one of Manhattan's most active apartment builders.
        Mr. Resnick's company, headed since the late 1960's by his son Burton P., was responsible for projects like the renovation of the 70-story building at 40 Wall Street, the tallest structure on Wall Street and for part of its history the world's tallest building. Resnick & Sons' other projects include Symphony House at 56th Street and Broadway and Seaport Plaza, a 34-story office building near South Street Seaport.
        His company thrived during the real-estate boom of the 1970's and survived the lean times of the 1980's as many rivals went under.
        Mr. Resnick was also was one of the leading boosters of the Bronx. Last year, he and his wife, Pearl, gave $5 million to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, after a previous gift of $3.5 million. The college thanked the Resnicks by naming the 23-acre campus of the medical school the Jack and Pearl Resnick Campus.
        Besides his wife and his son Burton, he is survived by another son, Ira, and two daughters, Marilyn Katz and Susan Fisher, all of New York City; 10 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
