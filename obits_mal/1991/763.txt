        Marshall Smith Lachner, an executive in the soap, beer and cosmetics industries, died on Sunday at the Hospice by the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 76 years old and lived in Boca Raton and Lodi, Wis.
        He died of cancer, a son said.
        Mr. Lachner started his career with the R. H. Macy Company in New York after graduating in 1936 from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He joined the Colgate-Palmolve Company in 1940 and by 1956 was vice president of its soap division. He then joined the Pabst Brewing Company as president but left after 18 months.
        In 1958, he was named president of the B. T. Babbitt Company and started a "Buy three -- ride free" campaign with the New York City Transit Authority, in which people could exchange three labels from the company's household cleaning products for a 15-cent subway token. In July 1960, he joined Revlon as a senior vice president. Two years later he formed his own company, Lachner Associates, which dealt in mergers and acquisitions. He retired in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; a daughter, Melody Aldridge of Rochester; four sons, Crispin, of Seattle, Marshall Jr., of Boca Raton, Geoffrey, of Dana Point, Calif., and Brandon, of Shrewsbury, Mass.; 10 grandchildren, and four great-granddaughters.
