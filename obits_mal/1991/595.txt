        Sir John Kerr, the former Governor General who was at the center of one of Australia's most bitter political disputes, has died. He was 76 years old.
        No specific cause of death was announced, but Sir John was hospitalized in January for a brain tumor. His death on Sunday was not announced until today, after he was buried in a private ceremony in Sydney.
        In 1975, Sir John dismissed the Labor Party Government of Prime Minister Gough Whitlam after the conservative opposition blocked the Government's money supply in the Senate, Parliament's upper house.
        Two years later, Sir John stepped down as Governor General, Queen Elizabeth's representative in Australia, still dogged by protests over his dismissal of the Whitlam Government.
