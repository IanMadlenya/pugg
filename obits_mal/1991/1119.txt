        Vitas Gerulaitis Sr., who nutured his son, Vitas Jr., into becoming one of the world's top professionals and later became the first head pro at the National Tennis Center in Queens, died on Thursday in Woodhaven, L.I.
        According to friends, Mr. Gerulaitis, who was 76 years old and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I., died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Gerulaitis, a former Lithuanian and Balkan States champion, came to the United States from Lithuania in 1946 and soon began a career as a teaching pro. Before he was named the first head pro at the National Tennis Center after a nationwide talent search in 1979, Mr. Gerulaitis ran a successful junior program in Baldwin, L.I. After stepping down as head pro in the mid-1980's, he continued as a teaching pro at the center in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
        In addition to his son, who now works as a television commentator, Mr. Gerulaitis is survived by his wife, Alodona, and a daughter, Ruta, a former touring pro who teaches tennis on Long Island.

        An obituary on Saturday about Vitas Gerulaitis Sr. referred incorrectly to a tennis championship he won. It was the Baltic States championship.
