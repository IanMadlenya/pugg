        Steve Marriott, who was the leader of Humble Pie and a member of the British rock group Small Faces, died today in a fire at his home, the police said. He was 44 years old.
        Mr. Marriott, who had just returned from a two-week recording session in the United States with Peter Frampton, was trying to make a comeback as part of a revival in popularity of music from the 1960's.
        His hits included "Itchycoo Park," "Sha la la la lee" and "All or Nothing." He stopped recording in the 1970's after he split with Small Faces.
        The police said the fire might have been started by a cigarette in the main bedroom of Mr. Marriott's 16th-century cottage in Essex.
