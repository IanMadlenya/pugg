        Pat V. Auletta, a small-businessman and member of Community Board 13 who was known as the mayor of Coney Island, died on Saturday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Coney Island, Queens.
        Mr. Auletta died of a heart attack, said his son, Ken Auletta, the writer.
        A lifelong resident of Coney Island, Mr. Auletta operated Pat's Sporting Equipment on Stillwell Avenue near the subway station from the early 1940's until 1966, then managed the Abe Stark Skating rink until it closed in the late 1980's.
        He and his wife, Nettie Tenenbaum Auletta, who died in 1979, were concessionaires of the Parks and Recreation Department at Manhattan Beach and Coney Island Beach each summer for four decades. In 1985, the Parks Department named a 4,500-square-foot sitting area on Coney Island after Mrs. Auletta.
        "It's really in honor of the family," Henry J. Stern, the Parks Commissioner then, said at the dedication. "She was so loved in Coney Island, and he still is."
        Mr. Auletta, who also founded the Brooklyn Borough Sports League, was a longtime member of Community Board 13, most recently serving as president of the parks committee. As the community deteriorated in the 1960's, he became a strong advocate for redevelopment of the boardwalk and the surrounding neighborhood.
        He is survived by two sons, Ken and Richard, and a daughter, Bonnie, all of Manhattan; a brother, Victor, of Brooklyn; and three grandchildren.

        Because of an editing error, an obituary in some editions yesterday about Pat V. Auletta, a member of Community Board 13 in New York City, referred incorrectly to Coney Island. It is in Brooklyn, not Queens. The obituary is reprinted today on page B14 for readers of editions that did not carry it.
