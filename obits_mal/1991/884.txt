        Guy Boudin, a photographer of the erotic-surrealistic school of fashion popular with fashion magazines, died March 29 in Paris. He was 57 years old and lived in Paris.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Boudin's first fashion photographs were taken for French Vogue in 1955. They included a two-page spread of a woman wearing a hat and standing under three butchered cattle heads with their tongues hanging out.
        In 1976 Mr. Boudin photographed a catalogue of women's underwear for Bloomingdale's titled "Cries and Whispers," which was meant to change the image of the American foundations industry.
        He was born in Paris and studied art and design. In 1957 and 1958 he worked for Vogue in New York and in the 1970's he worked for Charles Jourdan shoes and for Harper's Bazaar in Paris.

        An obituary last Sunday about a French fashion photographer rendered his name incorrectly. He was Guy Bourdin.
