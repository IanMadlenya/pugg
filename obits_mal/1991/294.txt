        The Rev. William La Verdiere, pastor of St. Jean Baptiste Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan for many years, died on Sunday at the Bethany Center of the Blessed Sacrament Fathers and Brothers Monastery in Cleveland. He was 88 years old and lived in New York until he moved to the center 16 months ago because of failing health.
        He died of heart failure, a spokesman for the monastery said.
        Father La Verdiere became pastor of St. Jean Baptiste on the Upper East Side in 1944. In 1958 he was appointed Provincial of the American Province of the Blessed Sacrament Order. He was also a professor of French and English at upstate seminaries.
        He was born in Quebec and raised in Winslow, Me. He was ordained in Montreal in 1928, and in 1933 he became editor of The Sentinel, a publication of the Blessed Sacrament Order.
        He is survived by three brothers, Laurier, of Winslow; Laval, of Waterville, Me., and Donald, who lives in the state of Washington, and four sisters, Jean Haule of Vassalboro, Me., Irene Kurlovich of Waterville, Yvonne Albert of Winslow and Charlotte Volmer of Nehalem, Ore.
