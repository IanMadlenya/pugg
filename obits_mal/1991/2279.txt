        Werner Bamberger, a reporter who covered the waterfront for much of his 40-year career at The New York Times, died on Friday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bamberger interviewed celebrities arriving aboard luxury liners, wrote about the shipping industry and investigated waterfront crime. His trademark was meticulous attention to detail in stories that ranged from a front-page description of a liner berthing unassisted during a tugboat strike to accounts of wearying labor negotiations.
        A native of Frankfurt-on-Main and a refugee from Nazi Germany, he came to The Times just weeks after his family reached New York in 1938. His tenure at the newspaper was interrupted only for World War II.
        Mr. Bamberger is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Ann Schweiker, and a brother, Max, of Houston.
