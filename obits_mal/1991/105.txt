        Dr. Winston H. Bostick, an atomic physicist who was a former head of the physics department at the Stevens Institute of Technology, died on Saturday in Tijuana, Mexico. He was 74 years old and lived in Dennis, Mass.
        He died of lung cancer, said Prof. Timothy Hart, a colleague at the institute in Hoboken, N.J.
        Dr. Bostick, a longtime resident of Chester, N.J., was a specialist in plasma and cosmic-ray physics. He was the George Meade Bond Professor at Stevens, whose faculty he joined in 1956 as a professor and the head of the physics department, a post he held until 1966. He retired in 1986.
        He was born in Freeport, Ill., and received bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of Chicago. In World War II he was associated with the Radiation Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, later taught at Tufts College and conducted research at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory of the University of California and at the Air Force Weapons Research Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M.
        In the mid-1950's he developed a "plasma gun" that shot bursts of atomic particles at high speeds through a magnetic field for research purposes.
        Dr. Bostick is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Lord; two sons, Joel, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Kent, of Albuquerque; a daughter, Verity Venezia of Manhattan, and a brother, William, of Birmingham, Mich.
