        Louis Hay, a teacher and psychologist in the New York City school system for 44 years, died on Tuesday at Tisch University Hospital. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications after surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Hay designed several Board of Education efforts to help disadvantaged children, including the Junior Guidance program for emotionally disturbed and handicapped pupils and the More Effective Schools program of the 1960's.
        He was a founder of the Teachers Guild, now the United Federation of Teachers. After he retired in 1971 Mr. Hay helped develop a collection on the history of anti-Semitism and the Holocaust for the Museum of Jewish Heritage. He was a graduate of City College and held a master's degree in psychology from New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Clara Levine, and a brother, Sidney, of Milwaukee.
