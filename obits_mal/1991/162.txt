        John Gundelfinger, a landscape artist and teacher, died on Jan. 23 at his home in Manhattan. He was 53 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said a friend, Lorna Drake.
        A painter of traditional landscapes, Mr. Gundelfinger chose the Delaware Water Gap as his primary focus. He also did portraits and a number of sketches of subway riders.
        He taught art at the Parsons School of Design and at his alma mater, the School of Visual Arts.
        He began his career as an illustrator. He was a member of the Society of Illustrators, and for several years in the 1960's he participated in the society's annual exibitions, winning gold medals for his work.
        He is survived by his brother, Hugo, of Lenox, Mass.
