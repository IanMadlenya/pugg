        Giovanni Michelucci, considered the father of modern Italian architecture, died on Monday, two days before his 100th birthday.
        Mr. Michelucci came to fame in 1933 when Mussolini, the Italian dictator, chose his "rationalist" design for the Florence railroad station. The architect was still working shortly before his death, and his design was chosen for the renovation of Florence's renowned Uffizi Gallery.
