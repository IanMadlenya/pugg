        The Rev. Alvin A. Illig, a Roman Catholic publishing leader and founding director of the Paulist National Catholic Evangelization Association, died Friday. He was 64 years old.
        Father Illig died of colon, lung and liver cancer at St. Paul's College in Washington, where he had lived since founding the association in 1977.
        He had resigned as association director last month, the Rev. Robert Rivers of St. Paul the Apostle Catholic Church in Los Angeles said Sunday.
        Father Illig was involved in religious publishing for more than two decades and directed a national drive to minister to inactive Catholics and those with no church affiliation. He received the "Pro Ecclesia et Pontifica" medal of Pope John Paul II in 1983 for his work in training clergy.
        In February, he was cited by Franciscan Communications for his publishing and electronic communications work.
        A Los Angeles native, Father Illig graduated from Los Angeles College, a junior seminary of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. He studied philosophy and theology at St. Paul's College, which is affiliated with Catholic University of America.
        He was ordained in 1953 in New York by Bishop Fulton J. Sheen and worked with Paulist Press, based in New York.
        He managed Information magazine and helped direct National Catholic Reading Distributors, which supplies literature to more than 2,500 churches and schools.
