        Jay Richard Kennedy, a novelist and screenwriter who wrote the script for the 1956 film "I'll Cry Tomorrow," died on Monday at the Westlake (Calif.) Hospital. He was 80 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said Eileen Newman, his longtime secretary.
        Mr. Kennedy's screenplay of "I'll Cry Tomorrow," based on the vaudeville singer Lillian Roth's autobiographical recounting of her 16-year struggle with alcoholism, was his best known and most widely praised work. Reviewing the movie for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther pronounced it "thoroughly authentic and convincing, shattering and sad."
        Mr. Kennedy wrote four novels and four screenplays. His 1953 best seller, "Prince Bart: A Novel of Our Times," attracted attention as an "inside Hollywood" novel.
        He told interviewers that he was raised on "the toughest street in the Bronx," quit school in the seventh grade and worked in 28 different occupations, including sharecropper, movie producer and munitions manufacturer. In 1966, he became vice president and story editor of Frank Sinatra Enterprises.
        He is survived by a daughter, Susan K. Hile of Arlington, Va.
