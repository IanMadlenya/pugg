        Ioan Tipu, Romania's Agriculture Minister, died on Monday as he was being rushed to a hospital for treatment of a bleeding ulcer, the Government said. He was 53 years old.
        A Government spokesman, Bogdan Baltazar, said the ulcer was apparently complicated by a liver ailment that led to internal bleeding.
        Mr. Tipu, a former executive in charge of animal farms and farming units, became Agriculture Minister in June 1990. During his tenure, Romania enacted one of Eastern Europe's most ambitious plans to redistribute land collectivized by the former Communist Government.
