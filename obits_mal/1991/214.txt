        David O'Connell, reputed chief of staff of the Irish Republican Army during the 1970's, died today at his Dublin home, the Sinn Fein party said. Mr. O'Connell, who used the Gaelic variant Daithi O Conaill, was 53 years old.
        His family said they found Mr. O'Connell dead after he had gone to bed complaining of feeling ill. Sinn Fein, the outlawed I.R.A.'s legal political wing, announced the death.
        A native of Cork, Mr. O'Connell reportedly joined the I.R.A. at age 18 and was prominent in the establishment of the movement's hard-line provisional wing in 1972.
        By 1973, when Mr. O'Connell slipped through a security net to give a speech at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast, the former teacher was believed to have become chief of staff.
        He was said to have developed the use of the car bomb, one of the main I.R.A. weapons in the early stages of its campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly Protestant province and unite it with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
        Mr. O'Connell was twice jailed for I.R.A. membership in Dublin, but also played an active political role. He was involved in talks with Protestant churchmen that led to a short-lived cease-fire in 1975.
        Soon after the July 1982 bombings that killed 11 soldiers in London, he spoke at a rally in Monaghan and threatened more bombs in Britain. Mr. O'Connell quit the Provisional Sinn Fein movement four years ago when the organization dropped its traditional opposition to taking part in elections.
