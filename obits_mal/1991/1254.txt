        Dr. James M. Dunning, the former dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, died Thursday at the Carlton Willard Village Nursing Home in Bedford, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the dental school said.
        Dr. Dunning was a leader in the fight to repeal a law in Massachusetts that restricted communities' use of fluorides in drinking water. His efforts won for him in 1983 the John W. Knutson Award, named for the dentist who first demonstrated the value of fluoride treatments.
        He graduated from Columbia University Dental School in 1930 and after practicing in the seacoast region of Labrador, traveling by boat to reach his patients, he earned a masters degree in public health from Harvard University in 1947. That same year, at the age of 35, he was appointed dean of the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. In his five-year tenure, he revamped the curriculum, won accreditation for the school from the American Dental Association and promoted school-based health programs.
        His efforts also led to the creation of the Martha Mae Elliott Health Center in Jamaica Plains about 25 years ago. The center serves the dental needs of about 400 poor children.
        His first wife, Mae, died in 1972. Dr. Dunning is survived by his second wife, Nora; two daughters, Cornelia Hollister of Franklin, Tenn., and Rose Dunning of Copper Center, Alaska; two sisters, Frances Beebe of Worcester, Mass., and Sarah Schear of Belmont, Mass., and two grandchildren.
