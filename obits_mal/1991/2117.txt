        Ernest Nathan, an entrepreneur and supporter of Jewish and Israeli causes, died on Saturday at Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 86 years old and lived in Providence.
        He died as a result of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Nathan, a native of Augsburg, Germany, graduated from the Institute of Textile Technology in Reutlingen, Germany, and began working with Chemische Fabrik Pfersee, a chemical company that his family started in 1868. In 1929, he moved to West Warwick, R.I., for a joint venture with the Crompton Corporation to produce Impregnole, a water repellent that his company had developed.
        He sold the Impregnole business to the Sun Chemical Corporation and was a company vice president from 1948 to 1952. After working on Israeli industrial development for two years, he returned to Crompton in 1954 to run its Chemo Products Teflon division in West Warwick.
        In 1962 he bought Elmwood Sensors, a new company in Cranston, R.I., with four employees that was set up to make thermostats. He expanded the company to include more than a thousand workers and a second factory in England before selling it in 1980.
        Mr. Nathan, a naturalized American citizen, helped dozens of other Jews escape from Europe to America in World War II. Later, as vice president of the Palestine Economic Corporation, he helped develop industry in Israel.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Pearl Gluck; two sons, Alan, of Barrington, R.I., and Richard, of Italy; a daughter, Joan Gerson of Washington, and a sister, Alice Regensteiner of Warwick.
