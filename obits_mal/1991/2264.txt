        Percy Max Apfelbaum, who retired as a professor of organic chemistry in 1966 after a 42-year teaching career at City College of New York, died last Wednesday at New Rochelle Hospital. He was 90 years old and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        He died after a short illness, his family reported.
        A native of Paris, Professor Apfelbaum graduated from City College in 1923 and returned the next year to teach. He earned a Ph.D. at Columbia in 1933 and served as the founding president of City College's teachers union from 1928 to 1934.
        He is survived by a daughter, Faith Ionene Sale of Manhattan; a son, Ben, of New Rochelle, and two granddaughters.
