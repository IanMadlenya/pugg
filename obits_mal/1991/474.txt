        Aubran Wayne Martin, one of three men convicted of murder in the 1969 killings of Joseph A. Yablonski, a union leader, and two members of Mr. Yablonski's family, died of stomach cancer on Sunday. He was 42 years old.
        Mr. Martin died at J. C. Blair Memorial Hospital, where he had been transferred from a state penitentiary, corrections officials said.
        Mr. Martin was identified at his trial as one of three gunmen who killed Mr. Yablonski, a dissident leader of the Union Mine Workers, and his wife and daughter at their home in Washington, Pa., in December 1969. Mr. Martin maintained that he had been only the driver of the getaway car.
        He was originally sentenced to death, but the penalty was later changed to life imprisonment. Six others, including a former union president, W. A. (Tony) Boyle, were convicted of conspiracy.
        Mr. Martin was functionally illiterate when he entered prison in 1971, but he later obtained an associate degree from Pennsylvania State University. He wrote "Caesar's Gladiator Pit," a book comparing life inside a maximum-security prison with Rome 2,000 years ago.
