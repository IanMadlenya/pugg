        Arthur J. Schwartz, a retired securities broker, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach. He was 81 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        He died of emphysema, his family said. He had been a resident of New York City before moving to Florida in the 1950's.
        Mr. Schwartz joined Bache & Company in 1928 and rose to became its regional manager for Florida and the Caribbean. He retired from the firm, now known as Prudential-Bache, in 1974.
        He is survived by two sons, Richard and Steven, both of Miami Beach.
