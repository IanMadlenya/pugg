        Sidney Reiner, a travel agent who led efforts to reopen the Soviet Union to American tourists during the thaw in East-West relations in the 1970's, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, his wife, Carol, said.
        As the president of Cosmos Travel, Mr. Reiner followed in the footsteps of his father, the late Gabriel Reiner, an immigrant from Czarist Russia, who bought the travel agency in the late 1930's and maintained an often successful personal campaign to keep the door open for travel to the Soviet Union regardless of the ups and downs of American-Soviet relations.
        After graduating from New York University and spending a year in law school, Mr. Reiner gravitated into his father's business. Over the years he cultivated personal relationships with many officials in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as with American officials involved in Soviet-American relations. In the early 1970's, he expanded those contacts to Chinese officials, working through the Chinese ambassadors in Moscow and Warsaw.
        Besides arranging tours to traditional tourist destinations in the Soviet Union, Mr. Reiner was instrumental in opening access to small cities with special significance to some Soviet-American Jews, like Uman in the Ukraine, where one of the founding rabbis of Hasidism is buried.
        He was a member of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council, a private group of executives and others promoting trade, and the Citizens Exchange Council, which organizes educational and artistic exchanges between the Soviet Union and the United States.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Alissa, a first-year law student at Yale University, and Cornelia, a senior at Wesleyan University.
