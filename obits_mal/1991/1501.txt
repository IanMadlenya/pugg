        Edward First, a tax lawyer for 40 years and former special assistant to the United States Attorney General, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his daughter said.
        Mr. First was a senior partner in the Manhatttan law firm of Guggenheimer & Untermyer from 1948 to 1979, when he retired. He had been special assistant to the Attorney General in the Department of Justice from 1934 to 1947, except for the years he served in the Navy in World War II.
        He was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and from its law school. He received a Master of Arts in tax law from Georgetown University in Washington. In retirement he conducted a five-year, privately published genealogical study, "The Progeny of Israel," tracing his family origins to 1790.
        Active in civic affairs, Mr. First was president of the Washington Heights and Inwood Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. and was a trustee of both the National Jewish Welfare board and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
        Besides his daughter, Susan Pollack of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, the former Edythe Weiner, former chairwoman of the New York City Commission on the Status of Women; two brothers, Irving, and Joseph, both of Philadelphia, and two grandchildren.
