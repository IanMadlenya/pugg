        Howard W. Geiger, a manufacturer of survival and expedition gear, died on Wednesday at White Plains Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He died of pneumonia, said his son Julian.
        In 1932, with Benjamin Willis, Mr. Geiger began the manufacturing company of Willis & Geiger. The company outfitted the polar expeditions of Admiral Richard E. Byrd in the 1930's, and designed and produced flying outfits for Amelia Earhart and Jacqueline Cochran.
        During World War II, the company designed and produced Naval flight jackets and one of the first electrically heated flying suits.
        After the war, the company developed sportswear, including the bush jacket popularized by Ernest Hemingway.
        Mr. Willis died in the late 1940's and the business was sold in 1980.
        Mr. Geiger is survived by his wife, the former Mildred Kaufman; two sons, Julian, of Greenwich, Conn., and Stephen A., of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
