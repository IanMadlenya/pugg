        Rabbi Samuel Schafler, the president of Hebrew College in Brookline, Mass., died Wednesday at his home in Brookline. He was 62 years old.
        He died of cancer, a college spokeswoman said.
        Rabbi Schafler, who was ordained in 1952, was educated at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan and in 1973 earned a Ph.D. in Jewish history there.
        In 1987 he became the sixth president of Hebrew College, a 70-year-old liberal arts institution that specializes in Judaic studies, and helped expand its student body by 25 percent.
        He was superintendent of the Chicago Board of Jewish Education from 1976 to 1987. He also served as officiating rabbi of the Lake Shore Synagogue in Chicago and as rabbi of the Knesses Israel Synagogue in Gloversville, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara; four sons, Daniel, of Brookline, Benjamin, of Manhattan, Seth, of Larchmont, N.Y., and Eliel, of Jerusalem; two daughters, Rena Hyman of Chicago and Gila Brand of Jerusalem, and eight grandchildren.
