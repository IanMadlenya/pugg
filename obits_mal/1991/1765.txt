        Nikiforos Vrettakos, one of Greece's best-known poets and the first leftist member of the Athens Academy of Arts and Sciences, died on Sunday. He was 79 years old.
        He had a stroke at his village home at Ploumitsa in the Peloponnesus and died on the way to a hospital in Sparta, friends of his family said.
        Mr. Vrettakos won the country's prestigious State Poetry Prize twice, and his work was translated into several languages. He wrote about his experiences as a soldier in World War II and on the plight of the left after losing the 1946-49 civil war. Many of his poems were set to music, some by the composer Mikis Theodorakis.
        He caused a storm in leftist circles when he decided to accept the nomination to the Athens Academy in 1988. Several other prominent poets had declined to join what they called the bastion of conservatism.
        Mr. Vrettakos was married and had two children.
