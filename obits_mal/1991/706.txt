        Nathan Dambroff, a lawyer who specialized in civil rights, labor and housing cases, died on Thursday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 83 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Dambroff retired in 1975. Among his clients was Cedric H. Belfrage, publisher and founder of The National Guardian newspaper. Mr. Dambroff defended him unsuccessfully against deportation in the 1950's after Mr. Belfrage refused to tell Congressional investigators whether he was a member of the Communist Party. Mr. Belfrage was deported to Mexico.
        Mr. Dambroff was a graduate of Columbia College and Brooklyn Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carol Bandes; a son, David, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.; a daughter, Susan, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.
