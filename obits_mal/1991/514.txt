        Charles Adams Baker, an agent for scores of luminaries of the New York stage and the chief of the William Morris Agency's theater department from 1950 to 1973, died on Friday in New York Hospital. He was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver cancer, a colleague said.
        He got his professional start working for the producer Jed Harris and as an agent with the Music Corporation of America. From 1973, when he left William Morris, until he retired in 1980, he was a consultant with Macmillan Inc., where in 1976 he created and supervised "Candide," the first hardcover compendium of a Broadway musical, with the full score by Leonard Bernstein, script by Hugh Wheeler and lyrics by Richard Wilbur, John Latouche and Stephen Sondheim.
        His clients included Angela Lansbury, Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Eva Marie-Saint and Robert Preston.
        Mr. Baker was born in Chicago and earned a bachelor's degree at Harvard College. In World War II, he served in the Navy, mainly on patrols in the North Sea, and rising to lieutenant.
        Survivors include a brother, John Douglas Baker of Treasure Island, Fla., and Spring Lake, Mich.
