        Correction:  October 21, 1991, Monday
        An obituary on Friday about Eliot Benson, a securities analyst in Washington, misidentified one daughter and misstated the residence of another. The daughter in New York City is Jennifer Benson; another daughter, Sherry Bronson, lives in Sunland, Calif.
