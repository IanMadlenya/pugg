        Walter J. Slatoff, professor emeritus of English literature at Cornell University and former chairman of its English department, died on Saturday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 68 years old.
        Dr. Slatoff died of lung cancer, his wife, the former Jane Metzger, said.
        He was an editor of Cornell's literary magazine, EPOCH, at his death. He taught at Cornell from 1955 to 1989, when he retired. He was chairman of the English department from August 1973 to August 1974.
        He received the Clark Distinguished Teaching Award in 1977.
        He was born in Manhattan, graduated from Columbia University and received a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.
        He wrote many articles and several books, among them "Quest for Failure," a study of William Faulkner (1960, Cornell University Press) and, most recently, "The Look of Distance: Reflections on Suffering and Sympathy in Modern Literature -- Auden to Agee, Whitman to Woolf" (1985, Ohio State University Press).
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Joan, of Ithaca; a son, Don, of Brooklyn; a sister, Ellen Berman of Usonia, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
