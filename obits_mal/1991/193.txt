        Eddie Barefield, a saxophonist and clarinetist who played with virtually every major big band, died on Jan. 4 at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife, Consuela, said.
        Mr. Barefield's first major big-band experience, with the Bennie Moten orchestra of 1932 (which later metamorphosed into the Count Basie Orchestra), led to work with Zach Whyte's band. In a 60-year career in big bands, he also performed with McKinney's Cotton Pickers, Cab Calloway, Les Hite, Fletcher Henderson, Don Redman, Benny Carter and Duke Ellington. Until recently, he worked steadily with the Illinois Jacquet big band.
        In addition to working with bands, he was a staff musician for ABC and WOR radio. He also conducted Broadway pit orchestras for nearly 20 years, spent 10 years in the band of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and composed and arranged for Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Paul Whiteman and Jimmy Dorsey.
        He was a regular soloist in groups around New York City, playing with Sammy Price, Wilbur De Paris and the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band. He also appeared in films, including Al Jolson's "Swinging Kid," Louis Armstrong's "Every Day's a Holiday" and "The Night They Raided Minsky's."
        Though Mr. Barefield was a fine soloist on both saxophone and clarinet, one of his contributions to jazz was his ability to blend his full, rich tone into the saxophone section of an orchestra.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Patricia Poindexter of Teaneck, N.J.
        A funeral service will be held on Monday at 7 P.M. at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, on 54th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues.
