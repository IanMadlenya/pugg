        Dr. Samuel R. Green, a microbiologist and enzymologist, died on Thursday at the Community Medical Center in Toms River, N.J. He was 71 years old and lived in Toms River.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Green was director of microbiologic research for Wallerstein Laboratories for many years. In 1947 he aided in research that led to the discovery of streptomycin, an antibiotic, by Selman A. Waksman and Albert Schatz.
        He was later an independent consultant and retired four years ago.
        A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Green graduated from Brooklyn College and held a master's degree from Ohio State and a doctorate from Rutgers.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Brinkin; two daughters, Barbara Tipton of Seattle and Laura Geen of Brookline, Mass., and a sister, Muriel Freed of Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.
