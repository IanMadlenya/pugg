        Boris Kroll, a fabric designer who was the longtime president of Boris Kroll Fabrics in Paterson, N.J., died on Friday night at his home in East Hampton, L.I. He was 77 years old and also had a house in Tucson, Ariz.
        His daughter said he died of cancer of the kidneys and colon.
        His company, which ceased operations on March 18, manufactured and distributed fabrics for home furnishings.
        Mr. Kroll was born in Buffalo, graduated from high school there, and went to New York as a young man. A self-taught hand weaver, he developed new upholstery techniques and founded his company in Manhattan in the 1930's.
        By the 1980's, his company had come to be considered a major fabric house and a leader in combining advanced weaving technology with an original and enduring color sensibility.
        A New York Times reviewer, David L. Shirey, wrote in 1977 that tapestries by Mr. Kroll in an exhibition at Guild Hall in East Hampton were "brilliant in their color combinations and imaginatively original in their patterns."
        Mr. Kroll was the company's president from its founding until 1987, when he became chairman, a post that he held until March.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lynn Steyert; his daughter, Lisa Kroll Stern of Manhattan, a textile designer who was president of Boris Kroll Fabrics until March; two sons, Geoffrey, of East Hampton, and Eric, of Manhattan, a photographer and historian of photography, and six grandchildren.
