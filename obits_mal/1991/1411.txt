        Robert S. Rau, an import-export executive and a civic leader in Manhattan, died on Thursday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications following back surgery, the family said.
        Mr. Rau was vice president, director and treasurer of Stein, Hall & Company, an import-export firm, from 1945 until his retirement in 1972. Before that, he was president of the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, a division of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. He was also co-treasurer of the Federation and, after its merger with the United Jewish Appeal, was on the board of directors. A graduate of Princeton University, he was also a past president of the Goddard-Riverside Community Center.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Dryfoos Bijur; a son, John, of Leonia, N.J.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
