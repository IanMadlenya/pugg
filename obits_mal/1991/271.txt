        Dr. John Graydon Kidd, a former pathologist-in-chief at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died on Monday at the Nacogdoches Medical Center in Texas. He was 82 years old and lived in Center, Tex.
        He died of complications from cardiovascular disease, his family said.
        Dr. Kidd conducted extensive research about the relationship between viruses and cancer. His discovery that the blood of guinea pigs could cure laboratory mice of experimentally induced tumors led to the identification of the enzyme asparaginase, an agent used against cancer.
        He was born in Edgewood, Tex., was a graduate of Duke University and received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins. He was with the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research for 10 years before joining New York-Cornell in 1944 as pathologist-in-chief and chairman of the pathology department.
        Dr. Kidd retired in 1964 but continued his research and teaching at Cornell until 1975, when he became professor emeritus of pathology.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Maudine Adams; two sons, Dr. John G. Kidd Jr. of Boston and Robert Kidd of Center; two daughters, Maudanne Barriskill of Virginia Gardens, Va., and Betsy Marks of Richmond; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
