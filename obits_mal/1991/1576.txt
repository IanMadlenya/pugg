        Doro Levi, an archeologist who worked with the United States in World War II to save Italian monuments from Allied bombardment, died here on Wednesday, his family announced today. He was 93 years old and died of old age, the family said.
        Mr. Levi was born in Trieste and studied at the University of Florence and the Italian School of Archeology in Athens, of which he was director from 1947 to 1977. From 1938 to 1945, Mr. Levi was a member of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, N.J.
        A Jew, he went to the United States after being persecuted by Mussolini's fascist regime. He worked with the Government to prevent the destruction of Italian monuments during battle, and in 1946 he founded a committee to restore European artworks damaged by the war.
        He is survived by three granddaughters.
