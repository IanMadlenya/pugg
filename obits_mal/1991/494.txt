        William Heinesen, a novelist and poet whose writing chronicled life on the Faeroe Islands, died on Tuesday in Thorshavn, the capital of the islands, where he was born. He was 91 years old.
        The cause of death was not mentioned in news reports from the islands, a Danish territory about 200 miles northwest of Scotland.
        Mr. Heinesen, who published his first volume of verse, "Arctic Elegies," in 1921, was considered to be one of the foremost 20th-century Danish-language storytellers. His 22 published works have been translated into the other Scandinavian languages and into English and German.
        In a recent interview, Mr. Heinesen said he thought his best novel was "The Black Pot," which deals with the British occupation of the Faeroe Islands during World War II. It was written in 1949.
        Mr. Heinesen was elected to the Danish Academy in 1961.
