        Walther Prokosch, an architect and former partner in Tippets, Abbott, McCarthy, Strattony, New York architects and engineers, now Tams Consultants, Inc., died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Prokosch died of pnuemonia, said his son, Christopher of Floyd, Va.
        In his association with the New York firm, which began in 1949, Mr. Prokosch was perhaps best known as the designer of San Juan International Airport in Puerto Rico, the Pan American Terminal at Kennedy International Airport and Little Dix Bay resort in Virgin Gorda, Britsh Virgin Islands. He retired in 1975.
        In 1970 with his son, Andrew, of Franklin, N.H., he was co-founder of Shelter-Kit Inc. of Tilton, N.H., manufacturers of house and barn kits. He retired in 1972.
        A graduate of Yale Architectural School in 1934, he and Charles Froesch wrote one of the first airport design textbooks "Airport Planning" (1946; John Wiley & Sons Inc.)
        Besides his sons, Mr. Prokosch is survived by his wife, Dr. Margo Sommers, a psychoanalyst, of Cambridge; two other sons, Eric of London and Michael of Dorchester, Mass.; a sister, Gertrude Kurath of Ann Arbor, Mich.; and two grandchildren.
