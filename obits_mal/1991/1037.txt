        Anthony E. Maglio, a retired Criminal Court judge in Brooklyn, died on Tuesday in St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Judge Maglio, who began a two-decade career on the bench as a magistrate an 1950, gained a reputation as a crusader against street crime. But, coincidentally, in 1959 he was suspended from the bench for releasing two youths without bail who were charged with beating an off-duty police officer with an iron bar.
        He fought the ouster and, after a hearing before a special referee appointed by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, he was censured for conduct unbecoming a judicial officer but was reinstated.
        He was later appointed a criminal court judge and served until 1969. After he retired he served as a state judicial hearing officer until shortly before his death.
        He was born in Brooklyn, the son of a shoemaker. He graduated from St. John's University Law School, which he attended at night, and was admitted to the bar in 1935. Long active in politics in the old Ninth Assembly District in the Bay Ridge section, he was named a legislative assistant by Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri in 1946.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Violet Mennella, who was for many years a Democratic district leader in Brooklyn; a daughter, Geraldine Pincus of Manasquan, N.J.; a son, Anthony P., of Brooklyn; a sister, Lena DeSimone of Brooklyn; a brother, Roger, of West Palm Bach, Fla., and four grandchildren.
