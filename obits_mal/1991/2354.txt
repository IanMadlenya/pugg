        Horatio Luro, the Argentine-born horseman who trained the Kentucky Derby winners Decidely and Northern Dancer, died Sunday of pancreatic cancer at his home in Bal Harbour, Fla., the New York Racing Association reported yesterday. He was 90 years old.
        Senor Luro, as he was known in thoroughbred-racing circles, was noted for favoring foreign-bred horses and for shaping up horses that needed attention. One was Princequillo, who had been shipped out of Ireland in 1941 but was claimed by Mr. Luro for $2,500 in 1942. Princequillo went on to win the Jockey Club Gold Cup and to sire such successful horses as Round Table and Dedicate, while also becoming a grandfather to Secretariat.
        Another Luro reclamation was a son of Riva Ridge, Tap Shoes, who won the Flamingo Stakes at Hialeah in 1981. Other Luro-trained stakes winners included One for All, Iceberg II, Spinney, Eugenia II, Miss Grillo, Graffiti, Talon and Jumping Hill.
        But by far the horses who made Mr. Luro smile most were the two colts who made successful runs for the roses at Churchill Downs, Decidely in 1962 and Northern Dancer in 1964. Both were ridden by Bill Hartack.
        As a young man in Argentina, where he was reared in a well-to-do family that included three uncles who were founding members of the Argentine Jockey Club, Mr. Luro was more interested in polo than in horse racing. He also had an interest in race cars, but that interest faded after his brother was killed in a crash in 1927.
        Mr. Luro, who arrived in the United States in 1937 with four Argentine and Uruguayan horses, was inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame in 1980.
        He is survived by a sister, Hercelia Salisbury, of Buenos Aires; a stepdaughter, Cary Robinson, and three step-grandchildren.
