        Franz Cardinal Hengsbach, who wore a piece of coal in his bishop's ring to symbolize his concern for miners and other workers, died on Monday, church officials said. He was 80 years old.
        A statement from the Roman Catholic Ruhr Diocese said Cardinal Hengbach had died at a hospital of complications from stomach surgery that he underwent on Tuesday.
        Known throughout Germany as the "workers' bishop," he was appointed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1988. In keeping with church policy, he retired in February after passing his 80th birthday.
        Born in the town of Velmede, 50 miles east of Essen, he was named the first Bishop of the Ruhr Diocese in 1957 by Pope Pius XII.
        A funeral service is scheduled Saturday at the Essen Cathedral.
