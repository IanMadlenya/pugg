        Joseph D. Lewis, an archivist and concert librarian for the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization since 1980 and a musical director, died on Sunday on his way to the hospital. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, said Bert Fink, the organization's director of special projects and public relations.
        As musical director, associate musical director or rehearsal pianist, Mr. Lewis worked with the 1953 European tour of "Porgy and Bess," with Leontyne Price, and with the original Broadway productions of "Fiddler on the Roof," "Juno" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." He also worked with Leonard Bernstein on four Broadway productions: "Trouble in Tahiti," "Candide" and its revival and "West Side Story."
        There are no immediate survivors.
