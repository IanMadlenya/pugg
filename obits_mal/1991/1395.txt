        T. Harvey Mathis, a real-estate developer who was chosen to be chairman of Atlanta's Olympic Games Authority last Thursday, died on Friday night at his home in Atlanta. He was 58 years old.
        Dr. John Cheatham, Mr. Mathis's physician, said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        Mr. Mathis, the president of Taylor & Mathis, a real-estate development and brokerage company, had been unanimously elected chairman of the authority, which was created by the Georgia Legislature to oversee the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta.
        Mr. Mathis is survived by his wife, Susan, and a sister, Elizabeth M. Cheatham of Griffin, Ga.
