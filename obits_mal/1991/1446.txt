        Johnny Vergez, an infielder with the New York Giants World Series champions in 1933, died on Monday at the University of California-Davis Medical Center. He was 85 years old and died of kidney failure, the medical center announced.
        In 1933, Vergez hit .271 with 16 home runs and 72 runs batted in in 123 games before missing the final month of the season for surgery on his appendix. He also missed the World Series because his wife, Helen, became ill.
        He is survived by his wife; his daughter, Sue Lear of Sacramento, three grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
