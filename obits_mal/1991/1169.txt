        Jonathan R. Goldberg, a Manhattan lawyer who specialized in civil rights cases, died on Monday at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Goldberg, who had been paralyzed for more than 10 years, died of a long-standing neurological disorder, a nephew said.
        From 1956 to 1960, Mr. Goldberg was in practice with a firm in which his father was a partner -- Dammann, Roche & Goldberg, which is no longer in business. Then he went into practice for himself.
        He did pro bono work for the New York Civil Liberties Union as an affiliate and for the National Lawyers Guild.
        Mr. Goldberg took an active role in the Reform Democratic movement of the 1960's and 1970's, helping candidates get on the ballot. A native New Yorker, he graduated from City College in 1951 and the New York University School of Law in 1956.
        He is survived by a brother, Richard, of Weisbaden, Germany.
