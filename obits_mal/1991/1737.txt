        Albert Bates Lord, a scholar of oral folk tales who taught at Harvard University for 33 years, died on Monday at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston. He was 78 years old.
        Professor Lord died of pancreatic cancer, the university said.
        In his Harvard career, which began in 1950, Professor Lord taught Slavic languages and literature, comparative literature and folklore and mythology. Before teaching, he traveled to Yugoslavia and Albania, where he collected folk poetry and songs. Later in his career, he made similar trips to Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.
        Professor Lord wrote several books and articles on folklore, among them "Epic Singers and Oral Traditions," which was published this summer by Cornell University Press.
        Professor Lord was born in Boston and earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Louise Carlson Lord, of Cambridge, Mass.; two sons, Nathan Eliot Lord of Lafayette, Colo., and Mark Edwards Lord, of Northwood, N.H., and one granddaughter.
