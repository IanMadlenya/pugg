        Howard (Hobby) Hobson, who coached the University of Oregon basketball team to the first National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship in 1939 and was a member of the National Basketball Hall of Fame, died today. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Hobson's son, David, said his father had died of congestive heart failure.
        Mr. Hobson coached the "Tall Firs" to a 46-33 victory over Ohio State in the first N.C.A.A. title game, at Northwestern University on March 27, 1939. His team went 29-5 that season and earned Oregon's only N.C.A.A. basketball crown.
        In 1965, Mr. Hobson became a member of the National Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass.
        Mr. Hobson, who was born in Portland, began his basketball career as a player at Franklin High School. He also played at the University of Oregon. He went on to coach at Benson High School, Southern Oregon Normal (now Southern Oregon State College) and then the University of Oregon, from 1936-47.
        He compiled a 212-124 record at Oregon.
        Mr. Hobson moved on to Yale University in 1947. He coached the Elis through the 1955-56 season, compiling a record of 121-118. In 1957, he became a senior vice president of Ronald Press Publishing in New York, a sports book publisher. Mr. Hobson retired in 1967.
        Mr. Hobson said in a 1985 interview that his biggest contribution to the game was a 13-year study of basketball that took the form of a doctoral thesis at Columbia University in 1944. The study eventually was published as a book, "Scientific Basketball."
        He said his study led to several rule changes, and the national publication of shooting percentages, rebounds and turnovers. His analysis included proposals for a 3-point field goal, a shot clock and wider free-throw lanes, all of which eventually became part of the game.
        Mr. Hobson staged an experimental game between Columbia and Fordham, using all three innovations, in the 1940's.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Jennie.
