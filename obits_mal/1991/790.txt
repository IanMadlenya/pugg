        Bucky Walters, a pitching star for the Cincinnati Reds in the late 1930's and 40's and a six-time National League All-Star, died Saturday at Abington Memorial Hospital. He was 82 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        During 19 years in the major leagues, Mr. Walters pitched for the old Boston Braves, the Boston Red Sox, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Reds. It was with the Reds that he had his best seasons, winning 20 or more games three times.
        In 1939, Mr. Walters had a 27-11 record and 2.29 earned run average and won the National League's Most Valuable Player award. He won 22 games in 1940 and two more in the World Series against the Detroit Tigers. He pitched Cincinnati to the Series championship with a 2-1 victory in Game 7.
        Mr. Walters won 23 games in 1944 and had a career record of 198-160.
        Known as a workhorse, Mr. Walters pitched a total of 3,140 innings and also was considered one of the better hitting pitchers in the game's history.
        Before he became a pitcher full time for the Phillies in 1935, Mr. Walters had been a third baseman. He had 23 home runs in his career and a .243 career batting average.
        Mr. Walters was a National League All-Star in 1937, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942 and 1944 before retiring as an active player in 1950. He also managed the Reds in 1948 and 1949 and later served as a big league coach.
        Mr. Walters is survived by his wife, Jane; two sons, Robert and William, and a daughter, Carolyn.
