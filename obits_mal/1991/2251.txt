        Gavin Gail Borden, the founder and president of Garland Publishing Inc., died on Thursday at his home on New York City. He was 52 years old.
        He died of cancer of the salivary gland, his family said.
        Mr. Borden founded Garland Publishing 23 years ago. The company specializes in photographic reprints of antiquarian books and manuscripts.
        In 1984, the company published a three-volume, corrected edition of James Joyce's "Ulysses." The company updated the original version of the seminal 20th-century novel, which was published in the United States in 1934 by Random House.
        At the time of its publication, the Garland edition was thought to be the definitive version of "Ulysses." Two years later, Random House reprinted the Garland version in paperback.
        Some Joyce scholars, however, became increasingly uneasy about the corrected version, primarily because of criticism raised by Prof. John Kidd, the director of Boston University's James Joyce Research Center, who said the revised text had serious mistakes.
        "Borden continued to feel that it was a scholarly enterprise and well worth doing," said Stephen Weissman, a friend and business associate. "It was clearly an important edition because it did make an attempt to get closer to the text as Joyce actually wrote it."
        Mr. Borden, whose great-uncle, Gail Borden, was the founder of the Borden Milk Company, graduated from Harvard College in 1962. He is survived by his business partner and former wife, Elizabeth Borden; their children, Sarah, Gavin and Frederick, all of New York City; and a brother, Gail, of Washington.
