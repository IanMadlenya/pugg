        Burton Berinsky, a freelance photographer who dabbled successfully in union organizing, writing and designing hats, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old.
        He died of heart disease, his wife, Helene, said.
        Mr. Berinsky joined the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in 1954 as an organizer. When the union's staff photographer died, he took the job. He had been a photography enthusiast since serving in the Army from 1952 to 1954.
        Ten years later, he became a freelance photographer for magazines. After meeting John F. Kennedy, then a Senator, in 1960, Mr. Berinsky became an unofficial photographer in the Kennedy entourage. Some of his photographs are permanently displayed at the John F. Kennedy Library in Dorchester, Mass.  Winner of Coty Award
        In 1980, Mr. Berinsky took over his father-in-law's hat business, Jay Lord, and began another career as a hat designer. Two years later, his creations won him a Coty Award, equivalent in the fashion industry to the Oscar.
        When Jay Lord closed in 1988, Mr. Berinsky lamented that dandies like the writer Tom Wolfe would have to search elsewhere for their custom millinery.
        In his final career, journalism, Mr. Berinsky wrote articles on fashion for several magazines, often focusing on the decline of men's hats.
        Mr. Berinsky, who was born in Boston, graduated from the Boston Latin School and Brandeis University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Adam, and a daughter, Rachel, both of Manhattan; his mother, Sadie Berinsky, and a sister, Arlene Morris, both of Stoughton, Mass.
