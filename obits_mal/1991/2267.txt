        David E. Evins, the New York shoe designer whose understated pumps and other shoes have been worn by celebrities and First Ladies since the early 1950's, died early yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his son, Mathew, said.
        Mr. Evins began his career as a shoe designer almost by accident. As a fashion illustrator for Vogue shortly after World War II, he altered the style of some shoes he was drawing for effect. His editor dismissed him, saying that if he liked shoe designing he should do it for a living.
        After working as a pattern maker and designing for a number of manufacturers, Mr. Evins opened a factory in New York City in 1947 with his brother, Lee, who remained a partner until his death in 1987. In 1948 Mr. Evins won the Coty Award for his creation of the shell pump, a shoe with a low-cut top that showed more of a woman's foot.
        In the early 1950's, after acquiring a shoe factory in France, Mr. Evins worked to make women's shoes lighter and more comfortable. The result was a handmade shoe called "6 ounces," which sold for up to $175 at a time when quality women's shoes cost about $45 a pair.
        His designs and manufacturing processes were widely immitated and he became a favorite among Broadway and Hollwood stars. He designed the "chunky pump" worn by Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe's "subway sandals" and the shoes worn by Ava Gardner in the film "The Barefoot Contessa." He made shoes for every First Lady from Mamie Eisenhower to Nancy Reagan.
        Born in London, he moved with his family to Brooklyn in 1922. He graduated from New York University and did graduate work at Pratt Institute.
        Aside from his son, he is survived by his wife, Marilyn; a grandson, Alexander; and a niece, Melissa Evins, and nephew, Reed Evins, both of whom are shoe designers in New York City.
