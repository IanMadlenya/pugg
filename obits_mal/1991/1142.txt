        He died of cardiac failure, said his son, David.
        Justice Glass practiced law in Manhattan from 1947 until 1976, when he was elected to the New York City Civil Court. He was an acting New York City Criminal Court Justice at the time of his election to the State Supreme Court bench in 1980. He served until 1987.

        He also served as general counsel to Junior High School 47, the School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, and was a director of the National Foundation for the Deaf. In the mid-1960's he drafted legislation guaranteeing the inheritance rights of children born by means of artificial insemination.
        He is survived by his wife, Gertrude; a son, David, of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a daughter, Wendy Goldfarb of Flushing, Queens; a sister, Lois Weinstein of Manhattan, and one grandchild.
