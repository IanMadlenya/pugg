        Dr. Irving M. Riffin, a family doctor and anesthesiologist for almost 50 years, died on Friday at a vacation home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 77 years old and lived in Montclair, N.J.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his daughter Jane said.

        Besides his daughter, Jane Susswein of Montclair, the financial vice president of the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot, he is survived by his wife, Babette, a former member of the Montclair Board of Education; another daughter, Ann, who disappeared in 1982 while on a painting vacation in Mora, N.M.; a brother, Dan, of Livingston, N.J.; a sister, Rosalie Sussman of Bethesda, Md., and two grandchildren.
