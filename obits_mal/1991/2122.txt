        Bishop Joseph McShea, who became the first head of the Roman Catholic Church's newly created Allentown Diocese in 1961 and remained in the post until his retirement 22 years later, died Thursday at his home here. He was 84 years old.
        He had been ill for several years with diabetes and other ailments, said Bishop Thomas J. Welsh, who succeeded Bishop McShea in 1983.
        Bishop McShea, a native of Luzerne County, Pa., was ordained in 1931 and served at the Vatican in the Sacred Congregation for Oriental Churches. Later he was appointed secretary to the papal delegation in Washington.
        He helped persuade Pope John XXIII to create the Allentown Diocese, which comprises Lehigh, Northampton, Berks, Carbon and Schuylkill Counties. The region, with 250,000 Catholics, had been part of the Philadelphia Archdiocese.
