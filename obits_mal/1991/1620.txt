        A native of Jackson, Miss., he served as president of the Mississippi Hunger Foundation and coordinated the shipment of tons of food and clothing to three of Mississippi's poorest counties in the 1960's.
        He also served as the first president of the International Research Institute for Sickle Cell Anemia.
        He is survived by his wife, F. Anita, and two sisters, Dr. Delano Heard of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Wesley Ann Moore of Lorton, Va.
