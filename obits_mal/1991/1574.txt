        Warner Alden Morse, a professor in the department of philosophy at the University of Kansas in Lawrence for 25 years, died Monday at St. Francis Medical Center in Topeka. He was 53 years old and lived in Lawrence.
        Dr. Morse died of complications following surgery for cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Dr. Morse joined the university in 1966 and currently held the post of director of undergraduate studies for the department of philosophy. He had been faculty adviser to Amnesty International.
        Earlier he had taught philosophy at Washington State University in Pullman.
        He graduated from Harvard in 1959 and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1972.
        A descendant of Samuel F. B. Morse, he was a member of the Amateur Radio Emergency Services and was able to decode messages in Morse code at the rate of 20 words a minute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Fowler; a daughter, Adina of Lawrence; two sons, Solon of Champaign-Urbana, Ill., and Caleb of Ann Arbor, Mich.; and a sister, Priscilla Conner of Needham, Mass.
