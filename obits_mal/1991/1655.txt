        George W. Mayer, the retired co-owner of Mayers Parkway Restaurant in the Bronx, died on Thursday at his home in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 82 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        The family business at East 233d Street and Bronx River Parkway in the Williamsbridge section began as a roadside inn in 1902. Mr. Mayer and his brother, Bill, built it into a favored site for wedding receptions and catered affairs. It closed in 1980.
        Mr. Mayer is survived by his wife, the former Mary Flanagan; a daughter, Maureen, of Ridgefield, Conn.; four sons, George R., of Bronxville, William P., of Baltimore, and John and Robert, both of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and five grandchildren.
