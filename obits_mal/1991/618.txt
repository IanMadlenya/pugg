        Samuel G. Gallu, a playwright and independent television and film producer, died yesterday at Doylestown Hospital in Doylestown, Pa. He was 73 years old and lived in Solebury, Pa.
        Mr. Gallu died of complications from prostate cancer, his son, Simeon, said.
        He was the author of "Give 'Em Hell, Harry," a play about Harry S. Truman that was produced on Broadway in 1975 with James Whitmore as its star. The play was made into film a year later. Mr. Gallu also wrote "Churchill: A Man Alone," starring Roy Dotrice, which toured the country in 1979.
        He also wrote for radio and television, and in the early 1950's founded his own production company, Gallu Productions in Hollywood. The company created television series like "Border Patrol," "Navy Log" and "The Blue Angel."
        Mr. Gallu was born in Woodbine, N.J., and graduated from Pennsylvania State University. In World War II he served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy in the Pacific. He was later given the Distinguished Public Service Award by the Department of the Navy, its highest civilian citation.
        Besides his son, Simeon G., of Manhattan, he is survived by two other sons, Christopher T., of Knoxville, Tenn., and Timothy J., of State College, Pa.; a daughter, Elizabeth Jane Gallu, of Winchester, Mass., and three grandsons.
