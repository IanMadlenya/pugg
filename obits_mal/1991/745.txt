        Carlos Montalban, an actor and dancer whose film career spanned four decades, died Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said Joel Brokaw, a spokesman for the family.
        Mr. Montalban, the brother of the actor Ricardo Montalban, was perhaps most familiar to American television viewers in the 1960's and 70's as El Exigente in Savarin coffee commercials.
        In films, Mr. Montalban played a boxer's manager in "The Harder They Fall" (1956) and a Latin American dictator in Woody Allen's "Bananas" (1971). His other film credits included "Flying Down to Rio" (1933), in which he danced. In other dance roles, he doubled for Warner Baxter in "Under the Pampas Moon" and for George Raft in "Bolero" and "Rhumba."
        His voice was well known in Latin America, where he was heard as the Spanish-language host of documentaries and newsreels like "The March of Time."
        Mr. Montalban, who was born in Spain, also produced film and live entertainment shows at the Puerto Rico Theater in New York in the 1940's.
        In addition to his brother, of Los Angeles, he is survived by his wife, Mary, and a sister, Carmen, of Torreon, Mexico.
