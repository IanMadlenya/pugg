        William D. Tyler, a retired advertising executive, died on Thursday in Tryon, N.C., where he was visiting. He was 82 years old and lived in Charlottesville, Va.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Tyler, a native of Manhattan who was raised in San Francisco, attended Yale University and began his advertising career with the Borden Company in Philadelphia. After working at Young & Rubicam and Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, now part of Saatchi & Saatchi, he became the first copy chief of the Leo Burnett agency in the 1950's.
        In 1958 he moved to Benton & Bowles, where he later became executive vice president and director of creative services, a post he held until 1962.
        For many years, he wrote a column on creativity in copy for Advertising Age magazine. He continued as an advertising consultant for several years before retiring a decade ago.
        Mr. Tyler is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Marshall; a son, Timothy, of Manhattan Beach, Calif.; a daughter, Marshall, of Charlottesville, and two granddaughters.
