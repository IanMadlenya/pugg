        Walter Hudson, who was once listed in "The Guinness Book of World Records" as the heaviest man on earth, died on Tuesday evening at his home in Hempstead, L.I. He was 46 years old.
        He died apparently of a heart attack, the police said. They said the Nassau County Medical Examiner would perform an autopsy later this week.
        The Associated Press reported that Mr. Hudson weighed 1,125 pounds at his death, and that emergency rescue workers had to cut a four-by-six-foot hole in the wall of his bedroom to remove the body.
        Mr. Hudson gained notoriety in 1987 when, at his top weight of 1,200 pounds, he became stuck in a doorway of his home. It was then that he contacted Dick Gregory, the entertainer and self-styled nutrition expert, who aided him in a weight-loss program. A year later, Mr. Hudson, having lost 600 pounds, went outdoors for the first time in 18 years. But he had regained much of the weight before he died.
        Mr. Hudson operated a catalogue clothing company with offices in Brooklyn. But all of the company's business, according to the A.P. report, was conducted over the phone or in meetings at Mr. Hudson's home. Called "Walter Hudson Ventures," it featured fashions for large women.
