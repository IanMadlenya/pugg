        Michael Guerriero, professor emeritus in the department of school services at the City College of New York, died last Friday in Plantation, Fla., where he was vacationing. He was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage after a series of strokes, colleagues said.
        Dr. Guerriero retired in 1986 after 34 years on the City College faculty. He was born in Brooklyn, held a bachelor's degree from Columbia University and received a doctorate from Teachers College at Columbia.
        In the 1960's he was senior project coordinator for the Job Corps in the Office of Economic Opportunity. In recent years he was a leader of Project Life, which seeks to place disabled people in jobs and housing.
        There are no immediate survivors.
