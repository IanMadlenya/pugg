        The Rev. Arthur Raymond McKinstry, the former Episcopal bishop of Delaware and a friend of two Presidents, died Christmas Day at the Methodist Country House, his residence in Greenville, Md. He was 97 years old.
        Bishop McKinstry died after long suffering from cancer, said his son, James, of Wilmington, Del.
        In 1927, Bishop McKinstry was appointed rector of St. Paul's Church in Albany, where Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was then Governor, attended services. Soon after, he was named chaplain to the New York State Senate. After Roosevelt became President in 1932, he and Bishop McKinstry remained friends.
        In 1931, Bishop McKinstry was appointed rector of St. Mark's Church in San Antonio, where in 1934 he officiated at the wedding of Lyndon B. Johnson, then a Congressional aide, and Claudia Alta Taylor, known as Lady Bird.
        After Mr. Johnson became President, Bishop McKinstry recalled for reporters how three decades earlier the bridegroom had forgotten to buy a wedding ring. A Johnson aide, he said, rushed to a nearby store and brought back 12 rings, and the bride picked out one that fit.
        A native of Greeley, Kan., he earned degrees from Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, from Bexley Hall Divinity School in Gambier, and from the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Mass. He was ordained as an Episcopal deacon in 1919 and as a priest a year later. He served as the fifth bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Delaware from 1939 to 1954.
