        Robert DeLigter, an executive who for 25 years was vice president of the Cresca Company, the New York food importing concern, and who had his own credit and mail-order catalogue businesses, died on Wednesday at the New Rochelle Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. DeLigter, a Manhattan native and a graduate of Indiana University, founded Charg-All, a retail credit business, in New Rochelle in 1948 and two years later, joined Cresca in Manhattan. In 1975 he founded R. D. Associates in New Rochelle, publisher of the Energy Savers mail-order catalogue.
        In World War II, Mr. DeLigter served as an Army Air Forces captain in Alaska.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Josephi; two sons, Richard, of Manhattan, and Harry, of Los Angeles; two sisters, Anne Lewallen of San Jacinto, Calif., and Joan Levi of New Rochelle, and a grandson.
