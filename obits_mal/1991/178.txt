He was head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at St. Mary's Hospital in Hoboken, N.J., and also practiced at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital in Manhattan and at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. He retired in 1985.
        A longtime resident of Leonia, N.J., Dr. Kuntze was a former member of the Town Council, the Board of Education and the Recreation Commission.
        He is survived by two sons, Alan, of Mount Vernon, Wash., and Christopher, of Lancaster, N.H.; a daughter, Megan, of Rensselaer, N.Y.; a sister, Carol McGrath of Greenlawn, L.I., and a grandson.
