        Carl S. Brown, a former advertising executive, died on Saturday at the Courtland Gardens Health Center in Stamford, Conn. He was 84 years old and lived in Salisbury, Conn.
        He died of heart failure and lung disease, his family said.
        Mr. Brown, a native of Bethany, Mo., attended the University of Missouri and was a reporter and advertising manager for several newspapers before opening his first advertising agency in 1938. In 1941 he became executive advertising manager of Blackett, Sample & Hummert in Chicago.
        He came to New York as general manager of the Sherman & Marquette agency and in 1948 founded Brown & Butcher, later the Carl S. Brown Company. He retired in 1962, selling his agency to Cunningham & Walsh, and raised Black Angus cattle on a 100-acre farm in Sharon, Conn.
        His first wife, the former Elizabeth Hartwig, died in 1966. He is survived by his second wife, the former Elsa Bernardy; two daughters, Louise Ringo of Menlo Park, Calif., and Linda Mead of Port Chester, N.Y.; a son, Timothy, of Houston; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.
