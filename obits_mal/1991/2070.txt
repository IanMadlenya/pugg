        Adrian Quist, a tennis star from Australia who captured Wimbledon doubles titles 15 years apart, died on Monday in a Sydney hospital. He was 78 years old. He had been ill with cancer for some time, hospital authorities in Australia said.
        Mr. Quist was Australia's top-ranked male player in 1936 and 1937, and was ranked fourth in the world in 1937. He captured the doubles title in 10 consecutive Australian Opens, with D.P. Turnbull twice and with John Bromwich eight times.
        In 1935, he teamed with Jack Crawford to take the French Open and Wimbledon doubles titles, and in 1950 he won the Wimbledon title again, with Mr. Bromwich.
        Mr. Quist also played in 54 Davis Cup doubles matches for Australia, and he was the Australian team's captain as well as its manager in 1948.
        After retiring from the game in 1950, Mr. Quist became general manager of the Dunlop sporting-goods company. He also wrote for The Sydney Morning Herald and other newspapers.
