        Orville Alvin Vogel, a wheat breeder whose research made possible the "Green Revolution" in world food production, died Friday at the convalescent center of the Panoramic City retirement village in Lacey, Wash. He was 83 years old and lived at Panoramic City.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Bertha, said.
        Mr. Vogel worked for the United States Department of Agriculture and was stationed at Washington State University for 42 years. He led the team that developed the Western Hemisphere's first commercially successful semi-dwarf wheat varieties, released to farmers in 1961. The advantage of this strain is to produce heavy yields without the stalk's falling over from the weight of the grain.
        His research in wheat breeds was publicly acknowledged by Norman Borlaug, a scientist who received the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize as father of the "Green Revolution." Mr. Vogel's greatest contribution is considered to be his invention of miniature equipment to automate planting and harvesting of research plots. Received Many Honors
        Born on a farm near Pilger, Neb., he attended Yankton College in South Dakota in 1927 and received his bachelor's and master's degrees in agriculture from the University of Nebraska. He received his doctorate in agronomy from Washington State College, now Washington State University, in 1939.
        Among many honors, Mr. Vogel received the 1975 National Medal of Science, Washington State's first Medal of Merit in 1987 and the 1990 John Scott Award given by the City of Philadelphia for useful inventions. He was inducted into the Agricultural Research Service's Science Hall of Fame in 1987.
        Survivors besides his wife include a daughter, Evelyn Gullikson of Olympia, Wash.; a son, Dr. Richard Vogel of Bellingham, Wash.; a sister, Dorothy Brandstetter of Stanton, Neb.; a brother, Claires of Cape Coral, Fla.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
