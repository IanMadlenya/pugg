        Paul Alan Kaplan, a theatrical producer and board member of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, died on Monday at New York University Medical Center. He was 36 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, said Ralph Giarrusso, his companion.
        Mr. Kaplan graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania in 1977. For the next nine years he worked for the Stanley H. Kaplan Educational Center Ltd., named for his father, which offers tutoring for entrance and licensing examinations.
        Pursuing his interest in show business, Mr. Kaplan was an associate producer of "As Is," a drama about the impact of AIDS by William M. Hoffman. The play opened at the Circle Repertory Company in 1985 and moved to Broadway's Lyceum Theater. He was also the executive producer of the 1986 movie "Parting Glances."
        He joined the board of the community center in 1988 and was elected to its executive committee two years later.
        Mr. Kaplan is survived by his parents, Stanley H. and Rita J. Kaplan, of Manhattan, and two sisters, Susan Kaplan, of Brookline, Mass., and Nancy Kaplan Belsky, of Waban, Mass.
