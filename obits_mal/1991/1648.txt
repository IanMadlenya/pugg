        Calvin Hawley Oakes, a retired Foreign Service Officer and a former senior executive at the Central Intelligence Agency, died on July 18 at his daughter's home in East Hampton, L.I. He was 86 years old and lived in Washington.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his daughter, Sarah Lawrence Oakes, said.
        Mr. Oakes graduated from Yale University in 1926 and studied in Paris before joining the State Department in 1930. He served posts in Britain, Italy, Jamaica and Albania, before being named Consul at Calcutta, India, in 1936. He joined the C.I.A. as the agency was being formed in 1946 and was chief of the Southeast Asia branch.
        In 1948 he returned briefly to the State Department and served on the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan that dealt with the Kashmir issue. He resigned from the C.I.A. in 1954 but remained as a consultant until 1962. He also served on the board of directors of the Cuban-American Sugar Company until 1966.
        His daughter is his sole survivor.
