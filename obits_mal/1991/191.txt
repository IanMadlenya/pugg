        Louis Pergament, who opened a home-improvement store in 1935 in Franklin Square, L.I., which grew into the Pergament Home Centers chain, died early Saturday in the emergency room of Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. A resident of Palm Beach, he was 86 years old.
        His son Murray said he may have suffered a heart attack.
        The elder Mr. Pergament retired from the company 25 years ago after he and his two sons began the expansion. Pergament had grown to 35 stores in the Northeast by the time the younger Mr. Pergament, its long-time president, chairman and chief executive, sold it in 1989.
        Besides his son Murray, a resident of Old Westbury, L.I., Mr. Pergament is survived by his wife, the former Mollie Hollander; another son, Robert, of Boca Raton, Fla.; a brother, Nathan, of Sunrise, Fla.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
