        Dr. Charles Gardner Child 3d, former chairman of the departments of surgery at medical schools at Tufts University and the University of Michigan, died on Sunday at the Veterans Affairs nursing home in Atlanta. He was 83 years old and lived in Atlanta.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Child started the organ-transplant program at Michigan while he was chairman there from 1959 to 1974. Colleagues said he had made significant contributions to surgery of the pancreas and was an authority on portal hypertension, or high blood presssure in abdominal veins.
        He wrote three books and 147 articles on portal hypertension and for 13 years was the lead investigator for federally sponsored research on the subject.
        He was chairman of surgery at Tufts from 1953 to 1958 and was surgeon in chief at the New England Center Hospital-Pratt Diagnostic Clinic in Boston. He joined the faculty at Emory University in Atlanta in 1977 and taught there for seven years.
        A 1934 graduate of Cornell University Medical School, he was an attending surgeon at New York Hospital and a professor of clinical surgery at Cornell from 1947 to 1953.
        He was a consultant to Federal agencies and a member of numerous professional societies, including the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. He was also the editor of the Journal of Surgical Research and chairman of the American Board of Surgery.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; three daughters, Caroline Tucker of Hong Kong, Helen C. Child of Lacey, Wash., and Elizabeth Avsharian of Ann Arbor, Mich.; two sons, Dr. Cleland Child of Atlanta and Charles, also of Ann Arbor; a sister, Barbara Mountain of New Canaan, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.
