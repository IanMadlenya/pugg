        William Henry Joseph Kennedy Jr., a retired English professor and expert on the literature of the Renaissance in England and Italy, died Dec. 27 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Kennedy was an associate professor of English at Queensborough Community College from 1965 until his retirement in 1989.
        He earned a bachelor's degree at Harvard University in 1942 and after serving in the Navy during World War II, returned and earned a master's degree in 1947 and a Ph.D. in English in 1957. Before joining Queensborough College, he taught at Harvard, the Boston Latin School, the University of Pennsylvania, City College of New York and Baruch College.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Veronica Kennedy, a professor at St. John's University; and a daughter, Francesca, also of Manhattan.
