        Arthur Klar, a theater concessionaire and publisher of souvenir books for the New York City Ballet and many dance and opera productions, died on Oct. 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 96 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said Leah Klar Barr, his sister.
        Born across the street from the old Metropolitan Opera House, Mr. Klar began his life in the theater as one of the boys hired to sell opera librettos on the street. He soon graduated to selling the more elegant librettos inside the Met, where he also sang as a juvenile supernumerary.
        Mr. Klar moved into publishing when Sol Hurok gave him the contract to produce a souvenir book for Anna Pav lova's American tours. Mr. Klar traveled with the company on three coast-to-coast tours, through 1924. He was also the concessionaire for the 31 Shubert theaters around the country in the 1940's.
        In addition to his Mrs. Barr, Mr. Klar is survived by his wife, Marcella; a daughter, Gail McManus; another sister, Mildred Dorfman, and two grandsons, all of Manhattan.
