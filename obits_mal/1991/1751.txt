        Brig. Gen. Pio Yukwan Deng, a member of Sudan's ruling Revolutionary Command Council, died today, the official radio reported. He was 43 years old.
        The radio said he died of a heart attack at the military hospital in Khartoum. It gave no other details.
        General Deng was among three southerners on the 13-member junta. He advocated a peaceful end to the eight-year-old civil war between the country's Muslim majority in the north, which controls the Government, and rebels of the Christian and animist minority in the south.
