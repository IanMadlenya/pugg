        Marchmont Schwartz, a two-time all-America running back at Notre Dame who later became head football coach at Stanford, died of heart failure Thursday. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Schwartz was hospitalized in nearby Walnut Creek after suffering a heart attack about two weeks ago, John Schwartz, one of his sons, said.
        Mr. Schwartz, a back, starred on the 1930 undefeated national championship team coached by Knute Rockne, and he also earned all-America honors in 1931. He set a school single-season record of 960 yards rushing. In 1974, Mr. Schwartz was named to the College Football Hall of Fame.
        He became Stanford coach in 1942, and his first team had a 6-4 record. The football program was suspended for three seasons during World War II.
