        George Kaminsky, a lawyer in Manhattan for more than 40 years and a former New York State Assemblyman, died on Thursday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 84 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said a family spokeswoman.
        Mr. Kaminsky, a graduate of New York University Law School, was a Democratic member of the Assembly from Brooklyn in 1935 and 1936. Each year, he sponsored a bill to repeal the law requiring a loyalty oath by teachers. He specialized in criminal and matrimonial law, and he retired in the mid-1970's.
        He is survived by two daughters, Ann Kreeger and Nina Sweet, both of Manhattan; four sisters, Sylvia Miller of Douglaston, Queens, Freda Zierer of Manhattan, Mary Goldstein of Monticello, N.Y., and Molly Kaminsky of Brooklyn; a brother, Morris Kaminsky of Brooklyn, and five grandchildren.
