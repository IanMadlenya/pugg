        Oliver Gleichenhaus, whose spicy "Ollieburgers" were sold nationwide, died Thursday after open-heart surgery. He was 79 years old.
        He opened Ollie's Sandwich Shop in the mid-1930's, and his secret recipe for hamburgers made the shop popular for years.
        In 1971, John Y. Brown, who made a fortune building up Col. Sanders' Kentucky Fried Chicken, bought Mr. Gleichenhaus's recipe for $1 million. The recipe was never made public.
        Mr. Brown then introduced the Ollieburger through his Lums restaurant chain, a new chain called Ollie's and mobile restaurants called Ollie's Trolleys.
