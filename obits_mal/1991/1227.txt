        Dr. Samuel Gartner, an ophthalmologist who practiced in New York for 65 years, died on Monday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 89 years old.
        He had cancer and died in his sleep, his daughter said.
        Dr. Gartner served on the medical staff at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx for half a century, as a physician, teacher and first chairman of its ophthalmology department. A specialist in ocular pathology, he was also an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        Dr. Gartner, a 1925 graduate of Long Island College Medical School, joined the staff at Montefiore in 1941 and was named president of the medical board in 1959. He retired in 1970, but was asked to return and remained active in the ophthalmology department, including serving as chairman of the residency selection committee, until last year.
        He was also affiliated with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary and the Bronx Eye and Ear Infirmary and wrote scores of articles on cataracts and other eye problems. He was a member of many professional societies, including the Association for Research in Ophthalmology, and had been president of the New York Society for Clinical Ophthalmology.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Bessie Gersten; a daughter, Irene Oppenheim of Belle Mead, N.J.; a son, Jerome, of Brooklyn; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
