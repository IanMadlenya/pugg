        Walter Reder, a Nazi war criminal who ordered the deaths of hundreds of Italian villagers, has died in a Vienna hospital, a news agency reported on Thursday. He was 75 years old.
        The Austrian Press Agency did not say when Mr. Reder had died or give the cause of his death.
        Mr. Reder last made headlines in 1985, when he returned to his native Austria after nearly 40 years in an Italian prison. He was met at the airport by the Defense Minister, Friedhelm Frischenschlager, who shook his hand and escorted him to officers' quarters. The cordial welcome of a convicted war criminal was condemned worldwide.
        Mr. Reder, a major in Hitler's elite SS, was captured in 1948 by British forces occupying Styria Province in Austria. He was extradited to Italy and convicted of sending hundreds of people from the Italian village of Marzabotto to their deaths. The Italian authorities said he had given the order for at least 600 of the 1,800 killings in the Marzabotto region.
        He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was paroled in January 1985.
