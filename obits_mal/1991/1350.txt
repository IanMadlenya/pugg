        Charles J. Fuschillo, a member of the Town Council of North Hempstead, L.I., since 1975, died yesterday at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. He was 62 years old and lived in Westbury, L.I.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was a retired manager of industrial relations for the Grumman Corporation, and he announced earlier this year that he would not seek re-election in November.
        He was a graduate of Hofstra University and received a master's degree in economics and finance from Adelphi University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Connie Palermo; two daughters, Elena Kehoe and Lisa Fuschillo, both of Westbury, L.I.; a son, Charles Jr., also of Westbury; and three grandchildren.
