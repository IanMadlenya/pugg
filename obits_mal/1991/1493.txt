        Amulya Lal Laskar, an expert on solid-state materials and a professor of physics, died Friday at Anderson Memorial Hospital in Anderson, S.C. He was 60 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Laskar, who was on the faculty at Clemson University, conducted wide-ranging research that advanced the development of solid-state batteries like the miniature ones used in heart pacemakers.
        Dr. Laskar, who was born in Dhaka, India, received a bachelor's degree from Surendra Nath College in Calcutta, a master's degree from Calcutta University and a doctorate degree from the University of Illinois. He taught at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kharagpur from 1953 to 1965 and at the University of North Carolina from 1965 to 1968, when he joined Clemson.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Renu Chakravarti Laskar, a professor of mathematics at Clemson; two sons, Joy of Urbana, Ill., and Sanjoy Raja of Clemson; four brothers, John of Washington and Nripendra, Shankar and Pradit, all of Calcutta, and two sisters, Namita Chakraborty of Calcutta and Chabi Roy of Durgapur, India.
