        Mitchell H. Cohen, a senior Federal District Judge and a former prosecutor in Camden County, N.J., died on Monday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 86 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Judge Cohen, a Republican, was appointed to the Federal bench in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy and in 1973 was named Chief Judge of the United States District Court for New Jersey. He had served as a judge on the Camden County Court and the New Jersey Superior Court.
        As Camden County Prosecutor, a part-time post he held from 1948 to 1958, he gained wide attention when he handled the case of Howard Unruh, who shot 13 people to death in East Camden in 1949 and who was judged insane and committed to a mental institution.
        Judge Cohen was born in Philadelpha, the son of a harness maker. He received his law degree from Dickinson Law School in Carlisle, Pa., and entered private practice. Active in Republican politics, he held a series of lower-court posts in Camden before becoming county prosecutor.
        He is survived by a son, Fredric Cohen, a lawyer in Camden and a resident of Philadelphia; a daughter, Peggy Braveman of Philadelphia, and two grandsons.
