        Alfred Hinds, a burglar and safecracker from London's East End who gained folk-hero status as a prison escapee, died on Friday. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Hinds taught himself law and argued his cases in 17 court appearances. While a fugitive, he sent letters to newspapers asserting that he had not taken part in a furniture store robbery for which he received a 12-year sentence in 1953.
        In 1955, he escaped from prison by copying a key to the jail workshop after memorizing its shape. He was captured in Ireland eight months later.
        Mr. Hinds escaped from two prison guards while at a court in London in 1957 and broke out of prison in 1958 by making a key to a bathhouse.
        After his release in 1964 he gave lectures arguing for a more intelligent police force.
