        Harlan Hobart Grooms, a senior Federal district judge whose desegregation rulings led Gov. George C. Wallace to stand in the door of a university building to block entry by blacks, died Friday. Judge Grooms was 90.
        Judge Grooms died at his home in Birmingham.
        In 1962, three blacks, including Vivian Malone, sued to be admitted to the University of Alabama, and Judge Grooms ordered the school to accept them as students.
        But Mr. Wallace, who was then Governor, vowed to keep blacks from attending the university. After a brief confrontation in a doorway at the university, however, Governor Wallace stepped aside and Miss Malone became its first black student, in 1963.
        Judge Grooms, who was a native of rural Montgomery County in Kentucky, received a law degree from the University of Kentucky in 1926.
        He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In his law practice, he was a senior partner in Spain, Gillon, Grooms & Young in Birmingham.
        Survivors include his wife, Angeline; two sons, Harlan Hobart Grooms Jr. and John Franklin Grooms of Birmingham, and two daughters, Betsy Edmonds of Bellevue, Wash., and Angi Proctor of Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.
