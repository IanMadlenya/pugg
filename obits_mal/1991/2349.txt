        Ralph E. Good, a biologist whose studies of the New Jersey Pinelands helped lead to the preservation of 1.1 million acres covering nearly a fourth of the state, died on Tuesday at his home in Haddonfield, N.J. He was 54 years old.
        He died of throat cancer, his family said.
        In 24 years at the Rutgers University campus in Camden, he was a botany professor, director of the graduate biology program and biology chairman.
        Tidal marshes and other wetlands were his special interests. Drawing nearly $1 million in grants, Professor Good directed studies that provided the research for Congress's creation of the Pineland National Reserve in 1978 and its later designation as a coastal plain reserve by Unesco, the United Nations agency.
        He was elected president of the New Jersey Academy of Sciences from 1978 to 1980, appointed to the Governor's Science Advisory Committee in 1987 and named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1990. He was also a consultant to the state Environmental Protection Department and National Park Service.
        Born in Chicago, he grew up in nearby Westmont, Ill. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in botany from the University of Illinois and a doctorate in ecology at Rutgers.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Norma Frauendorf; a daughter, Karen, of Haddonfield; three brothers, William, of Scottsdale, Ariz., Robert, of Downers Grove, Ill., and Thomas, of Asheville, N.C.; and a sister, Sarah, of Nenana, Alaska.
