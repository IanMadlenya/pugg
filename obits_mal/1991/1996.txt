        Roger B. Henkle, a professor of English and of media and culture at Brown University, died while jogging in Providence, R.I., on Oct. 5. He was 55 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Carol Thompson Henkle.
        Professor Henkle, a native of Lincoln, Neb., graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1956 and the Harvard Law School in 1959. He received his doctorate in English from Stanford University.
        He had been at Brown since 1968 and was chairman of the English department from 1981 to 1984. His specialty was 19th-century literature, although he taught a popular course in journalistic writing.
        He received numerous awards and fellowships, including the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Fellowship in 1964 and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1984.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Henkle is survived by a son, Timothy R. Henkle of Alexandria, Va.; a daughter, Jennifer K. Henkle of Baltimore, and a brother, James L. Henkle of Norman, Okla.
