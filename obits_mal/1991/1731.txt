        Walter F. Diehl, the international president of the stage and film workers' union Iatse from 1974 to 1986, died on Monday at his home in Allendale, Fla. He was 84 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said a union spokesman, Walter Blanchard, in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Diehl started out in Boston as a projectionist in 1927 and joined the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators of the United States and Canada five years later. He held several union posts in New England before becoming assistant international president in 1957.
        After retiring as president, he remained active as a member of the board of Iatse (pronounced YAT-see), an A.F.L.-C.I.O. affiliate.
        Mr. Diehl is survived by a son, two daughters and nine grandchildren.
