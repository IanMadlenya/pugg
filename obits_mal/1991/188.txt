        Dr. Arnold Rosenblum, the director of the International Institute of Theoretical Physics at Utah State University, died on Tuesday at his home in Logan, Utah. He was 45 years old.
        His death resulted from a grand mal seizure, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Rosenblum specialized in relativity, supergravity, optical parallel computing, solar energy and astrophysics. He was a native of Brooklyn whose degrees in physics included a bachelor's at Columbia, a master's at the University of Pennsylvania and a doctorate at Temple.
        His research honors included a Harvard Smithsonian Award in 1981 and a Humboldt Award in 1983. He wrote three books and many papers.
        The only immediate survivor is his mother, Dorothy, of Brooklyn.
