        Werner Henke, a petroleum engineer who invented a process for controlling industrial air pollution, died Saturday at his home in Lafayette, La., at the age of 75.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Gertrude Henke.
        Mr. Henke was the founder and president of the Nitrogen/Nergas Corporation and held patents in the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany.
        Among his achievements were the development of a method of oil recovery using pressure to extract oil from previously tapped wells and a system for removing many pollutants from the exhaust of industrial engines. His company said the system was widely used, including in Southern California, where the regional air quality agency ranked it as the best technology available for the purpose.
        Born in Berlin, Mr. Henke moved to the United States with his parents when he was a teen-ager. After graduating from Southern Methodist University, he worked as a field engineer in the petroleum industry and became the engineering manager for the Eastman Oilwell Company in Lafayette, where he met his future wife.
        During World War II, he was the chief engineering consultant for the regional War Production Board in New Orleans and was later a research and development officer for the Army in Aberdeen, Md.
        After the war, Mr. Henke returned to Lafayette as president and general manager of American Machinery Inc., before starting his own company.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Otto Henke of Dallas, and five children, Kenneth and Richard Henke, Susan Romero and Mary Prudhomme, all of Lafayette, and Lucy Louise Henke of Richmond and Kennebunkport, Me.
