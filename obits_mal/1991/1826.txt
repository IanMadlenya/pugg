        Dr. David A. Dreiling, a retired surgery professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, died on Tuesday in his apartment in Hollywood, Fla. He was 73 years old and lived in Florida after retiring last year.
        He died of prostate cancer, said a friend, Dr. Arthur Aufses.
        In 1977 Dr. Dreiling became the first holder of Mount Sinai's Alfred and Florence Gross professorship in surgery. He specialized in gastrointestinal and pancreatic diseases. He wrote scholarly articles and books on the pancreas and had received numerous awards in his field.
        Over the years, Dr. Dreiling was vice chairman of the department of surgery at the Mount Sinai Medical Center and director of experimental gastrointestinal surgery there and of its center for laboratory animal sciences.
        He was born in Brooklyn, studied at Cornell University and earned his M.D. degree in 1942 from New York University. His first affiliation with Mount Sinai was as an intern from 1942 to 1944. He went on to become chief of surgery at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens from 1964 to 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Oppenheimer; a son, David Jr., of Salem, Ore., and three grandchildren.
