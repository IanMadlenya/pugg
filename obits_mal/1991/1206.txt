        Vladimir M. Petrov, a Soviet spy whose defection in 1954 opened espionage investigations in Australia, died on Friday, officials announced today. He was 84 years old.
        No cause of death was given.
        Mr. Petrov died at Mount Royal Hospital, where he had been treated for several years.
        After his defection, he was given a new identity by the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, and an order barred news organizations from publishing information on his whereabouts.
        Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced the defection of Mr. Petrov, a third secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, on April 13, 1954, and immediately set up a commission to investigate Soviet espionage activities in Australia. The next day, Mr. Menzies called an election. His Liberal Party, behind in the polls at the start of the campaign, won Parliament by seven seats.
        Mr. Petrov is survived by his wife, Yedvokiya, the Government said.
