        Allan M. Schneider, a real-estate broker on eastern Long Island, died on Friday at a friend's house in East Hampton. He was 54 years old and lived in East Hampton.
        He died of a heart attack, a business associate, Barbara Richey, said.
        In 1974, he started his company, Allan M. Schneider & Associates, in Bridgehampton after selling real estate in the area for several years. Over the next 17 years, he opened offices in Sag Harbor, Southampton, East Hampton and Amagansett.
        His company recently formed an exclusive affiliation with Douglas Elliman, the New York City real-estate firm.
        Born in Brooklyn Heights, Mr. Schneider attended Princeton and had worked for an advertising firm in Manhattan.
        He was vice president of the board of trustees of the East Hampton Historical Society and worked in local civic and cultural organizations.
