        Bill McPeak, head coach of the Washington Redskins from 1961 to 1965 and for the last dozen years the director of professional scouting for the New England Patriots, died of a heart attack Tuesday at his home in Foxboro, Mass., Patriots officials said. He was 64 years old and had recently retired.
        A native of New Castle, Pa., he was a star end at the University of Pittsburgh. He was a 14th-round draft pick of the Steelers, played defensive end for Pittsburgh from 1949 to 1957 and was selected for the Pro Bowl three times. After his playing career, he continued with the Steelers as an assistant and was named head coach of the Redskins at the age of 35.
        With Washington, Mr. McPeak compiled a 21-46-3 record, coaching such stars as Sonny Jurgensen, Sam Huff and Bobby Mitchell. He was an assistant with the Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins from 1967 to 1974, when he suffered a stroke. After five years of rehabilitation, he joined the Patriots.
        Mr. McPeak is survived by a daughter, Leslie Mangano of Herndon, Va.; a sister, Eileen Linden of Manassas, Va., and a brother, Dr. Charles McPeak of New York.
