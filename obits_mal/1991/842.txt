        Edward H. Gauer, a San Francisco clothier who founded the Roos/ Atkins chain, died of complications of emphysema on Tuesday at the Eisenhower Medical Center near Palm Desert. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Gauer was a boy when he entered the men's wear business as a journeyman hatter in Danbury, Conn. He moved west in 1929 and managed clothing stores in Los Angeles and San Francisco before buying the Robert S. Atkins store in 1945. He bought the Roos Brothers chain in 1957 and formed Roos/Atkins, expanding the chain to 51 stores before it merged with Genesco in 1967. He was a former president of the Menswear Retailers of America.
        Mr. Gauer retired from the clothing business in 1969. He spent the last years of his life developing a cattle ranch in Sonoma County, Calif.
        He is survived by his wife, Marion; a son; a daughter, and three grandchildren.
