        Benjamin Hunningher, a retired Columbia University professor and an expert on drama and Dutch culture, died on Thursday at his home in Southbury, Conn.
        He was 88 years old. He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Hunningher was born in Flushing in the Netherlands and grew up in Amsterdam. He obtained his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Utrecht and was a drama and art critic for a daily newspaper, De Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant, from 1935 to 1942. He also taught Dutch history and literature in Amsterdam and The Hague, and from 1945 to 1948 headed the theater department in the Dutch Ministry of Education.
        During World War II, he worked in the resistance against the Nazis by organizing secret meetings and raising money to help actors and artists who lost their jobs because they refused to cooperate with the Government.
        In 1948 he went to Columbia, where he taught the history, literature and language of the Low Countries until 1964, when he returned to Holland to teach drama at the University of Amsterdam. He retired there in 1973 and went back to the United States as a drama lecturer at Harvard in 1975 and 1976.
        He was the recipient of Rockefeller and Guggenheim Foundation fellowships and wrote 10 books on theater, some in English and some in Dutch, and many articles for scholarly journals.
        His survivors include two sons, Reinout, of Southbury, Conn., and Joost, of London; a daughter, L. V. North of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
