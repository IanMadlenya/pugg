        Thomas W. Greelish, a former United States Attorney for New Jersey, died on Sunday while attending a picnic here. He was 51 years old and lived in Mendham, N.J.
        He apparently suffered a heart attack, said W. Hunt Dumont, who preceded Mr. Greelish as United States Attorney and who was with him on Sunday.
        Mr. Greelish was United States Attorney from August 1985 to March 1987, when he resigned to enter private practice. Previously he had been an assistant prosecutor under United States Attorney Herbert J. Stern and First Assistant Attorney General for New Jersey.
        As United States Attorney, he undertook successful crackdowns on organized crime, white-collar fraud and drug trafficking.
        More recently Mr. Greelish was a partner in the LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae law firm, working out of its Newark office.
        He was a graduate of Rutgers University and Seton Hall Law School.
        Survivors include his wife, Peggy Ann, and a daughter, Sharon.
