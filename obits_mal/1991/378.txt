        William T. Cowin, a retired justice of the New York State Supreme Court, died on Friday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 89 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of pneumonia, his wife, Pauline, said.
        Justice Cowin served on the bench for 16 years before retiring in 1976. A Republican in heavily Democratic Brooklyn, he had run repeatedly for the post but was unsuccessful. Finally, in 1969, after having been appointed by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to fill successive vacancies, he won a seat on the bench with the endorsement of both the Democratic and Republican Parties.
        After graduating from New York University and the Columbia University Law School, he had a varied career in the law. He served as secretary to a Federal judge, then had a private practice before being appointed an assistant United States attorney in 1929. He held that position until 1934, and was one of three bankruptcy trustees of the Prudence Company, a mortgage company, in the late 1930's.
        Justice Cowin served with the Coast Guard during World War II and then joined the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Seymour, and a sister, Mildred Greene, both of Williamstown, Mass.
