        Herbert Levy Werner, an international management consultant, died on Tuesday at New Rochelle Hospital. He was 82 years old and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Werner was born and educated in Berlin and earned a degree in textile engineering from Reutlingen College in 1930. He came to the United States in 1938 and founded Werner Associates, an international management consulting firm that advised the textile industry. The firm later became a subsidiary of the Leasco Data Processing Equipment Corporation, known subsequently as the Reliance Group, and Mr. Werner continued as a private consultant to the textile, cosmetics and heavy equipment industries.
        He was active in Jewish community affairs, including Israel bond drives in Westchester County, and served on the board of Westchester Jewish Community Services.
        He is survived by his wife, Stella; two daughters, Laurel Bauer of Amherst, Mass., and Beryl Elon of New Rochelle; a son, Jeffrey, of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and four grandchildren.
