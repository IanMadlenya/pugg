        Randolfo Pacciardi, an Italian anti-Fascist who organized Italian-American volunteers to fight with the Allies in World War II, died on Sunday in Rome. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Pacciardi, who was born in the Tuscan town of Grosseto, fought in World War I as a teen-ager and was awarded the British as well as the Italian Military Cross. After the war he received a doctorate in law from the University of Rome and went into politics, organizing a Free Italy movement in opposition to Mussolini's Black Shirts.
        Twice wounded by Fascist assailants, he was arrested in 1926 and sentenced to five years in a penal colony. He escaped in 1927, fled to Switzerland and began organizing an anti-Fascist resistance. In the Spanish Civil War he commanded the Garibaldi Brigade, part of the international force on the Republican side.
        After the Spanish Republic's defeat, he came to the United States and founded the Italian Legion, which recruited Italian-Americans to fight against the Axis.
        When the war ended, he returned home, became a leader of the small Republican Party and served as Minister of Defense in several postwar governments.
