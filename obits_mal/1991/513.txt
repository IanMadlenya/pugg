        Dr. W. Edward McGough, a psychiatrist and a breeder and judge of dogs, died on Wednesday at his home in Jackson Heights, Queens. He was 62 years old and had his primary residence in Colts Neck, N.J.
        Dr. McGough was professor of psychiatry at Duke University and Rutgers University until he retired in 1987. A graduate of St. Peter's College, he received his medical degree from Duke. He was a past president of the New Jersey Psychiatric Society and was a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.
        Dr. McGough was a widely known breeder of Cardigan Welsh Corgis, a short-legged dog with a foxlike head and long tail. His entries won prizes at many dog shows across the country. He also served for several terms as president of the Monmouth County Kennel Club in New Jersey and judged at shows in this country and in Europe.
        He is survived by a brother, Leo, of Fort Lee, N.J.
