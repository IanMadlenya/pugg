        Dr. Joseph Lawrence Goldman, a retired professor and chairman of the ear, nose and throat department of Mount Sinai Medical Center, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        He died suddenly of a heart attack, his son, James, said.
        Dr. Goldman, an authority on the treatment of sinusitis and cancer of the larynx, was associated with Mount Sinai for more than 50 years. He was the author of scores of articles and book chapters based on his research and trained more than 40 younger otolaryngologists now active at hospitals and medical schools throughout the country.
        A native of Brooklyn, he graduated from Columbia College and Long Island College Hospital Medical School. He spent his residency at Mount Sinai and returned to the hospital after four years of service during World War II in the Army Medical Corps, in which he attained the rank of colonel.
        He was named chairman of the Mount Sinai department in 1954. After becoming chairman emeritus in 1972, he continued as a teacher and practitioner at Mount Sinai until he retired in 1987. He also held academic appointments at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons and the New York University School of Medicine.
        Besides his son, a resident of Penn Valley, Pa., Dr. Goldman is survived by his second wife, the former Selma Jaffe; his two daughters, Betty Sevin of Rye, N.Y., and Barbara Steinbach of Rockville, Md., and six grandchildren.
