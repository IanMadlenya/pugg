        Martin S. Auer, a prominent Onondaga County Republican who served in the New York State Senate for 12 years, died on Tuesday at University Hospital in Syracuse. He was 72 years old and lived in Syracuse.
        He died of a heart attack, said his son Michael.
        Mr. Auer, who also served as chairman of the Onondaga County Republican Party from 1970 to 1974, was first elected to the State Senate in 1972. Before that he had served as city auditor in Syracuse and as a ward supervisor there.
        In 1980, despite a guilty plea to a charge of participating in a kickback scheme that benefited the local Republican Party and his later conviction of conspiracy to intimidate county workers into making contributions to the party, he was re-elected to office by almost 7,000 votes. He won easily again in 1982 but in 1984 was defeated by a margin of 233 votes in the heavily Republican district.
        Mr. Auer, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the owner and chief executive officer of Auer & Company, a wholesale candy and tobacco business.
        He is survived by two sons, Martin Jr., of Hancock, Mich., and Michael, of Syracuse; a daughter, Virginia A. Murphy of Syracuse, and four grandchildren.
