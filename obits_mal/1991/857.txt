        Stanley Diamond, a poet and anthropologist who founded the anthropology department at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver cancer, his wife said.
        Dr. Diamond, a 1951 Ph.D. graduate of Columbia University, founded a program in anthropology at the New School in 1966. It developed into a full department, and he served as its chairman until 1983, when he was named Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Humanities at the New School and also Poet in the University.
        Before that he had held teaching positions at Brandeis and Syracuse Universities and later was a visiting professor in Berlin and Mexico and at Bard College.
        His research took him to Israel, Nigeria and Biafra and to the Seneca Indian Nation in upstate New York. He founded Dialectical Anthropology, a journal of the social sciences, and published several books, including several volumes of poetry, with "Totems" and "Going West" among them.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie Josephine; their daughter, Sarah, of Manhattan, and two daughters by a previous marriage, Tanya Priber of Montclair, N.J., and Diana Alschuler Diamond of Manhattan; his mother, Mary Diamond, also of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
