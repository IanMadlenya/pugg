        Dr. Daniel Horn, professor of European history at Rutgers University, died on Monday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 56 years old and lived in Highland Park, N.J.
        He died as a result of continuing heart problems, a spokesman for the family said.
        Dr. Horn joined the faculty at Rutgers in 1964. He was born in Vienna and was a 1956 graduate of Brooklyn College. He received an M.A. from Columbia University in 1957 and a Ph.D. in 1963. He taught European history at City College in Manhattan, at Temple University in Philadelphia and at New Brunswick Theological Seminary.
        He was a fellow of the National Endowment of the Humanities and a member of the board of the Jewish Historical Society.
        He wrote several books. He was co-author, with David Oshinsky and Richard McCormick, of "The Case of the Nazi Professor" (Rutgers University Press; 1989), which dealt with the disputed dismissal of an instructor of German in 1935 at the New Jersey College for Women, now Douglass College.
        Dr. Horn is survived by his wife, the former Marcia Ginsburg; a son, Jeremy, of Highland Park; two daughters, Shari Lazarus of Elkins Park, Pa., and Deborah Horn of Edison, N.J., and a grandchild.
