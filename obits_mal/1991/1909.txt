        Austin T. Graves, who was president of John Wanamaker, New York, when the Manhattan department store closed in 1954 and who was later president and chief executive of Gruen Industries, died on Sept. 10 at his home in Port St. Lucie, Fla. He was 82 years old.
        The Port St. Lucie police said Mr. Graves and his wife, Mary, 80, were shot to death in their home by their son, Austin T. Graves Jr., 49, who lived with them and who had been appointed their guardian by the State of Florida. The police said the son then killed himself.  The younger Mr. Graves apparently could not handle the pressure of family responsibilities, the police said.
        The elder Mr. Graves was born in Louisville, Ky., and was a graduate of the University of Kentucky. Before going to John Wanamaker, New York, Mr. Graves had been with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago as a vice president and assistant general manager.
        His career at Wanamaker was brief; he arrived in 1953 and presided over the store's closing little more than a year later.
        For several years, he was associated with John D. Rockefeller 4th in an importing venture called Products of Asia. In the early 1960's he joined Gruen Industries, Inc., the maker of Gruen watches. He was named president and chief executive officer in 1967, became chairman in 1973 and retired in the late 1970's, said a granddaughter, Cynthia Campbell.
        According to news reports, Mr. and Mrs. Graves moved to Port St. Lucie in 1980 from Darien, Conn., and had been in their son's care since then.
        They had apparently been planning to sell their Florida home to move back to Connecticut to be close to their daughter, Linda Burns of Weston, Conn. The other survivors are Ms. Campbell, two other grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
