        Gaser Tabakoglu, an interior designer who transformed the Gallery at the Carlyle Hotel into a sultan's dining room from a 17th-century harem, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 36 years old and lived in London and Manhattan.
        He died of a brain tumor, a friend, Donald Claunch, said.
        Mr. Tabakoglu, a native of Istanbul, Turkey, was the American assistant to Renzo Mongiardino, the Milanese designer. In 1989 Mr. Tabakoglu commissioned artists in Milan to hand-paint the wallpaper that covers walls and screens in the octagonal room at the Carlyle Hotel's center. His inspiration was Topkapi Palace in Istanbul.
        Mr. Tobakoglu was educated in Venice and England and came to the United States in 1979.
        He is survived by two sisters, Najda Manufyan of Munich, Germany, and Seta Ayda Wilkinson of Istanbul.
