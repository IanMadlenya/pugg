        A. L. Philpott, the Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates and a political ally of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, died of cancer at his home on Saturday. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Philpott struggled with cancer for nearly two decades. Most recently, he had suffered from lymphatic cancer. Earlier he had suffered from cancer of the stomach, prostate gland and gallbladder. On Tuesday he had announced he would not seek to extend his 33-year legislative career because of declining health.
        Elected to state office in 1957 from the state's tobacco and furniture region, Mr. Philpott used that power bloc of rural, conservative Democrats to become Virginia's most powerful legislator. He became majority leader in the House of Delegates in 1978 and was chosen Speaker in 1980.
        Mr. Philpott supported racial segregation when he entered the Legislature in 1958. In 1982 he blocked an attempt by Mr. Wilder, then a State Senator, to have the state establish a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Mr. Wilder called for Mr. Philpott's resignation.
        But Mr. Philpott's early endorsement of Mr. Wilder's campaign to become lieutenant govenor three years later was crucial to the Wilder victory then and to Mr. Wilder's election as governor in 1989. The two had continued to have a close working relationship during the Governor's tenure.
        A native of Bassett, Va., and an Army veteran, Mr. Philpott attended the University of Richmond and its law school before running for election from Henry County.
        Mr. Philpott, is survived by his wife, Katherine A. Spencer Philpott of Bassett, and two children, Albert Lee Jr., of Fredericksburg, Va., and Judy Philpott Divers of Richmond. A second daughter, Carole Apperson Philpott, died several years ago.
