        Nana Yao Opare Dinizulu, founder of the troupe called Dinizulu and His African Dancers, Drummers and Singers, died on Sunday in Camden, N.J., after collapsing at Camden High School before a concert. He was 60 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of a heart attack, said a member of the Camden medical examiner's staff.
        For more than 40 years Mr. Dinizulu presided over the critically acclaimed company of dancers, drummers and singers that he termed "the oldest African dance company in America."
        He was born in Augusta, Ga., and traced his lineage to Ghana. He traveled to Africa frequently and in Ghana received the titles of Omanhene and Okomfohene, or chief and spiritual leader, of the Akan tribe. Nana is a Ghanaian title of respect.
        In the United States, he helped promote African customs and traditions with special emphasis on the Akan religion.
        Duku Anokye, a spokeswoman for the family, said that Akan custom prohibited the family from listing the names of survivers.
