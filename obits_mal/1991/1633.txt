        Irwin H. Pizer, a former health-sciences librarian and professor of library administration for the University of Illinois at Chicago, died on Monday at his home in Chicago. He was 56 years old.
        He died of colon cancer, the university said.
        Mr. Pizer directed the library at the State University of New York's Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse from 1964 to 1969 and was director of libraries at the State University in Buffalo from 1969 to 1971, when he assumed his posts at Illinois. He retired last year.
        He served as editor of the bulletin of the Medical Library Association. Earlier this year the association gave Mr. Pizer its highest honor, the Marcia C. Noyes Award.
        He was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and was a graduate of Antioch College with a master's degree from Columbia University.
        He is survived by a sister, Roslyn Weisner, of Queens Village.
