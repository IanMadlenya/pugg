        George P. Hunt, an artist and writer who was a former managing editor of Life magazine, died on Saturday at his home in Hobe Sound, Fla. He was 72 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for Life said.
        Mr. Hunt spent most of his career with Time Inc., starting in 1940 as an office boy. In World War II, he served with the Marine Corps for 31 months in the Southwest Pacific and was awarded a Navy Cross for valor in the battle of Peleliu Island and a Silver Star for gallantry in action on the island of New Britain.
        After the war, he returned to Time Inc. as a writer for Fortune magazine and transferred to Life in 1948, where he served in a variety of posts before being named managing editor in 1961. In 1971 he was named editor of Time-Life Films, a post he held until he retired in 1973.
        He then became a professional portrait and landscape artist, exhibiting his oils and watercolors in Palm Beach, Fla., and in Mexico.
        Mr. Hunt was born in Philadelphia and was a graduate of Amherst College.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Anita Eller; a son, George Jr., of Roanoke, Va.; two daughters, Donna Clarke of Palm Beach and Barre O'Neill of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
