        Richard L. Blum Jr., the retired chairman of Julius Wile Sons & Company, national importers of wines and spirits, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and lived in Millbrook, N.Y.
        He died of a heart attack, a family member said.
        Mr. Blum was the fourth generation of his family to work with Julius Wile, serving as its chairman from 1951 until his retirement in 1977. He was named honorary chairman of the company's successor, the Buckingham Wile Company in Lake Success, L.I.
        During his tenure at Wile, the company developed marketing ideas that led to the growth of sales of such well-known wines and spirits as Benedictine, B.&B. liqueur, Dry Sack Sherry and Bollinger Champagne.
        In 1974, Mr. Blum was named a Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur by the French Government for his work in advancing Franco-American relations. He was a former chairman of the National Association of Alcoholic Beverage Importers and president of the New York Importers and Distillers Association.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Blum graduated from the Woodmere Academy and Harvard. Joining the family company in 1938, he was sent to Europe to study the wine and spirits industry, but his three-year mission was cut short by World War II, where he served in the Navy.
        He is survived by his son, Richard 3d; daughter, Eleanore H.; a stepson, Cornelius Marx, and his mother, Eleanore L., all of Manhattan; a brother, Howard, of Santa Ynez, Calif., and one grandchild.
