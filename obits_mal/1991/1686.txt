        Helmy Kresa, a songwriter and the principal arranger and orchestrator for Irving Berlin, died on Monday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island.  He was 86 years old and lived in Bayside, Queens.
        He died of pneumonia, said his son, Kent Kresa.
        Mr. Kresa's was the first published arrangement of "All of Me," written by Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons. Mr. Kresa composed the instrumental sound track for Martin Scorsese's film "Raging Bull" and, with Carroll Loveday, he wrote "That's My Desire," which Frankie Laine recorded. In 1926, Mr. Kresa began working for Mr. Berlin and eventually became the general professional manager of the Irving Berlin Music Company.
        In addition to his son, who lives in Los Angeles, he is survived by his wife, Marjorie Jean.
