        Gary Hager, an interior decorator with the Manhattan-based firm Parish-Hadley Associates, died yesterday at his sister's home in Williamsville in Erie County. He was 40 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Hager worked for clients including Henry and Nancy Kissinger, Connie Chung and members of the Astor and Whitney families, Irene Carter of Parish-Hadley said.
        Orderliness was the most important consideration in Mr. Hager's approach to decorating. "Space is such a luxury," he once said, "Why give it up to clutter and confusion?"
        He grew up in East Aurora in Erie County, went to Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., and joined the firm in 1977.
        Besides his sister, Cathy Smith of Williamsville, he is survived by his parents, Glenn and Joanne Hager of Winter Springs, Fla., and three brothers, Timothy, of Venice, Fla., Michael, of Sarasota, Fla., and Patrick, of Allegany County, N.Y.
