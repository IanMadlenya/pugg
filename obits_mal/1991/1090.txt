        Tom Cassidy, a Cable News Network business newscaster who told viewers about his struggle with AIDS, died Sunday of complications from the disease. He was 41 years old.
        Mr. Cassidy came to CNN's business news department in New York in 1981 as a newscaster and reporter. The next year, he founded "Pinnacle", a weekend program about business leaders.
        Mr. Cassidy's condition was diagnosed as AIDS in 1987, and last March he was the show's topic. He discussed his life with the fatal disease and his decision to go public with it.
        "It was unbelievable the pressure that was lifted off my shoulders when suddenly everybody knew," he said. "There's something about AIDS that's quite powerful -- it's awfully final."
        Mr. Cassidy went to CNN from Mutual Radio in Chicago, where he was business editor. He began his broadcasting career in 1978 as a reporter and newscaster for KEZI-TV in Eugene, Ore. He then moved to KGO-TV in San Francisco.
        Mr. Cassidy, a Boston native, graduated from Bowdoin College and received two master's degrees from Columbia University, in finance and journalism.
