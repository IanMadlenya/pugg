        Leo J. Koury, who was wanted for two murders here and had been on the F.B.I.'s 10-most-wanted list since 1979, died of a brain hemorrhage at a San Diego hospital last Monday. He was 56 years old.
        Mr. Koury had been admitted to the hospital under an alias, William Franklin Biddle. On Friday, an anonymous caller told an acquaintance of Mr. Koury about his death, and the acquaintance notified the authorities.
        Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation here said they had not yet determined what Mr. Koury had been doing in San Diego or how long he had been there.
        Mr. Koury, who owned several Richmond bars catering to homosexuals, was indicted in 1978 on numerous charges resulting from his feud with rival owners of gay bars. Among the accusations was that he had killed a bouncer at one bar and had sent a gunman to another, where one person was killed and another wounded.
        Soon after his indictment, he vanished. When he died, he had been on the current most-wanted list longer than anyone else.
        He is survived by his wife and four children.
