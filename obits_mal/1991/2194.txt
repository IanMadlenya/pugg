        Jakob Josef Petuchowski, a Reform rabbi and a leader in Christian-Jewish dialogue who was the Sol and Arlene Bronstein professor of Judaeo-Christian Studies at the Cincinnati campus of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, died Tuesday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. He was 66 years old and lived in Cincinnati.
        He died of pulmonary complications after cardiac bypass surgery, said Jean Rosensaft, a college spokesman.
        Dr. Petuchowski was also research professor of Jewish theology and liturgy at the campus, where he earned his doctorate in theology in 1955.
        He is the author of 36 books in the areas of Jewish theology and liturgy, rabbinics and Judaeo-Christian studies, including "Ever Since Sinai -- a Modern View of Torah" (1961), "The Lord's Prayer and Jewish Liturgy (1978) and "When Jews and Christians Meet" (1988).
        He was born in Berlin, escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and in the 1940's earned a bachelor's degree from the University of London. In London, he was an assistant to Dr. Leo Baeck, president of the World Union for Progressive Judaism.
        He became a student at the Cincinnati campus in 1948, was ordained there in 1952 and joined the faculty in 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, who teaches in the Judaic Studies Department of the University of Cincinnati; three sons, Samuel Judah of Takoma Park, Md.; Rabbi Aaron Mark, of Roslyn Heights, L.I., and Jonathan Mayer of Washington, D.C.; and four grandchildren.
