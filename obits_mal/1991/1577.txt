        Ernest S. Meyers, general counsel of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. for more than 30 years, died on Thursday at the United Hospital in Port Chester, N.Y. He was 81 years old and lived in Scarsdale.
        Mr. Meyers died of complications resulting from a stroke, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Meyers was former senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Laporte & Meyers, which he founded in 1947. It is now Meyers, Tersigni, Lurie, Feldman & Gray. He retired in 1988.
        Mr. Meyers represented the recording industry association from 1951 to 1981. In that capacity he was instrumental in securing piracy protections for record companies and was active in international copyright law.
        From 1939 to 1946 he was a special assistant to the United States Attorney General in the antitrust division of the Justice Department and, from 1956 to 1976, was a member of the panel of consultants of the Library of Congress on the general revision of copyright law.
        He had been secretary of the executive council of the Federal Bar Association.
        Mr. Meyers was born in New Rochelle, N.Y., and was an honors graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and of Yale Law School, where he edited the law journal.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Scheuer; a daughter, Nancy Ferdinand of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
