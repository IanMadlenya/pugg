        Hasan Dosti, a former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Albania and the country's Minister of Justice in the early years of World War II, died on Tuesday at Hancock Park Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 96 years old.
        Mr. Dosti, who held degrees in law and political science from the University of Paris, was an anti-monarchist in the years before World War II and was frequently jailed.
        During the war he was a leader of the Bali Kombetar, or National Front, while continuing to serve in his judicial posts under the Italian and German occupation.
        In 1943 he was elected chairman of a coalition of resistance groups that included the Communist Party, but after the war he broke with the pro-Soviet Government of Enver Hoxha and went into exile.
        He emigrated to the United States in 1949 and became head of the National Committee for a Free Albania, part of the Assembly of Captive European Nations seeking to undermine Communist rule in Eastern Europe. He dismissed as Communist propaganda assertions that Albanian emigres included collaborators with the Axis powers during the war.
        Mr. Dosti is survived by a son, Luan, of Los Angeles, an aerospace engineer; seven other children who, the family said, are being held in labor camps in Albania, and three grandchildren in Los Angeles.
