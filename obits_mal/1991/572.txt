        Jack Romano, a teacher of acting and a director, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt Division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a heart attack, his niece, Ana del Castillo, said.
        Most of Mr. Romano's students were children or young people, many of whom now have professional careers. They include Robert Downey Jr., Jon Cryer, Helen Slater and Mary Stuart Masterson.
        For the last 16 years, Mr. Romano was artistic director of a summer camp for stagecraft, Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y.
        In New York, he was associated with many theater groups, most recently the Vortex Theater Company.
        Mr. Romano, who was born in Cuba, studied at the University of Havana, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and the University of Genoa, Italy.
        He is survived by his mother, Esther Behar, and a sister, Hilda Behar, both of Santiago de Cuba.
        Funeral services will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, Amsterdam Avennue and 76th Street.
