        Stanley Swerdlow, a textile executive and Off Broadway producer, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 72 years old and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        Mr. Swerdlow died of Parkinson's disease, his son Ezra said.
        Mr. Swerdlow co-produced the long-running Off Broadway musical "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris"; "The Firebugs" by Max Frisch; "The Toilet and the Slave" by Amuru Baraka (LeRoi Jones), and a musical version of Ionescu's "Amadee." At the same time he pursued a career as a textile designer and executive with Putnam Mills Inc., in New York where he worked for more than 25 years.
        In recent years, Mr. Swerdlow appeared in small film parts in Woody Allen's "Zelig," Penny Marshall's "Awakenings" and, most recently, as a hospital malpractice victim in Mike Nichols's "Regarding Henry."
        In addition to his son Ezra, of Hastings, N.Y., Mr. Swerdlow is survived by his wife, Amy, of East Hampton, L.I.; another son, Tommy, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Lisa Swerdlow of Manhattan and Joan Brandt of Northampton, Mass., and four grandchildren.
