        John C. Morgan, whose actions on a World War II bombing mission over Germany won him a Medal of Honor and helped inspire the book "Twelve O'Clock High," has died at the age of 76, his son said today.
        Mr. Morgan died of an apparent heart attack at Midlands Hospital here on Thursday, said his son, Master Sgt. Sam Morgan of the Air Force. He lived in Bellevue, Neb.
        Mr. Morgan's actions that won him the Medal of Honor and the actions of others in the same raid were the inspiration for Sy Bartlett to write "Twelve O'Clock High," Sergeant Morgan said, adding that his father and Mr. Bartlett were friends.
        A passage in the book and a scene in the movie based on the book depicted Mr. Morgan's actions in the raid. Mr. Bartlett told Mr. Morgan that he was the inspiration for the scenes, Sergeant Morgan said.
        Mr. Morgan, a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps, was a co-pilot on a B-17 when the plane was hit by fire from German fighter planes on a bombing raid on Germany on July 28, 1943.
        The pilot and top turret gunner were wounded and the three other gunners lost consciousness when their oxygen supplies were cut off, according to a history of Medal of Honor winners.
        For two hours, Lieutenant Morgan had to fight off the pilot, who continued to struggle with the controls despite a mortal head wound. The plane's communication system was knocked out, and it was two hours before the navigator entered the cockpit and was able to help Mr. Morgan.
        Lieutenant Morgan completed the air raid and returned to base, saving both the crew and the bomber.
        In March 1944, Lieutenant Morgan was captured by the Germans after his B-17 was shot down. He was freed in May 1945.
        After leaving the Air Corps, Mr. Morgan sold aviation fuel for Texaco Inc. in California for 45 years.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Gladys; a brother; two sisters, and four grandchildren.
