        Karl Reuling, a writer on music and dance and a founding editor of Ballet News, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old.
        A friend, Gordon Voorhees, said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Reuling was an editor at Time-Life, selecting subjects and editing classical-music record and book series.  He began writing for Opera News in 1946, and in 1977 became assistant editor of the magazine. In 1979 he became managing editor of Ballet News, a magazine published by the Metropolitan Opera Guild, and remained there until it ceased publication in 1986.
        There are no immediate survivors.
