        Duane S. Doolittle, founder of Down East magazine, died Sunday at a hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 79 years old and lived in Portland and Lincolnville, Me.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Mr. Doolittle founded Down East in 1954 after he gave up teaching at Syracuse University to move to Maine.
        The monthly publication, best known for its features about schooners, loggers and stately old homes, became one of the nation's most successful regional magazines. Mr. Doolittle sold it in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine, and four stepsons.
