        Wendall Garnett, secretary of the board of the Congress of Racial Equality, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. Garnett joined the national staff of CORE in 1972 and was a special assistant to Roy Innis, chairman of CORE, before being named secretary to the board in 1977. George Holmes, a spokesman for CORE, said that Mr. Garnett, a graduate of Pennsylvania State University, had suffered a stroke three years ago and had been paralyzed for a time. He was recovering and had returned to work, Mr. Holmes said.
        Mr. Garnett is survived by a son, Patrick, of Washington; his father, Samuel, of Holidaysburg, Pa.; two sisters, Colleen Wimbush and Janet Smith, both of Holidaysburg, and two grandchildren.
