        Julijonas Steponavicius, the Archbishop of Vilnius, Lithuania, who was arrested by the Soviet authorities in 1961 and sent into internal exile for 27 years, died on Tuesday in Vilnius, Vatican Radio said on Wednesday. He was 79 years old.
        The report did not give a cause of death.
        The priest was arrested at the height of the Government's campaign against the church in Lithuania.
        He returned to Vilnius in December 1988 after the warming of Vatican-Soviet relations. Pope John Paul II named him Archbishop of Vilnius in 1989.
