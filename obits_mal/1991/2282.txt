        Joseph F. Knott, president and chief operating officer of the Safety-Kleen Corporation of Elgin, Ill., died Monday morning at his home in Oak Brook, Ill., a Chicago suburb. He was 55 years old.
        He died of an apparent heart attack while exercising on a treadmill, said a company spokesman, John Feeley.
        Mr. Knott was born in Youngstown, Ohio, received his bachelor's degree at the University of Notre Dame and a master's in business administration at Northwestern University, in 1966.
        He joined Safety-Kleen, a large recycler of cleaning fluids, in 1987. He was the company's executive vice president when he was named president, chief operating officer and a director in August 1990.
        The company, which estimates 1991 sales at $700 million, recycles fluids that are commonly used to clean greasy, dirty metal parts in service stations. The recycled fluids are then used in dry-cleaning establishments, industrial plants and auto-body shops.
        Mr. Knott's first marriage, to Barbara L. Burton, ended in divorce in 1986. He is survived by his second wife, the former Peggy Lilja; five children from his first marriage, Joseph F. 4th, of Lisle, Ill., David W., of Chicago, James P., of Allentown, Pa., Mary Beth, of Oak Brook, and Kathleen M., of San Diego, and a stepdaughter, Amy Burger of Oak Brook.
