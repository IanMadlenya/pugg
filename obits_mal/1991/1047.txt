        Peter Buckley, a photographer, writer and editor, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 52 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said Cliff Jahr, a friend.
        Mr. Buckley specialized in the fields of travel, the theater and children's activities. He illustrated and wrote the text of "Bullfight," a 1958 book that won praise for depicting the drama of the sport.
        Mr. Buckley was born in Norwalk, Conn., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Duke University. He served as a Navy officer for four years. He was editor-in-chief of Plays and Players magazine in London and executive editor of the East-West network of magazines distributed by airlines. He contributed to a number of publications, including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Horizon and Mirabella.
        He is survived by a brother, Michael, of Los Angeles.
        Correction:  June 15, 1991, Saturday
        An obituary on May 23 about Peter Buckley, a photographer, writer and editor, attributed a book to him incorrectly. The 1958 book, "Bullfight," was written and illustrated by Peter Hays Buckley, also of Manhattan, a writer and photographer not related to the late Mr. Buckley.
