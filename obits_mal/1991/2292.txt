        Seth Kimmelman, a pianist and teacher at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, died yesterday at his home in Boston. He was 40 years old.
        He died of pneumonia resulting from AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Kimmelman, who made his New York debut at the 92d Street Y in 1978, championed lesser-known composers and music, giving the United States premiere of newly discovered works by Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel in 1986 and playing Richard Strauss's "Burleske" with the Boston Pops in 1989.
        He was born on April 27, 1951, in New York City, and studied at the Fontainebleau Ecole des Arts in France with Sir Clifford Curzon and Nadia Boulanger. He graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1972.
        His companion was David Young.
        He is survived by his father, Dr. David Kimmelman, and his stepmother, Edythe, of Norwalk, Conn.; his mother, Sylvia Kimmelman, and a brother, Burt, both of New York City, and a half-brother, Michael, the chief art critic of The New York Times.
