        Mitsuo Mutai, honorary chairman of the Yomiuri Shimbun, the world's largest daily newspaper, died today of heart failure at a Tokyo hospital, officials of the paper said. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Mutai, who served in sales posts after joining the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1929, is credited with helping the newspaper increase its circulation. The paper's morning editions now have a circulation of 9.8 million.
        Mr. Mutai was president from 1970 to 1981. He was named chairman in 1981 and honorary chairman in 1983.
        He worked at spinning companies for five years after graduating from Waseda University in Tokyo in 1918. He then joined the Hochi Shimbun, a sports newspaper owned by the Yomiuri Shimbun, as a salesman and later moved to the Yomiuri Shimbun.
        Mr. Mutai became a sales manager of the Yomiuri Shimbun in 1932 and one of the newspaper's executives in 1942.
