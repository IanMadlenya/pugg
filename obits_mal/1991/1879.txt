        Ellery Sedgwick Jr., a former president and chairman of the Medusa Corporation of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, a leading cement maker, died suddenly on Sunday at his home in Gates Mills, Ohio. He was 82 years old.
        His physician, Dr. Scott Inkley, said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        A native of Boston, where his father was editor and publisher of The Atlantic Monthly magazine for 30 years, Mr. Sedgwick graduated from Harvard University and arrived in Cleveland in 1934. He was a securities analyst both before and after wartime service as a Navy officer but in 1952 became president of what was then the Medusa Portland Cement Company. He retired from that post in 1970 and served three more years as chairman.
        Mr. Sedgwick is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Wade; three sons, Ellery 3d of Farmville, Va., Walter C. of San Francisco, and Theodore of Washington; a daughter, Irene Briedis of Lincoln, Mass.; a brother, Cabot Sedgwick of Nogales, Ariz.; a sister, Henrietta Lockwood of Bedford, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
