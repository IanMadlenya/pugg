        Henry J. DuLaurence Jr., a Cleveland laywer active in real estate and investments, died Saturday at the Manor Care Nursing Home in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. He was 85 years old and lived in Shaker Heights.
        He died of renal failure, a funeral home representative said.
        In the early 1950's Mr. DuLaurence was president of the Cleveland Apartment and Home Owners Association and legislative chairman of the National Apartment House Owners Association. He testified frequently before Congressional committees on housing issues, appeared before national real estate groups and was active in housing rehabilitation.
        In the late 1950's, he was a proponent of limiting the power of legislators to raise taxes and urged adoption of laws requiring voter approval of all tax increases by state and local governments beyond a certain level.
        Mr. DuLaurence was a 1929 graduate of Case Western Reserve University Law School.
        He is survived by two sons, Henry 3d of Boston and Robert of Cleveland Heights; a daughter, Sarah Appleton of Manchester, Mass.; two sisters, Lucia Houser of New Port Richey, Fla., and Helen Hartman of Teaneck, N.J., and six grandchildren.
