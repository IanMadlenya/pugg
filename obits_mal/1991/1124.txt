        James A. Walsh, a Federal district judge who issued the antitrust ruling that allows competing newspapers to pool resources in non-news operations, died Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospice. He was 84 years old.
        Judge Walsh suffered a stroke on April 20.
        He was appointed to the Federal judiciary by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 and retired in 1981. For the first 18 years of his tenure he was the only judge in the United States District Court in Tucson.
        Judge Walsh's ruling in 1965 in a case involving The Tucson Citizen and The Arizona Daily Star, based in Tucson, led to the Newspaper Preservation Act, which permits competing newspapers to enter joint operating agreements without violating antitrust laws.
        He is survived by 3 sons, 2 daughters, 13 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.
