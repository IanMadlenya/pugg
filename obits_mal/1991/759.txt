        James R. Graham, a Madison Avenue art dealer specializing in American art, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 83 years old and lived in Bayside, Queens.
        He died of a heart attack, said a nephew, Robert C. Graham Jr., the president of Graham Galleries.
        James Graham was the fourth generation in the family business, which was founded in 1857 on 14th Street and is now at 1014 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street. Robert Graham said yesterday that the gallery was the oldest family-owned art business in Manhattan.
        His uncle, who retired in 1987 after 50 years at work there, 34 as president, returned to the gallery several days a week until last Friday. Under James Graham, the gallery specialized in 19th- and early-20th-century American art, especially the works of Western artists like Frederic Remington, Charles Marion Russell, Thomas Moran and Albert Bierstadt. He helped form the Western art collection of the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth and was an art adviser to Geraldine Rockefeller Dodge.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Irma Bundul, and a brother and former partner in the gallery, Robert Graham Sr., of Stamford, Conn.
