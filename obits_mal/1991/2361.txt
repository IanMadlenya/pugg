        Stanley Earl Cowan, a composer, author and publicity agent, died on Saturday at his home in Granada Hills, Calif. He was 73 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said Miriam Levin, a spokeswoman for the family.
        Mr. Cowan, who was born in New York City, started his career in the 1930's as a songwriter. Among his compositions are "Taps 'Til Reveille," "Listen to Me Sing" and "A Cowgirl Dreams On." He also composed music for the "Ice Capades" for several seasons and wrote songs for movies, collaborating on some with his father, Rubey Cowan.
        In 1960, he formed his own public relations agency, Stanley Cowan & Associates, and later joined the public relations firm Rogers & Cowan, which was co-founded by his brother, Warren.
        In addition to his brother, he is survived by a son, Robert, and two daughters, Gail and Bobbie, all of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
