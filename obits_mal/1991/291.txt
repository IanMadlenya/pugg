        Travis Williams, who wrestled with homelessness, poverty and alcohol after setting records as a kick returner with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League, died of heart failure Sunday. He was 45 years old.
        Mr. Williams died in Martinez, Calif., near his hometown of Richmond, Calif., after suffering from liver and kidney problems for a long time, said his daughter Marla Williams.
        Known as the Roadrunner, Mr. Williams returned four kickoffs for touchdowns in his rookie season with the Packers in 1967, setting an N.F.L. record that still stands. He returned two in one game that season against the Cleveland Browns to tie a league record. He played four seasons with the Packers. A knee injury prevented him from playing in 1972 and ended his career.
        Mr. Williams returned to California and held a series of jobs: collecting junk, driving trucks, working as a bouncer and as a security guard.
        Marla Williams said her father became increasingly depressed in recent years, and joined the ranks of people living on the streets.
        Mr. Williams is survived by four sons and four daughters.
