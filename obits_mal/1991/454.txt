        Albert F. Kendall, a retired senior vice president and controller of the New York Bank for Savings, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 86 years old and lived in Flower Hill, L.I.
        He had lung cancer and died after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Kendall, who was born in Brooklyn, joined the New York Savings Bank in 1942 after 11 years with the New York State Banking Department. Through a merger in 1963, the bank became the New York Bank for Savings, now known as Goldome. Mr. Kendall retired in 1969.
        He is survived by a daughter, Kaye Byrne of Manhasset and Naples, Fla., and a grandson.
