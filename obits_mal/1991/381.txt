        He was a past Grand Knight of Mother Cabrini Council 2655 and a past commander of American Legion Post 1088.
        Besides his wife, the former Patricia Ahearn, Mr. Holahan is survived by four daughters, Patricia and Pamela, both of Elmhurst, Barbara Capozzi of Copiague, L.I., and Jeanne Rosser of Costa Mesa, Calif.; a brother, Edwin, of Reading, Mass.; a sister, Carole Coleman of Napa, Calif., and three grandchildren.
