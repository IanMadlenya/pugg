        Russ Thomas, who worked for 42 years with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League as a player, scout, broadcaster, assistant coach, controller, personnel director and general manager, died in his sleep on Monday night at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 66 years old. A spokesman for the Lions said the exact time and cause of death were unknown.
        The Lions drafted the native of Griffithsville, W. Va., out of Ohio State in 1946 and he played tackle on offense and defense until a knee injury ended his playing career in 1949. After two years on the football staff at St. Bonaventure, he returned to the Lions in 1952 as an assistant coach.
        As general manager and chief negotiator from 1967 until his retirement in 1989 he developed a reputation as a tough but fair bargainer, determined to hold down salaries.
        "He gave most of his life to the Lions and left an indelible mark on our organization," said William Clay Ford, the owner. "Aside from our business relationship, Russ was a very dear personal friend."
        Mr. Thomas is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two sons, John and James.
