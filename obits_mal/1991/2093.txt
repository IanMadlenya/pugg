        Harry A. Mallon, a printing company executive in the New York area, died Thursday at his home in Roslyn Estates, L.I. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Mallon died of cancer of the esophagus, said his son, Timothy, of Manhattan.
        Until three years ago, Mr. Mallon was president of two large commercial printing companies, the Peter F. Mallon Printing Corporation in Long Island City, Queens, which employed about 450 employees, and Format Printing in Totowa, N.J., which had about 200 employees. The Long Island City company, founded by Mr. Mallon's father in 1947, was liquidated, and the Format company was sold.
        Mr. Mallon was a native of the Bronx and graduated from Holy Cross College in 1945. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy during the postwar occupation of Japan and later served in Korea.
        Mr. Mallon was active in several printing trade associations, and served as a director of Printing Industries of America, as a member of the labor committee of the Metropolitan Lithographers Association, and as a director and chairman of the Association of the Graphic Arts.
        He was a member of the Roslyn Estates board of zoning appeals and the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club.
        Besides his son Timothy, Mr. Mallon is survived by his wife, the former Ruth A'Hearn; two other sons, Michael of Wilmington, N.C., and Gregory of Williston Park, L.I.; three daughters, Elizabeth Gonsalves of Atlanta, Ga., Barbara Kolk of Roslyn and Maureen Weatherwax of Ormond Beach, Fla.; a sister, Patricia Cuff of Roslyn Harbor, and six grandchildren.
