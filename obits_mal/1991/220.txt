        Walter J. Campbell, retired suburban advertising director of The New York Times, died yesterday at his home in Westfield, N.J. He was 70 years old.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Campbell joined The Times in 1974 as a display advertising salesman and retired in 1985 as suburban advertising director. Earlier he had been retail advertising manager for The Passaic Herald News in New Jersey.
        Mr. Campbell, a native of Newark, served with the Army in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Margaret P. Hanifin; a daughter, Nancy Mann of Mountainside, N.J.; two sisters, Margaret Elker of Wanamassa, N.J., and Lillian Schaefer of Shark River Hills, N.J., and two grandchildren.
