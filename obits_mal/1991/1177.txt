        Ollie Spencer, a National Football League lineman for 9 years and the offensive line coach of the Oakland Raiders for 17 years, died Sunday, apparently after a heart attack. He was 60 years old.
        After being a star tackle at Kansas, Mr. Spencer started on the Detroit Lions' 1953 championship team.. In following seasons, he played for the Lions and for the Green Bay Packers. Among the linemen he helped develop as coach were Pro Football Hall of Famers Jim Otto, Gene Upshaw and Art Shell, now coach of the Los Angeles Raiders.
        Mr. Spencer left football after the 1980 season and ran an insurance agency in Danville, Calif.
