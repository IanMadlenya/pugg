        Oscar A. Ornati, an economist who focused on poverty, discrimination and the social responsibility of businesses, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Ornati taught 25 years at New York University and became chairman of the Management Department at its Stern School of Business. Earlier he worked on housing and developing affirmative-action programs at the United States Office of Economic Opportunity in 1965 and 1966.
        Working as an arbitrator, he helped settle a printers' strike at The New York Times in the 1960's. He also advised the postal workers' union. Among the issues he studied were the minimum wage, wage-and-price controls and finding jobs for the poor. Last year he developed an index of employment in 24 regions of the country.
        Born in Trieste, Italy, he came to America in 1939. He served in the Army in Africa and Italy from 1943 to 1945. After the war he earned his bachelor's degree from Hobart College and a master's and doctorate at Harvard University. He taught at Cornell University and the New School. He received a Fulbright Fellowship and the Order of the British Empire.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn Lifshitz; three children, Lee, Susan and Molly, all of Manhattan, and a sister, Margherita Rasoli-Roth of Genoa, Italy.
