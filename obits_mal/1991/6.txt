        Richard H. Hansen, a lawyer whose 1962 book played a role in the drafting of the constitutional amendment on Presidential succession, died at a Lincoln hospital on Jan 4. He was 61 years old and lived in Lincoln.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Mr. Hansen raised the issue of Presidential succession in 1962 in the book "The Year We Had No President." It documents periods in United States history when a President was too ill to carry out his duties.
        The 25th Amendment, which took effect in 1967, details, among other things, instances in which the Vice President can temporarily replace an ailing President. Mr. Hansen testified before Congress in 1963 to urge its adoption.
        Survivors include his wife, Judith; three sons, four daughters, his mother and 13 grandchildren.
