        Gilbert Y. Chin, who headed a research team that improved the performance of telephones, died on Sunday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 56 years old and lived in Murray Hill, N.J.
        He died of stomach cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        In 1970, Dr. Chin's research team at A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories developed Chromindur, a type of magnetic alloy used to convert electrical signals into speech in telephone handsets. The Chromindur family of alloys can be formed into permanent magnets at room temperature. The development replaced hot stamp magnets used in telephone handsets, improving their performance.
        He was director of the Passive Components Research Laboratory for Bell Labs. Under his direction, the laboratory developed optical fibers for light-wave communications and made advances in superconductivity. He retired in March.
        Dr. Chin, who was born in China, came to the United States at age 15. He received a doctorate in science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1963.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ginie Wong-Lay; two sons, Patrick, of Murray Hill, and Michael of Freehold, N.J.; two daughters, Grace and Karen, both of Murray Hill; his parents, George and Lia-Wah Chin of Cambridge, Mass.; three brothers, Aland of Sharon, Mass., Brymer of Warren, N.J., and Robert of Bakersfield, Calif., and a sister, May McGrew of Houston.
