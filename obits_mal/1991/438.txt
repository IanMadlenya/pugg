        Donald J. Wilcox, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire, died on Friday at his home in Boston. He was 52 years old.
        He died of an AIDS-related illness, a spokesman for the university said.
        Dr. Wilcox joined the faculty at the university in 1970. He was the history department's director of graduate studies from 1973 to 1979 and was department chairman from 1982 to 1985. Earlier, he was a member of the Harvard University faculty.
        He specialized in Renaissance history. His most recent book, "The Measure of Times Past," a re-evaluation of the pre-Newtonian concept of time, was published in 1987.
        Dr. Wilcox was born in Putnam, Conn., and graduated from Wesleyan University in 1961. He received a doctorate in history from Harvard in 1967.
        He is survived by a brother, Charles H. Wilcox, of San Antonio.
