        Asher Wolk, a magazine editor and writer, died Saturday at the Veterans Administration Hospital Center in the Bronx. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a major bacterial infection and had been ill for the past four years after a fall caused severe neurological problems, his family said.
        Mr. Wolk was founder and editor in chief of Olam Hadash, a monthly children's magazine, written in Hebrew and published in New York. He founded the magazine in 1960 with the support of the late David Ben-Gurion, then Prime Minister of Israel.
        He was in charge of Jewish press relations for the World Zionist Organization for 35 years until his retirement two years ago. In 1986, he published a book in Israel on his travels entitled "It's the Whale I'm Looking For." He also wrote political articles for the Jewish Forward and Algemeiner-Journal.
        Born in Poland, he came to the United States in 1933 to join his father, the late Rabbi Paul Wolk of the Bronx. He graduated from the Hebrew Seminary in Vilnius, Lithuania, and attended Yeshiva University in New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Irene Swirsky; a son, Joel, of San Francisco; a daughter, Naomi Gibbons, of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Vera Lichtenberg of Belle Harbor, N.Y.; a brother, Leon, of Commack, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
