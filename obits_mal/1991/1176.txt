        Jerome P. Pickard, a geographer and a specialist in economic development who was senior adviser on demographics to the Appalachian Regional Commission for two decades, died on Monday at his summer home in Amagansett, L. I. He was 74 years old and also lived in Somerset, Md.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        In 1972, in a much-discussed report to the Federal Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, Dr. Pickard concluded that the urbanization of the United States was proceeding so rapidly that metropolitan governments would eventually have to be superseded by broader regional authorities to cover entities like the Atlantic Seaboard urban region. The Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, he said, would bear the same relationship to the seaboard region as Central Park bore to New York City in the 19th century.
        Dr. Pickard, who was reared in Chicago, was a graduate of the University of Chicago and held advanced degrees from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate from the Maxwell School at Syracuse University. He was a Fulbright scholar at the University of Oslo in Norway.
        From 1954 to 1959 he served as research director for economic development at the Washington (D.C.) Board of Trade. Later he held similar posts at the Urban Land Institute and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. He joined the Appalachian Regional Commission in 1970 and retired last year.
        Dr. Pickard taught regional development at George Washington University and was widely published in scholarly journals.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred; four daughters, Judith Lemieux of Montreal, Ruth Ann Running of St. Francis, S.D., Elizabeth Pickard of Lummi Island, Wash., and Susan Pickard of Madison, Wis., and six grandchldren.
