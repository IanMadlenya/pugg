        Dr. Leonard Greenburg, New York City's first Commissioner of Air Pollution Control and a professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Yeshiva University, died on March 13 at Manor Nursing Home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 98 years old and lived in Sarasota.
        He died of pneumonia, said his wife, Celia, who reported his death in a letter this week.
        Dr. Greenburg, who was first appointed in 1952 by Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri and was twice reappointed by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, often warned of impending environmental dangers facing city residents, like an increase in air pollution.
        An engineer and a physician, Dr. Greenberg held a degree in civil engineering from Columbia University, a Ph.D. in public health from Yale University and a medical degree from Yale Medical School. He joined the staff of Yeshiva University as professor of preventive medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine after leaving government service in 1958. He had also served as executive director of the division of industrial hygiene for New York State. He retired in 1969.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Frances Linenthal of San Francisco; three grandchildren, and one step-grandchild.
