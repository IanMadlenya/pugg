        He was bicycling with his wife, Joan, on June 5 when he was hit by a car, his daughter, Stephanie, said, said a report in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. She said her father's brain was damaged, and he was in a coma until his death in a hospital in St. Polten, about 30 miles west of Vienna.
        Mr. Koerner, a prolific painter, was considered a master of Magic Realism. His works are in the permanent collections of several museums, among them the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.  Prize for a War Poster
        Mr. Koerner moved to the United States in 1938, starting out in Brooklyn as a commercial artist. Throughout much of World War II, he designed posters for the Office of War Information and the Office of Strategic Services. His poster "Someone Talked" won an award from the Museum of Modern Art. He was sent to Germany after the victory in Europe to sketch the Nuremberg trials for the American Military Government.
        Mr. Koerner visited Vienna and learned that his mother, father and brother had died in a concentration camp. Among his paintings was a memorial portrait, "My Parents," showing his mother and father, backs to the viewer, as lonely figures on separate paths in the Vienna Woods.
        In 1952, Mr. Koerner moved to Pittsburgh. He taught at Chatham College and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh.
        Besides his wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Joseph, of Boston.
