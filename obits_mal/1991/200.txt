        John Bystrom, who established a satellite communications project designed to lessen the isolation of remote Pacific islands, died Friday. He was 69 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed, but Mr. Bystrom underwent heart bypass surgery on Dec. 28.
        A professor of communications at the University of Hawaii, he established the university's Peacesat program in 1971. It linked 14 Pacific areas by way of a low-technology communications system.
        Peacesat, which stands for Pan-Pacific Education and Communications Experiments by Satellite, made Hawaii the first state to offer university courses and handle interlibrary communications by satellite.
        Mr. Bystrom was born in Minnesota and received his doctorate from the University of Minnesota.
        He also served as president of the Minnesota State Board of Education, and was a political adviser to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.
        Survivors include his wife, Anne; three sons and a sister.
