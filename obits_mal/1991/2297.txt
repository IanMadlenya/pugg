        Fred Feller, a set builder for more than 200 Broadway shows, died on Wednesday at his home in Tierra Verde, Fla. He was 64 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said a friend and colleague, Willard Shaffar.
        Mr. Feller was a co-owner of Feller Scenic Studios and Theater Techniques in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y. Since 1947, when he entered the business, he had built hundreds of sets for Broadway productions, many of which won Tony Awards for best set design. Among them were "West Side Story," "A Little Night Music," "Cabaret" and "42d Street." He was also a production supervisor for the producers Hal Prince and David Merrick.
        Mr. Feller, a native of Brooklyn, learned set building from his father, who owned the business before him. After service in the Navy in World War II, he became a partner in the studio. When he retired and sold the business, it became the East Coast Scenery Company.
        He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a son, Rick, and a daughter, Lisa, all of Florida.
