        Michael Fardink, a pianist and conductor and the music director of opera at Rutgers, died on March 31 at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 36 years old and lived in Elmhurst, Queens.
        He died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.
        A native of Erie, Pa., Mr. Fardink was an active accompanist and chamber musician. He performed with artists like the sopranos Teresa Stratas and June Anderson, the violinist James Buswell and the Ariel Ensemble of New York. He also appeared frequently as a piano soloist, both in concerts and on recordings.
        From 1985 until the time of his death, Mr. Fardink was a faculty member of the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers in New Brunswick, N.J. As music director of opera at the school, he conducted the first American staging of Handel's "Deborah" and the first American performance since 1853 of Donizetti's "Belisario." He also was a co-founder of the New England Lyric Operetta and conducted many of its performances.
        He is survived by his father, Lyle, of Spring Hill, Fla.; two sisters, Jane, of Colorado Springs, and Debbie, of Erie, and a brother, Kevin Kennedy of Elmhurst.
