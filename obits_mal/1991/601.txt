        Frank A. Donaldson, retired chairman and former chief executive of the Donaldson Company, manufacturer of air filtration systems, died Saturday at his home in Carefree, Ariz. He was 71 years old and also lived in Excelsior, Minn.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Donaldson was connected with the Minneapolis-based company, founded by his father, for more than 50 years and helped build it into an organization with operations in 10 countries.
        A 1942 graduate of Harvard College, he served in the Navy in World War II. In 1945 he was named vice president of the company and was elected president six years later.
        He developed new filter systems for air cleaners and instituted agreements with overseas manufacturers. In 1970, he acquired the Torit Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial dust collectors. He relinquished the presidency in 1981 and retired in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene; two sons, Frank 3d of Minnetonka, Minn., and John of Minneapolis; a brother, Scott of Williamsburg, Va.; a sister, Joan Michelson of Sun Valley, Idaho; and four grandchildren.
