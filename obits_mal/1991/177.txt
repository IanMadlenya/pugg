        Dr. Bernard Amsterdam, a Manhattan internist who conducted research into the relationship between diet and heart disease, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Amsterdam graduated from City College and received a master's degree from Columbia and his medical degree from the Downstate Medical Center, now the College of Medicine of the State University of New York.
        He began practice in 1933 and was an early opponent of smoking because of its effects on health. In 1958, in The New York State Journal of Medicine, he wrote one of the first articles correlating consumption of saturated fats with increased risk of atherosclerosis.
        Dr. Amsterdam is survived by his wife, the former Jane Yotko; a daughter, Jacqueline, of Manhattan; a son, Alton, of Manhattan, and three sisters, Birdie, a retired New York State Supreme Court Justice, and Ruth Sanders, both of Manhattan, and Cybil Chizner, who lives in Florida.
