        John C. West, a general partner in a Wall Street banking firm, died Wednesday at his home in Boca Grande, Fla. He was 83 years old and died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. West, whose main residence was in Unionville, Pa., had been affiliated with the firm of Brown Brothers, Harriman & Company since 1934, working at its Philadelphia and Manhattan offices. Although he remained a partner until his death, he retired from daily work in 1973.
        Born in Clayton, Mo., he grew up in Providence, R.I. After graduating from the Groton School and Yale University, he worked a few years in the early 1930's for J. P. Morgan & Company before going to Brown Brothers. The only break in his career there was during World War II, when he served in the Navy.
        He had been a director of the Philadelphia Life Insurance Company, the American Bank Note Company, the Arawak Trust Company, Kleinwort, Benson International and the Howmet Turbine Components Corporation. He was also a trustee of the Seamen's Church Institute of Philadelphia and Brandywine Hospital, finance chairman of the Edwin Gould Foundation for Children and development chairman of Lincoln University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Robinson; a daughter, Cristy, and a son, J. Robinson, both of Washington, and two grandchildren.
