        Leo Cawley, an economist and radio commentater whose weekly program on economics, "Fearful Symmetry," was broadcast on WBAI-FM, died on July 22 in the Seattle Veterans Affairs Medical Center. He was 47 years old and lived in New York.
        He died of complications from a bone-marrow transplant, said Paula Webster, a spokeswoman for the family. Mr. Cawley was exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange when he was a marine in Vietnam, and he developed bone cancer in 1980.
        Mr. Cawley won the William Faulkner Award for Writing in 1961, and one of his better-known essays, "Refighting the War: Why the Movies Are in Vietnam," was published in the anthology "Hanoi to Hollywood: The Vietnam War on Film." He also wrote for the Monthly Review, of which he was a board member, The Nation, The Village Voice and Newsday. He had also taught at Vassar College and Georgetown University.
        He is survived by his wife, Hilda Gore, and a brother, John, of San Francisco.
