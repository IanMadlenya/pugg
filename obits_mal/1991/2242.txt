        George Lott, the DePaul University tennis coach, who won three Wimbledon doubles titles and five United States national doubles titles, died yesterday in Chicago. He was 85 years old.
        The cause of death was not reported.
        Lott, who was the nation's oldest collegiate tennis coach, earned more than 40 national and international tennis titles during his playing career and went unbeaten seven straight years in Davis Cup competition. In 1931, he won the Wimbledon doubles and mixed doubles titles, and in 1934 he again captured the doubles title.
        A 1930 graduate of the University of Chicago, he came to DePaul in 1969. Last month, he was inducted into the Chicago Sports Hall of Fame, one of seven Halls of Fame of which he was a member.
        He is survived by a daughter, Mimi Gregory, and two grandchildren.
