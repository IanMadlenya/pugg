        Dr. Herman Moritz Kalckar, an educator and biochemist who did pioneering work in metabolism, died Friday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 83 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        He died of pneumonia, said a spokeswoman for Harvard University Medical School, where Dr. Kalckar was professor emeritus of biological chemistry.
        Dr. Kalckar, who earned a medical degree from the University of Copenhagen in 1933, came to the United States in 1952 after serving as a director of the Institute of Cytophysiology in Denmark. He was a visiting scientist with the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases and later a professor of biology at Johns Hopkins University.
        In 1961 he was named head of the biochemistry research laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School. He retired in 1979 and joined the faculty of Boston University.
        He is survived by his wife, Agnete ; two daughters, Sonja Kalckar of Maui, Hawaii, and Nina Kalckar of Chicago; a son, Niels of Bridgewater, Mass.; a stepson, Dr. Peter Laursen of Vineyard Haven, Mass., a stepdaughter, Anne Karin Shaner of Concord, Mass.; and five stepgrandchildren.
