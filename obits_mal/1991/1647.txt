        Ralph Renick, a broadcaster who dominated the television news ratings in the Miami area for 35 years, died on Thursday at Cedars Medical Center. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Renick, who worked at WTVJ, suffered from hepatitis and liver cancer and had been in and out of the hospital since April.
        He was a board member of The Associated Press from October 1977 to May 1981 and was a former president of Associated Press Broadcasters, an advisory group for the cooperative's broadcast news division. He also was president of the Radio-Television News Directors Association.
        In 1985 Mr. Renick left his job as news director at WTVJ to run for Governor of Florida as a Democrat. He quit six months later after spending $100,000 of his own money, saying he did not have a taste for politics.
        He returned to television as a commentator for WCIX in Miami in 1988 and retired in September 1990.
        There was no immediate information on survivors.
