        Lloyd W. Dunn, a co-founder of the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which issues the Grammy Awards, died on Friday at his home in Encino, Calif. He was 84 years old.
        He died of cancer, his brother-in-law, Philip Barry, said.
        Mr. Dunn was born in Brooklyn, and worked for the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company in Manhattan before going to California in the 1940's to open an advertising agency.
        He joined Capitol Records as vice president of merchandising and sales in 1950. He later served as vice president of artists and repertory and as the president of the former Capitol Records International Corporation.
        Mr. Dunn and four other record executives founded the music academy in 1957.
        His autobiography, "On the Flip Side," was published in 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, Priscilla; three sons, Jeffrey, of San Francisco; Stephen, of Newport Beach, Calif., and Jonathan, of Los Angeles; a brother, Linwood Dunn of Los Angeles, and a grandson.
