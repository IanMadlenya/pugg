        Cedric Tallis, who ran the Kansas City Royals and the New York Yankees during a 43-year career in professional baseball, died here today. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Tallis died at Tampa General Hospital after a heart attack, said a hospital spokeswoman, Cindy Tanner.
        After leaving the Yankees following the 1982 season, Mr. Tallis became executive director of the Tampa Bay Baseball Group. Last December, the organization lost to a rival Tampa group when the National League pared finalists for an expansion franchise to six.
        In 1961, Mr. Tallis joined the expansion Los Angeles Angels as business manager. He became vice president of operations in 1965, just before the team moved to Anaheim. He joined the expansion Royals in 1968 as general manager, a year before the team's first season in the American League, and was chosen executive of the year in 1971 by The Sporting News.
        Gabe Paul brought Mr. Tallis to the Yankees in 1974 to supervise the rebuilding of Yankee Stadium.
        After helping complete the renovation of Yankee Stadium, which reopened in 1976, Mr. Tallis succeeded Al Rosen as the team's top baseball executive in 1980.
