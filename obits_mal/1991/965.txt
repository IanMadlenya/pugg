        The Rev. Robert P. Cawley, a Roman Catholic Vincentian priest and a former director of libraries at St. John's University, died on Thursday at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Queens. He was 57 years old and lived in Philadelphia.
        Father Cawley had suffered a heart attack while visiting the St. John's campus. His mother, Nora, 90, was in the same hospital in a coma, and died a few hours after her son's death without regaining consciousness.
        Since 1976 Father Cawley had been director of the Central Association of the Miraculous Medal, which supports the Vincentian order and has its headquarters in Philadelphia. He was a past president of the National Catholic Development Council.
        He is survived by a brother, Roderick, of Dix Hills, L.I., and by two sisters, Barbara O'Connor of Queens and Lorraine Rogers of Cape Coral, Fla.
