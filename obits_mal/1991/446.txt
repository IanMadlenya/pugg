        Edgar F. Johnson, founder of the E. F. Johnson Company, which dominated the market for citizens' band radios in the United States from the 1950's to the 1970's, died of pancreatic cancer on Monday at his home. He was 91 years old.
        In 1949 the company, which pioneered the development of two-way radio transmitters, became the first to manufacture complete ham radio transmitters.
        When the popularity of C.B. radios dwindled in the late 1970's, the company manufactured parts for cellular telephones and merged with Western Union. Western Union later sold it to the DEI Corporporation.
        Mr. Johnson retired in 1978 as the company's president and board chairman.
        He is survived by his wife and two daughters.
