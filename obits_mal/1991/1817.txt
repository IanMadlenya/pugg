        Helmut Walcha, an organist and harpsichordist known for his interpretations of the works of Bach, died on Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany. He was 83 years old.
        He died of cardiopulmonary failure, said Paul Jordan, a professor at the State University of New York in Binghamton and one of Mr. Walcha's former students.
        One of the great interpreters of J. S.  Bach, Mr. Walcha recorded the composer's complete organ works twice, as well as the complete "Well-Tempered Clavier" and, with Henryk Szering, the six sonatas for violin and harpsichord. Although blind, he had an active international career as a performer, recording artist and teacher.
        Mr. Walcha was born in Leipzig, Germany, in 1907. He attended the Institute of Music there, studying organ with Gunther Ramin, one of the leading Bach specialists of the time, and composition with Sigfrid Karg-Elert. He made his performing debut at the age of 17.
        In 1929, Mr. Walcha moved to Frankfurt, where he became a professor at the State Institute of Music. By the end of World War II he was head of the school's sacred-music division. In the 1950's, Deutsche Grammophon asked him to record the complete organ works of Bach on a historical organ, a project he started on again decades later but did not complete.
        His fame quickly spread through his recitals and recordings, attracting students from around the world to Germany to study with him. In 1961, the city of Frankfurt subsidized the building of an organ for Mr. Walcha at the Church of the Three Kings, where he was the organist until his health forced him to retire in the early 1980's. He was also the composer of three volumes of choral preludes, and edited a collection of the Organ Concertos of Handel.
        He is survived by his wife, Ursula.
