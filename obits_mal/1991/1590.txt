        James L. J. Pie, an advocate of state funds for private and parochial schools and a lawyer who wrote legislation that created the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority, died on June 30 at his home in Philadelphia. He was 69 years old.
        He died of heart failure said his wife, Mary.
        Mr. Pie joined the Philadelphia Solitictor's office in 1957 and retired in 1979 as a deputy solicitor. Specializing in mass transit issues, he drafted legislation for the transit authority and assisted in the development of the city's commuter tunnel and airport high-speed rail line.
        In 1959 he founded the Pennsylvania Federation of Citizens for Educational Freedom, a nonprofit advocacy group seeking refunds for parents of children in private and parochial schools.
        In the late 1960's, Mr. Pie wrote legislation for the State of Pennsylvania that authorized state funds for private and parochial schools and the refunds to parents. In 1973, the United States Supreme Court declared the legislation unconstitutional.
        Mr. Pie, a native of Philadelphia, graduated from La Salle College and earned a law degree from the Catholic University of America in 1950.
        In addition to his wife, the former Mary Frances Hensler, he is survived by four daughters, Maureen Pie-Bruno and Christina Pie O'Keefe, both of Philadelphia, Maria C. Hughes of Westmont, N.J., Elena C. of Philadelphia; five sons, Thomas, of St. Clairsville, Ohio, Joseph, of Philadelphia, Christopher, of Hatboro, Pa., John, of Wilmington, Del., and Paul, of London; a brother, John of Cherry Hill, N.J., and 10 grandchildren.
