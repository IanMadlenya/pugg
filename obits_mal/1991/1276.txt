        Ira Silverman, a influential leader of major Jewish groups who was the executive vice president of the American Jewish Committee from 1988 until last July when illness forced him to resign, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 46 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        He died of internal bleeding caused by ulcers and a parasite that invaded his digestive system while he was visiting China in 1989, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Silverman was the national program director of the American Jewish Committee from 1977 to 1981. For the last 11 months, he was director of the group's Institute of Human Relations. The committee, which was founded in 1906, works to protect the civil and religious rights of Jews in this country and abroad.
        In Manhattan, he was the director of the 92d Street Y from 1986 to 1988.
        Mr. Silverman, a trim, outgoing man, was born in Rockville Centre, L.I., on Jan. 20, 1945, and was graduated from South Side High School there. He earned a bachelor's degree at Harvard College in 1966 and a master's degree in public affairs at Princeton University in 1968.
        In early posts, he was the director of Federal Government relations of the Association of American Universities, a Washington correspondent for The Jerusalem Post and Yediot Acharonot, a Tel Aviv newspaper. He was also the first director of the Institute for Jewish Policy Planning and Research, which was founded by the Synagogue Council of America. From 1981 to 1986, he was president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in suburban Philadelphia.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jane Aresty, a management consultant; a son, Jacob, a student at Harvard; two daughters, Rachel and Sarah; his parents, Irving and Ruth Silverman of Tucson, Ariz., and a sister, Elizabeth Hart of Willits, Calif. His brother, Hy, died in 1988.
