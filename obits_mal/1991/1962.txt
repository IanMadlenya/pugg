        Dr. Arthur B. Hardy, a psychiatrist who promoted a new treatment for agoraphobia that helped thousands of patients across the nation, died Saturday at his home in Menlo Park, Calif.
        Dr. Hardy, who was 78 years old, died of cancer, associates said.
        Agoraphobia, a fear of being in open or public places that is so intense that victims can be effectively confined to their homes, was renamed territorial apprehension by Dr. Hardy.
        Dissatisfied with the results of classical psychoanalysis in treating the condition, Dr. Hardy broke from his Freudian training. He drew instead on the concepts of Dr. Arnold Lazarus and Dr. Joseph Wolpe at Stanford University in using behavior techniques like relaxation, desensitization, assertiveness training, gradual exploration and group support to free patients of their anxieties.
        Reports on Dr. Hardy's work in the news media and his television appearances drew 50,000 requests from people seeking help, as well as inquiries from therapists wanting to learn the new treatment.
        Dr. Hardy treated thousands of patients, wrote books, helped train other therapists and founded the Phobia Society of America to provide information. It became the Anxiety Disorder Association of America in Washington.
        Dr. Hardy was born in Sidney, Neb., and was a graduate of the University of Nebraska. He did his medical training at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif., and his internship in Denver. During World War II, he served in the military for four years as a surgeon. He became the director of psychiatry at the El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, Calif., and founded the Counseling and Psychotherapy Center in Palo Alto.
        He is survived by his wife, Crucita; a son, Douglas of San Jose, Calif.; a daughter, Diane Stouffer of Redmond, Wash.; a stepdaughter, Frances Larson of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, and a stepson, Rob Most of Menlo Park.
