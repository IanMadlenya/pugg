        Ray Felix, who played five seasons as a center for the New York Knicks in the 1950's, died on Sunday at his home in East Elmhurst, Queens. His son, Ray Jr., said the cause of death was a heart attack. Mr. Felix was 60 years old.
        Mr. Felix, a New Yorker, played his college basketball at Long Island University under Coach Clair Bee. After college, he and Coach Bee both joined the Baltimore Bullets.
        The 6-foot-11-inch pivotman won rookie of the year honors in the National Basketball Association in 1953-54 after leading the Bullets in scoring with an average of 17.6 points a game. After the season he was traded to New York for Al McGuire and Connie Simmons.
        In 376 games with the Knicks, he averaged 12 points and 9.1 rebounds. New York traded him to the Lakers on Jan. 24, 1960. After ending his pro career in Los Angeles in 1963, he worked for many years with the New York City Parks Department. In recent years, he was a supervisor at the Harlem Men's Shelter for the homeless.
        Mr. Felix is survived by his wife, Gloria: a son, Ray Jr., and four sisters.
