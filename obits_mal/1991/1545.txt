        Earl Attlee, a founding member of Britain's Social Democratic Party and the only son of former Prime Minister Clement Attlee, died today, a spokesman for Southampton Hospital said. He was 63 years old.
        The spokesman did not give any details, but a family friend said Earl Attlee had suffered a stroke on Monday evening and was in a coma. Both spoke on condition that they not be named.
        Earl Attlee was a deputy whip in the House of Lords for the centrist Social Democratic Party, of which he was a founder member.
        His father, a member of the Labor Party, was Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951 and introduced a sweeping program of nationalization and a new system of social services in Britain, including the National Health Service. He accepted an earldom in 1955 after he retired as opposition leader.
        Martin Richard Attlee, who became the second earl after his father died in 1967, served in the Merchant Navy from 1945 to 1950 and was an active member of the Honorable Artillery Company from 1951 to 1955.
        The earl was divorced from his first wife, Anne, in 1988, and married Margaret Gouriet the same year. He is survived by his second wife and a son and daughter from his first marriage. His son, Viscount Prestwood, succeeds him as the third earl.
