        Jose Cardinal Salazar Lopez died of a heart attack on Tuesday at a hospital in Guadalajara, church officials said. He was 81 years old.
        Appointed by Pope Paul VI in 1973, Cardinal Salazar was the third of only five cardinals in Mexican history.
        Mexico has two living cardinals, Ernesto Corripio of Mexico City and Juan Jesus Posadas, also of Guadalajara.
        Cardinal Salazar was born on Jan. 12, 1910, in Ameca, Jalisco, 30 miles west of Guadalajara, Mexico's second largest city. He was ordained in 1934 and made a bishop in 1961, and became Archbishop of Guadalajara in 1970.
