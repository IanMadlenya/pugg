        Gordon Ericksen, director emeritus of the American Language Institute at New York University, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 73 years old and also had a residence in Pedona di Camaiore, Italy.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was director of the institute from 1953 to 1973. He also taught English as a second language at Hostos Community College of the City University of New York.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jane Sebastian; two children from a former marriage, Robert L. Erick MacGordon of Manhattan and Judith Ericksen of Brazil; two stepsons, John Sebastian of Woodstock, N.Y., the singer, and Mark, of Los Angeles, an actor, and three grandchildren.
