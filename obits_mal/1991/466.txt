        Leif Melgaard, an artist whose woodcarvings became museum pieces and also found their way into Norway's royal palace, died on Saturday after a long illness. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Melgaard, who was born on a farm near Gudbrandsdalen, Norway, emigrated to the United States in 1920.
        He was among 12 American artists to receive the National Heritage Award in 1985 from the National Endowment for the Arts.
