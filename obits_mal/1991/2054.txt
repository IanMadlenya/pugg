        Tracy Bennett, a longtime dancer with the New York City Ballet, died on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 39 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said Mark Walker of the Walker Mortuary in Morgan, Utah.
        Mr. Bennett was born in Salt Lake City. He trained at the ballet school of the University of Utah and danced with Ballet West, based in Salt Lake City, from 1966 to 1970. He joined City Ballet the following year as a corps dancer, but he performed solo roles beginning early in his tenure. He had the distinction of performing in more works during City Ballet's 1972 Stravinsky Festival than any other dancer.
        Considered one of the company's most promising young dancers, Mr. Bennett was singled out during his career for his verve, ease, classical elegance and jazzy elasticity. Mr. Bennett originated roles in George Balanchine's "Chaconne," "Danses Concertantes," "L'Enfant et les Sortileges" and "Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2"; in Jerome Robbins's "Watermill," and in Peter Martins's "Ecstatic Orange," among other works.
        Mr. Bennett is survived by his mother, Lois Akogi of Salt Lake City; four brothers, David and Craig Bennett and Douglas Akogi of Salt Lake City and Scott, of Bakersfield, Calif., and a sister, Jeanette Holmstead of Murray, Utah.
