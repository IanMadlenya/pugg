        Stephen P. Guardino Jr., the former president of Guardino & Sons Marine Contractors, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack after collapsing in an office building, a nephew said.
        Mr. Guardino took over a tank- and hull-cleaning business founded by his father that grew enormously during World War II.  He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two sons, Stephen 3d, of Tampa, Fla., and Henry, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a sister, Lillian Chirello of Richmond, and three grandchildren.
