        Dr. Ralph G. Fairchild, a physicist and medical researcher at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, died on Dec. 17 while vacationing in Mount Cook National Park, New Zealand. He was 55 years old and lived in Setauket, L.I.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife said.
        Dr. Fairchild's work was directed at improving radiotherapy, particularly for brain cancer and melanoma, with new approaches involving photons, neutrons and radioactive substances.
        Internationally recognized as a leading American investigator in boron-neutron-capture therapy, Dr. Fairchild helped develop a new type of neutron beam at Brookhaven's Medical Research Reactor. The goal of neutron-capture therapy is to attract radiation to cancer cells, destroying them while leaving neighboring healthy cells undamaged.
        Dr. Fairchild, who was born in Trenton, earned a bachelor's degree in science from St. Lawrence University, a master's degree in nuclear engineering from Cornell University and a Ph.D. in physics from Adelphi University.
        He joined Brookhaven's medical department in 1961. In 1979 he also became a research associate professor at the School of Medicine at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
        Besides his wife, Frances, a retired teacher, he is survived by two sons, David, a physician with the Indian Health Service at Chinle, Ariz., and James, a hydrologist in Philadelphia; two daughters, Stephanie, a social worker in Buffalo, and Jovi, a senior at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.; his mother, Sara Fairchild Masland, a retired teacher, of Port Washington, L.I.; a sister, Virginia Pabst, of San Rafael, Calif., and two grandchildren.
