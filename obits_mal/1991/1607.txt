        Richard Kaufman, an accounting executive and a community volunteer, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 49 years old and lived on Roosevelt Island.
        He died of an embolism, his family said.
        Mr. Kaufman was president of the Community Advisory Board of Goldwater Memorial Hospital on the island, serving as liaison to the patients and staff.
        He is survived by his wife, Minerva; his parents, Helen and Judge Irving R. Kaufman of the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan, who is retired, and a brother, James, of Manhattan.
        Correction:  July 10, 1991, Wednesday
        An obituary yesterday about Richard Kaufman, a New York advertising executive and community volunteer, misstated the status of his father, Federal Judge Irving R. Kaufman. Judge Kaufman is a senior judge of the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan; he is not retired.
