        Robert H. Baraz, a senior State Department adviser and a high-ranking intelligence expert, died Tuesday at a Hospital in Arlington, Va. He was 61 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        Mr. Baraz died of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the State Department said.
        At the time of his death, he was an adviser on Soviet affairs to the State Department's Bureau for Intelligence and Research. He had retired in January 1990, but continued to work under contract.
        A 1954 graduate of Harvard University with a master's degree in Russian studies, Mr. Baraz worked briefly as a news reporter before joining the State Department in 1957 as an intelligence analyst.
        In the 1960's, he was part of a task force that dealt with the Berlin wall crisis, and in the 1970's was director of the political-military office of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research.
        He served next as director of the bureau's Soviet and East European office, and was named the State Department's national intelligence officer for arms control issues and Soviet affairs in 1986.
        In 1981, Mr. Baraz received a Presidential award for his work on Soviet policy issues.
