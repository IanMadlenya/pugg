        Edgar Lewy, a philatelic writer and stamp cataloguer who specialized in modern postage stamps, died Feb. 16 in London. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Lewy suffered from pneumonia, his United States publisher, Linn's Stamp News, said.
        Mr. Lewy was born in Berlin and fled Nazi Germany with his parents in 1936. He held a graduate degree in printing from Leeds University.
        His interest in printing led him to publish New Stamps, which was issued twice a month, from 1951 until ill health forced him into semi-retirement in 1988. New Stamps was an authoritative compendium and included details of printing techniques that were not generally available to collectors.
        Until his death, he also wrote a weekly column in Linn's on new issues and columns in several British and Australian publications. His personal stamp collection emphasized the stamps of Austria and engravings of new stamps.
        Mr. Lewy is survived by his wife, Lilly, and two children.
