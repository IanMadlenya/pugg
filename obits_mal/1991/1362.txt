        Robert B. Masson, a radio, television and public relations executive, died on Tuesday at his home in Studio City, Calif. He was 75 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said Herb Steinberg, a friend and spokesman for the family.
        In the early 1940's, Mr. Masson produced and directed "The Gloomdodgers," a daily variety show, on WMGM radio in New York, and then served as television program manager for Young and Rubicam, the advertising agency.
        He joined the program department of NBC Television in 1949 and helped conceive -- and then produced -- "Your Show of Shows," starring Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca. He subsequently produced NBC programs including "Broadway Open House," "The Colgate Comedy Hour," "The All Star Revue," "The Bob Hope Show" and "The Martha Raye Show."
        In 1960 he joined the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company as director of radio and television programming, later serving as its western regional director of public relations until his retirement in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice, and a brother, Alistair, of New York.
