        Barnet Naiman, a professor emeritus of chemistry at the City College of the City University of New York, died on June 4 at Forest Hill Manor, a retirement home in Pacific Grove, Calif. He was 91 years old.
        He died of complications stemming from an infection, his daughter said.
        He retired in 1970 after 45 years of teaching. Among his students were Jonas Salk, who discovered the polio vaccine, and Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid camera.
        Professor Naiman was co-author with William Rieman and Jacob Neuss of a textbook, "Quantitative Analysis" (McGraw Hill, 1942), that was reissued in 1951.
        He was a native of Baltimore and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1921. He received a master's degree in science and a doctorate from Columbia University.
        His wife, the former Dorothy Neuhof, a professor emeritus of physiology at Hunter College, died in 1979.
        He is survived by a daughter, Barbara Gee of Pacific Grove, and two grandchildren.
