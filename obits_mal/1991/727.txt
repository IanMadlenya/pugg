        Herbert Adler, a garment industry executive and entrepreneur, died on Wednesday at Bethesda Medical Center in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 72 years old and lived in Cleveland and Palm Beach.
        He died of kidney failure, said his wife, the former Dorothy Schepps.
        Mr. Adler, a certified public accountant, began his career after World War II with the Clarence Rainess Company, a Manhattan accounting firm that specialized in the garment industry. In 1967 he became the president of Bobbie Brooks, a manufacturer of women's and children's wear in New York.
        In 1977 he left Bobbie Brooks to become a partner in an investment group that purchased Humphries Leather Goods in Chicago. As chairman of Humphries, Mr. Adler helped it grow into one of the largest privately owned leather goods companies in the country before it was sold in 1990.
        He served as a trustee of Ohio University, from which he graduated in 1939, and as a fund-raiser for the United Jewish Appeal.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Michael, of Paris; two daughters, Carol Adler of Manhattan and Ellen Direnfeld of Washington; a brother, Seymour, of Los Angeles, and seven grandchildren.
