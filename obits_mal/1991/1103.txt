        Dr. Stanley Levin, a pediatrician and an immunologist who was assistant chief of staff at Schneider Children's Hospital of Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park for the last four years, died on Sunday in Rehovot, Israel. He was 69 years old and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        He died of melanoma, said chief of staff at the hospital, Dr. Philip Lanzkowski. Dr. Levin taught classes and continued his other duties until two weeks ago, Dr. Lanzkowski said.
        Dr. Levin was born in Johannesburg and received his medical training at the University of Witwatersrand.
        When Palestine was partitioned, Dr. Levin volunteered as a battalion surgeon with Haganah, the Jewish underground army. During hostilities with Arab forces in 1948 he married his chief nurse, Yochi Ashkenazi, who survives him, at a front-line hospital.
        Dr. Levin remained in the new state of Israel as a pediatrician, although he spent several sabbatical leaves at hospitals in the United States.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Zvi, of Kansas City, Mo.; a daughter, Elite, of Great Neck; a brother, Victor, of Sarasota, Fla., and four grandchildren.
