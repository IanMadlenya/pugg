        Rudolf F. Haffenreffer 3d, an industrialist whose family controlled the Narragansett Brewing Company, died Sunday at his home in Bristol. He was 88 years old.
        Narragansett Brewing, founded by his family in 1870, was sold in 1965 for more than $17 million to the Falstaff Brewing Corporation, which closed it in 1981 because of declining sales.
        Mr. Haffenreffer retired as Narragansett president and chairman in 1967.
        In the 1930's the family took over the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company, a Bristol shipyard that produced eight America's Cup yachts.
        Mr. Haffenreffer is survived by his wife, Virginie; a son, three daughters, a brother and 12 grandchildren.
