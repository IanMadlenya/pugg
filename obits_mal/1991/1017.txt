        Dr. Elliot Oppenheim, a specialist in internal medicine, especially diabetes, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, the former Tobian Goldman.
        Dr. Oppenheim, who at his death was in full-time practice in Gramercy Park, received his medical degree in 1938 from the University of Edinburgh.

        He was affiliated with several hospitals and was the co-author of a medical text. He was also a past-president of the Scarsdale Board of Education.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Steven, of Boston, and David, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Patricia, of Bellevue, Wash., and two grandchildren.
