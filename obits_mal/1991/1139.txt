        Jesse Siff, chief economist for Lehman Brothers from 1954 to 1972, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Siff, a native New Yorker, was a graduate of Columbia University and served in the Army in World War II in North Africa and Italy.
        He was one of the first economists hired by a Wall Street firm when he joined Lehman Brothers in 1948. After leaving Lehman, he was a founding partner of Siff, Oakley & Marks, an economic research and investment advisory firm. He later established his own institutional equity advisory firm, Jesse Siff Associates.
        Mr. Siff is survived by his wife, the former Mollie Biletch.
