        John Dillon, an advertising executive and a novelist, died on Tuesday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 68 years old.
        He died of respiratory failure, his company said.
        Mr. Dillon, known as Jack, joined Doyle Dane Bernbach in Manhattan as a copywriter 30 years ago and eventually rose to senior vice president and creative manager of the company, now called DDB Needham.
        His best-known work was a long-running television campaign for Polaroid featuring James Garner and Mariette Hartley. It won the 1982 Grand Effie award from the American Marketing Association. Other accounts he worked on included American Airlines, Avis and Volkswagen.
        He also wrote four novels: "The Spotted Horse," "Our Kind of People," "A Great Day for Dying" and "The Advertising Man."
        Mr. Dillon was born in Bloomfield, N.J. He worked 11 years for Fuller & Smith & Ross in Manhattan before switching to Doyle Dane in 1961. There he became a copy supervisor in 1962, a vice president in 1964 and senior vice president and creative manager in 1981.
        He is survived by two daughters, Cathleen McAbee of Cape Cod, Mass., and Linda Voltz of Westport, and a brother, Robert, of Santa Barbara, Calif.
