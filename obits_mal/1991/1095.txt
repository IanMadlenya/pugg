        Paul Cohen, co-founder of Imperial Wear, a retailing and mail-order clothing business for large and tall men, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Cohen, a native New Yorker, co-founded the business in Manhattan with Buddy Robins 46 years ago. It began as a small mail-order business and grew into an international mail-order company with two retail outlets, one in Manhattan, the other in Garden City, L.I. Among their clients were many football and basketball players.
        Mr. Cohen is survived by his wife, the former Laura Warner; two sons, George and Robert, both of Manhattan; a daughter, Alice Belden of Chicago, and nine grandchildren.
