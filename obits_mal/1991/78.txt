        Ira Frederick Aldridge, an accountant with I.B.M. for almost 20 years and a deputy commissioner in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, died on Sunday at Dobbs Ferry Community Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in Irvington, N.Y.
        He died of a respiratory disease, said his wife, Alfreda.
        A 1953 graduate of the City College of New York, Mr. Aldridge was a staff accountant with the New York Telephone company before joining the Carver Federal Savings and Loan Association as a vice president and auditor in 1957. He was later controller of HARYOU-ACT, one of the early anti-poverty agencies in Manhattan, before joining the Human Resources Administration under Mayor Lindsay. He joined the International Business Machines Corporation in 1968 and held a variety of positions before retiring in 1987. He was a great-nephew and namesake of the 19th-century black Shakespearean actor, Ira Frederick Aldridge.
        In addition to his widow, he is survived by a daughter, Cheryl Aldridge of Manhattan, and one grandson.
