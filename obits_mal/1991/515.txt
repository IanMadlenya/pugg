        Isadore Hamlin, a former executive vice chairman of the American section of the World Zionist Organization, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74 years old.
        He died of cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Hamlin, who spent 45 years with the World Zionist Organization and with the Jewish Agency for Israel, was the senior Zionist official in the United States and played a pivotal role in the Zionist movement in America.
        Born in Cambridge, Mass., he was a graduate of Cornell University and served as a captain in Army intelligence in Europe in World War II.
        From 1945 to 1949, he was administrative officer for the Jewish Agency's Washington office, which later became the Embassy for the State of Israel. He was then named assistant director of the Jewish Agency's New York office and was appointed executive director of the American section of the World Zionist Organization. He was executive vice chairman of the organization from 1974 to 1988, when he retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen; a son, Matthew, of Chicago; two daughters, Abby, of Manhattan, and Emily, of Chicago, and two grandchildren.
