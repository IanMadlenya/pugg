        Edwin Wolf 2d, a specialist in rare books and bibliography who headed the Library Company of Philadelphia for 32 years before he retired in 1984, died on Wednesday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 79 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Wolf was credited with reviving the library, founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin and containing the country's only surviving intact Colonial collection of books, maps and related artworks.
        A native of Philadelphia and the son of a prominent lawyer, he went to work when he was 18 years old for A. S. W. Rosenbach, the bookseller and bibliophile who attained a worldwide reputation. In 1953 Mr. Wolf was named curator of the collections at the Library Company, the oldest subscription library in the United States.
        Among the books he wrote were "Rosenbach: A Biography," co-written with John F. Fleming and published by World in 1960. He was a founder and president of the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance and an officer of the American Jewish Historical Society.
        Mr. Wolf is survived by his wife, the former Mary Paxson Matthews; two daughters, Mary Hurtig of Philadelphia and Ellen Shrecker of Manhattan; a son, Anthony, of Boston, and a brother, Robert, of Philadelphia.
