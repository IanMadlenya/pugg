        Burleigh Wartes, a cinematographer who worked on three Academy Award-winning documentaries, died Tuesday at his home in Norwalk, Conn. He was 58 years old.
        His family declined to give the cause of death.
        Mr. Wartes filmed more than 100 documentaries, features and commercials in more than 40 countries. His most recent work, "Superstar: The Life and Times of Andy Warhol," was released commercially this year. He was also the photographer of the films "Living Planet" and "On the Wing," both of which were shown at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, the Smithsonian Institution and other museums.
        The three Academy Award-winning documentaries for which Mr. Wartes was cinematographer were "Gods of Metal," about anti-nuclear advocates, "The Gifts," about water pollution, and "Straight Talk," about high school students who were taken to a penitentiary for warning lectures by convicts.
        He won an Emmy for his documentary "For Export Only," about pesticides and medicines prohibited or restricted in industrial countries but marketed freely in developing nations.
        Among his other films are "Style Wars," "Vietnam: An American Journey," "Who Shot President Kennedy?," "Linus Pauling, Crusading Scientist" and "The Age of Intelligent Machines."
        Surviving are his wife, Samantha Heilweil; their son, Joshua; two sons from his first marriage, David and Stephen, of Seattle, and two brothers, Jon and Chris, also of Seattle.
        A memorial service is to be held on Sunday at 2 P.M. at Saugatuck Congregational Church in Westport, Conn.
