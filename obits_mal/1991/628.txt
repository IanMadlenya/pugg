        Warren Chappell, a book illustrator and graphic artist, died on Tuesday at his home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 86 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said a spokesman for the Teague Funeral Service of Charlottesville.
        Mr. Chappell illustrated books for several publishing houses, including Alfred A. Knopf, Random House, Harper & Row, Doubleday and Little, Brown. His own books included "The Anatomy of Lettering" (1935), "A Short History of the Printed Word" (1970) and "The Living Alphabet" (1975). He also designed two typefaces, Lydian and Trajanus.
        Among the books he illustrated were editions of Jonathan Swift's "Tale of a Tub" (1930), Leighton Barret's retelling of Cervantes' "Don Quixote de la Mancha" (1939), Mark Twain's "Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" (1942), Henry Fielding's "Tom Jones" (1943), Herman Melville's "Moby-Dick" (1976) and Robert Penn Warren's "All the King's Men" (1981).
        Mr. Chappell collaborated with John Updike on books for children on music, including "The Magic Flute" (1962), "The Ring" (1964) and "Bottom's Dream" (1969).
        Born into a prominent Richmond family, Mr. Chappell was a graduate of the University of Richmond and studied at the Art Students League in New York, where he later taught.
        Mr. Chappell established his first studio on New York in 1932, moving in 1951 to Norwalk, Conn., and in 1978 to Charlottesville, where he was artist in residence at the University of Virginia.
        He is survived by his wife, Lydia.
