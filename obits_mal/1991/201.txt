        Dr. O. Wesley Davidson, a research scientist in plant nutrition and orchid culture and a faculty member at Rutgers University for 40 years, died on Saturday at St. Peter's Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 87 years old and lived in North Brunswick, N.J.
        He died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.
        As chairman of the Rutgers floriculture department from 1939 to 1969, he conducted wide research on the nutrition and physiology of orchids and other greenhouse plants and was a pioneer in the use of liquid fertilizers.
        Dr. Davidson, a native of Philadelphia, earned bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Rutgers. He became an authority on viruses and pests plaguing orchids, then a significant commercial crop in New Jersey, and was awarded the Gold Medal of Achievement by the American Orchid Society in 1971. He had been president of the New York Florists Club and a member of the executive committee of the International Flower Show in New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Eunice DeClark Davidson; a son, Donald, of West Windsor, N.J.; a daughter, Devon Schuster of Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.
