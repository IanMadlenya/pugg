        The Rev. Jerome A. Pechillo, an Auxiliary Bishop for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, died on Tuesday at his brother's home in San Francisco. He was 71 years old and lived at St. Aloysius Parish in Jersey City.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, his secretary said.
        Bishop Pechillo would have celebrated the 25th anniversary of his ordination as a bishop on Jan. 25. He was born in Brooklyn, studied at the Catholic University of America and was ordained as a member of the Francisan Fathers in 1947. He served in several positions at the Franciscan Preparatory Seminary in Hollidaysburg, Pa., before being appointed as a Vatican representative to missionaries in Paraguay in 1961.
        He was ordained a Titular Bishop in 1966 and in 1976 was appointed by the Archdiocese of Newark as regional bishop of Hudson County. He served on various committees of the Archdiocese of Newark and was treasurer of the North East Catholic Pastoral Center of Hispanics for the National Council of Catholic Bishops. He was also a member of the Latin America Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
        He is survived by a brother, Rudolph DiCarlo of San Francisco.
