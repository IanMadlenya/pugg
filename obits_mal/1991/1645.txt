        Milton D. Ratner, a Chicago physician, businessman and art collector, died Wednesday at his home. He was 73 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his stepdaughter, Julie Markow, said.
        Dr. Ratner attended Northwestern University and received his medical degree there in 1939. He served as a captain in the Army Medical Corps in Europe.
        In 1949 he joined the family business, Emery Freight System, founded by his father, Harry Ratner. He was chairman when he sold the company in 1988 and retired.
        A collector of 20th-century art, Dr. Ratner acquired a large collection of paintings, drawings and sculptures by Giacometti in the 1950's, most of which he sold at Sotheby's in 1984. He also collected African art and paintings by Delvaux, Baj and Dubuffet.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Audrey Slater; two sons, Gary and John, of Chicago; a daughter, Dr. Francine Kaufman of Los Angeles; three sisters, Bertha Cooke of Chicago; Helen Lipson of Los Angeles, and Beverly Jones of Hershey, Pa., and eight grandchildren.
