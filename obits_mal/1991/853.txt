        Howard Lanin, a band leader whose orchestra played for many well-known families, died on Friday at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 93 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, his son Myron said.
        Mr. Lanin was born in Philadelphia and began his professional career as a musician at age 11, when he appeared as a drummer at the old Crystal Palace movie theater. By the time he was 17, he had his own dance orchestra and he continued conducting until he was 89.
        The Howard Lanin Orchestra played for society parties and in ballrooms like those of the Ritz-Carlton in Manhattan and the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla.
        In 1940, he began producing shows for corporate events and conventions.  In addition to his son Myron, of New York City, he is survived by two brothers, William and Lester, also a band leader; another son, Jay, of Albuquerque, N.M.; two daughters, Betty Ann Beckman of Margate, N.J., and Suzanne Lande of Woodbridge, Conn.; 9 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
