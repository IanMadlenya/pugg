        Calvin L. Holt, a founder and owner of Serendipity 3, the "restaurant-general store" at 225 East 60th Street, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from heart bypass surgery, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Holt and his partner, Stephen Bruce, presided over the lively cafe and boutique since it opened in 1954. Its quirky specialties range from zen hash to frozen hot chocolate, and its whimsical merchandise is framed by original Tiffany lamps and other antiques.
        Favorite fare among the cafe's celebrity-sprinkled habitues are three-egg omelets filled with cavier and sour cream, Aunt Buba's sand tarts and lemon ice-box pie. Their formulas were revealed in "The Serendipity Cookbook," written by Messrs. Holt and Bruce with Pat Miller and published last year by Wynwood Press.
        Mr. Holt was a native of Hazen, Ark., and studied acting at the Goodman Memorial Theater in Chicago and modern dance with Jose Limon in New York. He acted and danced on television, in Latin Quarter revues and in Broadway shows including the 1955 production of "Catch a Star!" As a director of the Association of East Side Communities, he challenged the proposed development of the Queensboro Bridge area.
        He is survived by his stepmother, Rosa Boyce of Little Rock, Ark.
