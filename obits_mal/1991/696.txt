        Bud Berman, a clothing manufacturer, died Thursday at Sarasota Hospital in Florida. He was 74 years old and lived in Osprey, Fla., and in St. Louis.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his wife, Saramina.
        Mr. Berman retired in November as vice president for corporate development of the Kellwood Company of St. Louis, a manufacturer of clothing, home fashions and recreation equipment. He had been president of Kellwood's international division.
        After Army service in World War II he headed two clothing companies, with factories in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan, and ran a consulting company before joining Kellwood in 1977.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lorry Halloway of Washington; two sons, Burt and Bruce, both of San Francisco, and four grandchildren.
