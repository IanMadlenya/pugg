        Ralph Bisdale, a lighting artist and design consultant, died on Sunday at the Greenery Rehabilitation Center in Seattle. He was 46 years old and lived in Seattle.
        He died of complications of AIDS, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. Bisdale was born in Brooklyn. He was considered a talented environmental designer and his interiors for night clubs, stores and homes were featured in publications in the 1970's. Among his clients were Saks Fifth Avenue, Henri Bendel, Bonwit Teller and, most recently, Nordstrom.
        He is survived by a sister, Suzanne Cubbage.
