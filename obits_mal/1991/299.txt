        Peter P. Nigro, a founder of Nigro Brothers, the contractor on several of the largest highway projects in Westchester County in the last three decades, died on Saturday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 56 years old and lived in Eastchester, N.Y.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Nigro (pronounced NYE-gro) is one of four brothers who founded the family concern, originally to do landscaping, in Mount Vernon in 1958. They soon went into road construction and worked on the New England Thruway, the New York State Thruway and the Hutchinson River Parkway.
        Mr. Nigro is survived by his wife, the former Joan Gauthier; four sons, Gary, Thomas, Michael and Peter Jr., all of Eastchester; four sisters, Mary Nigro and Linda Porpora, both of Mount Vernon, Yolanda Bambera of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Eleanor Nullet of Bronxville; two brothers, Joseph and August, both of New Rochelle, and four grandchildren.
