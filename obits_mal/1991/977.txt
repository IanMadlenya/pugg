        Milt Bruhn, whose 11-year career as head football coach at the University of Wisconsin featured a stunning comeback by his team in a 1963 Rose Bowl defeat, died on Tuesday in Madison, Wis. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Bruhn died of a heart attack, said his wife, Helen.
        Badger teams coached by Mr. Bruhn from 1956-66 had a combined won-lost-tied record of 52-45-6. His teams won Big Ten conference titles in 1959 and 1962, then subsequently lost the Rose Bowl each time. In the second bowl, Wisconsin trailed Southern California by 42-14 early in the fourth quarter, then rallied dramatically, only to fall short, 42-37.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Bruhn is survived by a daughter, Mary Anne, and a son, Peter.
