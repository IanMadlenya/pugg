        Andre Kaminski, a Swiss writer whose novel "Next Year in Jerusalem" brought him wide acclaim late in life, died on Jan. 12, his family said on Sunday. He was 67 years old. His family said the announcement of his death was delayed so other relatives could be notified.
        The Zurich newspaper Sonntags-Zeitung said he had heart problems after breaking a leg while recovering from a stroke.
        He was born in Geneva of Polish Jewish descent. His best-selling novel, published in 1986, traced his family roots in an anecdotal style. It was published in the United States under the title "Kith and Kin."
        He was also a television producer and stage director.
        Survivors include his wife, Doris Morf, a Swiss politician.
