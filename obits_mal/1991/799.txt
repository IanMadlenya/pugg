        Roger Howdyshell, owner of one of the nation's few remaining manufacturers of toy marbles, died Thursday. He was 67 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Mr. Howdyshell had owned Marble King Inc. of Paden City, W. Va., for the last decade. He had been with the company and its predecessor for more than 40 years.
        He promoted the game of marbles by conducting and helping others to conduct local tournaments. For 20 years he was a director of the National Marbles Tournament in Wildwood, N.J.
        Company officials said Marble King Inc., which ships marbles around the world, would remain in operation.
