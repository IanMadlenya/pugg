        Dr. Biagio Battaglia, a retired medical officer for the New York City Fire Department, died on Monday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 81 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his daughter Frances Altman of Melrose Village, L.I.
        Dr. Battaglia, who specialized in pulmonary and respiratory diseases, worked for the city from 1950 to 1976.
        At his death he was an attending physician at Brooklyn and Kings County Hospitals and at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Brooklyn. He was a past president of the Brooklyn Lung Association.
        He was instrumental in introducing fire-retardant uniforms to the Fire Department in the early 1970's.
        Dr. Battaglia is survived by another daughter, Ann Feldman of Brooklyn; a sister, Mary Petrelli of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; three grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
