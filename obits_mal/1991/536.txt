        John D. Voelker, the Michigan judge who wrote "Anatomy of a Murder" and other books under the name Robert Traver, died on Monday. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Voelker was driving his car near his home here when he suffered a heart attack, state police in Negaunee said.
        Mr. Voelker, who was born in Ishpeming on the state's Upper Peninsula on June 29, 1903, was a retired justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. His 11 books consisted mainly of courtroom drama and fishing yarns.
        Mr. Voelker was the Marquette County prosecutor from 1935 to 1950 and served on the Michigan Supreme Court from 1957 to 1960.  'Anatomy' Was a Real Case
        "Anatomy of a Murder," published in 1958, was about a shooting by an Army lieutenant enraged by the rape of his wife. Mr. Voelker, who based the novel on a 1952 murder in Big Bay on the Upper Peninsula, was the defense lawyer in the actual case. Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Orville Prescott called it "immensely readable and continuously entertaining" and cited the author's "unflagging invention and narrative pace."
        "Anatomy of a Murder" remained on the Times best-seller list for more than a year. The 1959 film, directed by Otto Preminger and starring James Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara and George C. Scott, was praised by Bosley Crowther in The Times as "well nigh flawless."
        Among Mr. Voelker's other books were "Troubleshooter: The Story of a Northwoods Prosecutor," "Small Town D.A.," "Hornstein's Boy," "Laughing Whitefish," "Trout Madness" and "Anatomy of a Fisherman."
        In a 1989 interview, Mr. Voelker said: "Spinning yarns is a protection against the nuttiness . . . the greed, the hate all around us. I'm a fisherman who likes to observe and tell yarns, and so I told stories about things that I knew about."
        He is survived by his wife, Grace, and three daughters.
