        Richard M. Protovin, a painter, film maker and art teacher, died on Dec. 6 at his mother's home in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 46 years old and lived in Pass-a-Grille Beach, Fla.
        He died of AIDS, said Laurie Loeb, an assistant professor in New York University's film and television department.
        Mr. Protovin founded and headed the animation department at the Tisch School of the Arts at the university, where he was an associate professor from 1979 to 1988. That year, he moved to Florida and became a professor of animation production and cinema studies at the University of Tampa. His films have been shown as part of the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Best Short Films series at the Seattle International Film Festival, as well as at festivals in Moscow, Cannes and Venice.
        His paintings hang in museums and corporate collections around the world and have been seen in solo shows at the Peter Flannagan Gallery, the Animator's Gallery and the Raimundo Gallery in New York, as well as the Art Center in Turin, Italy.
        In addition to his mother, Doris Protovin, he is survived by a sister, Jody, also of St. Petersburg.
