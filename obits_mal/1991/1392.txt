        Robert L. Wilson, a Methodist Church sociologist and commentator, died of bone cancer Sunday at his home in Durham. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Wilson had been a professor of church and society at Duke University Divinity School since 1970. He directed the J. M. Ormond Center for Research, Planning and Development at Duke.
        His research interests focused on the relationship between church and community, the sociology of religious institutions, congregational planning and United Methodist Church policy.
        His book "What's Ahead for Old First Church?" is considered a pioneer study of urban flight from downtown churches.
        Mr. Wilson is survived by his wife, Betty Berenthien; a son, Keith, of St. Paul; a daughter, Marian Wilson, of Charlottesville, Va., and two grandchildren.
