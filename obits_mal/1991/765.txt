        Carl H. T. Sloss, a retired advertising director and former co-publisher and advertising director of Esquire Inc.'s Apparel Arts, died yesterday at his home in Strasburg, Pa. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Sloss died of congestive heart failure, his wife, the former Kathleen Boland, said.
        Mr. Sloss, a native New Yorker, worked for Esquire for several years before joining Reporter Publications Inc., to become advertising director of Gentry in 1951. The following year he was retained by Town and Country as manager of the magazine's men's wear department. He retired in 1969.
        Mr. Sloss began his career as an advertising manager in the 1940's with Cohn Hall Marx Company, manufacturers of men's wear fabrics.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son from a former marriage, Jack Sterling, a radio announcer for Yankee baseball; and a sister, Helen Barth of Rochester.
