        Larry W. Wilsman, the senior buyer of European and American designer collections at Saks Fifth Avenue, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 43 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, said Helen O'Hagan, a spokeswoman for Saks.
        Mr. Wilsman spent his entire career at Saks. He had a knack for spotting styles by Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel and Armani that would appeal to American customers. Working without notes, he could recall every detail, including accessories, of the clothes he saw on the runways.
        Mr. Wilsman was born in Evansville, Ill., and joined Saks as an assistant manager in the designer salon in St. Louis when he was 20. He became manager of the designer salon in Skokie, Ill., and came to New York in 1972 as an assistant buyer of misses dresses. He became the store's senior buyer in 1988 and handled designer lines like those of Bill Blass, Geoffrey Beene and Oscar de la Renta as well as European collections.
        He is survived by his mother, Helen, of Evansville, and his father, Wayne, of Chicago.
