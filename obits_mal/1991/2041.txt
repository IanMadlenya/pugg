        Hans Harnik, who left Austria to escape the Nazis and who, as an American lawyer, represented that country's new government after the war for nearly half a century, died on Friday at New York Hospital in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Harnik died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Born in Vienna, Mr. Harnik fled to the United States in 1938 and worked his way through Brooklyn College and Brooklyn Law School. He joined the Manhattan law firm of Wachtell, Manheim & Grouf, which represented Austrian government agencies until Worl War II. During the war the firm helped many Jewish refugees escape Austria.
        After the war, with the firm resuming its work with Austria, Mr. Harnik represented the country's consulate, trade mission and United Nations mission, among other agencies. When the 103-year-old firm dissolved this year, he was the senior partner. He then joined his son, Stephen, and others in a new firm, Goldberg Gelman & Harnik.
        In 1976, the Austrian Government awarded Mr. Harnik a medal for extraordinary service and in 1980 paid for his return visit as one of 400 "great sons" honored for their accomplishments abroad.
        Mr. Harnik was a former president of the Consular Law Society, for specialists in diplomatic law, and wrote articles on international arbitration.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Edith Bettelheim; his sons, Peter, of Arlington, Va., and Stephen, of New York City, and two grandchildren.
