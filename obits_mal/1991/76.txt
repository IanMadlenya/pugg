        Dr. Gratton A. Stevenson, an obstetrician and gynecologist who practiced in Garden City, L.I., for a quarter-century before he retired in 1973, died on Jan. 10 at Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in Dover, N.H. He was 73 years old and had lived since his retirement in Lee, N.H.
        He died of complications from emphysema, his family said.
