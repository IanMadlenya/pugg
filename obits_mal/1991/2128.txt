        Isidor Seidler, an electronics industry executive who late in life became a sculptor, died on Monday at Northshore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 85 years old and lived in Roslyn, L.I.
        The cause of death was liver cancer, his nephew, Lee J. Seidler, said.
        A graduate of City College of New York and New York Law School, Mr. Seidler began his career as a lawyer, but after earning a master's degree in electrical engineering from New York University in 1948, he entered the electronics industry.
        In 1952, he became chief executive officer at the Radio Receptor Corporation in Brooklyn, and in 1975 he took the top job at the Detecto Scale Company, also in Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife, Dora Bassman Seidler; a daughter, Susan Beckerman of Great Neck, L.I.; a brother, Leo of Linwood, N.J.; a sister, Sylvia Lurie of Freehold, N.J., and a granddaughter.
