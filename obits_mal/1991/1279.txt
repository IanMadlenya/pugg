        Louis E. Yavner, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and City Commissioner of Investigation in the LaGuardia administration, died on Saturday at Peekskill Community Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died as a result of a heart aneurysm, his wife, the former Viola Levenson, said.
        As a regent, Mr. Yavner worked to improve teaching, made illiteracy a public issue and challenged hiring methods of the Board of Education.
        Appointed Commissioner of Investigation in 1945, Mr. Yavner issued a controversial report that advocated setting up a bureau to ease racial tensions in the schools.
        Born in New York City, he went to Boys High School in Brooklyn and graduated from New York University Law School in 1938. For 30 years, he was senior partner in the law firm of Yavner and Bregstein, then counsel in the firm of Yavner, Gallet and Dreyer.
        From 1950 to 1953, he was deputy president of the New York City Council. He was also a member of the Wagner Commission on the Future of City University.
        Mr. Yavner was a national vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a trustee of the Jewish Board of Family and Children Services.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Ruth Himes of Falls Church, Va., and Judith, of Arlington, Va., and a son, Daniel, of Minnetonka, Minn.
