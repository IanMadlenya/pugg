        Robert Lee Cecchi, founder of the Gay Men's Health Crisis ombudsman's program in 1984, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center. He was 49 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Cecchi died of AIDS-related illness, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Cecchi was an early board member of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, a volunteer and founder of the ombudsman's program, which helped individual members protect their rights and find access to necessary health care. In the nearly four years he acted as ombudsman, he handled more than 1,000 complaints brought against hospitals or other health-care providers.
        In 1983, he was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to the New York State Aids Advisory Council, where he served until 1988.
        Mr. Cecchi was born in Olean, N.Y., and attended Ithaca College. He later received a degree in community and human services from the Empire State College of the State University of New York.
        He is survived by his parents, Josephine and Allen Cecchi of Olean; a brother, Allen Jr., of Arleta, Calif.; two sisters, Diane Cecchi of Marlton, N.J., and Donna Smith, also of Olean.
