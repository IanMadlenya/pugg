        J. Howard Carter, a founding partner in 1937 of the Manhattan law firm of Townley Updike Carter & Rodgers, now Townley & Updike, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Carter died of cancer, his daughter said.
        A trial lawyer for 30 years, he began his career in 1936 as chief assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, succeeding Thoma E. Dewey. As a trial lawyer, his clients included the News Syndicate Company, which publishes The Daily News, the Publishers Association and Elizabeth Arden. He retired in 1968.
        Mr. Carter grew up in the 1920's in East Harlem, where he played on the High School of Commerce varsity baseball team. It won the National High School Baseball Championship in 1920, and subsequently Mr. Carter received a baseball scholarship to Fordham University. That led to a contract with the Cincinnati Reds, for whom he played in five games as an infielder in 1926, according to The Baseball Encyclopedia.
        In 1974 he was inducted into the Fordham Athletic Hall of Fame.
        A widower, Mr. Carter is survived by a son, Howard, of Tinton Falls, N.J.; his daughter, Joan McHugh of Lake Forest, Ill.; a sister, Helen Hess of Wayne, Pa.; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
