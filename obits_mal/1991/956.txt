        Dr. Edward M. Rockey, a surgeon and a specialist in thoracic medicine who developed techniques for tracheobronchial drainage, died on Thursday at His home in Manhattan. He was 79 years old.
        He apparently died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Rockey graduated from the Pazmany Peter University of Budapest in 1939 and after an internship in Hungary completed his training in the United States. He served at several hospitals in Manhattan, including Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital and at St. Barnabas Hospital for Chronic Diseases in the Bronx, before joining the staff of Cabrini Medical Center and St. Clare's Hospital in 1978.
        Still active at both hospitals, he had a private practice in Manhattan. He taught at New York Medical College and invented the Rockey-Thompson Bronchial Suction Catheter, which enabled patients to remove excess fluids from their bronchial passages.
        He is survived by a sister, Catherine Woolf of Manhattan.
