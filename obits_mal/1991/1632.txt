        Dr. Henry C. Nathan, a professor of biology at Pace University, died on Saturday at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 66 years old.
        He died after a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Nathan, who was a research associate at the university's Haskins Laboratories, was instrumental in developing Ornidyl, a drug introduced last winter to treat African sleeping sickness.
        Dr. Nathan, a graduate of New York University, held a doctorate from Columbia. He served in the Navy in the Pacific in World War II.
        He began his career as a research biologist in 1953 at the Wellcome Research Laboratories in Tuckahoe, N.Y. In 1965 he joined the Union Carbide Research Institute in Tarrytown, N.Y.
        Dr. Nathan became a biology instructor at Hunter College in 1968 and was named to the Pace faculty in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Quinn, and two sons, Joshua, of Ithaca, N.Y., and Christopher, of Queens.
