        Johnny Thunders, a rock guitarist and songwriter who was a founding member of the New York Dolls, died Tuesday morning in New Orleans. He was 38 years old.
        The cause of his death is unknown and an autopsy has been ordered, his sister, Mariann Bracken, said.
        The New York Dolls blended elements of the Rolling Stones and American hard rock bands like MC5, and pioneered a heavily theatrical style that came to be called glam-rock. The Dolls, which were formed in 1971, gradually disintegrated and recorded their last album in 1974. But they influenced and helped form a local New York scene that included the Ramones, Blondie, Television and other groups.
        Mr. Thunders, whose real surname was Genzale, formed a new band several years later called the Heartbreakers, which was influential, as the Dolls had been, on the English punk scene. That band also dissolved, and in the 1980's Mr. Thunders recorded several solo albums and performed occasionally. He had recently returned from touring in Japan and Germany, and had moved to New Orleans only a day before he died.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by three sons, John Genzale, Vito Genzale, Dino Genzale, and a daughter, Jamie Genzale.
