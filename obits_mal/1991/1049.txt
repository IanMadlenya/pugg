        Jacob Millman, an electrical engineer who took part in the development of radar systems, died on Wednesday at his home in Longboat Key, Fla. He was 80 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said his grandson, Philip Millman of Palisades, N.Y.
        Dr. Millman, who was an expert on radar, electronic circuits and pulse-circuit techniques, was born in Russia and came to the United States in 1913.
        He earned a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1935. Except for three years during World War II, when he was a scientist with the Radiation Laboratory at M.I.T., he was a professor of engineering at City College of New York from 1936 to 1952.
        From 1952 until he retired in 1976, he taught at Columbia University. He was named chairman of the department of electrical engineering in 1965 and, at his retirement, became the Charles Batchelor Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering.
        He was the author or co-author of eight textbooks on electronics and computer science.
        He is survived by two sons, Richard, of Dayton, Ohio, and Jeffrey, of Billerica, Mass.; a sister, Rebecca Millman of Lawrence, Mass., and four grandchildren.
