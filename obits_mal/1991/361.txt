        Robert L. Hall, an aviator who designed World War II warplanes like the F4F Wildcat and F5F Hellcat that helped the Allies win the war, died on Monday at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. He was 85 years old and lived in Newport.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        The Wildcat and the Hellcat, which was designed to pilot specifications, set speed records during the war. Mr. Hall designed the planes for the Grumman Corporation, where he worked as an engineer and a test pilot starting in 1936.
        Mr. Hall also designed the TBF Avenger, which President Bush flew as a naval aviator in World War II, and several other warplanes. Later, as a vice president and chief engineer at Grumman, he led projects that built the Panther and Cougar jet fighters. He retired in 1970.
        Before joining Grumman, Mr. Hall worked for Stinson Aircraft from 1933 to 1936 where he designed the gull-wing Stinson Reliant.
        Mr. Hall was chief engineer of the Granville Brothers aircraft concern from 1931 to 1933. His Gee Bee racer City of Springfield swept every contest in the National Air Races in 1931.
        Mr. Hall was born in Taunton, Mass. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1927.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rhode Halvorsen; four sons, Robert Jr., of Kent, Conn., Edward, of San Diego, Eric, of Bristol, R.I., and Benjamin, of Tiverton, R.I., and seven grandchildren.
        Correction:  February 28, 1991, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Robert Hall, a designer of warplanes, misidentified one of his designs. It was the F-6F Hellcat, not the F-5F.
