        Paul Brickhill, author of "The Great Escape" and other war novels that sold millions of copies and were made into films, died on Tuesday. He was 74 years old.
        The cause of his death was not immediately available.
        Mr. Brickhill was a journalist on The Sun newspaper in Sydney before joining the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. He trained as a fighter pilot in Canada, flew with a squadron in England and was shot down over the Tunisian desert in 1943.
        He spent the rest of the war in a prisoner-of-war camp that became the setting of his book "The Great Escape," written in 1949.
        "The Dam Busters," "Escape or Die" and "Reach for the Sky," the story of legless British aviator Sir Douglas Bader, followed in quick succession.
        Mr. Brickhill's major books were translated into more than 20 languages and several, including "The Great Escape," were made into films.
        After the war, he worked for The Sun in Europe, where he covered the Nuremberg trials, and in New York.
        He is survived by a son, Timothy, and a daughter, Tempe.
