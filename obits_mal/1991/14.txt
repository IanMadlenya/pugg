        Sir Alec Rose, who sailed alone around the world in the 1960's, has died, his family said today. He was 82 years old.
        Sir Alec died Friday at Queen Alexander Hospital in Cosham, Hampshire, the family said.
        A grocer, he spent 320 days at sea on his 28,500-mile voyage, accompanied only by a stuffed rabbit named Algy. He received a huge welcome when he returned to Portsmouth on July 4, 1968, aboard his 36-foot ketch Lively Lady.
        When the trip was finished, Sir Alec said he made the trip "because it is something I have always wanted to do since I was a small boy -- the ultimate test of man and ship, to sail round Cape Horn."
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two sons and two daughters by his previous marriage.
