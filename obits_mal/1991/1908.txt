        Thomas M. Timlen, a former vice president and chief administrative officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Timlen was the second-ranking officer at the Federal Reserve of New York from July 1976 until he retired in July 1988. In that role, he served as an alternate voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the major policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System.
        During the early 1980's he directed the reorganization of the bank's computer operations and oversaw a gradual reduction in the bank's staff.
        He graduated from St. Peter's College in Jersey City, and from Harvard Law School.
        Surviving are two sons, Thomas, of Copenhagen, and Daniel, of Washington; a brother, William, of Northport, L.I.; two sisters, Catherine Healey of London, and Josephine Kelly of Milwaukee, and one grandchild.
