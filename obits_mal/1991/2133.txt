        Arthur G. Boardman Jr., a retired president of the Irving Trust Company, died in his sleep early yesterday at his home at Meadow Lakes, a retirement community in Hightstown, N.J. He was 81 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J., until two years ago.
        He died of emphysema, his family said.
        He joined Irving Trust in 1932 and, except for three years' service in the United States Navy in World War II, spent his entire career with the bank. For many years, he worked in its international division, which he headed from 1955 to 1961. He then became an executive vice president and joined the board of directors.
        He was elected president in 1970 and retired in 1975. Irving Trust was merged into the Bank of New York in 1988.
        Mr. Boardman, who was born in New Bedford, Mass., graduated from Dartmouth College and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. He was a past trustee of the Citizens Budget Commission and in the 1960's served for two years as general chairman of the United Hospital Fund.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; a son, James, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Nancy Sparkman of Manchester Center, Vt., and two grandchildren.
