        James C. Hill, a former arbitrator of labor-management disputes in New York, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 76 years old and lived in Fort Myers.
        Mr. Hill died of congestive heart failure, his daughter-in-law, Florence Bramley Hill, said.
        He became a member of the National Academy of Arbitrators in the early 1950's, after working for the New York State Board of Mediation, and was its president in 1969. In the mid-1950's he went into private practice. He retired in the late 1970's.
        Mr. Hill was a member of several Federal commissions appointed to determine minimum wages in Puerto Rico in 1954 to 1956 and in American Samoa in 1959 and 1960.
        He was born in Richmond, and graduated from Swarthmore College in 1935. He studied at the London School of Economics, the University of Chicago and Columbia University, where he received an M.A. in economics.
        Mr. Hill taught economics at Amherst, Sarah Lawrence, Columbia and Cornell and helped to found the Lower Bay School for West Indian children in Bequia in the Grenadines.
        His wife, the former Ruth Mary Lewis, died on Feb. 6.
        He is survived by two sons, both clinical psychologists, Dr. Lewis Hill of Staten Island and Dr. Emory Hill of Seattle; a daughter, Julia Hill of Miranda, Calif.; a brother, Walker, of Lansing, Mich., a retired English professor, and eight grandchildren.
