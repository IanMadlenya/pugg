        Kevin Peter Hall, the 7-foot-2-inch star of the movie and the television series "Harry and the Hendersons," died on Wednesday of pneumonia. He was 35 years old.
        The towering Mr. Hall, a native of Pittsburgh, played the lovable "Bigfoot" character in the 1987 feature film "Harry," as well as the lizardlike alien who stalked Arnold Schwarzenegger in "Predator."
        He also appeared in the television series "Misfits of Science," "Shannon's Deal" and "Room 227."
