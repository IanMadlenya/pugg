        Albert W. Wein, a sculptor known for his heroic Art Deco style, died on Saturday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. He was 75 years old and lived in Ossining, N.Y.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said Joseph Veach Noble, dean emeritus of the Museum of the City of New York.
        As the winner of a 1973 competition, Mr. Wein sculptured the largest granite bas-relief on a structure in the United States: a 75-ton 27-by-30-foot sculpture on the Libby Dam in northwest Montana. The dam, which spans the Kootenai River, is part of a joint project of the United States and Canada, and the relief, which has figures of horses, salmon and an Indian taming a river, symbolizes cooperation between the countries.
        Other Wein works are included in such sites as the Brookgreen Gardens of American Sculpture in Murrells Inlet, S.C., and the Jewish Museum, Gramercy Park Memorial Chapel and Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City. His smaller works and studies have been exhibited at such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. With Various Honors
        He won many honors, among them gold medals from the National Sculpture Society and the National Academy of Design. He was an Academician of the National Academy of Design and a Fellow of the National Sculpture Society.
        He also designed engraved glass for the Steuben division of the Corning Glass Company and designed the Penguin House for the Bronx Zoo.
        He is survived by his wife, Deyna; a son, Jack Yellin of Buffalo; two stepdaughters, Bambi Breakstone of Los Angeles and Gaye Breakstone of New York City, and three grandchildren.
