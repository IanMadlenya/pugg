        Julian H. Handler, an editor and publisher of food-industry newsletters and trade journals, died on Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Handler died of a stroke after heart surgery, a family friend, Morton Stark, said.
        A Brooklyn native, Mr. Handler graduated from Syracuse University, and after serving in the Navy in World War II, he worked for a number of food-industry trade journals.
        In 1972, he founded the Food Industry Newsletter, serving as editor and publisher until he sold it in 1986 to Newsletter Inc., a publisher in Alexandria, Va. Mr. Handler then started Profit Press, a small publishing house.
        He is survived by his second wife, Phyllis; two sons, John and Russell, both of Great Neck, L.I.; a brother, Morton, of Hackensack, N.J., and a sister, Hope Punnett, of Philadelphia.
