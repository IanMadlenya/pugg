        The Rev. Comerford J. O'Malley, who served as teacher, president and chancellor of DePaul University in Chicago in a 47-year career there, died Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Chicago. He was 88 years old and lived in Chicago.
        He died of pneumonia, a university spokeswoman said.
        Father O'Malley was a member of the Congregation of the Mission, the community of Vincentians that founded DePaul. He was ordained to the priesthhood in 1928 and received a degree of doctor of sacred theology in 1929 from the Colegio Angelico in Rome.
        He joined the faculty of DePaul in 1934 as a professor of philosophy, served as dean of the university's College of Commerce from 1936 to 1944, was elected president of the university in 1944 and was named its first chancellor in 1964. He retired in 1981.
        In the 1950's, Father O'Malley improved the university's academic strength, increased enrollments and led a $5.5 million fund-raising drive for a new library, a new research laboratory and an annex to the liberal arts building.
        There are no immediate survivors.
