        Dr. Gerald L. Belcher, professor of history and chairman of the history department of Beaver College in Glenside, Pa., died on Sunday at his home in Wyncote, Pa. He was 50 years old.
        The college gave the cause of death as brain cancer.
        Dr. Belcher, who joined Beaver's faculty in 1973, held a Ph.D. in British history from the University of North Carolina and taught that subject along with courses in modern European and Russian history. He became the department chairman in 1989 and a full professor earlier this year.
        He also developed and taught courses on women's history at Beaver, directed its honors program and received the college's teacher-of-the-year award for 1989-90.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and two sons, Eric and Craig, all of Wyncote; his mother, Josephine DeBie of Battle Creek, Mich.; a brother, Louis, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and a sister, Judy Huston of Suttons Bay, Mich.
