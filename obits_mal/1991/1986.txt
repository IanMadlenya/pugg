        Herbert Schainholz, an inventor and manufacturer of medical instruments, died on Saturday at his home in Teaneck, N.J. He was 66 years old.
        He died of stomach cancer, his family said.
        A native of Hanover, Germany, Mr. Schainholz arrived in the United States with his family in 1941. He served in the United States Army in World War II and earned his bachelor's degree after 10 years of night school at City College.
        He opened his own engineering-consulting business in 1959. At the time of his death, he was president and chief executive officer of the Medin Corporation and American Container Technology Inc., which he founded in 1966 and 1983, respectively, to concentrate on the medical field.
        Based in Wallington, N.J., the companies sell their products to doctors, hospitals and large suppliers of medical and hospital supplies. Among the inventions patented by Mr. Schainholz is a device that counts and memorizes the number of surgical instruments used in an operation to prevent any misplacement of the instruments.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Marianne Wolff Schainholz, and two sons, Jay David and Daniel Curtis.
