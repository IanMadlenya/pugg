        Arnold Hoffmann Jr., a painter, silkscreen artist and a former art director for The New York Times Magazine, died on Saturday at the Bellhaven Nursing Center in Bellport, L.I. He was 75 years old and lived in Springs, L.I.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Jean Kemper Hoffmann.
        Mr. Hoffmann joined The Times as a layout artist in 1942 after working briefly for Dell Publishing. In his 30 years at the paper, he was an art director for the Sunday magazine and other special sections. He retired in 1972.
        Mr. Hoffmann studied at the Art Students League and the National Academy of the Arts. In addition to exhibiting his own paintings at galleries in New York and on Long Island, he founded a silk-screen-print workshop in Springs, where he worked with such artists as James Brooks, Esteban Vicente and Robert Gwathmey and gave public lectures.
        He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Gail, and a son, Eric, both of New York City, and a brother, Arthur, of Washington.
