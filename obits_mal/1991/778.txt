        James B. Moore Jr., a yachtsman who competed on Long Island Sound for more than 60 years, died Saturday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Moore died of complications from cancer and diabetes, his son, Stephen Moore, said yesterday.
        A founding member of the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association, Mr. Moore won his first major regatta in 1930, the Atlantic Coast championship, in a Star Class sailboat. He raced competitively in other one-design sailboats, such as the Atlantic, the Resolute and the Shields, and was national champion in 1947 and 1948 in the Penguin Class. He was president of Moore Textile Fabrics of New York, a draperies business.
        Mr. Moore, a member of the New York Yacht Club and a judge for the United States Yacht Racing Union, is survived by his wife, Constance; two sons, James, of New York, and Stephen, of Port Washington; a brother, Cecil, of San Diego, and three grandchildren.
