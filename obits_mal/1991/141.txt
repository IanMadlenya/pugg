        Jose de Jesus Martinez, poet, playwright, philosopher and mathematician and a former aide to the late Gen. Omar Torrijos Herrera, the Panamanian leader, died on Sunday at his home in Panama. He was 61 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, associates said.
        A native of Nicaragua who became a Panamanian citizen, Mr. Martinez was perhaps best known to Americans as the "Sergeant Chuchu," who was described by Graham Greene in "Getting to Know the General," a work of nonfiction published in 1984.
        Mr. Martinez had volunteered to become a member of the Panamanian National Guard, achieved the position of sergeant and was widely regarded as General Torrijos's closest adviser, accompanying him on many of his international trips. Mr. Martinez was married to a number of women and had many children.
        Mr. Martinez won the National Theater Prize in Madrid in 1952 for his play, "La Perrera." He won Panama's Premio Ricardo Miro in 1969 and in 1971 for playwriting and for his philosophical essays. He also won Cuba's Casa de Las Americas prize for his book, "Mi General Torrijos," published in 1987.
        Mr. Martinez studied at the Catholic University of Chile, the Autonomous University of Mexico and later did doctoral and postdoctoral work in Spain, Germany and France.
