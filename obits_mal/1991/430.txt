        A former member of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Winter was part of an investor group that brought the Brewers baseball franchise to Milwaukee. He also provided money for a sports stadium in Israel and for research center at Mount Sinai Samaritan Medical Center in Milwaukee.
        He is survived by his wife, Muriel; two sons, Jack R. and Michael; a brother, Elmer; six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter, all of Milwaukee.
