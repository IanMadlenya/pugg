        Fred Levy Jr., one of the owners of the National Football League Rams when they moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles in 1946, died Sunday at his home in Palm Springs. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Levy and Dan Reeves bought the Rams in 1941, and Mr. Levy owned part of the team, with Bob Hope another of the owners, until Mr. Reeves bought out his partners in 1962.
        Mr. Levy also at one time owned Riverside International Raceway, which has been closed. Mr. Levy was born in Louisville, Ky., and his family owned the Levy Brothers department store chain in Kentucky.
        He is survived by three stepdaughters, a stepson and five grandchildren.
