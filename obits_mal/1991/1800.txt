        Don A. Lautman, an astronomer who helped track and project the path of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in the pioneering days of space exploration, died Friday at the age of 61.
        Mr. Lautman, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of pancreatic cancer, said the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, with which he was associated.
        Born in Helena, Mont., he graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology. He received a doctorate in astronomy from Princeton University in 1956 and studied how to analyze and predict the movement of artificial satellites.
        The launching of Sputnik the next year transformed theory into reality.  He worked 16 hours every day to help plot the satellite's orbit. At the time, he was working for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge.
        He later taught astronomy at Tufts and Northeastern universities. He also consulted privately in astronomy. At his death he was an associate at the Harvard College Observatory.
        He is survived by his wife, April, their son, Nicholas, and daughter, Samantha, all of Cambridge, and a son and two daughters by a previous marriage, David, of Reading, Pa., Rebekah, of Melbourne, Australia, and Barbara Walton of Washington.
