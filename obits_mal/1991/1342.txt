        Raphael L. Gould, longtime director of the American Library Service, an out-of-print and rare book concern, died on Thursday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 71 years old.
        He died after a series of strokes, his family said.
        Mr. Gould, who was born in Manhattan, was president of the Rockland County chapter of the Ethical Culture Society for several years. He was active in the Fellowship of Reconciliation and served as director of special projects for the American Committee on Africa, which worked to abolish apartheid in South Africa.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor Forte; two daughters, Susan Melaugh of Sharon, Mass., and Heidi Graynor of Englewood, N.J., and 12 grandchildren.
