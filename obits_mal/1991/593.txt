        Rear Adm. States Morris Mead, a retired member of the United States Naval Reserve who combined a naval career with 28 years as an executive of the Chase Manhattan Bank, died on Thursday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 75 years old.
        His family said he died of cancer.
        A native of Evanston, Ill., Admiral Mead graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1937, but because he had to wear glasses, was assigned to the Naval Reserve. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1965, and retired in 1975.
        Called to active service as an ensign in 1941, he became an assistant intelligence officer on the staff of an amphibious-landing training force. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Lieutenant Mead did intelligence work in Latin America. He was transferred to Pearl Harbor in 1942, was attached to the staff of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, and later helped establish naval air-transport throughout the Pacific.  Naval Aviation Museum Founder
        He left active service in 1946 as a commander.
        In 1956, he joined the Chase National Bank as a vice president, helping Chase merge with the Bank of Manhattan. From 1970 until his retirement in 1984, he directed Chase's international management consultant service.
        Admiral Mead was also a founder of the Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Fla.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Doris Conway; three sons, Christopher, of Naperville, Ill., Michael, of Orlando, Fla., and George, of Greenwich; three daughters, Loretto, of Rowayton, Conn., Kathleen, of Greenwich, and Martina Mead Gorey of Larchmont, N.Y.; a sister, Anne Mead Braly of Tampa, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
