        Justus Buchler, distinguished professor emeritus of philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and former chairman of the philosophy department at Columbia University, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Chambersburg, Pa. He was 76 years old and lived in Garden City, L.I.
        He died of a stroke, his sister, Beatrice Gotthold, said.
        Dr. Buchler, who specialized in metaphysics, was the editor, author or co-author of more than a dozen books. Among them were "Toward a General Theory of Human Judgment," "Nature and Judgment," "The Concept of Method," and "Metaphysics of Natural Complexes," all published by Columbia University Press in 1951, 1955, 1961 and 1966, respectively.
        He also wrote "Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in the West," and "Chapters in Western Civilization," both published in two volumes by Columbia University Press in 1946 and 1948, respectively.
        Dr. Buchler, who was born in New York City, earned a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1939. He played a major role in developing the graduate program in philosophy at Stony Brook after joining the faculty in 1971 as a distinguished professor. He retired in 1981.
        Previously he was Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy at Columbia from 1959 to 1971 and chairman of the department from 1964 to 1967. He joined the Columbia faculty in 1937 as a lecturer and from 1938 to 1943 was also an instructor at Brooklyn College.
        While at Columbia, he helped develop the core curriculum and, from 1950 to 1956, he was chairman of the contemporary civilization program.
        He was a member of several professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association, and was an official of the American Civil Liberties Union.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Evelyn Urban Shirk; a daughter, Katherine Tessen of Lititz, Pa., and his sister, who lives in Saddle River, N.J.
