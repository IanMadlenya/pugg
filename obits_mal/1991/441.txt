        Oscar Nitzchke, an architect who designed a number of internationally recognized buildings, including the United Nations headquarters in New York and the Los Angeles Opera House, died Monday at the Hopital Charles Foix in Ivry sur Seine, a suburb of Paris. He was 90 years old and lived in Paris.
        Mr. Nitzchke died of natural causes, a family spokesman said.
        Among the projects in which the Swiss-born architect took part while working with the architectural firm of Harrison & Abromovitz in New York were the Alcoa Building and the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company in Pittsburgh and the Los Angeles Opera House.
        Born in Altona, Germany, he grew up in Switzerland and went to Paris in 1920 to enter the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux Arts, a school of architecture. He left in 1922 to work with the modern architect Le Corbusier. In 1936 he made a set of presentation drawings for a building for a private client, Maison de la Publicite, that failed to reach completion. The drawings, later acquired by the Museum of Modern Art, were recently displayed at the Pompidou Center in Paris.
        Mr. Nitzchke came to New York to work with Harrison & Abromovitz in 1938, where he remained for 15 years. He left to become the head of design for Jim Nash Associates in New York, a position he held from 1958 to 1961. He retired in the early 1970's.
        In 1981 his work was shown at the Paris Exposition at the Pompidou Center; in 1985 at the Institut Francais d'Architecture in Paris, and, most recently, at Cooper Union in 1985.
        He is survived by a daughter, Frederique Nitzschke Groen of Paris, and three granddaughters.
