        Joseph D. Pikus, a longtime professor of health science at Jersey City State College, died on Sunday. He was 75 years old and lived in Cedar Grove, N.J.
        He died of stomach cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Pikus, whose doctorate from Columbia University was in education, joined the college faculty in 1973, retired as a full-time professor of health science in 1986 and then became an adjunct professor of health science and sociology. He was active in that part-time post until last month.
        Dr. Pikus (pronounced PICK-us) grew up in Pine Brook, N.J. He is survived by his wife, Lila, a psychotherapist; two sons, David H. of Short Hills and Dr. Anthony A., a physician, of Marblehead, Mass, and a granddaughter.
