        Fred Capossela, the announcer at New York thoroughbred race tracks for 37 years before his retirement in 1971, died Wednesday night at his home. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Capossela suffered a stroke last Saturday and another stroke on Wednesday, according to a statement issued by the New York Racing Association.
        Cappy, as he was known, was best remembered for his distinctive style in saying the phrase "It is now post time."
        A native New Yorker, he was a racing writer for both The Brooklyn Eagle and The New York Evening Post before calling his first race in 1934. He assumed permanent status as New York's race caller in 1940.
        He is survived by two sons, Fred Jr. and Joseph.
