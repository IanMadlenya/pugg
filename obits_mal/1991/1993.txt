        Lou Stoumen, a photographer and film maker who taught for many years at the University of California in Los Angeles, died in Sebastopol, Calif., on Sept. 13. He was 75 years old.
        He died of cancer, said Barry Singer, a friend and business associate.
        Mr. Stoumen was born in 1916 in Springtown, Pa. He graduated from Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa., in 1939. Before the start of World War II, he worked as a freelance journalist and photographer in New York. During that period, he made many of the photographs of Times Square for which he was best known. A selection of these were collected in the 1985 book "Times Square: 45 Years of Photographs."
        In 1945 Mr. Stoumen settled in California, where he began a career in film making. He received Academy Awards for his documentary productions "The True Story of the Civil War" (1957) and "Black Fox" (1964). From 1966 to 1986 he taught film production at U.C.L.A., where he held the rank of professor.  Toward the end of his life he moved to Sebastopol.
        In addition to his volume of photographs of Times Square, Mr. Stoumen published nine other books of photography and writing, including "Can't Argue With Sunrise: A Paper Movie" (1975) and "Ordinary Miracles" (1981). At the time of his death he was working on an autobiographical book to be called "Ablaze With Light and Life."
        He is survived by three daughters, Mary Lee Baranger, Toby S. Caraya, and Tatiana Stoumen, all of Xalapa, Mexico, near Veracruz.
