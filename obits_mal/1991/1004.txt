        Alexander Kendrick, who in nearly four decades as a newspaperman and television correspondent covered world events, including World War II from the Russian front, and as an author wrote a biography of of his colleague Edward R. Murrow, died Friday at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Kendrick died of a heart attack, said his brother, Vic Kendrick.
        Alexander Kendrick was born in Philadelphia and began his journalism career there with The Public Ledger, which later folded. He switched to The Philadelphia Inquirer, which at the start of World War II sent him to cover the Murmansk Run, where American freighters evaded Nazi U-boats to ferry supplies to the Soviet Union.
        After the war, on a trip to Rome, Mr. Kendrick became friends with Murrow and joined him as a radio and television correspondent at CBS News.
        As a foreign correspondent, Mr. Kendrick reported from scores of cities, including Moscow, Vienna and London, where in 1965 he was succeeded as CBS bureau chief by Dan Rather.
        Mr. Kendrick returned to Washington, where he continued to report and also turned to writing books. In 1969, he wrote a biography of Murrow, "Prime Time: The Life of Edward R. Murrow," and five years later wrote "The Wound Within," an analysis of American policy during the Vietnam War. Both were published by Little, Brown.
        He retired from CBS 15 years ago and returned to Philadelphia.
        Mr. Kendrick's wife, Sarah Kunitz, a Soviet citizen he met while on a sightseeing ferry in Moscow, died in 1981.
        He is survived by his brother and a sister, Julisa K. Simmons.
