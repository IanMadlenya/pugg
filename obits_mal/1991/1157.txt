        Joseph M. Katz, an entrepreneur who donated more than $10 million to the University of Pittsburgh, which named its business school for him, died of cancer on Sturday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 77 years old.
        After starting as a door-to-door stationery salesman, in 1945 he founded Papercraft Corporation, a manufacturer of gift wrapping materials that grew into a nationwide organization of 16 plants. It was sold six years ago and now is known as Amalgamated Investment Corporation.
        A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Katz, with his first wife, Agnes, gave the school more than $10 million in 1987. It was the largest gift in the school's 200-year history.
        He is survived by his second wife, Thelma; a son, Marshall, and a daughter, Andrea McCutcheon, both of Pittsburgh; three grandchildren, a sister and two brothers.
