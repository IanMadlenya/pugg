        Yusuf Idris, one of Egypt's best-known playwrights, whose work often reflected his strong anti-Israeli views, died on Thursday in London of heart failure. He was 64 years old.
        The Egyptian Embassy in London confirmed his death. Mr. Idris had been a patient at the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases.
        Mr. Idris, who was best known for his plays and short stories, was considered by many Arab writers and critics to be the literary equal of Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1988.
        When Mr. Mahfouz was awarded the prize, Mr. Idris protested he should have received it instead. He said he had been rejected by the Swedish Academy because of his anti-Israeli views.
        Mr. Idris, born on May 19, 1927, began his literary career as a journalist and continued writing a newspaper column until his latest illness.
        He wrote 9 plays and 11 collections of short stories, which were translated into 24 languages. His most famous short story collection is "Arkhas Layali," or "Cheapest Nights." His novels included "Al-Haram" ("The Forbidden").
        He is survived by his wife, Ragaa, two sons and a daughter.
