        Harry T. Montgomery, a retired deputy general manager and vice president of The Associated Press, died on Thursday at Greenwich Hospital. He was 81 years old and lived in Greenwich.
        He died of lung cancer, a family member said.
        He was deputy general manager of the news agency from 1962 until his retirement in 1974, a period of major change in the delivery of news and photos to newspapers and broadcasters who were A.P. members. Earlier he was bureau chief in Ottawa, business editor and chief of communications. He was a vice president from 1972 to 1974.
        A native of Flint, Mich., Mr. Montgomery was a reporter for The Detroit Times, The Detroit Free Press and the International News Service before joining The Associated Press in 1937. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1940-41.
        His survivors include his wife, Emily; two sons, Thomas, of San Francisco, and Henry, of Albuquerque, N.M., and two daughters, Beth, of Buffalo, and Emily Ellen, of Albuquerque.
