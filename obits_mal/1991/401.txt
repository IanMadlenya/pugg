        James MacDonald, a sound-effects specialist who provided the falsetto voice of Mickey Mouse for 30 years, died on Friday at his home. He was 84 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Roberta.
        Mr. MacDonald had a collection of 1,000 instruments, including coconut shells and dried peas in a keg, that he used to produce sound effects for animated Walt Disney classics like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Fantasia."
        Mr. MacDonald, who once aspired to be an engineer, was a drummer in a cruise ship band when he met Walt Disney. His ability to create sounds or imitate any he heard led to a career at the Disney studios, which he first visited with his band in 1934 to record a Mickey Mouse sound track.
        His first major film was "Snow White" in 1937. He not only yodeled for the dwarfs but also whistled for the calliope and sneezed as Sneezy.
        By 1946, Disney was too busy with his production duties to record Mickey Mouse's voice, as he had for years. Mr.  MacDonald took over the falsetto voice in the sound track for "Mickey and the Beanstalk" and continued until he retired in 1976.
        Even after retirement, Mr. MacDonald continued to record for Disney. He produced the sound of Evinrude the dragonfly in the "The Rescuers" in 1977.
