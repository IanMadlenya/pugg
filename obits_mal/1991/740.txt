        James Merritt Brownlow, a research scientist who helped to develop memory cores for computers and integrated semi-conductor circuits in 34 years with International Business Machines, died Thursday at his home in Norwich, Vt. He was 70 years old.
        He died of a brain tumor, a spokesman for the family said.
        After receiving a master's degree in ceramics in 1948 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Brownlow worked for the Laboratory for Insulation Research at M. I. T.and for the Glenco Gulton Company in New Jersey before joining I.B.M. in 1953.
        He specialized in crystallography and magnetic research. He had patents and developed processes for manufacturing computer memory cores of ceramic materials.He also developed a high-quality single crystal of complex magnetic oxides.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; four daughters, Beth Brownlow of Concord, Mass., Ann Brownlow of Manhattan, Judith Brownlow of South Royalton, Vt., and Mary B.
