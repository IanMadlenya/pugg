        Dr. Kenneth B. McCredie, a pioneer in the treatment of leukemia, died Saturday at his home. He was 55 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed.
        Dr. McCredie was chief of the leukemia department at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, which he joined in 1968.
        He pioneered in the use of combinations of anticancer drugs and biological agents like interferon in treatment. Because of his research, some forms of adult leukemia can now be cured and most can be controlled for long periods.
        Survivors include his wife, three daughters, a son and four grandchildren.
