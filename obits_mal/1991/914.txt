        Dr. Thomas B. Meade, a Brooklyn periodontist, died on Saturday at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 75 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of the effects of a stroke that had left him partly paralyzed nine years ago, his family said.
        Dr. Meade was born in Montserrat, West Indies, and came to New York as a teen-ager. He was a graduate of St. John's University and received his dental degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
        He served with the New York City Department of Health, maintained a private practice in Brooklyn and taught at the New York Technical College.
        Dr. Meade is survived by a son, Gary, of Brooklyn, and a brother, William Mason Jr., of Mount Vernon, N.Y.
