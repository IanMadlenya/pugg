        Jose Abrantes Fernandez, a former Cuban Interior Minister who was serving a 20-year prison sentence for negligence and misuse of Government funds, died of a heart attack today, the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. He was in his late 50's.
        Mr. Abrantes, who was stripped of his rank of general after his trial in August 1989, was taken to a hospital Monday afternoon from a prison on the outskirts of Havana. Doctors failed to revive him.
        The former Interior Minister was jailed along with six of his aides after a drug-trafficking scandal that stunned Cuba in the summer of 1989.
        He was convicted of abuse of authority, negligence in his duties, and improper use of Government funds.
        The purge of the Interior Ministry followed the execution in July 1989 of an Angola war hero, Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, and three other senior army officers who were accused of involvement in drug trafficking.
