        Milton Kestenberg, a lawyer and real-estate manager who helped win reparations for victims of the Holocaust and who organized aid for children who survived it, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Sands Point, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Kestenberg was the founder and president of Kenyon Associates, a real-estate management firm in Manhattan. The properties he managed included Knickerbocker Village, the Apthorp Building and Astor Court, all in Manhattan.
        He was born in Lodz, Poland. After studying law at the University of Vilna and in Warsaw, he began working as a lawyer in Cracow. He ended up in the United States by chance. On a bet that he could get a visitor's visa, he applied and succeeded. He came to the World's Fair in New York City in 1939, but his return was barred when World War II broke out. He studied at St. John's University in Queens and began his career anew.
        After the war, in which his mother and brother died at Treblinka, he represented survivors in the German courts, seeking restoration of property and reparations. He specialized in helping children, many of them too young to remember the details normally required for legal evidence.
        He was particularly concerned about the psychological impact of the Holocaust. He and his wife, a psychoanalyst who had also left Poland before the war, founded the International Study of Organized Persecution of Children in the Holocaust and traveled worldwide collecting hundreds of interviews. They also created the Association of Children Survivors to help them cope.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Judith Silberpfennig; a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet, of West Chester, Pa., and a sister, Irene Duel of Manhattan.
