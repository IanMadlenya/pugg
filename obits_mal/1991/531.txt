        Ernest Bonnamy, an architect and interior designer, died on Sunday at his home on Shelter Island, L.I. He was 94 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his wife, Laura, said.
        Mr. Bonnamy was associated with the architecture firm of Kahn & Jacobs in Manhattan from 1945 to 1975. Among his accomplishments was the collaborative design of the Capitol Building in Havana; 17 buildings for Saks Fifth Avenue, including the Manhattan store; the lobby of the I.T.T. building in Manhattan's financial district, and the interior of the Plaza Hotel.
        Mr. Bonnamy, a native of Paris, served with the French army in World War I. He studied and later taught art and sculpture at Bonn University in Paris. He came to the United States in the mid-1920's to design the I.T.T. building and became a citizen in 1945.
