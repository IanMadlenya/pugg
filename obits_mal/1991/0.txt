        Frank Maier, the former Midwest bureau chief of Newsweek whose personal account of his liver transplant was the magazine's cover story on Sept. 12, 1988, died at his home yesterday in Arlington Heights, Ill. He was 57 years old.
        He died of kidney failure, his family said.
        After spending four years as a reporter at the Chicago Daily News, Mr. Maier joined Newsweek in 1970 as a reporter in Chicago. The next year he became the bureau chief responsible for the magazine's coverage of 10 Midwestern states.
        He left the magazine in 1988 to write an expanded version of his cover story, "The Miracle of Transplants: A Second Chance of Life." He was a graduate of the University of Notre Dame.
        Surviving are his wife, Ginny Ryan Maier; his mother, Merrie Mitchell Maier of Glen Ellyn, Ill.; two daughters, Katie VanEgeren of Arlington Heights, and Heidi of Chicago; two sons, Michael of Chicago and Daniel of Mount Prospect, Ill.; three sisters, Bunny McCafferty of Elmhurst, Ill., Patricia Miller of Streamwood, Ill., and Susan Schemmel of Glen Ellyn, and two grandsons.
