        Gilbert Price, a baritone who won acclaim for his Broadway debut in "The Roar of the Greasepaint -- the Smell of the Crowd" in 1965, was found dead on Wednesday in an apartment in Vienna. He was 48 years old and had gone there recently to conduct a workshop in singing and acting, friends said.
        Mr. Price had long suffered from diabetes, but it was not known if the illness contributed to his death. The State Department said the cause of death was being investigated by the Vienna Institute of Forensic Medicine.
        The singer was 22 when he ran onto the stage of the Shubert Theater and electrified audiences with a single song, "Feeling Good," in the second act of "Roar of the Greasepaint." He was nominated four times for Tony Awards, for his roles in "Lost in the Stars" (1972), "The Night that Made America Famous" (1975), "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue" (1976) and "Timbuktu" (1978), an adaptation of "Kismet."
        Mr. Price graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn in 1960. After touring in the early 1960's with Harry Belafonte and with the Leonard de Paur Chorus, he became a protege of Langston Hughes, and played a lead role in Hughes's "Jerico-Jim Crow" Off Broadway in 1964.
        He is survived by his father, Leon, of Charlotte, N.C., and a sister, Jeanette Stargill of New York.
        A memorial service is to be held on Feb. 5 at 1:30 P.M. in the Actors' Chapel at St. Malachy's Roman Catholic Church, 239 West 49th Street.
