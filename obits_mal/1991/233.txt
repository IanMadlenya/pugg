        Anthony M. Rey, a retired hotel executive who was president of the Resorts International Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City when legalized gambling began in New Jersey in 1978, died on Wednesday at the Linwood Convalescent Center in Linwood, N.J. He was 74 years old and lived in Ventnor, N.J.
        He died of prostate and bone cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Rey, a native New Yorker, had a long career in the hotel business after attending New York University and graduating from L'Ecole Hoteliere in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1933. He held a variety of posts at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan until 1958, when he became general manager of the Astor, then on Times Square. A Construction Boom
        In 1965 he went to Atlantic City as president of the Chalfonte Haddon Hall, which was renovated and renamed the Resorts International Hotel in 1976. Two years later, on May 27, 1978, the hotel casino opened, the first in the city to offer gambling, touching off a construction boom that within a decade was to make Atlantic City the gambling capital of the East Coast.
        In 1979, Mr. Rey became a vice president of the hotel's parent company, Resorts International Inc. He retired in 1986 as senior vice president.
        From 1965 to 1974, he was vice chairman of the Atlantic County Improvement Authority and from 1975 to 1981 he was chairman of the Atlantic City Convention Bureau.
        In World War II, he served as a Navy Seabee in the Pacific and was awarded the Bronze Star.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothea Carley; a son, Anthony Jr., of Alexandria, Va.; three daughters, Donna Rey, Jamie DiGiovanni and Cynthia Higbee, all of Absecon, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
