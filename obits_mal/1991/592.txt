        Max Truex, who was described by a teammate on the 1960 Olympic team as "this gutsy little runner pounding at you around the track," died Sunday. He was 55 years old.
        Mr. Truex, one of America's top distance runners in the 1950's, had been suffering in recent years from Parkinson's disease, but the official cause of death was not immediately declared, said his wife, Catherine. She said that her husband died at their Milton home.
        Mr. Truex attended high school in Warsaw, Ind., where he had an unquenchable thirst for running, his coach, Fred Olds, recalled recently. Mr. Truex set the national schoolboy mile record of 4 minutes 20.4 seconds.
        In college at the University of Southern California, Mr. Truex won the National Collegiate Athletic Association cross-country championships and set the American 5,000-meter record and the N.C.A.A. two-mile record. In the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, he set an American record in the 10,000 meters, 28:50:2, in finishing sixth in an event long dominated by Europeans.
        His case of Parkinson's disease was diagnosed in 1979, and as his condition deteriorated, Mr. Truex, a real-estate lawyer for Los Angeles County, couldn't be heard by jurors. He tried his last case in 1981 and retired on disability at age 46 a year later.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three children: Gene, 16; John, 14, and Mindy, 11.
