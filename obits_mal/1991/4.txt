        Jose Lampreia, chef and co-owner of La Maison Blanche, a favored meeting spot for French celebrities and epicures, died on Wednesday at his home in Paris. He was 36 years old.
        He died of tuberculosis, said Rene Duran, Mr. Lampreia's partner in the restaurant.
        Mr. Lampreia opened his restaurant on the edge of Paris in 1982. Though he had no gastronomic training, his cooking drew acclaim and earned one star in the Michelin guide. Mr. Lampreia, who grew up in southern Portugal, was noted for his use of southern and Mediterranean ingredients -- garlic, olive oil, fis, ginger, coriander and fish.
        In 1990, Mr. Lampreia closed La Maison Blanche and moved into a new and bigger restaurant, Le 15-Montaigne-Maison Blanche, built on the roof of the Theatre des Champs-Elysees. Mr. Lampreia will be succeeded as chef at the 15-Montaigne by his brother-in-law, Jose Martinez.
        Mr. Lampreia is survived by three brothers, a sister, and his parents.
