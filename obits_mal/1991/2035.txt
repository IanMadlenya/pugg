        G. Louis Joughin, who was a professor, literary critic and author and a leading advocate for civil liberties and academic freedom, died Tuesday at home in Woodlands, Tex. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Joughin died of complications from several strokes, his family said.
        Mr. Joughin (pronounced JOCK-in) took up the fight for civil liberties during the McCarthy era. He joined the staff of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1951, serving as assistant director as well as research director and chief of the academic freedom committee at the headquarters in New York City.
        During much of the campus unrest of the 1960's and early 1970's, he was an associate secretary of the American Association of University Professors in Washington.
        Mr. Joughin taught literature, drama and history at the University of Texas at Austin, the New School for Social Research, Sarah Lawrence College, Columbia University and University of Maryland.
        He reviewed books for The New York Times and other publications on topics that included the socioeconomic problems of Mexican-Americans, India's caste system, literary criticism and drama.
        Mr. Joughin won praise as a co-author, with Edmund Morgan, of "The Legacy of Sacco and Vanzetti" (Harcourt, Brace, 1948). A Times review called the book "a distinguished work" and "a definitive history of the case." He also had books published on academic freedom and tenure.
        He was born in Montreal and earned his undergraduate degree as well as his master's and doctorate at Harvard.
        Survivors include his wife, Jean Templin Joughin, and their daughter, Celia Joughin-Thompson of Rawlins, Wyo., and three children from a previous marriage, Beatrice Garcia of Sylmar, Calif., Lucia Deaville of Pipersville, Pa., and Dr. William Joughin of New Haven and Hartford.
