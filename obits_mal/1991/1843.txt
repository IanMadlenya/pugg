        Dr. Hiao-Tsiun Ma, a musicologist, conductor and teacher who founded the Children's Orchestra in New York and who was the father of the cellist Yo-Yo Ma, died on Aug. 28 at Long Beach Hospital on Long Island. He was 80 years old.
        He died of a stroke, said his daughter, Dr. Yeou-Cheng Ma.
        Dr. Ma was born in Ningpo, China, on July 11, 1911, and studied at the National Central University in Nanking. He later joined the faculty of the school. In 1936 he moved to France and earned a doctorate in musicology at the Sorbonne, with Chinese music as his specialty. He also studied violin and composition at the Paris Conservatoire and the Ecole Cesar Franck, and he performed professionally as a violinist. Moved to New York
        Dr. Ma moved to New York in 1961. A year later he founded the Children's Orchestra Society. He conducted the orchestra and taught its young players until his retirement in 1977. In 1984, the orchestra was revived by his daughter and her husband, Michael Dadap, who now conducts it.
        In 1977, Dr. Ma moved to Taiwan, where he taught at the Chinese Cultural University of Yangming Shan, and continued conducting. His musical compositions include "Suzy," an operetta; a string quartet, and children's works. He also published two method books, "First Steps of Violin Playing" and "First Steps of Cello Playing," in 1976.
        In addition to his son, of Winchester, Mass., and his daughter, of Fresh Meadows, L.I., he is survived by his wife, Marina, and four grandchildren.
