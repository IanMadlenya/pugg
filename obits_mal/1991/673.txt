        Ian McLellan Hunter, a screen and television writer who won an Academy Award for the 1953 film "Roman Holiday," died on Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He apparently had a heart attack while seeing a doctor at the hospital, his wife, Alice, said.
        Among his film credits were "A Woman of Distinction," "Second Chorus" and "Mr. District Attorney." His work for television included "The Blue and the Gray," Thomas Wolfe's "You Can't Go Home Again," and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," for which he received an Edgar, the annual mystery award. He also wrote episodes for several television series, including "The Defenders" and "The Adams Chronicles."
        In 1964, he collaborated with Ring Lardner Jr. on the Broadway musical "Foxy," starring Bert Lahr and Larry Blyden. Mr. Hunter and Mr. Lardner were blacklisted in Hollywood during the McCarthy era, and they used pseudonyms while creating television series, including "The Adventures of Robin Hood."
        Mr. Hunter taught in the dramatic-writing program at New York University for 20 years. For the last two summers, he was a screenwriting adviser at the Sundance Institute in Utah. He was a longtime member of the council of the Writers Guild of America, East.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Tim, a film director; his sister, Aileen Hamilton, and four grandchildren, all of Los Angeles.
