        Max Janowski, a composer of Jewish liturgical music, died on Monday at his home in Hyde Park, Ill. He was 79 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said Howard Helsinger, the president of K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Congregation of Hyde Park, where Mr. Janowski had served as music director since 1938.
        Mr. Janowski wrote choral works used in synagogues around the world. Among his best-known compositions are "Avinu Malkeynu" ("Our Father, Our King"), a hymn used during the High Holy Days, and "Sim Shalom" ("Song of Peace"), which was dedicated to the American diplomat Ralph Bunche.
        Mr. Janowski was born in Berlin in 1912. After training as a pianist and organist, he became head of the piano department at the Mosashino Academy in Tokyo in the early 1930's. He emigrated to the United States in 1937, and served in the Navy during World War II.
        Mr. Janowski was also a conductor, choir director and voice teacher. The baritone Sherrill Milnes and the mezzo-soprano Isola Jones were among the singers who studied with him.
        He is survived by his mother, Miriam, of Tel Aviv.
