        He was born in Keosaugua, Iowa, and held degrees from the University of Iowa, the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin. He taught at Louisiana State University from 1929 to 1948.
        Dr. Cox is survived by two sons, Robert, of Baltimore and Edward, of Richmond, and two daughters, Phyllis Rigdon of Claremont and Susan Reilly of Irvington.
