        William L. Dunfey, a hotelier who was long one of the leading figures in Democratic politics in New Hampshire, died this morning at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital here. He was 65 years old and lived in Rye Beach, N.H., a coastal community near Portsmouth.
        Mr. Dunfey had recently confirmed he had cancer.
        A native of Lowell, Mass., and a graduate of the University of New Hampshire, he was a founder of Dunfey Hotels, a family business that branched out of New England and grew into an international hotel chain beginning in the 1960's.
        But he was just as widely known in New Hampshire for his participation in state and national Democratic politics. He was New England regional coordinator for John F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign in 1960, a member of the Democratic National Committee in the early 1960's, Northeastern regional manager of President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 campaign, chairman of the Democratic State Committee from 1965 to 1968 and northern New England coordinator for the Presidential bid of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.
        Mr. Dunfey also had a sustained interest in news gathering. He was a founder and director of The Spectator, a monthly liberal journal of political opinion and news about New Hampshire, and was a director of The New Hampshire Times, an alternative weekly newspaper that has shut down. He was a trustee of several organizations, including the University System of New Hampshire, the Dartmouth Medical School and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a daughter, Julie Daniell; a granddaughter, Hayley; eight brothers and sisters and many nieces and nephews.
