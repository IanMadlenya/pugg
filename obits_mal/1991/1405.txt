        Moe C. Spahn, a former camp director and private-school headmaster who was an all-America basketball player in the 1930's, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his son said.
        Dr. Spahn, who earned a Ph.D. in education from New York University, was headmaster of the Franklin School in Manhattan from 1950 to 1975. He was with the school, now known as the Anglo-American International School, for more than 50 years, serving as a teacher before he became headmaster and later on the board of directors.
        He was director of Camp Winaukee in New Hampshire from 1938 to 1975 and director of the Tripp Lake Camp in Maine from 1958 to 1982. He was a past president of the Association of Private Camps.
        A 1934 graduate of the City College of New York, Dr. Spahn was a player on championship basketball teams there and was voted an all-American in 1932. He also coached basketball teams at City College and at West Point.
        He is survived by his son, Stephen, of Manhattan, who is headmaster of the Dwight School; a daughter, Jayme Stewart of North Salem, N.Y., the director of college placement at the York Preparatory School; a brother, Milton, of the Bronx, and five grandchildren.
