        Prof. Roy C. Macridis, a retired political scientist at Brandeis University, died on Dec. 20 at New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. He was 72 years old and lived in Belmont, Mass.
        He died of cancer, an announcement from Brandeis said.
        A former head of the politics department, the Social Science Council and the Faculty Senate, he retired two years ago as Lawrence Wien Professor of International Cooperation. He joined the Brandeis faculty in 1965 after teaching government and political science courses at other universities, including Harvard and Columbia, starting in the late 1940's.
        Professor Macridis was a native of Istanbul, Turkey, and a graduate of Athens College in Greece and the University of Paris Law School, with a Ph.D. from Harvard. He worked for the Office of Strategic Services in World War II and came to this country in 1944.
        He wrote nine books and numerous articles on French politics, comparative politics and public policy. His "Contemporary Political Ideologies" (Little, Brown, 1983) will go to its fifth edition next year.
        Professor Macridis is survived by his wife, the former Jacklyn Williams; his daughter, Kathleen Macridis-Ennis of Newton, Mass.; his son, Steven, of Barnstable, Mass., and five grandchildren.
