        Selden J. Hannah, a former intercollegiate and seniors ski champion who became one of the nation's most prolific ski-area architects, died on Aug. 31 at his home in Franconia, N.H.
        He was 77 years old, and his family said he died in his sleep.
        A 1935 graduate of Dartmouth, where he was captain of the varsity ski team, Mr. Hannah, who was known as Sel, was virtually unbeatable in Alpine events both in college and for years afterward. He won the slalom and the Alpine combined titles at the first national seniors competition in 1953 and is enshrined in the Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.
        A founder of the Sno-engineering company, Mr. Hannah served as its president and chief trail designer until 1970, working on more than 250 ski areas in the United States and Canada.
        In addition to his wife, Pauline, Mr. Hannah is survived by a brother, Paul, of Weston, Mass.; a daughter, Joan, a member of the 1960 and 1964 Olympic ski teams who is now an instructor in Vail, Colo.; two sons, Frank, of Andover, Mass., and Selden, of Rochester, N.H., and eight grandchildren.
