        Robert Kaufman, a television and screen comedy writer whose credits included the films "Divorce American Style" and "Love at First Bite," died on Thursday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 60 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his wife, Robin Krause.
        Mr. Kaufman won both an Emmy and a Peabody Award for his scripts for Bob Newhart's original variety show, which made its television debut in 1961. He wrote episodes for many other television series, including "McHale's Navy," "I Dream of Jeannie" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents," and created 54 television pilot shows.
        In addition to "Love at First Bite," which he also produced, and "Divorce American Style," for which he received a 1967 Academy Award nomination, he also wrote the screenplays for "Getting Straight," "How to Beat the High Cost of Living," "I Love My Wife" and "Freebie and the Bean," among others. His most recent film was "She's Out of Control" (1989), which he also produced.
        He is survived by his wife; two daughters, Melissa and Robin, and two sons, Richard and Christopher, all of the Los Angeles area.
