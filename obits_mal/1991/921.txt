        Charles Fleschner, a demolition contractor who helped dismantle buildings at the 1939 World's Fair, died on Wednesday at his home in Hollywood, Fla. He was 90 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his daughter Bette Lerner of Metuchen, N.J.
        Mr. Fleschner, working for the Albert A. Volk Housewrecking Company, helped demolish buildings at the site of the 1939 World's Fair, which was held in Flushing, Queens. He then formed his own company, Charles Fleschner & Company Housewreckers, and was president of the Housewrecking Contractors Association. He retired in 1953.
        He is survived by his wife, Lottie; another daughter, Marilyn Robbins, also of Metuchen, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
