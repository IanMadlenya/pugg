        Harold Goldsmith, co-founder of Merry-Go-Round Enterprises, operator of a nationwide chain of apparel stores, died in an airplane crash Wednesday in Aspen, Colo. He was 48 years old and lived in Aspen.
        Mr. Goldsmith was one of three people, including the pilot, who were killed when the chartered Learjet plunged into a mesa a half-mile short of the runway as it was approaching Aspen Airport on a flight from Las Vegas, Nev.
        Mr. Goldsmith and Leonard Weinglass, boyhood friends, founded Merry-Go-Round in 1970. The company, with headquarters in Joppa, Md., developed a reputation for spotting fashion trends in men's and women's clothing before other retailers. The chain operates more than 600 stores and sold $478 million worth of clothing in the year ended last February.
