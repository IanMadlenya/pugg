        Irving Sloan, a retired supermarket executive and a philanthropist with a special concern for the handicapped, died on Monday at Beth Israel North hospital in Manhattan. He was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Beginning in the 1930's, Mr. Sloan, with his brother Joseph, operated half a dozen grocery stores, under the franchise name Associated, in Manhattan and the Bronx. A brother, Max Sloan, was a co-founder of the Sloan's chain, which grew to 40 stores.
        Mr. Sloan, whose two sons were disabled by cerebral palsy, was a founder of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City Inc. in 1946 and was on its board.
        In addition, he contributed to and was president of the board of the Southbury Training School Foundation, a volunteer group affiliated with the school, which is for the disabled and is in Southbury, Conn.
        Mr. Sloan and his wife, Hilda, also helped pay for six fitness centers for the handicapped, one in each of New York City's five boroughs and one at Southbury Training School.
        Mr. Sloan had undergraduate and law degrees from New York University.
        Besides his sons, Bruce and Alan Sloan, from his first marriage, to Frances, who died in 1984, his survivors include his wife, Hilda, whom he married in 1985; a stepdaughter, Barbara Peterman; a step-granddaughter; and a sister, Hilda Levine.
