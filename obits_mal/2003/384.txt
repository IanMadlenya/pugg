        Karl Genus, a prolific and versatile early director of television programs, mainly on cultural subjects, died on May 29 at his home in Asheville, N.C. He was 84.
        Mr. Genus (pronounced JEN-us) worked for almost a decade for CBS, beginning in 1954. Among the hundreds of shows he directed, which included soap operas and dramas for ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90,'' a 1959 ''CBS Show of the Month'' drama titled ''I, Don Quixote,'' stood out. Starring Lee J. Cobb, Eli Wallach and Colleen Dewhurst, it was seen nationwide and led to the 1965 Broadway musical ''Man of La Mancha'' (currently in revival).
        Mr. Genus received several Emmy nominations. In the early 1960's he was the principal Eastern director when the Eastern and Western film and television directors merged into the Directors Guild of America. He was a guild vice president for 26 years.
        Genus Carl Benson was born in Bridgeport, Conn. He took the stage name Karl Genus while studying at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, and in 1951 he founded the Totem Pole Playhouse in Fayetteville, Pa.
        He spent 16 years as a stage director before joining CBS Television in New York. He worked in television and film for nearly five decades and was writing a film script at his death.
        Mr. Benson's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his companion, Beverly Jones; his former wife, Muriel, of New City, N.Y.; a daughter, Tiane, known as T. C., of Washington; a son, Terry, a stage manager in Manhattan; and two grandchildren.
