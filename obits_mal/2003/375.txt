        Frank P. Smeal, a municipal bond expert who became a principal adviser during the New York City fiscal crisis of the 1970's, died on April 8 at his home in Rumson, N.J. He was 84.
        Mr. Smeal worked on Wall Street for 38 years. The bulk of his career -- 30 years -- was spent at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, where he rose to executive vice president and treasurer. He retired in 1985 as a partner and managing director of the fixed-income division at Goldman, Sachs & Company.
        From 1985 to 1988, he served as chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan New York civic group founded in 1923.
        Mr. Smeal had been among the first to warn Mayor Abraham Beame that the city's borrowing practices would lead to disaster.
        He is survived by a daughter, Dr. Mary Margaret Smeal; a son, Henry F.; two sisters and two grandchildren.
