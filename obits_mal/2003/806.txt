        Bruce Alexander Cook, a writer of crime fiction and nonfiction, died on Nov. 9 in Los Angeles. He was 71.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter Catherine.
        The best known of his crime novels, written under the name Bruce Alexander, was a series about Sir John Fielding, the founder of London's first police force. His nonfiction books ranged from a biography of Dalton Trumbo, the blacklisted American screenwriter, to a book about the blues. His first book, ''The Beat Generation,'' was published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1971.
        Mr. Cook was born in Chicago in 1932. He attended Loyola University, and after several years in public relations, began to write. In 1967 he moved to Washington to join the staff of The National Observer, for which he covered popular culture including movies, books and music.
        After The National Observer closed, Mr. Cook was a book review editor at USA Today and The Detroit News. He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he did the same work for The Los Angeles Daily News.
        Mr. Cook's last book, ''The Price of Murder,'' published last month, is another in the John Fielding series.
        In addition to his daughter Catherine, Mr. Cook is survived by his second wife, Judith Aller; a son, Robert Neal Cook; and another daughter, Cecilia Laiche.
