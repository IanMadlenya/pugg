        Salvatore Pepe, a major developer of commercial real estate in Westchester County, died on Sunday at a hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 93 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
        Mr. Pepe was the president of Bianco & Pepe Inc., based in Scarsdale, N.Y., which he founded decades ago in a partnership with his father-in-law.
        It began as a construction company and evolved into a construction, development and real estate management company. It built the Vernon Hills shopping center in Eastchester, N.Y.
        Bianco & Pepe is the parent company for the family's real-estate activities. The Pepe assets include office buildings, shopping centers and other retail and industrial sites.
        The Pepe family's holdings include Westchester One, a building that is one of the main commercial structures in White Plains. Built in the 1970's by Mr. Pepe and his son Nicholas, who has succeeded his father as president of the company, the building has 850,000 square feet of office space.
        Salvatore Pepe began in the construction business in 1931 in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He had been a construction worker, was laid off during the Depression and founded Bianco & Pepe. The company built a number of industrial structures in Connecticut and lower Westchester County.
        A native of New York City, he lived with his family in the Bronx, Mount Vernon and Los Angeles and returned to the New York City area in the late 1920's.
        In addition to his son, his survivors include his wife, Catherine Bianco Pepe; two other sons, Eugene and William; 10 grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.
