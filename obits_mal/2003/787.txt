        Milton S. Shapiro, a lawyer who was active in many organizations in support of Israel, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Philip.
        Mr. Shapiro was the chairman of the American Zionist Fund from 1982 to 1985, and president of the Zionist Organization of America from 1986 to 1989. From 1993 to 1997, he was the national president of the Jewish National Fund and helped more than a million Soviet Jews settle in Israel, the fund said.
        He was a former partner in the law firm of Graubard Miller. Recently, he had been counsel to the firm.
        Milton S. Shapiro was born on May 9, 1922, in Manhattan, the son of Philip, a tailor from Lviv, Ukraine, and Lena, from Galicia. His mother later worked in real estate, first collecting rents and managing rooming houses, then buying properties. Milton, her only son and the middle child of five, began advising her on transactions when he was 10.
        He graduated from Abraham Lincoln High School and Brooklyn College, served three years in the military and received his law degree from New York University Law School in 1948. He was admitted to the United States Supreme Court bar in 1961.
        After law school, he worked for the firm of Bernheimer & Zucker, becoming a partner, and then for Shapiro, Mortman & Schwartz, which eventually merged with Graubard Miller.
        He had homes in New York City and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Leibowitz; a daughter, Susan Levkoff; and four grandchildren.
