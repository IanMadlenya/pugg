        Ricardo Cané, a singer and percussionist in the Afro-Cuban group Los Muñequitos de Matanzas, died on June 5 in a hospital in Matanzas, Cuba, where he lived. He was 54.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Caridad Diez, the group's manager.
        Los Muñequitos was formed in 1952 and has become one of Cuba's most revered traditional groups, using just percussion, vocals and dancing to bring out the African roots of the Cuban rumba. The group, based in Matanzas, a center for African culture in Cuba, was originally called Guaguancó Matancero, and became known by its current name after one of its first recordings, ''Los Muñequitos,'' which was about characters in newspaper comic strips.
        Baldomero Ricardo Cané Gómez was born in Matanzas in 1949 and played in various folk groups during the 1960's and 70's, including the Grupo Afrocuba de Matanzas, which he directed. In 1976 he was invited to join Los Muñequitos by Gregorio Díaz, known as Goyo, one of the founding members.
        Los Muñequitos made the first of many United States tours in 1992, and was featured on the album ''La Rumba Soy Yo,'' released on the Cuban label Bis. The recording won a Latin Grammy Award in 2001 for best folkloric album.
