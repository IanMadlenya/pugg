        Richard B. Sewall, a longtime English professor at Yale University whose influential biography of Emily Dickinson dispelled many myths about the reclusive poet, died in Newton, Mass., on Wednesday at the home of his son Richard. He was 95.
        In ''The Life of Emily Dickinson,'' published in 1974, Mr. Sewall challenged the received wisdom about Dickinson. Unconvinced by the conventional telling of her life, which portrayed her as a lovelorn woman too fragile for the world, Mr. Sewell visited her hometown of Amherst, Mass., countless times and emerged with a complex portrait of Dickinson that earned him the National Book Award for biography.
        The book, published late in Mr. Sewall's academic career, was the capstone of more than 40 years at Yale, where his lectures on English literature were among the most popular with undergraduates.
        Descended from a line of Congregational ministers dating back to the Salem of the witch trial era, Mr. Sewall was known for infusing his lectures with an almost religious fervor. Focused more on teaching than scholarship, he published only two books in his long academic career.
        He also served as an administrator at the university, using his rapport with young people to defuse many volatile clashes between student radicals and university officials in the upheavals of the 1960's, Richard Sewall said.
        Yale named a teaching award after him that is given to an outstanding professor each year. Mr. Sewall, who retired from Yale in 1976, continued to receive letters from students he had taught half a century ago, right up until his death, his son said.
        In addition to his son Richard, Mr. Sewell is survived by two other sons, Stephen, of Glenview, Ill., and David, of Woodbury, Conn.; and six grandchildren.
