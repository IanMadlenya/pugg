        Burton Feldman, a historian who chronicled and appraised the Nobel Prizes, died on Jan. 10 in Denver. He was 76 and lived in Denver.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Peggy.
        A recently retired professor of English at the University of Denver, he won critical praise for his book ''The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige'' (Arcade, 2000), which mixed applause and criticism of the awards. Professor Feldman called them ''a desperately needed symbol of authority and coherence in an age when all standards are under attack.''
        But he also said that Sully Prudhomme, a French poet, critic and philosophical writer who won the prize for literature in 1901, was ''as forgettable a poet as can be found in the Nobel's long list of mediocrities.''
        In a review in Commentary, Jonathan Marks, a political scientist, said Professor Feldman ably demonstrated that ''considerations other than mere excellence have long played a role in the bestowal of the world's most-sought-after laurel.''
        Professor Feldman was born in Albany and received a bachelor's degree from Union College, a master's from Columbia and a doctorate from the University of Chicago.
        He was a lecturer at Chicago before joining the Denver faculty in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife; a brother, Albert, of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; and a sister, Eleanor Werlin of Laguna Hills, Calif.
