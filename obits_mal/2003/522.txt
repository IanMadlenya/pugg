        James Jerome Dwyer, legal guardian for the pension funds of an army of past and present New York City employees, died last Thursday at his home in Stuyvesant Town. He was 54.
        The cause was esophageal cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Dwyer, a career civil servant, was the chief of the Pensions Division in city's Law Department, also known as the Office of the Corporation Counsel. He was named to the post in 1986.
        Mr. Dwyer, known as Jerry, stood watch over five retirement systems covering more than half a million city employees, pensioners and sundry other beneficiaries. His office counseled and went to court for the City Employees Retirement System, the Police and Fire Department Pension Funds and the Teachers' and Board of Education Retirement Systems.
        He was the chief interpreter of laws coming into play governing matters like taxation and domestic relations. He and his legal team analyzed proposed legislation and drafted legal opinions for the funds, attended their board meetings and spoke for them in litigation.
        James J. Dwyer was born in Manhattan and graduated from Fordham. He first joined the Law Department as an attorney trainee in its Family Court Division in 1974, the year he received his law degree at Fordham.
        He is survived by his wife, Christine Ball Dwyer; a son, Kevin; a daughter, Kristin; and his parents, Mary and James J. Dwyer, all of Manhattan; and two sisters, Mary Agnes Del Tuffo of Sugarland, Tex., and Dr. Regina Dwyer of Seattle.
