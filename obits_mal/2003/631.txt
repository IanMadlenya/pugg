        Dr. Jose Barchilon, a psychoanalyst and educator who studied the unconscious roots of creativity and mental illness, died on Aug. 6 at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 90.
        In addition to training and teaching in New York and Denver, Dr. Barchilon wrote extensively, including early studies of psychosomatic illness and psychoanalytic studies of novels by Jane Austen, Albert Camus, Mark Twain and others.
        He also trained a generation of psychiatrists and psychoanalysts as director of residency training at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and as a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Medical School. In 1981, he returned to New York, where he resumed his private practice and worked as an attending psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Westchester Division.
        Dr. Barchilon, who was born in French Morocco, is survived by his wife, Sally Barchilon; their children, Andrew and Josette; and three children -- Dr. John Barchilon, Coco Van Meerendonk and Jacqueline Barchilon -- from his first marriage, to the painter Raquel Barchilon.
