        Meyer Steinberg, a philanthropist and real estate developer with interests in a number of shopping centers in the Midwest and Southwest, died on Thursday in New York City. He was 84 and had homes in Manhattan and Hewlett, N.Y., and in Palm Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Steinberg died at Mount Sinai Hospital of complications related to lung cancer, said his daughter Susan Zises Green.
        Mr. Steinberg, who was widely known as Mike, was chairman and co-founder of Enterprise Asset Management, which has major real state holdings in New York and California. He was also a major investor in a predecessor company of the Reliance Insurance Company, a Philadelphia insurer that was shut down by state regulators in 2001 and was long run by Mr. Steinberg's nephew, the financier Saul Steinberg.
        Mr. Steinberg, the son of Russian immigrants, was born and raised in Brooklyn. While attending high school at night, he started working at 15 when he and his older brother formed a business that made rubber doormats from used tires. He went on to form a tire manufacturing company that exported tires to Italy during World War II. He later bought the rubber factory subsidiary of Ideal Toys. By the 1960's, Mr. Steinberg formed Enterprise Asset Management with Robert G. James.
        Mr. Steinberg was very supportive of community and philanthropic groups, having served as a major fund-raiser and chairman of the South Shore Long Island division of the UJA-Federation of New York and a major donor to the S.L.E. Foundation for Lupus Research.
        Besides Ms. Green, of Manhattan, Mr. Steinberg is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, Jean, and three other daughters: Bonnie S. Englebardt and Lois Robbins Zaro, both of Manhattan, and Carol S. Weisman, of Los Angeles.
