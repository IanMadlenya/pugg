        Rabbi Robert L. Lehman, a prominent Reform rabbi and a refugee from Nazism who eventually returned to a pulpit in Vienna, died on June 13 at a hospital in Nassau County. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a brain hemorrhage, his family said.
        Rabbi Lehman retired in 1997 after 41 years at the Hebrew Tabernacle Congregation in Washington Heights. He later served as interim rabbi at Or Chadash, a Reform congregation in Vienna, and Temple Israel in Lawrence, N.Y., in Nassau County.
        Born in Germany, he came to this country in 1938. He was a 1949 philosophy graduate of Long Island University and was ordained at Hebrew Union College in 1954. He received a doctorate in ministry at New York Theological Seminary in 1985.
        Rabbi Lehman was a former president of the New York Association of Reform Rabbis and the American Federation of Jews from Central Europe. He served on national committees of the Central Conference of American Rabbis and on the executive committee of the World Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.
        Rabbi Lehman is survived by his wife of 45 years, Loni Tucker Lehman, and a daughter, Sharon Lehman of the Bronx.
