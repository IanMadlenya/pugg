        Gil Nickel, a onetime guided-missile expert from Oklahoma who became a prominent wine producer in the Napa Valley, died on Thursday at his home in Oakville, Calif. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Armed with little more than an amateur's enthusiasm for wine, Mr. Nickel arrived in California in the mid-1970's, studied oenology at the University of California at Davis and, in the early 1980's, reopened the long-abandoned Far Niente winery in Oakville, in the center of the Napa Valley.
        In 1992, he opened a second winery, Dolce, where he produced a single late-harvest white wine, called Dolce, in the style of the sweet white wines of Bordeaux like Ch√¢teau d'Yquem.
        In 2000, he released the first wines from yet another venture, Nickel & Nickel, which is devoted to producing only single-vineyard wines. Eventually, Nickel & Nickel plans to make as many as 25 wines from specific sites in its vineyards and from other properties.
        Last year, Nickel & Nickel opened a new winery, centered on a restored farmhouse from 1880.
        Harold Gilliland Nickel was born in 1939 in Muskogee, Okla. He graduated from Oklahoma State University in 1961. After military service in Vietnam, he worked as an analyst at a Navy laboratory in Corona, Calif., then joined the family business, Greenleaf Nursery, a wholesale plant nursery in Oklahoma. He left that business and returned to California in 1976 to pursue a career in wine.
        In his spare time, he collected and raced antique cars in the United States and Europe and traveled widely, often on a motorcycle with his wife, Beth, as a passenger.
        In addition to his wife, survivors include a son, Jeremy, who is the other Nickel in Nickel & Nickel.
