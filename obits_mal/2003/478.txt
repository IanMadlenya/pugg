        Eliot Wald, a comedy writer for television and films, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 57 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his wife, Jane Shay Wald.
        Mr. Wald, whose earlier career included a stint as a television critic and as a rock-music writer for Chicago newspapers, moved on to write for the comedy group Second City and for ''Saturday Night Live.'' With a ''Saturday Night Live'' colleague, Mr. Wald wrote scripts for the films ''Hear No Evil, See No Evil'' and ''Camp Nowhere.''
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, Donald, of Stone Ridge, N.Y.
