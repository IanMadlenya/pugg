        Gavin Lyall, a prolific and popular British writer of thrillers, died on Monday in London. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Katharine Whitehorn, a British writer and journalist.
        Starting his career when many British thriller writers had specialties -- spycraft for John le Carr√©, horses for Dick Francis -- Mr. Lyall drew on his experience as a Royal Air Force pilot to write adventure stories that usually involved dangerous flying missions in exotic places by cynical young men of dubious morals.
        His first novel, ''The Wrong Side of the Sky'' (1961), was a big success. It was followed by ''The Most Dangerous Game'' and ''Midnight Plus One,'' which the novelist Brigid Brophy said ''very nearly fulfills its deeper purpose of being morally exciting.'' Other tales from this period include ''Shooting Script'' and ''Judas Country.''
        In 1980 a new and very different Lyall hero appeared, Maj. Harry Maxim, a British special forces officer, working on secret assignments for the prime minister's office at 10 Downing Street.
        ''The Secret Servant'' (1980), ''The Conduct of Major Maxim'' (1982), ''The Crocus List'' (1985) and ''Uncle Target'' (1988) all displayed expert knowledge of espionage and government's inner workings.
        In 1993, after the end of the cold war, Mr. Lyall turned his attention to the very early days of the British secret service, before World War I, producing ''Spy's Honour'' (1993) and ''Honorable Intentions'' (1999).
        Gavin Tudor Lyall was born in Birmingham, England, on May 9, 1932. He served in the Royal Air Force before attending Cambridge University and pursuing journalism at Picture Post, the BBC and The Sunday Times.
        He is survived by his wife, Katharine; their two sons, Bernard, of London, and Jake, of Fairfax, Calif.; and two grandchildren.
