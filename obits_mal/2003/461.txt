        Henry Thomas Lipman, the second director of the Institute for Retired Professionals at what was then the New School for Social Research, died on June 22 at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. He was 87 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        Professor Lipman spent 20 years at New York University, where he rose to associate dean and professor of adult education at the School of Continuing Education. Retiring from N.Y.U. in 1979, he was then director of the Institute for Retired Professionals until 1989. The institute, founded in 1962, allows retired professionals to share knowledge gathered in their careers.
        For the next six years, Professor Lipman was a director of Elderhostel, an educational travel organization. There and at the New School institute, he helped organize more than 200 back-to-school programs for retired people.
        Born in Boston, Henry Lipman worked his way through an extension program at Harvard to earn a degree in economics in 1937. He received a master's in economics at American University in 1938 and earned five battle stars as an Army first lieutenant in North Africa and Italy during World War II.
        He started at N.Y.U. as an instructor in adult education and advanced to direct its off-campus liberal arts program. Beginning in the mid-1960's, he directed the university's Office of Community Service, where he oversaw government-supported training programs for paraprofessionals in education and social work.
        He developed similar programs for N.Y.U. and the United States Agency for International Development at the University of Lagos, in Nigeria, in the late 1960's. He was dean for administration when N.Y.U. formed its Division of Academic Development and Community Services in 1977 and appointed him director.
        Professor Lipman is survived by a son, Timothy, of Chevy Chase, Md.; a daughter, Ruth Simon of Bethesda, Md.; a brother, Maurice, of Brookline, Mass.; and five grandchildren.
