        Claude Martel, a senior art director of The New York Times Magazine, died on Thursday in Ottawa. He was 34 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was plasmablastic multiple myeloma, a cancer of the blood, said Janet Froelich, the magazine's art director.
        Mr. Martel was a skilled typographer with an eye for the expressive nuances of type. He focused on style and fashion during his five years at the magazine, and designed issues devoted to special themes.
        Mr. Martel grew up in Aylmer, Quebec. He studied graphic design at the Algonquin College in Ottawa before moving on and graduating from the Ontario College of Art in Toronto. After his schooling, he started a design studio in Toronto with Susan McCallum called McCallum Martel. They helped redesign of C Magazine, devoted to contemporary Canadian art.
        Mr. Martel is survived by his parents, Lionel Martel and Hélène Chartrand, of Aylmer, Quebec; a sister, Julie Martel, also of Aylmer; and his partner, Kurt Miller.
