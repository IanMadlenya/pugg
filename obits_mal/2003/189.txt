        Dr. William W. L. Glenn, a cardiac surgeon who developed a procedure for treating congenital heart disease and helped to create an early model of an artificial heart, died on March 10 in Peterborough, N. H. He was 88.
        The chief of cardiovascular surgery at Yale University from 1948 to 1975, Dr. Glenn created what became known as the Glenn shunt, an operation used to bypass malformed right chambers of the heart.
        He developed the technique in 1954 to treat ''blue babies,'' infants whose heart defects decrease the flow of blood to their lungs; the resulting lack of oxygen in their blood gives the babies a blue appearance.
        Dr. Glenn developed his innovative approach to medicine as a field surgeon in the Army Medical Corps in World War II. His resourcefulness was apparent when he and Dr. William H. Sewell invented their artificial heart in the early 1950's using pieces from a child's Erector set. The device is now at the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution.
        Dr. Glenn introduced improvements to pacemakers and wrote one of the standard texts for vascular surgeons, ''Glenn's Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery'' (McGraw-Hill Professional), now in its sixth edition. He was president of the American Heart Association from 1979 to 1981.
        William Wallace Lumpkin Glenn was born on Aug. 12, 1914, in Asheville, N.C. He received a bachelor's of science degree from the University of South Carolina in 1934 and a medical degree from the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia in 1938.
        He is survived by his wife, Amory, of Peterborough; a son, William A. L. Glenn of Manhattan; a daughter, Elizabeth McLellan of Dublin, N. H.; and four grandchildren.
