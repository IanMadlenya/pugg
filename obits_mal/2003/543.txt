        In 1960 he founded the Richard Bauman Agency, based in New York City. He specialized in discovering gifted young people like Mr. De Niro and Ms. Midler.
        In the 1970's Mr. Bauman and a theater agent, Walter N. Hiller, opened Bauman-Hiller & Associates.
        Mr. Hiller died in 1998. In 2000 Mr. Redanty and Mr. Shaul became partners in Mr. Bauman's agency, then named Richard Bauman & Associates. The agency, whose clients included the actor Robert Morse, is still in business after 40 years.
