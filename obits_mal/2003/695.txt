        Sir Ian Hunter, a British impresario and organizer of arts festivals who played a major role in shaping the annual Edinburgh Festival, died on Sept. 5 at his home in West Sussex, England. He was 84.
        As managing director and later as president of Harold Holt (now Askonas Holt), a British concert agency, Sir Ian also promoted the careers of many prominent musicians, including Yehudi Menuhin, Daniel Barenboim and Claudio Arrau.
        He began his career in 1947 as an assistant to Rudolf Bing, artistic director of the first Edinburgh Festival, which was held that year. Three years later, when Sir Rudolf moved to the Metropolitan Opera, Sir Ian succeeded him, overseeing six more festivals from 1950 to 1955.
        He added a visual aspect to this predominately musical event by organizing parallel exhibitions of major painters. In 1951 he arranged for the first postwar European visit of the New York Philharmonic.
        Ian Bruce Hope Hunter was born near London on April 2, 1919, and educated at Fettes College in Edinburgh. After studying music he became an assistant to Fritz Busch, musical director of the Glyndebourne Opera Festival.
        He started the Bath International Music Festival in England 1948, as well as British festivals in London, Brighton, Windsor and Malvern and another festival in Hong Kong. He was knighted in 1983.
        Sir Ian is survived by four daughters from his first marriage, to Susan Russell, who died in 1949, and by his second wife, the former Marie Showering, from whom he was separated.
