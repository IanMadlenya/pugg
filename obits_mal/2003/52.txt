        Milton Lipson, a lawyer and investigator who, as a Secret Service agent from 1938 to 1946, was a personal bodyguard for Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, died on Wednesday in Glen Cove, N.Y. He was 89.
        Mr. Lipson was one of the small group of aides who helped President Roosevelt disguise his inability to walk by, for example, lifting him to a standing position and propping him up on crutches before he made a speech.
        In the 1990's, he was a valuable source of information on this subject for Doris Kearns Goodwin, Geoffrey C. Ward and other presidential biographers.
        Mr. Lipson, who attended Columbia University, began his career as an investigator for Fiorello H. La Guardia's first successful mayoral campaign. After the election, he worked for the city as a welfare-fraud investigator while attending classes at St. Lawrence University Law School (now Brooklyn Law School). He received his law degree in 1937.
        In 1962, he was appointed commissioner of accounts of Nassau County, heading a new office in charge of investigating public contracts. Later, he was vice president for corporate security at American Express, an assistant district attorney in Nassau County and a village judge in Sea Cliff, N.Y.
        His book, ''On Guard: the Business of Private Security,'' was published in 1976. He continued to practice law until June 2002.
        Milton Lipson, who was known as Mitch, was born in Manhattan on Feb. 3, 1913. He lived in Sea Cliff, and is survived by his companion, Clara Cazzulino; a daughter, Eden Ross Lipson, an editor at The New York Times; a son, Merek Evan Lipson, of San Francisco; and eight grandchildren.
