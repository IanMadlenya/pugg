        Walter J. Fried, a real estate lawyer who handled the conversion of prime Manhattan apartment buildings like the Beresford and the Ritz Tower into cooperatives, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 99 and lived in Manhattan and East Hampton.
        Mr. Fried was a retired partner in the law firm now named Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. He was born on May 27, 1904, in Lawrence, N.Y. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in 1924 and earned his law degree from Columbia in 1928.
        That year, he joined his father's law firm, Erwin, Fried & Czaki. In 1929, he was admitted to the New York Bar and joined the firm then named Riegelman, Hess & Strasser, a spokeswoman for his firm said, although the exact name at that time could not be confirmed. He remained at the firm until his retirement, in 1979.
        During World War II, Mr. Fried was the American liaison to the British code-breaking center at Bletchley Park. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his services.
        After the war, he returned to the firm and became chairman of its real estate practice and, later, of the firm itself. In the 1950's, he was a pioneer in the movement to turn rental apartment buildings into corporations with shares owned by residents. The conversions included the Beresford on Central Park West and the Ritz Tower at Park Avenue and 57th Street.
        He was a former president of the American Chess Foundation and, from 1969 to 1993, served on the board of the Salant Corporation, a clothing manufacturer. He was chairman of Guild Hall, a cultural center in East Hampton, from 1974 to 1978.
        Mr. Fried's wife, Brita Digby Fried, died in 2000. He is survived by a son from his first marriage, to Louise Goldman, Michael Faraday of New Jersey; his stepdaughters, Allison Blinken and Ingrid Einstein, both of New York State; and seven grandchildren and one great-grandson.
