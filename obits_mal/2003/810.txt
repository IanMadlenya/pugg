        Alexander M. Vagliano, who was involved in the negotiations for the return of American hostages from Iran, died on Thursday at his home in Norfolk, Conn. He was 76.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, his wife, Sara, said.
        In January 1981, as head of the international banking division of Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, Mr. Vagliano joined a group of bank executives who were negotiating the release of Iranian assets from American banks. The negotiations were part of an agreement that the United States government had brokered with Iran for the return of American hostages, one of whom was Mr. Vagliano's cousin, Moorehead Kennedy.
        A native of Paris, Mr. Vagliano came to the United States in 1940 and was naturalized in 1945 after serving in the Army. He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School and worked for six years as an associate at the law firm of White & Case before joining J. P. Morgan & Company. He also worked for the Agency for International Development in the 60's.
        After retiring, Mr. Vagliano turned to raising sheep in Connecticut. In the late 1980's, the French government awarded him the rank of Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his activities promoting French-American culture.
        He is survived by his wife; two sons, Andr√©, of Brookline, Mass., and Justin, of Dover, Mass.; a daughter, Barbara, of New York City; and five grandchildren.
