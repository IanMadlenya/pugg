        Peter McLennan, a copy editor for The New York Times for 23 years, died on Saturday at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 55 years old. The cause, pending an autopsy, was believed to be an aneurysm, said his wife, Katherine.
        Mr. McLennan joined The Times in 1979 and was an editor in its style section for eight years, for the Long Island section for three years and for the national editions for two years. Since 1992, he had been on the metropolitan staff, and often edited and wrote headlines for the main articles of the day.
        Mr. McLennan, a chess and bridge aficionado, edited the Times's chess and bridge columns. He was recently editing ''The New York Times Guide to Chess,'' by Robert Byrne, the Times's chess columnist, which is to be published later this year by Times Books. He also edited ''The New York Times Bridge Book,'' by Alan and Dorothy Truscott, which was issued last year by St. Martin's Press.
        Peter Nelson McLennan was born in Toronto on Jan. 27, 1948, and grew up in Quebec and Williamsburg, Va. He graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1970 with a bachelor's degree in history. He was a copy editor for The Hartford Courant before joining The Times.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth, Meredith, and Caroline, all of Old Greenwich; his parents, Winona McLennan of Williamsburg, and Donald McLennan of Youngstown, Ohio; two brothers, Douglas, of Arlington, Va., and Robert, of Davis, Calif.; and two sisters, Carol McLennan, of Toronto, and Christine Cruttwell, of Newmarket, Ontario.
