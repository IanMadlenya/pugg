        Henry Harfield, a lawyer specializing in banking who also participated in the release of prisoners taken at the Bay of Pigs, died on Sept. 13 in Manhattan. He was 89.
        Mr. Harfield spent his entire career at the New York law firm of Shearman & Sterling, where he helped develop the legal and regulatory framework for the international banking business after World War II. He represented the firm's lead bank client, Citibank.
        Many of the issues he worked on were esoteric, but important. He developed the legal basis for negotiable certificates of deposits, creating a legal way for commercial banks to pay interest on deposits. Citibank introduced certificates of deposit as a product in 1961.
        Mr. Harfield was the author of ''Bank Credits and Acceptances'' (John Wiley & Sons) and argued several banking cases before the United States Supreme Court.
        After the Cuban revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, Mr. Harfield represented Citibank on Cuban expropriation cases. After the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, Mr. Harfield played a behind-the-scenes role to secure the return of captured Cuban refugees.
        Mr. Harfield negotiated and prepared the Canadian bank letters of credit that guaranteed provision of the medical supplies that led to the prisoner release.
        A native of St. Louis, Mr. Harfield was born on Oct. 17, 1913, and graduated from Yale University in 1934. He received a law degree from Columbia University in 1937.
        His wife of 50 years, Marion Bussang Harfield, died in 1999, and a daughter, Ellen Harfield Piel, died in 1996. He is survived by one daughter, Susan Harfield Leness Peck of New York; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.
