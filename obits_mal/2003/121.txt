        Jim Gordon, who broadcast Giants, Rangers and Knicks games on radio and television for almost 40 years, died at his home in Putnam Valley, N.Y., on Sunday, the day after his 76th birthday.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Jeanne, said.
        Mr. Gordon's career began in local radio in Syracuse. In 1955 he was hired by Madison Square Garden as a broadcaster, and he later became a news anchor for WINS and news director of WABC and WNEW.
        Mr. Gordon broadcast Rangers games on radio with Monty Hall, the game-show host, and then Bill Chadwick, and on television for 10 years with Phil Esposito and John Davidson.
        From 1977 through 1994, including the Giants' two Super Bowl seasons, he was the team's radio voice. Dick Lynch, the former Giants cornerback, was his analyst.
        Mr. Gordon was a graduate of Grover Cleveland High School in Queens and Syracuse University. Since 1970, he and his wife lived in Putnam Valley.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Jim of Eureka, Calif.; Brian of Delray Beach, Fla., and Chris of Clinton Corners, N.Y.; two daughters, Laura Hess of Roslindale, Mass., and Mary Gordon of Putnam Valley; two grandchildren; one great-grandchild; and a sister, Noreen Dick of Kinderhook, N.Y.
