        Mel Wong, a dancer, choreographer and visual artist, died on Thursday after collapsing at a swimming pool in Santa Cruz, Calif. He was 64 and lived in Santa Cruz.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Connie Kreemer.
        Mr. Wong performed with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company from 1968 to 1972 and was in the original casts of ''Canfield,'' ''Tread,'' ''Second Hand,'' ''Signals'' and other dances by Mr. Cunningham. A painter and sculptor whose work has been exhibited in galleries in New York and California, Mr. Wong integrated visual and dance arts in his own choreography, which he began to create in 1970 and which was performed by his company and by troupes throughout the world.
        Several of Mr. Wong's best-known works were steeped in Americana, but at the time of his death he was touring in a program of solos called ''Growing Up Asian-American in the 1950's,'' which explored discrimination with humor. He also performed with Silvia Martins in recent years in a program of solos.
        Born in Oakland, Calif., Mr. Wong began training in dance as a high school gymnast. His teachers included Raoul Pause, Ann Halprin, Eugene Loring, Mia Slavenska and Carmelita Maracci, and in New York he studied at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet and at Mr. Cunningham's school. He received a master's degree in visual arts from the University of California at Los Angeles.
        Mr. Wong taught dance at the State University of New York at Purchase, the University of Colorado and New York University and at the American Dance Festival. At his death he was a professor of theater arts at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
        A previous marriage to Betsy Erickson, a ballet dancer, ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Kreemer, he is survived by three daughters, Anika, Kira and Suzanna, all of Santa Cruz; his mother, Louise, of Alameda, Calif.; and a brother, Maurice, of Oakland.
