        Stan Martin, a cabaret expert and longtime New York radio personality who for six years helped run The New York Times's popular-music station, WQEW-AM, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. He was 64.
        The cause was a stroke, his sister, Rochelle Levy Steinhardt, said.
        Mr. Martin joined the station in 1992 as program director when The Times changed the station's format from classical music and its name from WQXR-AM to WQEW. He eventually became the station manager.
        He left in 1998, when The Times leased the station to ABC, which now uses it for Radio Disney.
        Mr. Martin presented a Monday afternoon show on WQEW on which he was joined in the studio by star performers like Rosemary Clooney and Tony Bennett. He also broadcast regularly from top New York night spots.
        His radio career began in 1959 at WDLC in Port Jervis, N.Y. He then worked for several other stations, including WPIX-AM, WHN-AM and WFAN-AM in New York and WPEN-AM in Philadelphia.
        After leaving WQEW, Mr. Martin was master of ceremonies for cabaret shows in Manhattan and host of a Web site, www.popstandards.com.
        Mr. Martin, whose original name was Stanley Martin Feuerman, was born in Manhattan on Dec. 26, 1938. He was a graduate of New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study. He later taught at N.Y.U. as an adjunct professor of communications.
        He is survived by his mother, Sylvia Feuerman of West Palm Beach, Fla., and his sisters Ms. Steinhardt of Manalapan, N.J., and Pamela Findling of San Diego.
