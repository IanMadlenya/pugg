        Seymour Cohn, co-founder and chairman of the Sylvan Lawrence Company, long a major commercial real estate power in New York City, died on Thursday. He was 92.
        A former resident of Upper Brookville, N.Y., Mr. Cohn lived in Palm Beach, Fla.
        At its peak, the Sylvan Lawrence Company was one of the larger owners of commercial real estate in Lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn, controlling an estimated $1 billion in office buildings and other holdings in the early 80's
        Mr. Cohn, a native of Manhattan, attended Rutgers University and, after serving in the Army in World War II, joined his brother, Sylvan Lawrence, in the real estate business. Both had learned the trade during the Depression, doing chores for their uncle, Elias A. Cohen, one of the city's most active and successful real-estate brokers.
        The brothers built several office buildings in Lower Manhattan, including a 16-story building at 90 William Street, completed in 1967, and buildings of more than 20 stories at 90 Washington Street and 95 Wall Street, both completed in 1970.
        The 26-story structure at 100 William Street, which became the company's home, was finished in 1973 and was then considered one of the finest new buildings in the insurance district.
        Mr. Cohn was known for his ability to buy properties on favorable terms and refurbish them to attract creditworthy tenants.
        Mr. Lawrence, who was chairman at the time of the company's greatest influence, died in 1981. The business has recently been winding down its affairs as a brokerage and management company; the last of its 128 buildings -- 100 William, 111 Eighth Avenue, and 95 and 99 Wall Street -- were sold as a package in 1998.
        Mr. Cohn's wife, Estelle Grossman Cohn, died some years ago. He is survived by a son, Marc, of Glen Head, N.Y.; a daughter, Paula Hallman, of Oyster Bay, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.
