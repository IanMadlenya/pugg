        Paul S. Conklin, a prolific photojournalist who was the first official photographer for the Peace Corps in the 1960's, died on Wednesday at his home in Port Townsend, Wash. He was 74.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Ruth Merryman, said.
        Mr. Conklin's work appeared in National Geographic, Time magazine, The New York Times and other publications. One of his most striking images, which appeared in Time, was that of a young protester placing a daisy in the barrel of a National Guardsman's rifle during a demonstration at the Pentagon against the Vietnam War.
        His rise to prominence came first with his work for the Peace Corps, where he was hired in 1964 by the agency's director, Sargent Shriver.
        After service in the Army, Mr. Conklin worked as a newspaper reporter in Minneapolis and as a freelance writer in Nigeria. Then, based on his experience in Africa, he approached Mr. Shriver in Washington and was hired by the newly formed Peace Corps.
        Later in his career, Mr. Conklin continued to travel extensively. Working with the writer Brent Ashabranner and others, he provided photographs for more than 20 books for young adults.
        At times, he engaged his subjects closely: Ms. Merryman said one project involved living for six weeks with an Arab family and an Israeli family for a book on how Mideast hostilities affected the lives of children.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Conklin is survived by two sons, David, of Port Townsend, and Peter, of Portland, Ore.; a stepdaughter, Alex Todd-Lippock of Washington, D.C.; a sister, Kathryn Green of San Francisco; and a grandson.
