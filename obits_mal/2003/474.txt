        Patrick M. Wall, a Manhattan criminal defense trial lawyer with many prominent clients and the author of a respected book in his field, died on July 5 in White Plains, N.Y. He was 68 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Patrick M. Wall Jr.
        Among the clients the elder Mr. Wall represented was James L. Marcus, New York City's former water commissioner, who was charged with bribery and conspiracy and was sentenced in 1970 in State Supreme Court to one year in prison. Earlier, in 1969, Mr. Marcus had been released after serving almost 11 months in federal prison. He had been convicted of conspiracy to accept a bribe on a city reservoir contract.
        Mr. Wall received a doctorate in law from New York University in 1964 after receiving two lesser law degrees at the university, where he was on the Law Review. His doctoral thesis was published in 1965 as ''Eye Witness Identification in Criminal Cases.''
        In 1967, three decisions handed down by the United States Supreme Court on the same day -- all dealing with constitutional issues related to identification procedures in prosecutions and the risks of mistaken identifications -- relied in part on material in Mr. Wall's book.
        From 1970 to 1981, Mr. Wall was the first chairman of New York State's Advisory Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure. In the 1970's, he also served on the Mayor's Judiciary Committee.
        He maintained a private legal practice from the 1970's until about two years ago.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Wall lived in Queens and White Plains as a child. He received a bachelor's degree from the College of the Holy Cross.
        His marriage to Mary Catherine Russell ended in divorce.
        Besides his son Patrick M. Jr. of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, Jean; a daughter, Caitlin Gayle Wall of Riverdale, in the Bronx; another son, Conor Patrick Wall, also of Riverdale; and two grandchildren.
