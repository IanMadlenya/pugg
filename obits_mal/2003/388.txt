        Leon Robbin, a patent lawyer who headed the legal department of the old P. R. Mallory Company when it invented the long-life sealed alkaline battery now known as Duracell, died on May 22 at his home in Key Biscayne, Fla. He was 101.
        Mr. Robbin drafted the patents for the company's products, including the dry-cell storage batteries that became staples in the Allied campaigns of World War II and that are now everyday household items. He joined the company in 1933 as assistant secretary and vice president for the legal and patents division.
        A native of Washington, Mr. Robbin graduated from the Georgetown University law school in 1922. In his 47 years with Mallory, he incorporated and led its overseas subsidiaries. He retired in 1980.
        Mr. Robbin was a collector of musical manuscripts, scores, letters and other writings by composers, including Schubert, Schumann, Rossini and Liszt. His family said he left the collection, about 350 items, to Georgetown University.
        Mr. Robbin's first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Olga Key Robbin; four daughters, Grace R. Drehmel of Sea Ranch, Calif., Susan Chace of Manhattan, Barbara L. Robbin of Los Angeles and Gwendolyn Paine of Toledo, Ohio; a stepdaughter, Donna Key of Denver; and three grandchildren.
