        George de Kay, who fostered the early careers of best-selling novelists and issued popular nonfiction as the president of one of New York's last independent publishing houses, M. Evans & Co., died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. Mr. de Kay, who also lived in Stonington, Conn., was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Miranda.
        In an era when independent publishers were gobbled up by vast conglomerates, M. Evans evolved from a packaging company that developed properties for larger publishers into a house with an eclectic list that included the early books of popular novelists like Donald Westlake, Dean Koontz, David Morrell and Eric Van Lustbader.
        In addition, Evans best sellers included ''Aerobics'' by Kenneth Cooper; ''Body Language'' by Julius Fast; ''Meeting at Potsdam'' by Charles L. Mee Jr.; ''A Gift of Joy,'' the autobiography of Helen Hayes; and the house's most striking recent success, the revised ''Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution.''
        Mr. de Kay founded M. Evans in 1954 with Mel Evans, a colleague at Doubleday & Co., where Mr. de Kay was the editor in chief of Permabooks, Doubleday's first paperback imprint. He worked with Herbert Katz, then his editor in chief, to expand the company over the years.
        Mr. de Kay, who was born and reared in New York City, was a grandson of Charles Augustus de Kay, a literary and art critic of The New York Times who founded the National Arts Club in 1898.
        Mr. de Kay was a graduate of Choate and Tufts and a member of the Century Association.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons and a daughter from his marriage to Mary Elliman de Kay, who died in 1982: Colman, of Los Angeles; Sarah, of Claverack, N.Y.; and Charles, of Chicago. He is also survived by a brother, the author James Tertius de Kay of Pawcatuck, Conn.; two stepchildren, Alexandra Booke Millner of Los Angeles and Nicholas Booke of New York; and four stepgrandchildren.
