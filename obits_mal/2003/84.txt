        Jerry Mayer, who won an Obie award for one of his own long-running one-man shows, was found dead in his apartment in Manhattan on Feb. 3. He was believed to be about 60.
        He was discovered after he missed rehearsals for ''Endgame,'' a workshop production directed by Andr√© Gregory. Mr. Gregory said he had apparently died of natural causes, but an autopsy is pending.
        Mr. Mayer acted off and on for Mr. Gregory for more than 30 years, as the Mad Hatter in his ''Alice in Wonderland'' and as Waffles in ''Vanya on 42nd Street.''
        Born in Iowa, Mr. Mayer moved to New York in 1966 and joined Mr. Gregory's Manhattan Project troupe. He also did Shakespeare with Joseph Papp and acted in movies.
        His play ''Taudshow'' (1979), about Antonin Artaud, won him his Obie. His 1981 one-man show, ''You Know Al He's a Funny Guy,'' explored the private Albert Einstein.
        No survivors are known.
