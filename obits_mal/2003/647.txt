        Robert B. Sims, retired executive vice president of the National Geographic Society and president of its magazine group, died on Wednesday in Jackson, Tenn. He was 68 and lived in the nearby town of Alamo.
        The cause was cancer, National Geographic said.
        Mr. Sims retired in 2001 after 14 years with the society, which he joined from the Defense Department, where he was assistant secretary for public affairs from 1985 to 1987.
        He was born in Alamo on Nov. 26, 1934, graduated from Union University in Jackson, earned master's degrees in journalism and political science at the University of Wisconsin, and attended the National War College as well. He rose from Navy ensign in 1958 to captain in 1984.
        From 1982 to 1985, he was a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan in public affairs and press posts.
        Surviving are his wife, Patricia; two daughters, Jacqueline Sims Jasinski of Pelham, N.Y., and Carolyn Sims of Washington; two sons, James B., of Suffolk Va., and William, of Richmond, Va.; and seven grandchildren.
