        Sir Terry Frost, an eminent British abstract painter, died last Monday at St. Julia's Hospice near his home in Newlyn, Cornwall. He was 87.
        For more than five decades, Sir Terry remained dedicated to abstraction, painting in a style that combined Cubist order, Matissean sensuousness and Abstract Expressionist energy. Working with a vocabulary of stripes, triangles, diamonds, ovals, half-moons and other graphic elements and with a concentration on rich color, he avoided pure formalism in an effort to capture sensations of natural experience. Over the years his palette brightened, and his work became increasingly devoted to a cheerful, mildly mystical hedonism.
        Terence Ernest Manitou Frost was born Oct. 13, 1915, in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. In high school, which he left at the age of 15, he edited the school art magazine, but his art career didn't begin in earnest until he became a prisoner of war. While serving with the British commandos in 1941, he was captured in Crete and imprisoned in Stalag 383 in Bavaria. There he met the artist Adrian Heath, who encouraged his interest in art, and he began to paint and draw fellow prisoners.
        Released from prison at the end of the war, Sir Terry enrolled at the Camberwell School of Art, and he began to associate with artists like Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Victor Pasmore who favored exploring abstraction, still a controversial enterprise in the British art world.
        Sir Terry had his first solo exhibition in 1952 at Leicester Galleries, and in the same year he began teaching at the Bath Academy of Art. In subsequent decades, while teaching at various art schools, he had many one-man shows, culminating in a retrospective mounted by the Royal Academy of Arts, London, in 2000. He was elected to the Royal Academy in 1992 and knighted in 1998.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathleen, whom he married in 1945; five sons; a daughter; and 12 grandchildren.
