        Peter Shaw, a retired talent agent, studio executive and a co-producer of the long-running television series ''Murder, She Wrote'' starring his wife, Angela Lansbury, died last Wednesday at the couple's home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. He was 84.
        British-born like Ms. Lansbury, he was an Army major in World War II. He sought a career in Hollywood and, while under contract at MGM studios, met Ms. Lansbury; they were married in London in 1949.
        For a time, Mr. Shaw worked for the William Morris Agency, representing stars like Robert Mitchum, Katharine Hepburn and Anna Magnani. He also was assistant head of production at MGM before returning to William Morris to oversee the agency's international operations.
        He and his two sons, David and Anthony, joined forces in the 1980's to produce television movies, including the ''Murder, She Wrote'' series. Universal Studios said they recently finished a new installment with Ms. Lansbury, titled ''The Celtic Riddle,'' which is scheduled to be shown on CBS this spring.
        In addition to Ms. Lansbury and his sons, Mr. Shaw is survived by a daughter, Deirdre, and three grandchildren.
