        Darrell Henline, publisher and editor of the monthly magazine Cabaret Scenes, died on Sept. 25 at his home in Guttenberg, N.J. He was 75.
        The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer, said Peter Leavy, an editor at the magazine.
        Mr. Henline started Cabaret Scenes in 1995 to draw attention to performances by singers in small clubs around the country and overseas. The magazine, which includes news, reviews and profiles of famous and lesser-known performers, has subscribers in 46 states and in 14 countries.
        Mr. Henline also established the Cabaret Scenes Foundation and had planned to create a cabaret archive and hall of fame.
        Originally a dancer with the Joffrey Ballet, he was an editor at Dance magazine in the 1950's before working on two magazines that covered New York nightlife, After Dark and Cue. He was also an editor at The SoHo Weekly News in the 1970's.
        He is survived by his companion, Dr. Keith Meritz; and a sister, Joan Summers, and brother, Bryce, both of Walla Walla, Wash., where he was born.
