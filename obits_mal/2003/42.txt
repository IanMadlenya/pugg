        Dr. Sebastian von Hoerner, a radio astronomer and astrophysicist who was a pioneer in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and an expert on the formation of stars, died on Jan. 7 in Esslingen, Germany, where he had retired. He was 83.
        Dr. von Hoerner spent much of his professional life at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, W. Va., where he was a scientist in astrophysics and engineering from 1962 to 1985. He lectured widely and often wrote for journals on subjects as diverse as radio antenna design and the possibility of interstellar travel (he was skeptical).
        Dr. von Hoerner conducted research in stellar dynamics, interstellar communication and life in space. He worked on refining radio telescopes that listen to the sounds of space -- or, as one of his papers called it, ''universal music.''
        Eventually, his interest turned to the quest for indications of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. He was an advocate of the SETI project, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
        He was a co-editor of a four-volume reference work in his native German intended to give people outside of astrophysics a better understanding of the field, much as Dr. Carl Sagan did for the American public.
        Sebastian von Hoerner was born in Görlitz, Germany, and received a Ph.D. in physics at the University of Göttingen in 1951. In the 1950's he worked as an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute in Göttingen and, for a year, as a Fulbright scholar at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories in California.
        After a stint at the Institute for Astronomical Research in Heidelberg, he continued his work in the United States in Green Bank.
        Dr. von Hoerner's designs increased the power of radio telescopes to catch signals from space. His concept for a homologous antenna formed the core of a radio telescope at Effelsberg, near Bonn.
