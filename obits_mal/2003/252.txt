        Noel Fox, a former bass singer with the Oak Ridge Boys who became a power in the music business, died here on Thursday. He was 63.
        He died after surgery following a series of strokes, his longtime band manager, Jim Halsey, said.
        Mr. Fox was born and raised in Columbia, about 40 miles south of Nashville. He sang with the Oak Ridge Boys for five years before leaving in 1972 for a Nashville music business career that included booking, talent management and publishing.
        In 1978 Mr. Fox began managing the Oak Ridge Boys' publishing entity, Silverline/Goldline Music Inc. He later served as vice president of MCA Music/Nashville and president of Maypop Music Group, which was owned by members of the group Alabama.
        An early champion of the singer-songwriter Steve Earle, Mr. Fox signed him to a publishing deal and introduced him to Tony Brown, at that time producer for MCA Records. MCA subsequently signed Mr. Earle and released his 1986 debut hit ''Guitar Town.''
        The Oak Ridge Boys began in Knoxville in 1943 as the Oak Ridge Quartet, singing country and gospel music. The group has won five Grammys, four in gospel and one in country.
