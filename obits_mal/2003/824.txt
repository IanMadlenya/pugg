        Henry Phace Roberts, a tap dancer who performed with the Copasetics and on television and in the movies, died on Nov. 8 in New York. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
        Born in Savannah, Ga., Mr. Roberts trained as a child by performing on the streets, in the time-honored way of tap.
        He began to dance professionally at 14 and a few years later joined the Five Blazers, a suave young tap group known for its ''one-man dance,'' in which the five men moved as one body in perfect synchrony. He also danced with a group called the Three Rockets.
        Mr. Roberts was a charter member of the Copasetics, a group of tap stars that began performing in the early 1950's. His last performance, at 87, was with the group while it was on a European tour.
        He was particularly known for a move called ''around the world,'' in which he hunkered down and turned with one hand in the air.
        Mr. Roberts performed on television with Milton Berle and Sammy Davis Jr., and on the ''Tonight'' show and ''The Ed Sullivan Show.'' His film credits include ''Cabin in the Sky,'' ''Stormy Weather'' and ''The Cotton Club.''
        He is survived by his son, Rick, of Manhattan; his daughter, Sharon, of Temple Hills, Md.; and his sister, Eloyce McCollen of the Bronx.
