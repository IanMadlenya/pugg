        Fred Russell, a sportswriter and longtime sports editor of The Nashville Banner who also compiled ''Pigskin Preview,'' for years an annual feature in The Saturday Evening Post, died on Jan. 26 in Nashville. He was 96.
        Mr. Russell, who grew up in Nashville and graduated from Vanderbilt University Law School there, abandoned a brief legal career and joined The Banner, now defunct, as a reporter in 1929. He was named sports editor in 1930, vice president in 1955 and sports director in 1969. He continued to write his column, Sideline Sidelights.
        Besides writing ''Pigskin Preview,'' in which Mr. Russell predicted the best teams and players in college football each year from 1949 to 1962, he wrote or was co-author of several books.
        The best known was ''Bury Me in an Old Press Box'' (A. S. Barnes, 1957), which John Lardner, writing in The New York Times, praised as ''unsentimental, gay and trenchant throughout.''
        Mr. Russell, he wrote, ''is one of those regional giants of the sports-writing trade -- it's a small and special group -- who have transcended local limits and local interests and made a kind of national impact on sporting life.''
        In tribute to Mr. Russell, Vanderbilt created the Fred Russell-Grantland Rice scholarship, which is given each year to an entering freshman who plans a career in sports journalism.
        Mr. Russell is survived by four daughters, Carolyn Russell, Ellen Sadler and Kay Beasley, all of Nashville, and Lee Brown, of Columbia, Tenn.; 11 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
