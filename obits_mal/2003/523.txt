        John Lewis Selover, vice chairman of the Christian Science board of directors and publisher of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Friday at his home in Boston. He was 72.
        A church spokesman, Peter Osterlund, said Mr. Selover had suffered a brief illness.
        Mr. Selover had been publisher of The Christian Science Monitor, a job he held as manager of the publishing society of the Church of Christ, Scientist, since 1998. During his tenure, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its political cartoons. It also expanded and redesigned its Web site.
        Mr. Selover, a native of California, began his career as an advertising executive in San Francisco after graduating from Principia College in Illinois and serving in the Army in the early 1950's. He switched into marketing and public relations, and he worked with small firms in the fledgling semiconductor industry.
        From 1970 through 1975, he was a manager of community and public affairs for the First Church of Christ, Scientist. It was during that period that the church built Christian Science Plaza, a 14-acre complex in Boston's Back Bay.
        Mr. Selover was made a Christian Science practitioner in 1975, and a teacher of Christian Science in 1982. He was elected to the church's board of directors in 1985.
        Mr. Selover is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, of Boston; a daughter, Alison, of Los Angeles; a son, Alexander, of Los Angeles; a brother, William C. Selover of San Francisco; and two grandchildren.
