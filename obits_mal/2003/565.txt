        George B. Rabinor, who was active in the development of rental housing in New York City, on Long Island and elsewhere in New York, Pennsylvania and Florida, died on July 22 at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 91.
        He was an officer of the Long Island Home Builders Association and longtime chairman of its apartment builders' division.
        Born in the Bronx, he grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from City College of New York, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He taught English and speech for 13 years at high schools in Queens and Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn Law School, he was admitted in 1934 to the New York State Bar.
        Three years later, his career as a developer began. In the following years he had a leading role in the construction of 2,044 apartments in eight apartment projects, as well as 528 single-family homes. Other locations in New York State where he oversaw construction included Buffalo, Hartsdale and Ithaca.
        He also had a hand in some sophisticated marketing. In 1956, when his construction of Hartsdale House, a 72-family apartment house in Hartsdale, was nearing completion, the opening of two model apartments was underscored by an exhibition of paintings by prominent American artists.
        The purpose of the show was to draw attention to the apartments' contemporary furnishings. The display, of works of art on loan from the Grand Central Art Galleries, was open to the public.
        Mr. Rabinor is survived by his wife, Terry Rabinor; two daughters, Judith C. Kirschner of Hewlett, N.Y., and Joan E. Rabinor of Chevy Chase, Md.; one son, Arnold J., of Lido Beach, N.Y.; one stepdaughter, Jennifer A. Serito, of Boca Raton; eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
