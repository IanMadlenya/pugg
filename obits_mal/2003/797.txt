        Joe Kleinerman, a runner, track coach and Runyonesque character who was a key figure in developing the New York Road Runners Club, the New York City Marathon and women's distance running, died on Tuesday in Calvary Hospice in the Bronx. He was 91.
        Until 1958, when road races were scarce in New York, the city's runners traveled to Boston once or twice a month to compete. Kleinerman was part of a group that formed the Road Runners Club of America and, four months later, a local chapter, the New York Road Runners Club.
        In 1970, the club put together the first New York City Marathon, run entirely in Central Park. Kleinerman helped Fred Lebow, the race impresario, turn it into a world-famous five-borough extravaganza.
        At the start, the New York club had 33 members, no offices and no money. Now it has more than 38,000 members, a six-story home off Fifth Avenue (with a lobby named after Kleinerman) and enough money to stage 100 races a year, including the Joe Kleinerman 10-Kilometer, which helps raise money for college scholarships named after him.
        In 1967, Kleinerman, Vince Chiapetta and Nina Kuscsik, all leaders in New York City distance running, successfully led a national movement to allow women to run races longer than a mile.
        Joseph George Kleinerman was born Jan. 12, 1912, in Spring Valley, N.Y., and grew up in New York City. At 13, he became fascinated with running when his older brother, Mike, took him to the Millrose Games. He ran at DeWitt Clinton High School, and after one year at City College, he worked 32 years for the post office in New York City, with time out for service in World War II. He retired in 1968.
        In 1941 and 1942, he finished 10th in the Boston Marathon. His best time there was 2 hours 38 minutes, and he ran that, he once told Newsday, ''with sneakers, on dirt roads and without any water stops.''
        The Millrose Athletic Association named him an assistant coach in 1941, head coach in 1967 and coach emeritus in 2002. Into his 90's, he remained active as the New York Road Runners Club's registrar.
        He is survived by three nieces.
        Kleinerman estimated he had run 500 races. Knee injuries forced him to stop racing at 53 and running at 70. At 81, after knee replacement surgery, he found the perfect physical therapy: he started jogging.
