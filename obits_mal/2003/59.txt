        Clark Waring Blackburn, who led efforts in the 1960's to get social welfare agencies to provide education and job training in addition to traditional family counseling, died on Jan. 18 in Aurora, Colo. He was 94.
        From 1952 to 1974, Mr. Blackburn was general director of the Family Service Association of America, now known as the Alliance for Children and Families, an organization of more than 200 family counseling agencies in the United States and Canada. He promoted professional counseling as the key to families' well-being and was co-author of the 1968 book ''How to Stay Married.''
        Mr. Blackburn weighed in on the top issues of the day, as families moved to the suburbs, television sets became household centerpieces and schools were racially integrated. He led studies on the rise of teenage marriages in the 1950's and lobbied state legislatures to permit girls to return to classes after pregnancies.
        As the civil rights movement developed, Mr. Blackburn sought to have family service organizations offer job training and educational services in poor and black communities as well as provide counseling for mostly middle-class clients. He developed programs for low-income mothers as part of the Johnson administration's war on poverty. In the 1970's, he helped establish the Council on Accreditation, which evaluates 1,500 organizations serving families and children.
        Mr. Blackburn was born in Seneca, S.C. He graduated from Yale in 1932 and received his master's degree in social work from Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
        He is survived by a daughter, Mary Jane Cook of Centennial, Colo.; two sons, Clark Waring Jr., of Clayton, N.Y., and Bennett S., of Peconic, N.Y.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
