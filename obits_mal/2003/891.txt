        William A. Delano, the first general counsel of the Peace Corps and an executive secretary of the City Bar Association, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was kidney failure, his daughter, Laura, said.
        As a young litigation lawyer in 1953, just out of Yale Law School, Mr. Delano was hired by Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts, a Manhattan law firm, which encouraged its young lawyers to take pro bono clients. Mr. Delano, who was a distant cousin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, worked on the cases of mentally ill patients committed against their will, said his wife, Georgia, and the experience turned him toward the world of volunteerism.
        In 1961, he left the practice to become the first general counsel of the newly founded Peace Corps. He held that post until 1964, when he became the secretary general of the foreign arm of the Peace Corps, the International Secretariat for Volunteer Services, a position he held until 1967.
        From 1979 until 1981, Mr. Delano was the executive secretary of the City Bar Association.
        In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by three sons, Peter and Andrew, of New York, and Daniel, of Colorado; and three grandchildren.
