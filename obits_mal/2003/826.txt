        Bernard Brightman, who built a successful jazz record company on a foundation of songs about sex and drugs, died on Nov. 9 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, his son Adam said.
        Mr. Brightman's company, Stash Records, took its name from the subject of its first album, ''Reefer Songs'' (1976), a compilation of jazz and blues songs, most from the 1920's and 30's, about drugs, mostly marijuana. Tracks included ''Reefer Man,'' by Don Redman and His Orchestra, and ''Who Put the Benzedrine in Mrs. Murphy's Ovaltine?'' by Harry Gibson. That album's success led to a follow-up, ''Copulatin' Blues,'' devoted to songs about sex, and other themed compilations.
        Although there were occasional questions about the legitimacy of the rights to all the vintage recordings he reissued, his anthologies were praised for their concepts, selection quality and entertainment value.
        Stash evolved into a source of new recordings by young and relatively unknown musicians like the pianist Hilton Ruiz, and by more established performers like the singer Chris Connor. Stash and its sister label, Jass, remained a source of archival material, including historically significant recordings, some previously unissued, by Charlie Parker.
        A jazz enthusiast and record collector, Mr. Brightman made music his livelihood after the sale of the family handbag business in the mid-1970's left him with money and time on his hands. He ran Stash Records until it closed in the late 90's.
        In addition to his son Adam, he is survived by his wife, Natasha; two other sons, Ezra and Fred; three stepdaughters, Lynn Tesser, Liza Jones and Jodi Homann; and four grandchildren.
