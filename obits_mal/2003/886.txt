        Gary Stewart, a singer and writer of hard-driving honky-tonk songs who had a No. 1 country hit in 1975 with ''She's Actin' Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles),'' was found dead on Tuesday at his home in Fort Pierce, Fla. He was 59.
        The cause was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck, said Audria Moore, a spokeswoman for the Fort Pierce Police Department.
        Often compared to Jerry Lee Lewis for his tenor voice, Mr. Stewart also recalled Mr. Lewis in the rowdy subject matter of his songs. ''She's Actin' Single,'' ''Flat Natural-Born Good-Timin' Man,'' ''Drinkin' Thing'' and other songs proudly celebrated earthy pleasures with wordplay and a driving beat. Mr. Stewart's 1975 album ''Out of Hand'' quickly established itself as a honky-tonk classic.
        He made a string of albums for RCA in the 1970's that earned widespread acclaim, but he slowed down in the 80's. His last studio album was ''I'm a Texan'' (1993), and earlier this year he released ''Live at Billy Bob's Texas.''
        He began his career as a songwriter for Stonewall Jackson, Billy Walker, Cal Smith, Nat Stuckey and others. At one point in 1971 four songs in the country Top 10 were written by Mr. Stewart.
        Born in Kentucky, Mr. Stewart was a longtime resident of Fort Pierce.
        His wife of more than 40 years, Mary Lou Stewart, died on Nov. 21, and his son, Gary Joseph Stewart, committed suicide in 1988.
        Mr. Stewart is survived by his daughter, Shannon Stewart, and a grandson, Mark Joseph Stewart-Peavy, both of Fort Pierce.
