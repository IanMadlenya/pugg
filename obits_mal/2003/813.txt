        Dr. Leon Pordy, a Manhattan cardiologist who unexpectedly moved into the corporate world, becoming chairman of the Chock full o'Nuts coffee company, died on Nov. 14 at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
        Dr. Pordy, a pioneer in the application of computer technology to cardiology, was an attending cardiologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center, now Mount Sinai Hospital, and a professor of medicine.
        It was his close relationship with one patient, William Black, the founder of Chock full o'Nuts, that led to Dr. Pordy's move into big business. Mr. Black persuaded him to join the board in 1976.
        ''We just thought, Let's have Leon,'' Mr. Black's wife, Page, another of Dr. Pordy's patients, said in a 1982 interview.
        Dr. Pordy was still practicing medicine, but quickly rose through the corporate ranks, becoming Chock full o'Nuts's medical director, executive vice president, president and eventually chairman.
        Dr. Pordy juggled his two lives until 1982, when he was elected chairman of Chock full o'Nuts. He remained chairman until he retired in 1992. Chock full o'Nuts was acquired by Sara Lee in 1999.
        Born on July 5, 1919, in New York City, Dr. Pordy graduated from New York University at 18, and from Louisiana State Medical School in 1943, In World War II, he served in a hospital in Udine, Italy.
        Besides his daughter, of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife of 52 years, Ruth, of Manhattan; two sons, Dr. William Pordy of Manhattan and Dr. Robert Pordy of Ardsley, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  November 20, 2003, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Tuesday about Dr. Leon Pordy, a cardiologist, who became chairman of the Chock full o'Nuts coffee company, omitted the name of a survivor. She is his daughter, Melissa Pordy of Manhattan.
