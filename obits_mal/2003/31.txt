        David Cummins Morton II, an architect who did the first residential loft conversion in the Fulton Ferry area in Brooklyn, died on Tuesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 61 and a former resident of Brooklyn Heights.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Morton, who designed homes around the country, bought the vacant Berglas Manufacturing Company building, a former toilet seat factory near the waterfront just south of the Brooklyn Bridge, and transformed it into an apartment house in 1975. At the time, the neighborhood was a mostly empty warehouse and manufacturing area, not today's thriving residential market.
        A native of Providence, R.I., he was the son of Rogers C. B. Morton, a former congressman and secretary of the interior, who died in 1979.
        David Morton graduated in 1963 from Yale, where he received a master's degree in architecture in 1968.
        He practiced in New York for 25 years before moving to Marin County, Calif., 10 years ago. He was active in land conservation in Maine, Hawaii and California.
        Mr. Morton is survived by his mother, Anne Morton Kimberly, and sister, Anne Wyman, both of Easton, Md.; and his partner, Thomas Cordell of San Francisco.
