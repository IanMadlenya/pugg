        Frank Richlan, a founder of the Manhattan-based architecture firm Beckhard Richlan Szerbaty & Associates, died on Sept. 10 at his home in Nutley, N.J. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer, the family said. His longtime partner and co-founder of the firm, Herbert Beckhard, died the next day at 77.
        Like Mr. Beckhard, Mr. Richlan started in his profession under the aegis of Marcel Breuer, the celebrated Bauhaus master. A former senior associate in Breuer's New York firm, he joined Mr. Beckhard to form the partnership originally named Herbert Beckhard Frank Richlan & Associates in 1982.
        Among the projects on which Mr. Richlan collaborated since then were the International Financial Center in Jersey City and the Franklin Township Technical Center.
        Mr. Richlan received an M.A. in architecture at Columbia in 1965. He retired from Beckhard Richlan earlier this year.
        Survivors include his wife, Janice; three children; and two grandchildren.
