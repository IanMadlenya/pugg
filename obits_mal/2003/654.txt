        Howard D. Graves, a retired lieutenant general in the Army, a former superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and the chancellor of the Texas A&M University System until two weeks ago, died on Saturday at his home in College Station, Tex. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        General Graves, a career Army officer for 35 years, beginning in 1961, also served for a time as commandant of the Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pa.
        He became chancellor of the Texas A&M University System in 1999 and remained in the post until Aug. 31, when he stepped down. General Graves was in charge when two new universities were added to the system, in San Antonio and Killeen.
        He was superintendent at West Point from 1991 to 1996. In 1994 he dealt with a furor that arose after West Point football players were charged with sexually harassing female cadets. He investigated, and dealt out penalties to the players involved.
        He was the United States Army War College's commandant from 1987 to 1989. By mid-August 1988, he had drawn up a plan to enhance training in the science and art of military strategy for the Army's future leaders.
        During his Army career, General Graves was the personal assistant to two chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowe Jr. and Gen. Colin L. Powell, and dealt with issues ranging from the reunification of Germany to peace planning for the Middle East.
        Howard Dwayne Graves was born on Aug. 15, 1939, in Roaring Springs, a village in northwestern Texas. He graduated from West Point in 1961 and went on to study as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he received three degrees: bachelor of arts, master of arts and master of letters.
        His survivors include his wife, Gracie; a son, Greg, of College Station, who is a major in the Army; a daughter, Gigi Kail of Middletown, R.I.; a brother and a sister; and five grandchildren.
