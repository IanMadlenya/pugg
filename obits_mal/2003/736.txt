        Dr. Aubrey Gorbman, a zoologist who helped pioneer the study of endocrine systems and hormones in animals and humans and explored the relationships of the systems among different species, died on Sept. 21 at his home in Seattle. He was 88.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his daughter Claudia Gorbman.
        In the early 60's, Dr. Gorbman helped found the field's first journal, General and Comparative Endocrinology, and was one of its top editors for more than 30 years. He also organized a series of international meetings on comparative endocrinology that continue to this day, occurring every four years.
        ''He nurtured the development of comparative endocrinology and was one of the first to promote it, within the country as well as internationally,'' said Dr. Stacia Sower, a professor of biochemistry and biology at the University of New Hampshire who worked with Dr. Gorbman in the early 80's at the University of Washington, where he was a zoology professor and department chairman.
        Dr. Gorbman was also well known for supporting and encouraging women in biology. For his efforts, he received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Mentoring in 1998 from the Clinton White House.
        Born in Detroit, Dr. Gorbman earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from Wayne State University there and his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.
        He taught at Barnard College and Columbia before leaving in 1963 for Washington. He retired there in 1985.
        Dr. Gorbman wrote or contributed to nearly 250 scientific articles. He also wrote what is often considered his field's seminal text, ''A Textbook of Comparative Endocrinology'' (1962).
        His wife of 60 years, Genevieve, died in 1998.
        In addition to his daughter Claudia, he is survived by a son, Eric, and two daughters, Beryl and Leila, all of Seattle; a sister, Rose Korinsky of Detroit; and four grandchildren.
