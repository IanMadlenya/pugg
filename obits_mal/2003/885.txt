        Felix Kaspar, a 5-foot-4 Austrian who won world championships and an Olympic medal in figure skating and dazzled audiences with his jumping, died Dec. 5 in a hospital near his home in Bradenton, Fla. He was 88.
        The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, said June Kaspar, his wife of 54 years.
        Kaspar won the world and European championships in 1937 and 1938 and the Austrian championships from 1936 through 1938. He won the bronze medal in the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.
        When he appeared in exhibitions in the United States and Canada in 1937, he became an audience favorite. Maribel Vinson, writing in The New York Times in 1937, said his jumps measured as much as 4 1/2 feet high and 19 feet long. After an appearance in Toronto, The Canadian Press reported, ''On his jumps, Kaspar gained an altitude rarely equaled in Canada and bolstered his reputation as the greatest jumper who ever wore skates.''
        Kaspar was born on Jan. 14, 1915, in Vienna, and started skating at age 9. In 1938, with war looming in Europe, he moved to Australia, where he met his future wife. She and their daughter, Cherie Kaspar, of Boston, are his only survivors.
        When the war wiped out the 1940 Winter Olympics, he turned to coaching. His pupils included Tommy Litz, who won the United States men's championship in 1963 and was the runner-up in 1964, and Emi Watanabe, a Japanese women's champion in the 1970's.
        Kaspar later appeared in ice shows in the Netherlands and in Germany. He retired from coaching in 1989 and moved from California to Florida.
        ''He played golf and tennis until 1998,'' his wife said by telephone. ''His last real appearance was that year, when he was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.''
