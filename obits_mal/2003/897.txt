        Sidney A. Rand, a Lutheran elder statesman who served as president of St. Olaf College and as United States ambassador to Norway, died on Dec. 16 in Northfield, Minn. He was 87.
        His death was announced by St. Olaf College.
        Dr. Rand, an ordained Lutheran minister, was president of the college for 16 years before President Jimmy Carter sent him to Oslo as his ambassador in 1980; he retired from the post in 1981.
        With former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, he founded the Nobel Peace Prize Forum conference, held annually by five colleges in the upper Midwest.
        He also taught homiletics, the art of writing and delivering sermons, at Luther Seminary in St. Paul in the mid-1980's.
        Sidney Anders Rand was born in Eldred, Minn. He graduated in 1938 from Concordia College, where he also received a doctor of divinity degree in 1956.
        He was ordained at the Lutheran Seminary in St. Paul in 1943 and served as a pastor in northern Minnesota before he joined the Concordia faculty in 1945.
        He was president of Waldorf College in Forest City, Iowa, from 1951 to 1956, when he became executive director of college education for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Minneapolis.
        During his presidency at St. Olaf, in Northfield, from 1963 to 1980, the college added six buildings on campus while increasing its enrollment by about 50 percent, to its present level of about 3,000. Dr. Rand conducted two fund-raising campaigns, bringing in about $25 million; another one, with a goal of more than $20 million, was well under way by the time he left for Oslo.
        In the 1980's, he was chairman of Minnesota Citizens for Court Reform and a member of the Governor's Tax Commission. He wrote an autobiography, ''In Pleasant Places'' (1996).
        After his return from Norway, he emerged from retirement three times, for stints as interim president of Augustana College in Sioux Falls, S.D., in 1986 and 1987 and in 1992 and 1993, and of Suomi College (now Finlandia University) in Hancock, Mich., in 1990 and 1991.
        Dr. Rand's first wife, Dorothy Holm Rand, died in 1974 after 31 years of marriage; he is survived by his wife, Lois Ekeren Rand, whom he married later that year. He also leaves a son, Peter A.; a daughter, Mary Taylor; a stepdaughter, Sarah Buck; a stepson, Mark Ekeren; a brother, Lyman; nine grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
