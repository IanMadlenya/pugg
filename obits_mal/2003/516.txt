        Rod Amateau, a movie veteran who worked on classic early television comedies like ''Dobie Gillis'' and the Bob Cummings and Burns and Allen shows as a writer, director or producer, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 79.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said his friend Jerry Pam.
        Born Rodney Amateau in New York, he started as a writer for CBS radio. At 20th Century Fox he advanced from junior writer to make his directorial debut in 1952 with ''The Bushwackers,'' a Western.
        He directed another film that year, ''Monsoon,'' but soon turned to the booming genre of light prime-time television entertainment, finding his niche as a producer, director and writer of weekly family shows.
        He was a producer and wrote episodes for ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show,'' which ran on CBS from 1950 to 1958. At the time he was also working on ''Private Secretary,'' the CBS vehicle with Ann Sothern. He was a director for ''The Bob Cummings Show,'' a series renamed ''Love That Bob'' in reruns, and produced and directed episodes of ''The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,'' which was introduced in 1959.
        In the 1960's he was a mainstay of ''Mr. Ed'' and ''The Patty Duke Show,'' as well as the famously short-lived ''My Mother the Car'' on NBC and ABC's even-shorter-lived ''O.K. Crackerby.''
        Mr. Amateau returned to films in the 1970's, directing ''Pussycat, Pussycat, I Love You'' (1970), a sequel to Woody Allen's ''What's New, Pussycat?,'' and ''Where Does It Hurt?'' (1972) with Peter Sellers.
        He detoured into directing naughty comedies, including ''Drive-In'' (1976), ''High School U.S.A.'' (1983), and ''Lovelines'' (1984). He also directed the more family-oriented ''Garbage Pail Kids'' (1987).
        His final credit as producer was for the NBC-TV movie ''Swimsuit'' (1989).
        Mr. Amateau is survived by his wife of 42 years, Charlene Schneider; two sons, Todd, of Los Angeles, and John P., of Pasadena, Calif.; two daughters from earlier marriages, Susan Amateau, of Los Angeles, and Chloe Shapero, of Richmond; and four grandchildren.
