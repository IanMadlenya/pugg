        Arthur Oldham, a British choirmaster who founded the Edinburgh Festival Chorus in 1965, died on May 4 in Paris. He was 76 and had retired to Paris.
        The cause was cancer, The Times of London reported.
        Mr. Oldham, who was also a composer, was best known in Europe for his years of work with the Edinburgh Festival Chorus.
        He was also the longtime director of the Orchestre de Paris's highly regarded chorus, which he organized in 1975. His work with it led him to move from Scotland to France in 1977. Later he commuted weekly between France and Britain.
        Over the years he worked with the choruses of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Scottish Opera. In 1956 he became the choirmaster of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Edinburgh, where he developed into a renowned trainer of choir singers.
        An orphan, Mr. Oldham studied composition in London at the Royal College of Music, where he had a scholarship, and became a pupil of the British composer Benjamin Britten.
        Mr. Oldham is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.
