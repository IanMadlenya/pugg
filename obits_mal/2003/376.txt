        Allen Eager, a top saxophonist during the bebop era who after a short career quit jazz for the high life in Europe and elsewhere, died on April 13 in Daytona Beach, Fla. He was 76.
        The cause was liver cancer, his daughter Omine said.
        Mr. Eager was, with Zoot Sims, Stan Getz, Al Cohn and others, part of the wave of saxophonists in the late 1940's influenced by Lester Young, and he played frequently in the clubs on West 52nd Street in Manhattan. He was praised by critics for his swinging ease and natural tone, and had the rare distinction of being a white saxophonist often employed by black bandleaders, including Fats Navarro, Coleman Hawkins, Tadd Dameron and Charlie Parker.
        But by the mid-50's, after leading his own group and playing with Gerry Mulligan and Buddy Rich, Mr. Eager disappeared from the scene. He later blamed Parker's death in 1955 for his departure. ''After Charlie Parker died, jazz just went down the tubes as far as being a vital force,'' he told The Orlando Sentinel in 1993. He also acknowledged the ravages of drugs.
        By 1956 Mr. Eager was living in Paris, where he hobnobbed with celebrities and became engaged. He skied and raced cars, and in 1961 he and his racing partner Denise McCluggage placed at Sebring, a 12-hour endurance race in Florida.
        Mr. Eager settled in Florida in the late 60's and raised a family, making periodic returns to the music business. He recorded a comeback album, ''Renaissance,'' for the Uptown label in 1982 and toured with Dizzy Gillespie.
        In addition to his daughter, Ms. Eager of Miami, he is survived by his former wife, Nancy, of Homestead, Fla.; a son, Jacob, of Miami; another daughter, Zoe Griffin of Roswell, Ga.; and two granddaughters.
