        John Semple Galbraith, a historian of 19th-century Britain whose tenure as the second chancellor of the University of California's San Diego branch in the 1960's secured its position as an equal member of the university system, died on Tuesday in San Diego. He was 86.
        Dr. Galbraith, a native of Glasgow, retired in 1986 after 39 years as a history professor at U.C.L.A. and an administrator at San Diego. He accepted the chancellorship there in 1964 but exacted a pledge from Clark Kerr, president of the multicampus university system, that San Diego would get a library and academic status worthy of a true university.
        The visible memorial to his legacy at San Diego became Geisel Library, designed by the California architect William Pereira and inaugurated shortly after Chancellor Galbraith resumed his professorship at U.C.L.A. in 1968. He first joined the faculty in 1948 after teaching for a year at Ohio University.
        Among his books were ''The Reluctant Empire'' (1963), ''The Hudson Bay's Company as an Imperial Factor'' (1957) and ''The Establishment of Canadian Diplomatic Status at Washington'' (1951). He also published ''Crown and Charter'' (1974) and ''The Little Emperor'' (1976).
        Dr. Galbraith's family immigrated to the United States in 1925, and he graduated from Miami University in Ohio in 1938. He received an M.A. in 1939 and a Ph.D. in 1943 at the University of Iowa, after which he served as an Army historical officer for the Third Air Force until 1946.
        Leaving San Diego in 1968 for a visiting fellowship at Cambridge, he was succeeded as chancellor by Dr. William J. McGill, subsequently president of Columbia University.
        Dr. Galbraith is survived by his wife of 62 years, Laura Huddleston Galbraith; two sons, James M. of San Marino, Calif., and John H. of Venice, Calif.; a daughter, Mary P. Galbraith of Claremont, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
