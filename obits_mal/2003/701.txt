        Donald J. Mitchell, a Republican from New York who served in the House of Representatives for 10 years, died on Saturday in Little Falls, N.Y. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said Gretchen Barr, his daughter.
        In his time in the House, from 1973 to 1983, Mr. Mitchell represented the Mohawk River Valley in upstate New York and sat on the Armed Services Committee. In the 1970's, he and several other members of the House started a campaign to persuade the Defense Department to award more military contracts and employ more people in the Northeast, which at the time was steadily losing defense dollars to the South.
        In the mid-70's, Mr. Mitchell, who was a Navy fighter pilot during World War II, led another campaign to prevent the Air Force from cutting 1,500 jobs at a development center at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, N.Y. In October 2000, the base named a clinic after him.
        Before his election to the House, he served in the New York State Assembly for eight years, the last four as majority whip.
        Born in Ilion, N.Y., in 1923, Donald Jerome Mitchell earned a bachelor's degree in optometry from Hobart College and a master's degree from Columbia University. After World War II, he was a naval flight instructor during the Korean War.
        He had an optometry practice in Herkimer, N.Y., until 1954, when he became a councilman for the town and then, from 1957 to 1960, its mayor.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Gretta; two daughters, Gretchen of San Antonio and Cynthia Mitchell-Gingles of Manassas, Va.; a brother, James of Oakdale, N.Y.; a sister, Juanita Stone of Tiburon, Calif.; a granddaughter; and several nieces and nephews.
