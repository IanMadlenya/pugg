        Chester Ludgin, a baritone who sang more than 30 roles for the New York City Opera, including leading roles in its world premieres of ''The Crucible'' by Robert Ward and ''The Good Soldier Schweik'' by Robert Kurka, died on Aug. 9 at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, a spokeswoman for City Opera said.
        Mr. Ludgin made his City Opera debut in 1957 as Dr. Falke in Johann Strauss II's ''Fledermaus.'' In that performance and for many decades afterward, Mr. Ludgin was praised for his dramatic stage presence as well as his singing. Reviewing his performance in Janacek's ''Makropoulos Affair'' in 1970, Harold C. Schonberg, the senior music critic of The New York Times, cited his ''characterization with every detail thought through, a characterization of chilling reality.'' After a 1960 performance as Sharpless in Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' another critic noted that ''his noble, rich voice was a pleasure to hear, as always.''
        Mr. Ludgin sang many leading baritone roles, but was particularly accomplished in American repertory, including ''The Ballad of Baby Doe,'' ''The Devil and Daniel Webster'' and ''Susannah.'' In addition to his many premieres with City Opera, he created the role of Sam for the Houston Grand Opera's 1983 world premiere of ''A Quiet Place,'' by Leonard Bernstein. He sang often at the San Francisco Opera and other companies in North America.
        His final appearance at City Opera was in 1991, but he continued singing in musical comedies, most recently the lead in ''The Most Happy Fella.''
        He is survived by a brother, Donald, of Monticello, N.Y., and a sister, Rosalind Yussim of San Francisco.
