        Trevor Nelson, a producer for ''60 Minutes,'' died on Thursday in Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 34 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from meningitis, CBS said in a statement.
        Mr. Nelson produced reports for the correspondent Steve Kroft over the last three years, including segments on security issues after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He also produced the first interview with the teenage stock manipulator Jonathan Lebed. Many of the segments he produced led the program.
        He was born in New York and in 1991 received a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California, Berkeley. He joined CBS News in the Washington office of ''60 Minutes'' as an associate producer in 1996 and moved to New York in 1998. Before that he worked for Monitor Radio in Boston.
        He is survived by his wife, Maggie; two sons, George and Conrad; two sisters, Angela Colt of San Francisco and Andrea Abbott of Bronxville, N.Y.; and his mother, Suzanne K. Colt, and stepfather, Edward Colt, of Manhattan.
