        Frederick A. Hetzel, who was the director of the University of Pittsburgh Press for 30 years and made it a leading publisher of short fiction and poetry as well as academic books, died on Saturday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 73.
        The cause was complications from rheumatoid arthritis, The Post-Gazette of Pittsburgh reported.
        Mr. Hetzel also started the Drue Heinz Literature Prize for short fiction, whose winners receive $15,000 and have their work published by the University of Pittsburgh Press, which administers the prize.
        The Heinz award received a $1 million endowment in 1996 from Drue Heinz, a food-industry heiress. Mr. Hetzel led the University of Pittsburgh Press from 1964 until he retired in 1994. He enriched its offerings of books meant for the general reader. The press's products range from academic books about science and the humanities to the Pitt Poetry Series, which Mr. Hetzel supported even though he was not a poetry reader.
        Frederick Armstrong Hetzel was born on Sept. 6, 1930, in Pittsburgh and graduated in 1952 from Washington & Jefferson College in Pennsylvania. He served in the Army in Korea from 1952 to 1954 and received the Bronze Star. He received a master's degree in English literature from the University of Virginia in 1957.
        From 1957 until 1964 he worked first at the Institute of Early American History and Culture, in Williamsburg, Va., and then as associate editor of the University of Pittsburgh Press.
        Mr. Hetzel is survived by his wife, the former Nancy Miller; daughters Jean Hetzel, Emily Hetzel and Jennifer Gear; a son, Frederick A. Jr.; and seven grandchildren.
