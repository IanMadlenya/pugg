        Michael Small, a prolific composer of film and television soundtracks, died on Nov. 25 at New York Weill Cornell Center. He was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Lynn.
        Mr. Small wrote the music for more than 50 films and television shows starting in the late 1960's, including ''The Stepford Wives,'' ''The China Syndrome'' and the 1981 version of ''The Postman Always Rings Twice.''
        He had a specialty in thrillers, scoring ''The Parallax View,'' ''Klute,'' ''Marathon Man'' and ''The Drowning Pool.''
        Mr. Small, born in New York City, was the son a general manager for the Shubert Organization, and he wrote music for theatrical productions while an undergraduate at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass.
        He also studied for a year at Harvard for a master's degree in English literature.
        After studying music privately with Meyer Kupferman, a composer and professor at Sarah Lawrence College, Mr. Small got his start in the movies with the 1969 film ''Out of It.''
        Besides his wife, he survived by his sons Jonathan, of Los Angeles, and David, of Toronto.
