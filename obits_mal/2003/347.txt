        Peter Flint Joyce, a retired Southern California banking executive who took a special interest in golf, helping to organize the 1992 U.S. Open, among other efforts, died on May 13 at his home in Pebble Beach, Calif. He was 61.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Judith Anne, said.
        A Los Angeles native, Mr. Joyce moved to Pebble Beach after his retirement from Citicorp in 1990. He became active in the AT&T Junior Golf Association, which offers free clinics to Monterey youths, serving as a board member. He also held positions with the 1992 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Joyce spent much of his youth in New York, attended Columbia University and served in the Navy.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his mother, Katherine Flint Joyce of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif.; four stepdaughters; and four grandchildren.
