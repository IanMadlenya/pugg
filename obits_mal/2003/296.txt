        Edwin Saul Marks, an investment banker and supporter of Lincoln Center as well as medical and other cultural institutions, died on Thursday at his home in Great Neck, N.Y. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Marks headed Carl Marks & Company, the firm founded by his father, whose operations began in New York in 1925. Edwin Marks, who became president and chief executive officer in 1961 after his father died, is credited with diversifying its operations from securities trading to management consulting, merchant banking and mutual funds among other investment activities.
        At his death, Mr. Marks was vice chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. An early supporter of Lincoln Center, he helped establish the finance committee of the Lincoln Center Fund. He was a supporter of the Juilliard School, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and served on the business committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        His interest in biomedical research led him to become a life trustee of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, where he helped establish the Boas-Marks Biomedical Research Center, of which he was chairman emeritus. He was a trustee of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he was elected vice chairman in 1998.
        Edwin Saul Marks, who was born June 3, 1926, was raised in Brooklyn. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1949 and joined the family firm after Army service.
        Mr. Marks is survived by his wife of 53 years, Nancy Abeles Marks; three daughters, Carolyn M. Blackwood, Linda M. Katz, and Constance M. Miller; a sister, Marjorie M. Boas Levins; and three grandchildren.
