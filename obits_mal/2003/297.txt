        Chris Borgen, a former New York City police detective who was a news reporter on WCBS-TV in New York for nearly 30 years, died on Friday in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 76.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, CBS announced.
        Mr. Borgen joined the station in 1966. His forte was breaking crime stories. On three occasions Mr. Borgen was called in by the police to help negotiate the release of hostages. He once helped persuade a woman who had just killed one child and was holding a knife to the throat of another to surrender by reciting the 23rd Psalm with her.
        In his eight years as a police detective, he earned 19 citations for bravery.
        Mr. Borgen first worked in television when Walter Cronkite hired him as a researcher and writer for a report about prisons. He was offered a full-time job at WCBS and retired in 1995.
        In addition to appearing on the station's 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. news programs, he was host of programs like ''Channel 2 the People'' and Channel 2 Eye On.'' His ''Police Files'' series led to more than 40 felony arrests and the recovery of stolen property worth more than $2.5 million, CBS said.
        Earlier, he had broadcasting jobs with the United States Information Agency and the radio stations WINS-AM and WNCN in New York.
        Christoper Sidney Borgen was born in Manhattan on Dec. 9, 1926, and attended City College and Columbia University. He is survived by his wife, Mitsou, their son, Christopher, of Bloomfield, N.J., and a granddaughter.
