        Prince Alexis Scherbatow, who left Russia in 1920 and taught history and political science at Fairleigh Dickinson University for two decades, died on Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 92 and lived in Manhattan.
        Long prominent in the Russian Nobility Association of America, he retired as its president in 2001. Its activities have included conducting genealogical research, giving money to orphanages in Russia and performing other charitable work.
        Prince Alexis Pavlovich Scherbatow was born in St. Petersburg into a family that traces its descent from the House of Rurik, the first Russian dynasty.
        After leaving Russia, Prince Scherbatow and other family members lived in what is now Istanbul; Sofia, Bulgaria; Rome; and Brussels, and then came to the United States in 1937.
        He was in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945 and served in Europe. Then he worked for the Tolstoy Foundation, which aids Russian immigrants, and assisted in the writing of books on Russian topics.
        Having received a doctorate in history from Columbia, he taught history part time at Fairleigh Dickinson from 1962 to 1966 and was a full-time faculty member there, teaching history and political science, until 1980.
        He married Kathleen Comerford McLoughlin, and she died 58 years later, in 1999.
        His survivors include his second wife, Princess Larissa Krivoruchkina-Scherbatow, and two sisters, Princess Anna Nabokov and Princess Olga Geordgadze, both of Brussels.
