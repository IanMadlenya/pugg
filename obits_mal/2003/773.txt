        Philip M. Chu, an architect whose work included libraries at Amherst, Barnard and Bryn Mawr Colleges and at Princeton University, died on Oct. 27 at the Arcadia Residence, a home for the elderly in Honolulu. He was 83 and moved to Honolulu with his wife 14 years ago.
        The cause was a stroke, said a son, the Rev. Ernest D. Chu.
        Mr. Chu joined the architectural firm of O'Connor & Kilham in the 1950's and became the managing partner in the Manhattan-based architectural firm of Kilham, Beder & Chu in the 1970's. He contributed to more than 70 buildings, including dormitories at West Point.
        His designs for the exteriors of his libraries and other academic structures tended to be modern and uncluttered, as was true of his interiors, which from the 1960's offered easy access to stacks and ample study space.
        The Amherst library, completed in 1965 and named for Robert Frost, was typical of many American college libraries, a roomy and airy interior that was intended to increase the building's attraction as a center of campus life, not simply to function as a warehouse for books and periodicals.
        Open stacks were arranged throughout the three upper levels, and instead of a traditional central reading room, 702 individual study units were provided for students.
        Mr. Chu also designed the first modern wing of the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md., and the Chappaqua (N.Y.) Library
        Philip Mei Chu was born in Shanghai. He came to the United States during World War II, and graduated from the University of Michigan, where he studied architecture.
        He and his wife, Esther, lived in Queens and in Chappaqua before moving to Honolulu, where he did more architectural work before retiring.
        Besides his wife and his son Ernest, of Deerfield Beach, Fla., he is survived by another son, Dr. James A. Chu of Boston, and two grandsons.
