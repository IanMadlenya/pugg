        Mathew Aaron Kleiner, a former Manhattan prosecutor and advocate for those with H.I.V. infection, especially hemophiliacs like himself, died on Thursday in Manhattan. He was 31 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        The cause was hepatitis and H.I.V. infection, contracted through a blood transfusion he had received as a teenager. He had been fighting a nerve disease associated with the later stages of AIDS even as he pressed his cause publicly and in the courts.
        Mr. Kleiner, who was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 9, 1971, and graduated from Cornell University in 1993, received his law degree from New York University in 1996. From the fall of 1996 until two years ago he worked as an assistant district attorney in the appeals bureau of the Manhattan district attorney's office. In 2001 he served as the campaign manager for David Reiss, a Democrat who ran in Brooklyn for the City Council.
        Beginning as a student at Cornell, he lectured about H.I.V. infection, protected sex and the particular concerns of hemophiliacs exposed to the virus that causes AIDS. Mr. Kleiner appeared in public as recently as December in his role as a health advocate when he lectured in an AIDS awareness program at Queens College.
        Mr. Kleiner is survived by his wife, Jennifer Butler Kleiner; their triplets, Abigail, Samuel and Megan, born around 10 a.m. on New Year's Day; his parents, Sidney and Suzanne of Queens; and his brother, Daniel H., also of Queens.
