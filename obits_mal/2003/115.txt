        Rudy Sablo, a leading athlete, coach and administrator in American weight lifting and other sports for more than 60 years, died Feb. 4 in his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
        Competing at 170 pounds, Sablo lifted 335 pounds in the clean and jerk and 270 pounds in the snatch. His lifting career was interrupted by World War II, in which he became a physical instructor for the Tuskegee Airmen.
        After the war, he spent 20 years as a New York City firefighter. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the 83-year-old Sablo put on his old firefighter's uniform, appeared at the site of the World Trade Center and offered help. The firefighters were so inspired by his regard and counseling that they asked for and received his uniform for their museum.
        Sablo became the chairman of the Amateur Athletic Union's national weight-lifting committee and rewrote its rulebook. He also insisted that an athletes' representative be on the committee, a concept adopted and expanded years later in every Olympic sport.
        He ran the A.A.U.'s metropolitan area office for 20 years and helped found the Empire State Games, an annual statewide Olympic-type competition. He was the manager of the United States weight-lifting teams in the 1972 and 1976 Olympics and served on the United States Olympic Committee's board. He was elected to the United States Weightlifting Hall of Fame, and the U.S.O.C. honored him with its Olympic Shield award.
        He married Eudine Gumbs, who was known as Deen, in 1957. She died in 1990, and he left no immediate survivors.
