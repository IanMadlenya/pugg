        Emerson Chapin, a longtime New York Times editor and foreign correspondent, died on Monday in Montclair, N.J. He was 82.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter, Ruth, said.
        Mr. Chapin, who lived in Montclair, worked for The Times from 1955 until his retirement in 1985, mainly as a copy editor on the foreign desk. From 1963 to 1966 he was a foreign correspondent based in Tokyo, covering Japan and Korea and traveling on assignment in Vietnam and Laos.
        Emerson Eagle Chapin was born in Brooklyn on July 31, 1920, and graduated from the University of Rochester in 1941. He served in the Army in World War II.
        He attended the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and, in 1952, won a Pulitzer Traveling Scholarship, which took him to London. There he worked as a copy editor with the Reuters news agency. In 1955 he returned to New York and joined The Times.
        Besides his wife, the former Ruth Hudak, whom he married in 1946, and his daughter, of Portland, Ore., Mr. Chapin is survived by a son, David, of Livingston, N.J., and four grandchildren.
