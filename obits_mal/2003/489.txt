        William R. Smith, whose company made the Snapper brand of self-propelled lawn mowers, died on June 28 at Henry Medical Center in Stockbridge, Ga. He was 90 and lived in McDonough, Ga.
        Mr. Smith was president and chief executive of the company, originally called McDonough Power Equipment, from the late 1940's through 1979. It was for a time one of the biggest employers in his native Henry County. The company was later named Snapper Lawnmowers.
        Mr. Smith was also a benefactor of Henry County, a suburban area south of Atlanta.
        William Raymond Smith was born in McDonough and graduated from high school there. He had jobs in Marietta, Ga., and in East Point, Ga.
        In 1950, he acquired the patents on what became the Snapper from the device's developers, Neal and Alex Smith, two Floridians who were not related to him. He moved back to Henry County to oversee expansion of the manufacturing of Snappers.
        Because part of the lawn mower resembled a turtle shell, he called the original model a Snapping Turtle. Later, the name became simply Snapper.
        He and his wife of 68 years, Sarah, who died before him, created a foundation that gives educational grants.
        Mr. Smith also taught applied engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology and did military aviation design work during World War II.
        His survivors include one daughter, Nancy Smith of Atlanta; one brother, Leary of Chamblee, Ga.; one granddaughter; two great-grandchildren; and one great-great grandchild.
