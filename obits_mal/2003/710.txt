        Stephen Jay Rose, a founder of AC&R Advertising, which specialized in fashion, retail and high-end brands like Est√©e Lauder, the cosmetics maker, and Foot Locker, the athletic shoe retailer, died on Sept. 30 at his home in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son John.
        Mr. Rose and a partner, Alvin Chereskin, founded AC&R Advertising -- the name used three of their initials -- in New York in the mid-1960's. Its clients also included London Fog, Bordeaux wines and Sterling automobiles.
        From 1965 to 1987, Mr. Rose held several posts at AC&R -- executive vice president, secretary, chairman and chief executive.
        In the 1980's, he and Mr. Chereskin sold AC&R to the Ted Bates advertising agency, but they continued to run AC&R as a subsidiary into the mid-1980's. Mr. Rose also held posts in the American and international divisions of Bates. He retired from advertising in the 1980's and invested in theatrical productions on Broadway and in London.
        Mr. Rose was born in the Bronx on Nov. 24, 1925, served in the Navy during World War II and received a bachelor's degree in 1948 from University Heights College of New York University.
        His marriages to Zelda Gale and Barbe Rose ended in divorce.
        Besides his two sons, John and Daniel, both from his marriage to Zelda Gale, he is survived by his wife, Margitta Rose, and four grandchildren.
