        Paul Bernbach, a philanthropist and real estate investor, died on June 14 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 57 and a lifelong resident of Brooklyn.
        The cause was melanoma, his family said.
        Mr. Bernbach was born in Brooklyn, a son of William Bernbach, one of the founders of the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach. The elder Mr. Bernbach died in 1982.
        Late in 1982, Paul Bernbach was elected a director of what was then called Doyle Dane Bernbach International. At that time, he controlled 651,816 shares, or 11 percent, of the concern, which was publicly held. He resigned from its board in 1984.
        A supporter of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he was on its board of trustees from 1985 until he died. He was also on the boards of St. Ann's School and of Packer Collegiate Institute, both in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Bernbach graduated from Brooklyn Friends School and received a bachelor's degree from Columbia and a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
        He practiced law with the Manhattan-based law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in the 1970's and was assistant to the office of the president of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons from 1979 to 1981.
        He was a private real estate investor for the rest of his life, and was a partner in Bernbach & Plotkin, a private investment company specializing in real estate.
        He is survived by his wife, Thérèse, whom he married in 1967; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Brooklyn, and Sarah, of Manhattan; a son, Matthew, of Brooklyn; and a brother, John, of Manhattan.
