        Robert S. Mullaney, an aeronautical engineer and executive at the Grumman Corporation who helped oversee the construction of the craft that landed Apollo astronauts on the moon, died at his home in Bellport, N.Y., on July 6. He was 82.
        Mr. Mullaney was a former Navy pilot who had a hand in the development of fighter planes at Grumman, which is now part of Northrop Grumman Corporation. He became manager of the Lunar Excursion Module program in 1962. Mr. Mullaney coordinated hundreds of engineers for the project, which produced the vehicle that carried astronauts between the spacecraft's command module and the moon's surface. It was tested in space in March 1969 on the Apollo 9 mission and made its historic landing four months later on the Apollo 11 mission.
        Mr. Mullaney was later the project manager for the F-14 Tomcat program and then vice president of Grumman International, where he was responsible for promoting sales in South America.
        In World War II, he was a dive-bomber pilot on the aircraft carrier Ticonderoga. He was awarded the Navy Air Medal and the Purple Heart.
