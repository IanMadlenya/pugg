        David Minkin, a successful New York-area real estate developer who was also president emeritus of Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn, died on Friday. He was 99 and lived in Queens and in Palm Beach, Fla.
        He died at J.F.K. Medical Center in Palm Beach County.
        In an interview in 1985, Mr. Minkin said proudly, ''I am a developer, builder, owner and manager of real estate for over 50 years.'' He was also active in nonprofit organizations and as a philanthropist.
        He built and owned many properties, including apartment houses in various sections of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as in Hackensack, N.J., and New Rochelle, N.Y.
        He was president of the medical center for more than two decades and was its primary benefactor. The David Minkin Rehabilitation Institute at the center, named in his honor, was built while he was in charge.
        Another unit, the Bernard and Rose Minkin Pavilion, an acute-care medical and surgical center named for his parents, was also built under his supervision.
        David Minkin was born in Manhattan, and the family moved to Brooklyn in 1907. There, after graduating from high school, he went to work in his father's business in 1922 and oversaw building projects, rented apartments and performed administrative tasks.
        In 1926, David Minkin went out on his own. He and a new partner built two apartment buildings in the late 1920's in Jackson Heights, Queens, where growth was predictable. He remained a builder during the Depression and the years after World War II.
        Mr. Minkin was a trustee of various nonprofit organizations, among them the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, the Jewish Braille Institute, Long Island University, the Richard Tucker Music Foundation and the Rabbi Jacob Joseph School, a theological seminary.
        He left no immediate survivors.
