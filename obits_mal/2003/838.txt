        Teddy Wilburn, who with his older brother Doyle formed one of the most popular country-music duos in the 1950's and 1960's and later played a vital role in the careers of Loretta Lynn and Patty Loveless as song publisher and manager, died on Monday in Nashville. He was 71.
        The cause was a form of Parkinson's disease, said the Grand Ole Opry announcer Eddie Stubbs.
        The Wilburn Brothers had at least one Billboard Top 10 country single every year from 1954 through 1966. They were regarded as Nashville pioneers as much for their business moves as for their records, notably getting Ms. Lynn signed to Decca Records from her original tiny California-based label, Zero Records.
        Besides recording their own hits, like ''Somebody's Back In Town'' (1959), the Wilburn Brothers sang on classic records by Ernest Tubb and Webb Pierce. Their uncredited backup harmonies on Pierce's ''In the Jailhouse Now'' helped that single stay at No. 1 on the country charts for 21 weeks in 1955.
        The Wilburns were born into a musical family in the Ozark mountain town of Hardy, Ark. At first, Doyle and Teddy sang in a family act with their older brothers, Lester and Leslie. Roy Acuff heard the group in 1940, and arranged for their Opry debut that year in Nashville. In 1948, they became regulars on the ''Louisiana Hayride'' radio program in Shreveport, La., where Pierce was often a guest artist.
        Doyle and Teddy served in the Korean War and were discharged in 1953, at which time Pierce helped them get a record deal with Decca.
        Virgil Doyle Wilburn died in 1982. Teddy, whose real name was Thurman Theodore Wilburn, rarely performed after his brother's death.
