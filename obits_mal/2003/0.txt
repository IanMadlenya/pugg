        Richard Horner, a Broadway theater owner and producer who won a Tony Award for the 1974 revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' died on Saturday at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 82.
        By himself and with his business partner Lester Osterman, Mr. Horner produced dozens of Broadway and Off Broadway shows during the 1960's and 70's, including ''Butley,'' Albert Innaurato's ''Passione'' and ''The Crucifer of Blood,'' a Sherlock Holmes story adapted from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ''Sign of Four.''
        He was also a general manager for ''Da,'' the 1969 original production of ''1776'' and other shows.
        ''A Moon for the Misbegotten'' won three Tony Awards in 1974, including a special award presented to the producers.
        Mr. Horner and Mr. Osterman's Coronet Theater Corporation owned several Broadway theaters, including the 46th Street Theater (now the Richard Rodgers), the Helen Hayes and the Morosco, which closed in 1981.
        During the 1980's, Mr. Horner was the executive director of the American Shakespeare Company in Stratford, Conn., and staged productions at Jones Beach Marine Theater.
        Born in Portland, Ore., he graduated from the University of Washington at Seattle and served in the Navy during World War II.
        Mr. Horner is survived by his wife, the former actress Lynne Stuart; two sons, Lindsey Horner of New York City and Randall Horner of Portland, Ore.; two daughters, Robin Horner of San Francisco and Anne Cameron of Albuquerque; a sister, Joy Rich of Roseburg, Ore.; and three grandchildren.
