        Laurence I. Radway, a Dartmouth College professor of government with a zeal for practical politics who walked the length of New Hampshire in his losing 1972 campaign for the United States Senate, died on May 7 in Lebanon, N.H. He was 84.
        The cause was complications of abdominal surgery, his wife, Patricia, said. He lived in West Lebanon, N.H.
        Dr. Radway, who taught at Dartmouth for 39 years and had a particular interest in the American presidency, served two terms in the New Hampshire House of Representatives and was chairman of the state Democratic Party.
        He played host to Democratic presidential candidates competing in the New Hampshire primary, either in his living room or on tours of the state. These included Senators John F. Kennedy, John Glenn and Al Gore; Representative Morris K. Udall; and Govs. Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.
        Mr. Radway ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1972, losing in the Democratic primary to John A. Durkin, who later won the seat held by Norris Cotton, a Republican.
        He walked the length of his state from Colebrook to Seabrook to publicize his promise of ''clean, fresh and competent leadership.'' He walked 10 miles a day through weather as cold as 35 below and spent nights with supporters.
        Laurence Ingram Radway was born on Staten Island on Feb. 2, 1919, and earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees from Harvard. He received a master's degree in public administration from the University of Minnesota.
        In addition to his wife, the former Patricia Headland, Dr. Radway is survived by his sons, Robert, of Greene, Me., and Michael, of Portland, Ore; daughters, Carol Tobias of Dorchester, Mass., and Deborah Radway of Montague, Mass.; a brother, Robert, of Providence; and five grandchildren.
