        Roland de Margerie, a French diplomat who played a major role in French-German reconciliation after World War II, died last week, his family said today. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. de Margerie was Ambassador to Bonn in 1963 when President Charles de Gaulle and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation.
        The accord was aimed at ending decades of enmity, marked by three wars between 1870 and 1945.
        Mr. de Margerie had a long career in the French diplomatic service. He played a prominent role in several post-World War II conferences of the victorious Allies. At Big Four meetings in the mid-1950's he was the permanent official in the French delegation and was for many years chief of the political department of the Foreign Ministry.
        A graduate of the School of Political Science, he served in several posts abroad, from Belgium to China, before becoming Ambassador to Bonn.
        Mr. de Margerie's son, Emmanuel, recently retired from the French foreign service after serving as Ambassador to the United States.
