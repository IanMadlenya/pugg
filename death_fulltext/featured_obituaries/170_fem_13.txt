        Denny Griswold, founder and former editor of the newsletter Public Relations News, died on Feb. 7 in Norwalk, Conn. She was 92 and in recent years had lived at the Wilton Meadows Health Care Center in Wilton, Conn.
        Her newsletter was the first periodical to report on public relations, said Jack O'Dwyer, whose company, the J. R. O'Dwyer Company, publishes the rival O'Dwyer Newsletter.
        Ms. Griswold said on various occasions that she had the idea for the newsletter in 1944, when there were no more than 25 formal corporate public relations departments in the United States and perhaps 100 companies that described themselves as handling public relations.
        The newsletter, which is still published, has an international circulation, which it does not disclose.
        Ms. Griswold was born Denora Prager in New York on March 24, 1908. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College and a master's from Radcliffe.
        She joined the editorial staff at Business Week, where her first husband, Glenn Griswold, was the editor and publisher. After working in public relations, first at J. Walter Thompson and then at other agencies, she started her own agency with Mr. Griswold. He died in 1950.
        In 1951, she married J. Langdon Sullivan, an investment manager, who died in 1995.
        She is survived by three stepchildren, Diana Sullivan Spenski of Virginia Beach, Va.; Margot Sullivan Grosvenor of Newport, R.I.; and James R. O. Sullivan of Boston; 12 stepgrandchildren; and 20 stepgreat-grandchildren.
