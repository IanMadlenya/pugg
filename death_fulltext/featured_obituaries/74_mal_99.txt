        David Caplan, a New York civil engineer who spent 50 years in public service, including 20 as director of planning for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, died on Wednesday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        He belonged to a crop of young engineers dubbed the Depression Whiz Kids because they infused public engineering departments with managerial talent.
        Mr. Caplan's ties to the triborough authority, a state agency, reached back to 1930. He later went to work for the Department of City Planning, where he filled a number of engineering jobs and rose to assistant director of planning. As such, he was responsible for drawing up current and comprehensive long-range plans for New York City's public-service construction.  Role in Bridge Projects
        In 1957, Robert Moses lured him back to the triborough authority as director of planning. He worked closely with Mr. Moses when the Throgs Neck and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges were built, along with a network of highway approaches and interchanges. He retired from the director position in 1979 at 70.
        Mr. Caplan started studying civil engineering at New York University but had to leave to take a job. While working, he attended night classes until he managed to graduate from Cooper Union and earn a master's degree from N.Y.U.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 60 years, the former Sadie Rosenfeld; two sons, Floyd, of Rye Brook, N.Y., and Harold, of Riverdale; two grandchilden, and three great-grandchildren.
