        Irving Koerner, a retired executive vice president of the investment banking firm of Allen & Company in Manhattan, died on Thursday at the Carlotta-Good Samaritan Nursing Home in Palm Desert, Calif. He was 84 years old and lived in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, his wife said.
        Mr. Koerner joined Allen & Company in 1929 shortly after graduating from Rutgers University and was with the concern until he retired in 1984. While with Allen, he formed the New Jersey Natural Gas Company in Asbury Park in 1951 and was its executive vice president for more than 30 years. He later was named a vice president of the New Jersey Resources Corporation.
        Besides his wife, Peggy, he is survived by a daughter from a previous marriage, Felice Chait of Rock Tavern, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
