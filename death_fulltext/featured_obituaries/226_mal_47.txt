        Conrad B. Duberstein, the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Brooklyn since 1984, died on Friday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 90.
        His death was announced by the court, on which he had continued to serve as chief judge on a year-to-year basis since nominally retiring in 1995.
        Judge Duberstein had already retired from a career as a bankruptcy lawyer when he was appointed to the bench in the bankruptcy division of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in 1981. He became chief bankruptcy judge in 1984.
        A native New Yorker, Conrad Duberstein attended Brooklyn College and graduated from St. John's University School of Law in 1941. He served in the Army in World War II, winning a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He became a partner in Schwartz, Rudin & Duberstein in Brooklyn in 1954 and was with Schwartz & Duberstein from 1960 to 1970.
        That year he joined Otterbourg, Steindler, Houston & Rosen as a senior partner and retired from that firm in 1980.
        Judge Duberstein is survived by his wife, Anne Saggio Duberstein; a daughter, Elyssa Belessakos; a sister, Barbara Roberts; and four grandchildren.
