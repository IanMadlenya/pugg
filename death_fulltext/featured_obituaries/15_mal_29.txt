        Prince Mozaffar Firouz, a former Iranian deputy prime minister who was known as the Red Prince for his close ties with the Tudeh Communist party, has died. He was 83 years old. Members of his family who made an announcement today did not say when he died or give the cause of death.
        Prince Firouz took part in negotiations in 1946 on the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Iranian part of Azerbaijan in the aftermath of World War II. He also held the Labor Ministry portfolio and helped draw up Iran's first labor code.
        He was later named Ambassador to the Soviet Union but resigned the post in 1947 to protest what he called undemocratic policies of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.
        He moved to Paris and published articles and books attacking the Shah, but did not return to Iran when the Shah was overthrown in 1979 in an Islamic revolution.
