        Harry S. Ackerman, a television producer who made or helped to create such hits as "Gunsmoke," "I Love Lucy" and "Leave It to Beaver," died on Sunday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was 78 years old.
        He died of pulmonary failure, a publicity agent, Frank Liberman, said.
        Mr. Ackerman developed "Gun smoke" and organized the development of "I Love Lucy." He was a co-creator of "Our Miss Brooks" and supervised the show.
        After a stint with his own production company, he joined Screen Gems, now Columbia Pictures Television, where he worked from 1958 to 1977 on shows including "Dennis the Menace," "The Donna Reed Show," "Hazel" and "The Farmer's Daughter." He was a co-creator of "The Flying Nun" and "Bewitched." His credits include the television anthology series "Studio One" and "Suspense."
        Many of his shows have won a new generation of viewers. Reruns of "Bewitched," "Dennis the Mennis" and "The Donna Reed Show" appear on the Nickelodeon cable channel, which specializes in children's programming and nostalgia entertainment.
        He was born in Albany and educated at Dartmouth College. He began his career as an advertising executive at Young & Rubicam.
        He is survived by his wife, the actress Elinor Donahue, who co-stars on the Fox network show "Get a Life" and who played the eldest daughter on "Father Knows Best," and five sons and a daughter.
