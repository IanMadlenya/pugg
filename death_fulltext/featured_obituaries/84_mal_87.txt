        Dr. Richard Edwards Gordon, a psychiatrist and author, died on Thursday at North Florida Regional Hospital in Gainesville, Fla. He was 71 and lived in Gainesville.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        From 1953 to 1967, Dr. Gordon practiced in Englewood, N.J. Based on his research there and elsewhere in Bergen County, N.J., he was co-author of "The Split-Level Trap" (Geis, 1961), along with his wife, Katherine K. Gordon, a sociologist, and Max Gunther, a magazine writer, describing the stresses, frustrations and boredom of suburban commuter families.
        Conclusions in the book were considered overdrawn by many reviewers and local notables, but it became a much-discussed best seller.
        Dr. Gordon published scores of articles in professional journals and was author or co-author of several other books. The latest, "Introduction to Psychiatric Research," with his wife and Carolyn J. Hursch as co-authors, appeared in 1988. Professor Emeritus in Florida
        In 1967 Dr. Gordon moved to Florida.  At his death, he was professor emeritus at the College of Medicine, University of Florida in Gainesville, from which he retired in 1987.
        He was a native of Manhattan, graduated from Yale and received his M.D. degree at the University of Michigan and a Ph.D. in social psychology at Columbia University. He trained at the New York Psychiatric Institute.
        He was a past president of the Florida Psychiatric Society and served as its representative to the American Psychiatric Association's assembly of district branches for 10 years.
        Besides his wife, Dr. Gordon leaves a son, Richard E. Jr., of Gainesville; three daughters, Katherine Reed of Old Greenwich, Conn., Virginia Ford of La Canada, Calif., and Laurie Gordon of Orlando, Fla.; a brother, Donald, of Englewood, and five grandchildren.
