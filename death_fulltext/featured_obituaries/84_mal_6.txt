        Henry A. Byroade, a career diplomat who was Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East, South Asia and Africa from 1952 to 1955 and Ambassador to Egypt in 1955 and 1956 and later to five other countries, died on Friday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 80 and lived in Potomac, Md.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, and he had surgery for cancer in June, said his daughter, Linda B. Griffin of Burtonsville, Md.
        Mr. Byroade was Ambassador to South Africa from 1956 to 1959; Afghanistan from 1959 to 1962; Burma from 1963 to 1968; the Philippines from 1969 to 1973, and Pakistan beginning in 1973. He retired from the Foreign Service in 1977.
        A 1937 West Point graduate, he began as a career Army officer, rising to the temporary rank of brigadier general in 1946, when he was only 32. From 1949 to 1952, the Army lent him to the State Department, and he became chief of its office of German affairs. In 1952, he resigned his Army commission and became an Assistant Secretary while still in his 30's. Critics on Both Sides
        In that post, he drew criticism from Israel and Arab nations for a 1954 policy declaration in which he told the Israelis, "You should drop the attitude of a conqueror and the conviction that force is the only policy that your neighbors will understand," and told the Arabs, "You should accept this state of Israel as an accomplished fact."
        Mr. Byroade had been Ambassador to Egypt for a little more than a year when it was announced that he was being transferred. He was considered a friend of Arab causes but was unable, during his Egyptian assignment, to prevent a large-scale arms deal between Czechoslovakia and Egypt or to influence the Egyptian Government, run by Gamal Abdel Nasser, in its expanding campaigns against the West and the United States in particular.
        Criticism of Mr. Byroade's effectiveness in Cairo was heard with growing frequency in Eisenhower Administration circles in the last few months before it was made public, in July, 1956, that he was going to South Africa.
        In the previous month, Dr. Emanuel Neumann, the chairman of the executive committee of the Zionist Organization of America, urged that Mr. Byroade be removed from Cairo. He said Mr. Byroade had been "long an apologist" for the Egyptian Government.
        His 1937 marriage to Mary K. Richard, ended in divorce in 1961. He was married to Jitka Donda Henson in 1962.  In addition to his second wife and their daughter, Mr. Byroade's survivors include three sons from his first marriage, Gene R. of Jacksonville, Fla. and Alan M. and Jon D., both of Arlington, Va.; two stepsons, John D. Henson and Mark D. Henson, both of Mesa, Ariz.; two grandchildren and four stepgrandchildren.
