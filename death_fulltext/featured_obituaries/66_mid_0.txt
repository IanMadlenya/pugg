        Shirley Greengrass, a partner with her husband in Barney Greengrass, a Manhattan restaurant and delicatessen that has been in existence for nearly 90 years, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Greengrass died of cancer, said a son, Gary, president of the family-run business at 541 Amsterdam Avenue, near 86th Street.
        Born in Norwich, Conn., Mrs. Greengrass grew up in Bayonne, N.J. She and Mr. Greengrass, the son of the original owner, were married in 1956. Mr. Greengrass's first name is Barney, as his father's was, but he is known as Moe by family, friends and customers.
        Like her husband and his father before him, Mrs. Greengrass was a fixture in the restaurant and known to hundreds of regular customers from the neighborhood and elsewhere.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Greengrass is survived by two sons, Gary, and Barney, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Sylvia Greene, of Saddle Brook, N.J., and Marian Diamond, of Highland Park, N.J.; a brother, William Liebman, of Bayonne, N.J., and two grandchildren.
        Correction:  July 21, 1992, Tuesday
        An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Greengrass, a partner with her husband in Barney Greengrass, a Manhattan restaurant and delicatessen, misidentified her husband. He is Moe Greengrass; his father, Barney Greengrass, founded the business.
