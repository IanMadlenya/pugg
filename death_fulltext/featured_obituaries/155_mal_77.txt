        Sidney Alexander, the author of 15 books on Renaissance history and art, as well as novels, poetry, plays and criticism, died on Dec. 11 at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 87.
        Among his major works were the biography ''Marc Chagall'' (1978)  and his three-volume historical novel consisting of ''Michelangelo the Florentine'' (1957), ''The Hand of Michelangelo'' (1967) and ''Nicodemus'' (1984), all based on the life of the artist.
        Writing in The New York Times Book Review, James R. Mellow praised the Chagall biography for its ''caustic verve'' and depiction of a ''difficult, vital and tarnished figure.''
        The Michelangelo novel received mixed reviews, but Mr. Alexander's translations were warmly praised. The American Literary Translators Association honored his ''Complete Poems of Michelangelo'' (1991) as the outstanding literary translation of 1991, and his rendering of Francesco Guicciardini's ''History of Italy'' (1969) received the PEN Award for Translation in 1970.
        There was also critical praise for his most recent work, a translation of Horace's ''Odes and Satires'' (1999). Bryn Mawr Classical Review said it ''caps a distinguished and versatile life of writing.''
        Born in New York, Mr. Alexander graduated from Columbia University in 1934. In the 1950's he settled in Florence, Italy, where he lived for more than 30 years, first as a cultural correspondent for The Reporter magazine and later as a resident scholar. In 1983 he moved to Richmond.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances.
