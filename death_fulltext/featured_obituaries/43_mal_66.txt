        Mr. Ellis joined the staff of the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, in 1935 and remained with the agency until 1957. From 1957 to 1960, he worked for Chief Justice Earl Warren as deputy director of the Federal court system.
        He was born in Petoskey, Mich., and graduated from Hillsdale College. He moved to Washington in 1929 and graduated from George Washington University Law School, where he also received a master's degree in law.
        In 1960, Mr. Ellis was named administrative law judge at the Federal Power Commission, a post he held until he retired in 1978.
        He is survived by two children, Amy Foster Ellis and William Leigh Ellis Jr., both of Bronxville, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
