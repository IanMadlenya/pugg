        Edward Kleban, the Tony Award-winning lyricist of ''A Chorus Line,'' died Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Kleban's death was caused by complications from cancer of the mouth, according to his attorney, Allen Stein.
        Mr. Kleban, who was born in New York City and graduated from Columbia University, produced records for Columbia Records in Los Angeles before returning to New York in the late 1960's to work in the theater.
        In 1974, he collaborated with Marvin Hamlisch, the composer, on the songs for ''A Chorus Line.'' The musical, which has played for more than 12 years, won a Pulitzer Prize and earned Mr. Kleban a Tony Award in 1976 for best lyrics.
        ''I remember talking to a friend the week before it opened,'' Mr. Kleban said in 1983, at the time of the musical's record-breaking 3,389th performance. ''I'd been paid $500 for my whole year's work, and I said I didn't know if that would be it or if I'd make a fortune.''
        Mr. Kleban taught for many years with the B.M.I. Musical Theater Workshop, a series of classes for lyricists, librettists and composers associated with Broadcast Music Inc., the music-licensing firm. He worked on other theatrical projects, including ''Gallery,'' an unstaged 1981 Public Theater production, and he wrote two new songs - with Mr. Hamlisch - for the film version of ''A Chorus Line.''
        Mr. Kleban is survived by his father, Julian Kleban of New York City, and a sister, Toby Levine of Potomac, Md.
