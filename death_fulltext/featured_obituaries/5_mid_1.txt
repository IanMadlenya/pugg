        The former sister-in-law of former Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada has been found dead on the banks of the Napa River, an apparent suicide, officials say.
        Katherine Laxalt, 52 years old, was identified by a driver's license found at the scene, said Napa County's chief deputy coroner, Jim York. Two fisherman found the body on Tuesday.
        Investigators discovered several notes and a tape in Mrs. Laxalt's car at a nearby motel where she had been staying, Mr. York said. He added that the messages said that ''she was tired and couldn't take it any more.''
        Tests to determine the exact cause of death will be completed in about two weeks, Mr. York said.
        Mrs. Laxalt was married to the former Senator's brother Peter from 1956 to 1977. She had four children.
