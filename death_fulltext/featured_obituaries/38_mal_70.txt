        Carl Bailey, a principal dancer and a teacher with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, died on Tuesday at Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital in Detroit. He was 35 years old.
        His death was from respiratory complications during treatment for tuberculosis, Dr. Steven Vaughn, Mr. Bailey's physician, said.
        Mr. Bailey performed with the Ailey company for 10 years. A dancer of quiet authority, he was featured in such ballets as ''For Bird - With Love'' and ''Revelations,'' both by Mr. Ailey, and in Elisa Monte's ''Treading,'' Billy Wilson's ''Concerto in F'' and Ulysses Dove's ''Bad Blood.''
        Mr. Bailey was born in Detroit, and studied with the Detroit City Dance Company, with whom he also performed. He also trained with Fred Benjamin and at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center and Connecticut College. Mr. Bailey performed with the Pauline Koner Dance Consort and the Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble, and in the national touring company of ''The Wiz'' and with ''Disney on Parade'' before joining the Ailey senior company in 1979. Last year, he received a proclamation from the city of Detroit in recognition of his accomplishments.
        He is survived by his parents, Theodore and Irma James; a brother, Anthony Bailey, and a sister, Margaret Ann Rogers, all of Detroit.
