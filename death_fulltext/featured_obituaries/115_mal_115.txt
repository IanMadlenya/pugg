        John Moore, a fashion designer of the 1950's and 60's who was best known for designing Lady Bird Johnson's 1965 inaugural gown, died on Wednesday in Alice, Tex. He was 68 and lived in Alice.
        The cause was complications from a liver ailment.
        A protege of Norman Norell, Mr. Moore graduated from the Parsons School of Design in New York in 1950 and worked as a designer for Elizabeth Arden, Jane Derby and Mattie Talmack before opening his own business in 1963. He also designed for many private clients including Angela Lansbury, Lisa Kirk and Marilyn Monroe, achieving a notoriety of sorts when the strap of Monroe's dress broke as she was signing the contract to appear in the film ''The Prince and the Showgirl.'' He also designed the dress Monroe wore at her marriage Arthur Miller.
        He won several fashion awards including the Coty American Fashion Critics Award in 1953. The yellow satin dress and coat with sable cuffs that Mrs. Johnson wore to her husband's inaugural ball is in the Smithsonian Institution. Mr. Moore's designs are also in the permanent costume collections of several other museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Moore was born on Feb. 21, 1928, in Wilson, Okla., to John E. Moore and Inez Matheny Moore. He grew up in Alice, where his parents ran a lumber yard and appliance store. In the late 1970's Mr. Moore turned the store in an antiques shop, which he ran until his death.
        There are no immediate survivors.
