        Bob Allen, a bandleader and singer, died of throat cancer on Monday at his home in Stockton, Calif. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Allen was a singer with the Hal Kemp Orchestra, a popular band that appeared in fashionable nightclubs throughout the United States and Europe, and on radio during the 1930's. In 1940, he formed his own group, the Bob Allen Orchestra, which performed such songs as ''Whispers in the Dark'' and ''Got a Date With an Angel'' for several years at the Rosemont Ballroom in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Allen later sang with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra and the Carmen Cavallaro Band. He became a cabinetmaker in the mid-1950's, but recorded an album of Hal Kemp songs with Keith Ingham last year.
        Mr. Allen is survived by his wife, Maggie; three sons, Bob Jr., Tom and Steve, all of Stockton, and a brother, Charles, of Ontonagon, Mich.
