        Edmund Halsey Kellogg, a retired Foreign Service officer, conservationist and professor emeritus at Vermont Law School, died Friday at the Kendal retirement community in Hanover, N.H. He was 81.
        His family said he had been in declining health after a series of strokes.
        Mr. Kellogg was born in Morristown, N.J. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1934 from Princeton University, studied at the University of Dijon in France and earned his law degree at Harvard Law School. He entered the Foreign Service in 1940.
        In World War II, he served in the United States Army Air Force, rising to major, and worked on aerial photographic intelligence and the top secret Ultra project in England that deciphered the German codes.
        Returning to diplomacy, he held policy-planning positions in Washington and at the United Nations, foreign assignments in Phnom Penh and Dusseldorf and retired in 1969 as an adviser to Secretary of State Dean Rusk on world population.
        Most recently, Mr. Kellogg lectured at Vermont Law School on laws affecting the environment and population planning, reaching emeritus status three years ago. He was a past chairman of the Massachusetts Historical Commission and a founder of the Preservation Trust of Vermont.
        Mr. Kellogg is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Celina Robbins; two daughters, Eliza K. Klose of Washington and Celina K. Moore of North Montpelier, Vt.; two sons, Dr. Roger B., of Montpelier, and Edmund D., of Winchester, Mass.; a sister, Cornelia K. Morris of Oyster Bay, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
