        David K. Kadane, a law professor and a former general counsel for the Long Island Lighting Company, died on Saturday at his home in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 77 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Kadane was the Harry H. Rains Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the Hofstra University School of Law. He was a member of the school's faculty when it was established in 1970 and was the first director of its Neighborhood Law Office, which serves low-income clients.
        He was a graduate of City College and Harvard Law School. From 1936 to 1938, he was assistant counsel to the United States Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, and from 1938 to 1946 he was assistant director of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        He joined Lilco in 1946 and was its counsel until 1970. From 1964 to 1966, he took a leave to serve in the Peace Corps, helping local governments in East Africa establish legal institutions, draft laws and train lawyers.
        Though retired at Hofstra, Mr. Kadane continued to teach there and also at the Queens College School of Law.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helene Born; a son, Joseph, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Kathryn Crane of Seattle, and three grandsons.
