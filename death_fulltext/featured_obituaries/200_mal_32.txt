        James J. Crisona, a Democrat who served successively in New York State's Assembly and Senate, as borough president of Queens and as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, died on Thursday at the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home in Manhattan. He was 96 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Crisona's political career was in Queens, but he practiced law in Manhattan from 1945 to 1957. He resumed his law practice after he stepped down from the bench.
        Mr. Crisona was born in New York City on Aug. 30, 1907. He received a bachelor's degree in 1928 and a law degree in 1931, both from New York University.
        He went on to practice corporate and other kinds of law in New York City and was the senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Crisona Brothers from 1945 to 1957. During some of those years, he did legal work in the railroad industry.
        Concurrently, he was elected to the State Assembly in 1946 from a constituency in Queens and to the State Senate in 1955, also from Queens.
        A popular figure, he was elected borough president of Queens in 1957 while he was running his law firm. He took office in 1958, and not long afterward he was also elected Democratic leader of Queens at a special meeting of the Queens Democratic Executive Committee.
        But he stepped down as borough president and went on the New York State Supreme Court bench in 1959, serving until 1976.
        In subsequent years he served on the boards of directors of money funds and mutual funds in addition to practicing law.
        His wife of 55 years, Claire Peysson Crisona, died in 1990.
        He is survived by two daughters, Claire Cascella and Cynthia Crisona; two granddaughters; and four great-grandchildren.
