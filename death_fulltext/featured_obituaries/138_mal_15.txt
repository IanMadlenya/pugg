        Richard A. Orange Jr., a management consultant who used his knowledge and love of jazz to help executives see the strength of improvisation and teamwork, died June 4 at New York University Hospital. He was 48 years old.
        The cause of death was a stroke, said his sister, Taur.
        Mr. Orange formed his own company, Richard A. Orange Jr. Associates, in New York to help clients deal with such issues as diversity and work better with middle managers.
        He drew on his experience of growing up in a working-class Bronx community as a black child for insights on how to bring African-Americans into executive positions.
        After participating in a diversity conference organized by Mr. Orange, Charles K. Gifford, the chairman and chief executive of the BankBoston Corporation, wrote in The Boston Globe: ''At the end of the week, I had been enriched and stretched by seeing beneath the surface of colleagues to their backgrounds and their stories, to their burdens and their joys.''
        Among his clients were the DuPont Company and BankBoston.
        He earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Queens College and a master's degree in social psychology from the New School for Social Research.
        He was a member of the Portsmouth Consulting Group, a group of senior consultants who met three times a year to share experiences.
        He was also a trainer of consultants at the NTL Institute for Applied Behavioral Science.
        In addition to his sister, Mr. Orange is survived by his wife, Trudy; his companion, Dr. E. Joyce Buchanan of New York; a daughter, Courtney, of New York, and his father Richard, of New York.
