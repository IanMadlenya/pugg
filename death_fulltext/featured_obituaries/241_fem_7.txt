        Hortense Kooluris, a longtime performer, teacher and lecturer on Isadora Duncan and her dances and the last surviving early exponent of Duncan's art, died on Feb. 8 at her home in Stuart, Fla. She was 92.
        Her death was confirmed by Michael Gotkin, a cousin.
        Ms. Kooluris was the last great exponent of Duncan dance of her generation, and the last surviving pupil of Irma Duncan, one of the ''Isadorables,'' young girls trained and adopted by Isadora Duncan. Ms. Kooluris once said she would like to be remembered as ''one of the chosen ones to live and die in Isadora's beautiful art.''
        Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Kooluris was encouraged by her family to study dance and music and began training in ballet as a child. In her early teens, she began to study with Anita Zahn, who had learned Duncan technique from Duncan's sister, Elizabeth.
        At 15, Ms. Kooluris began performing with a company organized by Irma Duncan. She danced with the group from 1930 to 1933, after which she continued to study the technique and perform in Duncan programs and lecture-demonstrations in New York City and internationally.
        She was the principal dancer in video recordings of the original Duncan choreography in the archives of the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
        Ms. Kooluris continued to dance into her mid-80s, until she was in an automobile accident.
        In 1977 she formed the critically well-received Isadora Duncan Centenary Dance Company with her friend and colleague, Julia Levien, another noted Duncan teacher, who died last year. Ms. Kooluris taught master classes in Duncan technique at several universities.
        Ms. Kooluris's husband, Spyros George Kooluris, died in 1984. She is survived by her daughter, Linda Kooluris Dobbs of Toronto; her son, G. Kirby Kooluris of Stuart, Fla.; and her sisters, Judy Stark and Myra Lanigan of Manhattan.
