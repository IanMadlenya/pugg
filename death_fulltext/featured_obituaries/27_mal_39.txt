        From 1948 to 1955 Professor Albertson assisted Allan Nevins, the Columbia historian who conceived the project to interview top people in government, business and the arts and collect documents from them to preserve current history. He later taught at Brooklyn College before becoming a history professor at the University of Massachusetts.
        He was born in Denver and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of California at Berkeley and a doctorate at Columbia. He served as an air officer for the Navy in World War II.
        Professor Albertson is survived by his wife, Eve Spangler; a son, Mark, of Sunnyvale, Calif.; a daughter, Constant, of Hudson, Ontario, and a granddaughter.
