        Sebastian de Grazia, a political philosopher and Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, died on Sunday in Princeton, N.J. He was 83.
        Professor de Grazia, who taught political philosophy at Rutgers University from 1962 to 1988, won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for biography for his book ''Machiavelli in Hell'' (1989, Vintage), about the Renaissance  statesman and author.
        After winning the prize, Professor de Grazia was asked why he had chosen the title ''Machiavelli in Hell.'' He laughed and said: ''I did not consign him to hell. If anything, I helped let him out of it.''
        His book ''A Country With No Name: Tales From the Constitution'' (1997, Pantheon) was called by Publishers Weekly ''a freewheeling, irreverent romp through American history.'' His other books include ''Of Time, Work and Leisure'' (1962), in which he contended that there was no leisure, or only trifling amounts of it, in the United States.
        He was born in Chicago and received a bachelor's degree and a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago. During World War II he served in the Office of Strategic Services in Washington.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucia; a daughter, Margreta de Grazia of Philadelphia; four sons: Alfred Joseph III of Wilmington, Del.; Sebastian Jr., and Marco, both of Florence, Italy; and Tancredi, of Fortaleza, Brazil; and three brothers: Alfred Joseph, of Princeton; Edward, of Manhattan; and Victor, of Chicago.
