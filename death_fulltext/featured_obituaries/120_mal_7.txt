        Bradley D. Nash, an Eisenhower Administration figure who went on to be co-author of a highly praised book about improving the executive branch of Government, died on Wednesday in a hospital in Ranson, W.Va. He was 96 and lived in Harpers Ferry, W.Va.
        From 1927 to 1929, Mr. Nash was an aide to Herbert Hoover, then the Commerce Secretary under President Calvin Coolidge. Later Mr. Nash was financial adviser to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and to the War Production Board and held other Government posts.
        Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from 1953 to 1961, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and then Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce.
        He collaborated with Cornelius Lynde in writing ''A Hook in Leviathan: A Critical Interpretation of the Hoover Commission Report,'' a 1950 book about recommendations made by the 1947-1949 Hoover Commission, which Congress had authorized to appraise the executive branch of government.
        The panel, which was headed by Hoover, the President from 1929 to 1933. recommended many changes that were carried out, among them was founding the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
        Mr. Nash was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard in 1923. He was also a banker and, much later, the Mayor of Harpers Ferry.
        His marriage to Elaine Hoffman in 1942 ended in divorce. He married Ruth Cowan in 1956, and she died in 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia J. Ingram; a stepdaughter, Lucy Hoffman Webb of Washington, and four step-grandchildren.
