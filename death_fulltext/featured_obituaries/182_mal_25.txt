        Leon Mandel III, an influential figure in the auto industry as editor in chief and publisher of AutoWeek magazine, died on Tuesday at his home in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. He was 73.
        He had leukemia, Crain Communications Inc., the parent company of AutoWeek, said in announcing his death.
        At his death, Mr. Mandel was publisher emeritus of AutoWeek, which grew during his two decades there and had a circulation of 350,000 in November 2001.
        A sister publication, Crain's Detroit Business, said that month that AutoWeek was the largest weekly consumer car magazine in the country.
        Mr. Mandel was also a vice president of Crain Communications.
        Mr. Mandel wrote and reported about the world of cars for four decades. He became influential in his field because of his expertise and experience and because of the witty, biting way he expressed his views on the global automobile industry in his weekly column, ''Jaundiced Eye,'' in AutoWeek; in books about the world of cars; and in a weekly television program, ''AutoWeek on Speedvision.''
        He went to work for Crain Communications in 1983 as editor in chief of AutoWeek and held that post until 1988, when he became its publisher.
        He was succeeded as publisher in November by Rich Ceppos but remained an AutoWeek columnist and contributor.
        He was the author or co-author of six books, including ''American Cars,'' a history of the domestic auto industry.
        Under Mr. Mandel, AutoWeek, which was founded in 1957, was a training ground for numerous automotive journalists. He delighted in demonstrating, hands on, the characteristics of cars at auto shows.
        Mr. Mandel kept in touch with the vagaries of the car market. He reported last year on a survey of readers about the most important considerations in choosing a car.
        ''At the top of the list was performance,'' he said. ''At the bottom was fuel mileage. Fuel mileage just hasn't registered with Americans for a long time.''
        He received the Automotive Hall of Fame 2000 Distinguished Service Citation.
        Leon Mandel III was born in Chicago and grew up there and in New York City. He attended Cornell and sold cars for 15 years at a dealership in San Francisco. He got his start in journalism on a weekly newspaper in Northern California and went on to work for Motor Trend and Car and Driver.
        His wife, Olivia, died earlier.
        He is survived by a son, Dutch, who is editor and associate publisher of AutoWeek and lives in Grosse Pointe, Mich.; a daughter, Olivia MacLeod of Portland, Ore.; and five grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary last Friday about Leonard Mandel III, publisher emeritus of AutoWeek magazine, omitted attribution for his observation about how some Americans choose cars. It was in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle that Mr. Mandel said of a survey in his magazine: ''At the top of the list it was performance. At the bottom was fuel mileage. Fuel mileage just hasn't registered with Americans for a long time.''
