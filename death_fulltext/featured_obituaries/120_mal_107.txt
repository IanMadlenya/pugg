        Malcolm Pirnie Jr., a former chairman of the environmental consulting company Malcolm Pirnie Inc.  in White Plains, died on Jan. 18 in Winter Park, Fla. He was 79 and lived in Winter Park.
        The cause was heart failure, a spokeswoman for the company said.
        Mr. Pirnie, who was chairman from 1970 until his retirement in 1987, helped expand his father's company into one of the largest of its kind, with more than 1,000 employees at 36 offices. The company has been involved in a number of projects in the New York area. In 1992, for example, officials of the New York City water system hired the company to prepare a plan to combat harmful zebra mussels in case the mussels showed up in reservoirs supplying the city's water. Mr. Pirnie received both bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering from Harvard University, working briefly in his father's business between undergraduate and graduate school.
        Beginning in 1941, he spent four years as an officer in the United States Public Health Service. He returned to Malcolm Pirnie Engineers in 1945, became a partner in 1952 and was elected chairman when the company was incorporated in 1970.
        Mr. Pirnie lived in Scarsdale, N.Y., until his retirement, when he moved to Florida.
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah; a son, Malcolm Pirnie 3d of Boston; a daughter, Pamela Grayson of Westport, Conn., and three grandchildren.
