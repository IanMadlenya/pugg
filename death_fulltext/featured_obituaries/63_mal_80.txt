        Walter D. Engels, the first news director at WPIX television and an innovator in that field, died on Sunday at his home in Hampton Bays, L.I. He was 80 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Engels worked as a photographer at The Daily News beginning in 1934 and won awards for his work. In 1948 he was made newsreel editor at the newspaper's affiliated television station. In 1952 WPIX promoted him to director of news, special events and live programming. He continued in that post for 18 years.
        He won an award for producing the first televised United States Senate hearings, held by Senator Estes Kefauver. WPIX overcame an initial court ruling prohibiting that broadcast. The station also televised United Nations sessions. Producer of Documentaries
        Mr. Engels produced several documentaries, including "The Secret Life of Adolph Hitler," "Cuba, Castro and Communism" and "Evita Peron," scenes of which were used in the Broadway musical, "Evita."
        Mr. Engels retired in 1970 after Federal Communications Commission hearings criticized WPIX for mislabeling some news film as satellite transmissions, misstating the locations of some foreign correspondents and not specifying that some news film was a few days old. The station said any mistakes were inadvertent. Service in Navy
        Mr. Engels, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Columbia University and also studied at the London School of Economics. In World War II he served in the United States Navy as a military Government officer in Okinawa.
        His wife of 49 years, the former Veronica Mary Thomas, died about five years ago.
        He is survived by a son, Walter J., of Garden City, L.I.; three daughters, Joan A. Engels-Kroll of Manhattan, Gail Mon Pere of Ukiah, Calif., and Jennifer Howland of Los Angeles; a sister, Dorothy L. Klock of Pittsfield, Mass., and seven granddaughters.
