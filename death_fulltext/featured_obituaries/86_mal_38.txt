        Roy Kenneth (Ken) Fairman, an illustrious Princeton athlete of the 1930's who then served as the university's director of athletics for 32 years, died yesterday at the Medical Center of Princeton. He was 82 and a resident of Princeton Borough.
        The cause of death was a stroke, a university spokesman said.
        Mr. Fairman was involved in the growth of a program that, by his retirement in 1972, had 50 varsity teams competing in 21 different sports plus an intramural program involving 65 percent of the undergraduates.  Top Athlete in His Class
        Mr. Fairman came to Princeton in 1930 as a freshman from Syracuse. When he graduated four years later he had won eight varsity letters and the Poe Cup as the foremost athlete in his class. There were three letters in football, the last as an end on the undefeated team of 1933; three in basketball and two in lacrosse. He was captain of the basketball team and became the varsity coach one year following his graduation.
        In 1937, Mr. Fairman was appointed the acting graduate manager of athletics, succeeding Asa S. Bushnell, who had resigned to direct the new organization that became the Eastern College Athletic Conference. His permanent appointment overseeing the school's athletic program came in 1941.
        After service an an Army officer and tank commander in World War II, Mr. Fairman returned to Princeton in 1945 and became an early advocate of formal Ivy League play, which began in 1956.
        He served as Mayor of the Township of Princeton from 1959 to 1963 and as the first president of the Princeton Council of Community Services.
        He is survived by his wife, Adra Armitage Fairman; a son, Hugh S., of Sparta, N.J.,; a daughter, Lisa Heher of Princeton; a sister, Claris Schwing of Palmyra, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
