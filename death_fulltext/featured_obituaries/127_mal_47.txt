        Rudolf Lewis Baer, a dermatologist who spent nearly 50 years on the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine, 20 as department chairman, died on July 31 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 87.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Baer was the George Miller MacKee professor and chairman of the department of dermatology from 1961 to 1981, after which he continued to teach, do research and see patients until his stroke. The N.Y.U. Medical Center endowed a Rudolf L. Baer Professorship in 1986.
        He undertook research in many aspects of dermatology and influenced a generation of specialists in biochemistry and immunology.
        Rudolf Baer was born in Strasbourg, Alsace, when it was part of Germany. He received his medical degree from the University of Basel in 1934. Postgraduate work took him to N.Y.U. He completed his training at Montefiore Medical Center and was on the faculty of Columbia University until he joined the N.Y.U. School of Medicine in 1948.
        Dr. Baer's wife of 53 years, Louise Grumbach Baer, died in 1994, and a son, Andrew R., died on July 28. He is survived by another son, John R., of Dallas; a sister, Eva, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
