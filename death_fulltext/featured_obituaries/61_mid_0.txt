        Elizabeth Lapchick, the widow of the legendary New York basketball player and coach Joe Lapchick, died early yesterday morning at her home in Milton, Mass. She was 87 years old and had been ill for a long time, her family said.
        Mrs. Lapchick was married for 41 years to Joe Lapchick, who played pro basketball for 20 years, including a stint with the original Celtics. He coached the Knicks for 10 years and the St. John's University team for 20 years.
        They lived and raised their family in Yonkers, N.Y., as Mr. Lapchick fashioned one of the most notable basketball careers in New York, on his way to being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. After he died in 1970, Mrs. Lapchick lived in Yonkers and then in Virginia, and finally moved to Massachusetts to live with her son Richard.
        St. John's will establish an Elizabeth Lapchick Award honoring a scholar-athlete.
        In addition to Richard, she is survived by her son, Joseph, and a daughter, Barbara.
