        Theo Crosby, an architect and a founding partner of Pentagram, an international design company, died on Monday in London, where he lived. He was 67.
        He died in surgery for a lung infection, Pentagram said.
        Mr. Crosby was the architect for a reconstruction of the Globe Theater that is being built in London on the South Bank of the Thames River. His recent work also included the refurbishment of the interior of the Barbican Center in London.
        Mr. Crosby, a native of South Africa, earned a degree in architecture at the University of the Witswatersrand in Johannesburg, then moved to England. He worked for several architects before becoming an editor of the magazine Architectural Design. In 1964, he won the top prize at the Milan Triennale, the Olympics of the design world. In 1972, he became a founding partner of Pentagram, which has offices in London, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong and Austin, Tex.
        He was a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and of the Berlin Academy, as well as a fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers and Royal Academicians. He was the author of "Architecture: City Sense" (1965), which deals with the problems of urban planning.
        Mr. Crosby is survived by his wife, Polly, and a daughter, Dido, of London.
