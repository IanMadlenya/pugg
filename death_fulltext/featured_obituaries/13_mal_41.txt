        F. Vernon Foster, a New York stockbroker for more than 70 years, died of complications following a blood infection last Sunday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Foster, who was active in the family brokerage firm, Foster & Company, until mid-January, was a 1915 graduate of Cornell University. He joined his father on Wall Street in a firm that was one of the early block traders.
        When the United States entered World War I, he enlisted in the Army and became a first lieutenant in the Air Service. After winning two dogfights with German planes, he was shot down and captured in September 1918 and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner.
        Returning home in 1919, he bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and soon became a specialist, forming his own firm, of which he remained a general partner until his death. He was a trader on the floor of the exchange until the late 1960's.
        Mr. Foster is survived by his wife, the former Doris Warland; a daughter, Amanda Washburn of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Glen, of Manhattan; a stepson, Michael Conger of New Vernon, N.J., three grandchildren and two step-grandchildren.
