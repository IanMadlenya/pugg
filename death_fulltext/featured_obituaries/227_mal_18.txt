        Harold D. Shapiro, a partner in the law firm of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal and its first chairman, died last Thursday in Evanston, Ill. He was 78 and lived in Wilmette, Ill.
        His death was announced on the Web site of the firm. The cause was a ruptured aneurysm.
        Mr. Shapiro oversaw the coast-to-coast expansion of the law firm, where he practiced for more than 53 years, and was its chairman from 1985 to 1990. For most of his tenure at Sonnenschein, his main client was the Allstate Insurance Company, once part of Sears, Roebuck. He also handled an intricate financial arrangement in the early 1990's on the Sears Tower in Chicago, which provided Sears with an increase in liquidity of about $850 million, roughly the value of the building.
        Harold David Shapiro was born on the West Side of Chicago on April 15, 1927. He served with the Seabees in the Philippines in World War II before graduating in 1949 from Northwestern University, where he received his law degree in 1952. He lectured at Northwestern's law school for many years and was named senior Harriman adjunct professor in 1971.
        He worked briefly for Gov. Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois before joining Sonnenschein in 1952 and remained active in Democratic politics as well as in Chicago civic groups and charities.
        Mr. Shapiro is survived by his wife of 55 years, Beatrice Cahn Shapiro; two sons, Matthew D., of Wilmette, and Nicholas J., of Columbia, Mo.; a daughter, Michal Ann Shapiro; a sister, Barbara F. Schmetterer, of La Porte, Ind.; and three grandchildren.
