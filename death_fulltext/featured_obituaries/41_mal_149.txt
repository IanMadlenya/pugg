        A union spokesman said the cause of death was heart failure.
        Mr. Addes was born in La Crosse, Wis., and went to work at the Willys Overland plant in Toledo, Ohio, when he was 17 years old. In the early 1930's he was active in organizing efforts among auto workers and when the U.A.W. was chartered in 1935 he became a full-time organizer.
        He was the first elected secretary-treasurer of the union, and was re-elected to 10 more one-year terms before losing to Emil Mazey in 1947. He later worked for the Ford Motor Company and retired in 1975.
        Mr. Addes is survived by his wife, the former Gloria Saba; three daughters, Cindy Madron of Ontario, Calif., Joyce Chaffee of Grosse Pointe Woods, Mich., and Corinne Jarett of Sterling Heights, Mich.; a brother, John, of Toledo; two sisters, Mary, of Detroit, and Jeanette Karam of St. Clair Shores. and three grandchildren.
