        Abbot J. Copeland, a retired textile executive who worked in Manhattan for 44 years, died on Feb. 18 at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 88.
        The cause was the effects of old age, said his son Denis K. Copeland.
        Mr. Copeland spent his entire career in the garment business with United Merchants and Manufacturers Inc., a major distributor of fabric and yarn. He retired as executive vice president in 1972.
        He is survived by two sons, Denis K. and Michael J., both of Manhattan, and a brother, Arthur, of Sarasota.
