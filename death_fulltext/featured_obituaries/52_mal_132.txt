        Agehananda Bharati, a Hindu monk and the Ford-Maxwell Professor of South Asian Studies at Syracuse University, died on Tuesday at the home of a friend in Pittsford, N.Y. He was 68 years old and lived in Syracuse.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the university said.
        Professor Bharati, who joined the Syracuse faculty in 1961, was chairman of the department of anthropology from 1971 to 1977 and was its acting chairman in 1985.
        Before coming to Syracuse, he taught lingustics, comparative philosophy, anthropology and South Asian studies at universities and institutions in India, Japan, Thailand and the United States. In 1987, he received a Fulbright scholarship to teach in West Germany.  Born in Vienna
        Born in Vienna on April 20, 1923, as Leopold Fischer, he adopted the name Agehananda Bharati in 1951, when he was ordained in the Dasanami Sannyasi order of Hindu monks. His interest in Indian culture began in his youth when he learned classical Sanskrit and Hindi. He served with the German Army's Free India Legion and after World War II he went to India and entered a monastery.
        After he was ordained, the 6-foot, 7-inch swami was given a beggar's bowl and traveled throughout India as a mendicant monk. For the next five years he continued his studies and taught German, philosophy and comparative religion before coming to the United States in 1956. He became a United States citizen in 1968.
        He was the author of four books, including "The Ochre Robe," his autobiography (Ross-Erickson Press, 1980).
        He is survived by a brother, Hans Fischer of Vienna. His companion was Rita Narang of Rochester.
