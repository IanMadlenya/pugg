        Edward E. Lewis, an industrialist who headed the Mutual Security Agency's European production program under the Marshall Plan, died on Saturday at his daughter's home in Verona, N.J. He was 98 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his daughter said.
        Mr. Lewis was chairman of the Raymond Rosen Company of Philadelphia, which distributed electronics and appliances. He retired in 1973.
        In the 1950's he worked on finding solutions to production problems in Western Europe as part of the Marshall Plan's rebuilding. Before that, he was president of the Colonial Radio Corporation of Buffalo, and had worked for RCA, General Electric and other electronics companies.
        He is survived by his daughter, Shirley Fader of Verona, five grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
