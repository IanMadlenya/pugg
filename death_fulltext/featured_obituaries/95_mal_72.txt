        Thomas Francis Sutton, a former top executive of the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, died on Dec. 9 at his home in the Cotswolds in England. He was 71.
        The cause of death was cancer, said a spokesman for J. Walter Thompson.
        Mr. Sutton, who was born in Berlin, began his career in 1949 working at the British Market Research Bureau, a Thompson subsidiary. A decade later, he was transferred to the Thompson office in London, where he served as managing director.
        During a period in which advertising agencies were seeking growth by linking overseas affiliates, Mr. Sutton was elected a director and executive vice president of Thompson in 1965. In that role, he led the expansion of the agency into Asia and Latin America.
        In 1972, when he was 49, Mr. Sutton had major cancer surgery and stepped down as a director and executive vice president. He moved to the Tokyo office, where he managed the Unilever and De Beers business accounts. In 1983, he retired from the Thompson company and moved to England, where he lived until his death.
        Mr. Sutton is survived by his wife, Maki. He is also survived by two daughters, Nicola and Alison, and a son, Jonathan, all of the London area.
