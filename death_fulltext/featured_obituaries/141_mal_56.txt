        Jacques Abram, a pianist who performed regularly as a recitalist and concerto soloist in New York in the 1940's and 50's, died in Tampa, Fla., on Oct. 5. He was 83.
        Mr. Abram was known for performances that combined virtuosity and precision with a modernist's interpretive coolness. He was praised for the chiseled details he brought out in works by Scarlatti, Haydn, Beethoven and Chopin, and he introduced contemporary works, notably the Britten Piano Concerto and solo works by Norman Dello Joio. He gave the Britten its American premiere in Salt Lake City in 1948, and its first New York performance, with Stokowski conducting, in 1949.
        He was born in Lufkin, Tex. He began improvising at the piano when he was 3 and performed publicly when he was 6. During his tours, he was heard by Rachmaninoff and Paderewski, who urged his parents to enroll him at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he became a student of Ernest Hutcheson.  He studied at Curtis until he was 13, then with Josef Hofmann and David Saperton at Juilliard.
        In 1937, Mr. Abram won the National Federation of Music Clubs' Schubert Memorial Award for young artists. He made his New York debut as a soloist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, and also played with the New York Philharmonic.
        In the 1950's he was an artist in residence at the University of Toronto and the Royal Conservatory of Music, also in Toronto. He moved to Tampa, Fla., in 1963.
        He is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Washington and Gregory, of Croton, N.Y.; a daughter, Nell Abram of Tampa, and a brother, Lynwood Abram of Louisville, Ky.
