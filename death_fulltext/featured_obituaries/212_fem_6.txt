        Jessie V. Stone, a philanthropist who was the widow of W. Clement Stone, the insurance magnate known for his optimistic books and speeches on success, died on Sept. 3 at her home in Winnetka, Ill. She was 100.
        Mrs. Stone's death, exactly two years after her husband's, was announced by their son, Norman.
        Mrs. Stone was a founder and board member of the W. Clement and Jessie V. Stone Foundation, which makes grants for education and child development. The foundation, financed entirely by Mr. and Mrs. Stone's contributions, has donated more than $200 million, said Sandra Treacy, its executive director.
        Jessie Verna Tarson was born in Chicago on Oct. 30, 1903, and became a longtime advocate of volunteerism. She was the first president of the Women's Auxiliary of the Robert R. McCormick Boys Club (now the Boys and Girls Club) in Chicago and volunteered for decades at the Chicago Maternity Center. She later worked with a group now known as Prevent Child Abuse America, created by her daughter, Donna J. Stone, who died in 1985.
        In addition to her son, a psychologist who serves as the foundation's president, Mrs. Stone is survived by 12 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. An older son, Clement, died in 1986.
