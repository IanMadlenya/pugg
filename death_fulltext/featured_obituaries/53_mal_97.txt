        Saul Jeffee, retired chairman and president of Movielab Inc., a New York concern, now defunct, that developed and printed motion-picture and video films, died Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Jeffee died of congestive heart failure, his wife, Beatrice, said.
        He was the founding vice chairman of the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1969 and remained in the post until 1987. He was also a leader in the Anti-Defamation League from the early 1950's. He retired in 1988.
        Mr. Jeffee, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., collected a library of historical motion picture inventions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He gave it to the Margaret Herrick Library of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He also invented a machine that speeded the production of black-and-white television commercials.
        He was the author of "Narcotics: An American Plan" (1966), which put forward a plan to stem drug addiction in the United States through free drugs, free medical treatment and other means.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Kahn, and a daughter, Gail Cohen, of Manhattan.
