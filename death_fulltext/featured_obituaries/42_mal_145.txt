        His studies at the National Cancer Institute led to use of cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, two chemotherapy drugs that are still used worldwide.
        Dr. Decker also made inroads in the treatment of cancer of the uterine lining and cervical cancer.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; four children, a sister and four granchildren.
