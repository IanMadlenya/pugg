        Robert Brown, an ex-convict who drew on his experiences to help law-enforcement authorities combat juvenile prostitution in Times Square in the 1970's and 1980's, died on Tuesday in Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        His family said he had suffered from a long illness.
        An orphan who spent his childhood in various institutions and foster homes in upstate New York, Mr. Brown was convicted of killing a clerk in a robbery in a Broadway hotel in 1948. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.
        With the help of a chaplain and a therapist, Mr. Brown rehabilitated himself while serving 23 years in state prisons. After his release in 1971, he became active in the Fortune Society, a self-help organization based in Manhattan that operates with public and private financing.
        In the numerous talks that he gave to community groups on behalf of the society, he drew on his experiences to support his contention that the best way to combat violence was to prevent childhood abuse.
        In 1978, he became an undercover investigator with the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, charged with gathering information on juvenile prostitution and pedophilia in Times Square. He walked the streets at night, unarmed, befriending young runaways. The vivid, detailed reports that he wrote helped to close a large number of businesses that served as fronts for prostitution in the area. He retired in 1989.
        He then turned to writing an autobiography, which he did not finish. He described it as his story of deprivation and rehabilitation and the growth of a conscience.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Natalie Kaplan, and a daughter, Phaedra, of Manhattan.
