        Viktor Tsoi, the lead singer and songwriter for Kino, one of the Soviet Union's most popular rock bands, died in a car crash outside Leningrad on Aug. 15. He was 28 years old.
        Mr. Tsoi, an idol among teen-agers and a star of the Leningrad rock scene, helped start Kino in 1982. The band members, who supported themselves by working as coal miners, performed on an underground circuit not sponsored by the state. Kino, whose first tape was produced by Boris Grebenshikov, the Soviet underground rock idol of the group Aquarium, quickly became popular among teen-age fans eager for black-market tapes.
        In 1986 the band was included on an American compilation of Soviet music, ''Red Wave.'' With the spread of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policies of openness, Kino achieved even greater popularity, since it had never been associated with the Government. The band's most recent album, ''Groupa Kroovy'' (''Blood Type''), recorded in 1987 and released in the United States last year, included a song about the war in Afghanistan, opposing Soviet involvement but supporting the soldiers who fought there involuntarily. ''Groupa Kroovy'' was the group's most popular release.
        Mr. Tsoi had also been featured in the Soviet documentary ''Ya-Ha!'' about the Leningrad rock scene, and he had appeared in a commercial Soviet film, ''The Needle,'' which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah this year. Mr. Tsoi performed with Kino's guitarist at the time of the film's screening. He was about to start work on another film.
        He is survived by a son.
