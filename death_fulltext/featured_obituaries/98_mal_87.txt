        The Rev. Dr. Carl Hermann Voss, a Congregational minister and vocal campaigner for a secure Jewish state, died on Tuesday at his home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 84.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
        During World War II, Dr. Voss founded and led the American Christian Palestine Committee. The group called for a Jewish national state to give refuge to survivors of the Nazi Holocaust.
        To that end, he became a vocal supporter of the partition of Palestine. Once Israel was established, he urged the United States to provide the aid that would enable the new state to absorb the many refugees then arriving. In his speeches, he took the position that Washington and the world were not doing enough.
        He also was a prominent figure in the Church Peace Union and the World Alliance for International Friendship Through the Churches. He traveled extensively for both organizations in this country and overseas. At the end of World War II, Dr. Voss advocated a strong United Nations.
        He served as a minister in Brooklyn; Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C., and Saratoga Springs, N.Y. He also held academic positions at colleges in this country, England, Israel and Switzerland.
        He published several books, two of which remain in print as paperbacks: "Living Religions of the World: Our Search for Meaning" (Prometheus, 1977) and "Rabbi and Minister: The Friendship of Stephen S. Wise and John Haynes Holmes" (Prometheus, 1980), the story of a 42-year alliance of two New York clergymen fighting Tammany Hall, anti-Semitism and racial discrimination.
        Dr. Voss is survived by his wife, Dr. Phyllis G. Voss; a daughter, Carlyn V. Iuzzolino of Albuquerque, N.M.; a stepdaughter, Christina G. Wynings of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a sister, Dorothy C. Grissom of Fort Myers, Fla.; and three grandchildren.
