        William Elliott Burch, a race-horse trainer and the son and grandson of members of horse racing's Hall of Fame, died of cancer on Friday. He was 36 years old and lived in Garden City, L.I.
        Mr. Burch, whose father, Elliott, and grandfather, Preston, were among the most prominent trainers in the history of the sport, was best known for saddling State Dinner to an upset victory over Alydar in the 1979 Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park. The younger Burch, who trained for Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney and owners of other prominent stables, also conditioned the prominent colt Exile King.
        Mr. Burch left racing three years ago to pursue a career in social work and last year received a master's degree from Adelphi University.
        Mr. Burch is survived by his father; a sister, Jan; and two brothers, Richard and Daniel.
