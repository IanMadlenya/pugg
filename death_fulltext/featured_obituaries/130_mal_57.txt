        Michael Patrick Tierney, a Manhattan lawyer who specialized in international antitrust and insurance matters and whose pro bono work put him in the front lines of the anti-abortion movement, died on Nov. 5 at Kennedy International Airport. He collapsed at the airport after arriving from Singapore. He was 53 and lived in Rutherford, N.J.
        The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Christopher Slattery, an associate at the Legal Center for Defense of Life. In 1989, Mr. Tierney helped found the nonprofit center in Manhattan, along with a similar organization in Morristown, N.J.
        At his death he was a partner in the international Wall Street law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel.
        Mr. Tierney was associated with several abortion-related legal cases.  Most recently, he became involved in  Hope v. Perales, a case that forestalled an attempt to broaden abortion rights in New York.
        The 1991 case involved the state's  Prenatal Care Assistance Program, which finances services for women whose incomes are just above the poverty line but high enough to disqualify them for Medicaid.
        The Legislature had not included abortion among the qualified services and thus gave New York a two-tiered system. While Medicaid helps pay for abortions, the prenatal assistance program does not. Abortion rights advocates challenged the arrangement as unconstitutional discrimination against low-income families. Mr. Tierney entered the case to help argue that the Legislature could withhold financing for abortions, and in 1994 the Court of Appeals agreed.
        Mr. Tierney was born in Port Chester, N.Y., and graduated from Manhattan College in 1966. He joined the Cahill law firm in 1969 after graduating from Columbia Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Wiegmann Tierney; their four children, Thomas, Rosemary, Joseph and Elizabeth, all of Rutherford, and a brother, Daniel, of Manhattan.
