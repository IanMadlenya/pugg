        Dr. Menek Goldstein, a professor of neurochemistry, physiology and biophysics at the New York University School of Medicine, died on Oct. 18 at his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was apparently a stroke, said Dr. Mortimer Levitz, a colleague at the school.
        Dr. Goldstein, an expert in the chemistry of neurotransmitters, was noted for research on brain chemistry that added to the understanding of movement disorders like as Parkinson's disease.
        He contributed to the process of synthesizing L-dopa, a chemical that is deficient in Parkinson's disease.
        Born in Poland, Menek Goldstein was sheltered from the Holocaust by a Catholic family in World War II. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Bern in 1955 and worked briefly at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Massachusetts after coming to the United States the next year.
        He joined the staff at N.Y.U. in 1957 as a biochemist and began his academic career as an instructor in 1958. He had worked as a full professor since 1969.
