        Bert Freed, a character actor who appeared in "Detective Story," "Wild in the Streets," "Billy Jack" and about 75 other films, died on Tuesday while on vacation in West Sechelt, British Columbia. He was 74 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Carl.
        Mr. Freed, who was born in the Bronx, earned a bachelor's degree in theater from Pennsylvania State University and began his acting career in New York. Her made his first Broadway appearance in "Johnny Two by Four" in 1942. His other theater credits include "One Touch of Venus" and "A Stone for Danny Fisher."
        His films include "Halls of Montezuma" (1950), "Where the Sidewalk Ends" (1950), "The Desperate Hours" (1955), "Fate Is the Hunter" (1964) and "Norma Rae" (1979). He also appeared in some 200 television shows.
        Mr. Freed served on the board of the Screen Actors Guild from 1969 to 1989, and was first vice president from 1975 to 1977. In 1971 he ran unsuccessfully against John Gavin for the presidency of the union in its first contested election. In a bitter campaign, Mr. Freed accused the guild of being too accommodating in its dealings with studio heads. He ran again in 1977, also unsuccessfully.
        In 1992 he was given the Ralph Morgan Award for service to the guild.
        In addition to his son, of Scarsdale, N.Y., he is survived by his wife, Nancy Lee; a daughter, Jennifer, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a stepson, Andrew Sutton of Tempe, Ariz., and two grandchildren.
