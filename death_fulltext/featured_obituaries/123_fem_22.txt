        Joan Mosenthal DeWind, a psychiatric social worker, who raised butterflies and was a founding member of the Xerces Society, an international organization devoted to the conservation of butterflies, moths and other invertebrates, died on Sunday at her home in Sherman, Conn. She was 82.
        She died from complications arising from childhood polio, her husband said.
        A longtime amateur lepidopterist, Mrs. DeWind specialized in sphinx moths. She helped with the butterfly collection at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan and designed butterfly gardens.
        She was also a founder of the Naromi Land Trust, a nonprofit organization that acquired large tracts of farmland in Sherman, Conn., and preserved it as open space.
        Mrs. DeWind is survived by her husband, Adrian W. DeWind, a New York City lawyer, and by her four children and seven grandchildren.
