        Carlos Bernardo Alemany, the jeweler who spun the surrealistic imagery of Salvador Dali into concoctions of precious metals and stones, died on Sunday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        He suffered a brief illness, said a longtime friend, Justice Bentley Kassal of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.
        A native of Buenos Aires, Mr. Alemany spent the 1930's as conductor of a tango orchestra touring Latin America, Europe and the United States. He settled in New York in the 1940's and learned the jeweler's trade at a company on 47th Street.
        In the 1950's, he met Dali. Mr. Alemany had a workshop in the St. Regis Hotel as a partner in the firm of Alemany & Ertman. He began to translate Dali's visions from canvas to jewelry, chiefly for exhibition, designing and supervising their execution.
        The result was the Salvador Dali Jewel Collection of gem-studded fantasies. Mr. Alemany traveled with the jewels and lectured about them in this country and abroad. Among the collection's noted pieces was his rendition of "Persistence of Memory" (1931), with Dali's soft clocks. The benefit exhibition was sponsored by the Owen Cheatham Foundation.
        The collection was later sold and Mr. Alemany retired in the 1980's when the St. Regis closed for renovation.
