        Rostislav Nebolsine, a civil engineer and a leader in the White Russian community on the East Coast, died on Sunday at his home in Bridgehampton, L.I. He was 90 years old. He died of a heart attack, a grandson, Paul Klebnikov, said.
        Mr. Nebolsine, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, was president of Hydro Technic, an engineering concern that developed high-rate water-filtration systems for the steel industry. He also developed water-supply systems in the United States, South America, Europe and the Far East.
        In the 1970's, he did extensive work on an irrigation and water-supply system for Algeria. He was born in St. Petersburg and immigrated to the United States at the time of the Russian Revolution. He was active in White Russian affairs and supported such groups as the Russian Children's Welfare Society and the Russian Orthodox Theological Fund.
        He is survived by a son, Arcadi, of Manhattan; a daughter, Catherine Coulter of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Helen, of Flushing, Queens, and six other grandchildren.
