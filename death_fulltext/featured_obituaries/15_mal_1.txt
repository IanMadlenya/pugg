        Mr. Barry, who was known as ''Bud,'' spent 35 years in radio and television. He began as an advertising copywriter and in 1937 became a radio announcer for NBC in Boston.

He joined Young & Rubicam in 1959 to take charge of the agency's radio and televison department. In 1964 he was named executive vice president, and in 1970 he retired.
