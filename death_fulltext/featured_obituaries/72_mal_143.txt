        Leonard Lerner, a Manhattan lawyer and advocate of tenant rights, died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 64.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Lerner, who grew up in public housing in Brooklyn, specialized in housing law and practiced for more than 30 years.
        He represented tenants at the Barbizon Hotel for Women when it was converted to a transient tourist hotel and succeeded in preserving some rooms as permanent residences.
        Mr. Lerner was often a lawyer of last resort for cases that other lawyers spurned. For example, he litigated for 18 years in the Roxborough Tenants Association's challenge to the legality of tens of thousands of dollars in rent increases. The day he died, word came that state officials had ruled for the tenants.
        He served as chairman of the New York County Lawyers' Association's Committee on the Civil Court from 1986-88. Recently he helped to organize a program for volunteer lawyers to train social workers at the New York Foundling Hospital on housing issues.
        Mr. Lerner was active in the Democratic Party, serving as the president of the Riverside Democratic Club from 1970 to 1971 and as a district leader on the Upper West Side from 1971 to 1975.
        He was born in Manhattan, the son of Russian immigrants. After graduating from City College, he worked as an accountant while attending Brooklyn Law School at night, earning his degree there in 1961.
        His survivors include a brother, Joseph, of Manhattan.
