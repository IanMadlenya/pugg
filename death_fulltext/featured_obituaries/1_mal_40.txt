        Claudio Villa, the Little King of Italian song, died late Saturday in a hospital where he had heart surgery last month. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Villa, whose first professional singing success came in 1941 with ''Villa Triste,'' was a four-time winner at Italy's San Remo song festival, capturing the top honor in the world of Italian popular music in 1955, 1957, 1962 and 1966, the last time for ''Granada,'' one of his biggest hits.
        Mr. Villa performed several times in the 1950's and 60's at Carnegie Hall in evenings of Italian song and also appeared in the 1959 motion picture ''See Naples and Die.''
