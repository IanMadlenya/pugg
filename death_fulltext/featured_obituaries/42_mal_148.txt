        Georges Dargaud, who first published the popular Tintin books and the Asterix comic-book series, died Wednesday after a long illness, his publishing house said today. He was 79 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed. Mr. Dargaud founded Dargaud Editeur in 1936 and took an active role in operating the publishing house until selling it to the Media Participation group in January 1989.
        In 1948, he arranged with the Belgian artist Herge to publish the Tintin books, in which the cartoon hero, Tintin, and his dog, Milou, narrated news and feature articles written for young people. The arrangement continued until 1975.
        He began Pilot magazine in 1960 and used it to introduce characters like the Gallic warrior Asterix and the lonesome cowboy Lucky Luke, which were later spun off into films and hardcover books. The publishing house sells two million copies of the 30 original Asterix titles a year in 33 languages.
        Mr. Dargaud is survived by his wife, Irene, and a daughter, Corinne.
