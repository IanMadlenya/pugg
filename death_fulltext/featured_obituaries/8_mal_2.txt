        Harvey O'Connor, an author of scathing biographies on the Mellons, the Guggenheims and the Astors, died Saturday of heart failure after a long illness at his home in Little Compton, R.I. He was 90 years old. Mr. O'Connor was born in Minneapolis in 1897, the son of a railway cook. He worked in logging camps from 1915 to 1918, when he became the editor of The Seattle Daily Call, a Socialist newspaper. In the 1920's, he was an editor for several trade union newspapers. His first book, ''Mellon's Millions,'' was published in 1933. He later wrote ''Steel-Dictator'' in 1935; ''The Guggenheims'' in 1937; ''The Astors'' in 1941; ''History of the Oil Workers International Union'' in 1950; ''The Empire of Oil'' in 1955; ''World Crisis in Oil'' in 1962 and ''Revolution in Seattle'' in 1964.
        Mr. O'Connor, who was publicity director of the Oil Workers International Union from 1945 to 1948, was subpoenaed by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953. Mr. O'Connor refused to tell the panel whether he had been a Communist when he wrote his biographies, which had been placed in libraries maintained by the United States Information Service abroad. 'Hit on the Head Pretty Hard'
        ''I feel like an innocent bystander caught in the brawl between the Senator and what he calls the Acheson State Department,'' Mr. O'Connor said, referring to Secretary of State Dean Acheson. ''I was a bystander and I got hit on the head pretty hard.''
        Mr. O'Connor was subsequently convicted of contempt for refusing to answer Senator McCarthy's questions, and was given a one-year suspended sentence that was reversed on appeal. Later Mr. O'Connor said he was proud that McCarthy called him ''the most contumacious witness ever to appear'' before the committee.
        The McCarthy subpoena was not Mr. O'Connor's last. In 1958, the House Un-American Activities Committee cited him for refusing to respond. The case was dismissed in 1963.
        He was the chairman of the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee from 1955 to 1963, and was given the Distinguished Civil Libertairan Award in 1975 by the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
        He is survived by his wife, Jessie; a son, Stephen, of North Attleboro, Mass.; a daughter, Kathleen, of Lincoln, N.H., and three grandchildren.
