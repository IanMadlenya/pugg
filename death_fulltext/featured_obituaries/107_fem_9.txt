        Mildred Lahr, who was married to the comedian Bert Lahr from 1940 until his death in 1967, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.
        Mrs. Lahr, whose maiden name was Schroeder, was born in Cincinnati and came to New York in 1928 after winning a beauty contest. She became a Ziegfeld Girl and made her Broadway debut in 1930 in Earl Carroll's "Fine and Dandy." She made occasional appearances in sketches with Mr. Lahr after their marriage, but he did not encourage her acting ambitions.
        She is survived by a daughter, Jane, of New York City; a son, John, an author and a drama critic for The New Yorker, of London, and two grandchildren.
