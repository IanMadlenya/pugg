        Mr. Kaiser, a specialist in labor law for more than 40 years, began representing the musicians' union in 1942, became its general counsel in 1947 and held that position until early 1988.
        He negotiated the first contract that provided residual payments for musicians who performed in radio and television commercials, a practice that continues.
        At his death Mr. Kaiser was counsel to the Washington law firm of Bredhoff & Kaiser. He was also general counsel of the American Bakery, Confectionary and Tobacco Workers Union.
        Mr. Kaiser, born in Brooklyn, attended Brooklyn College and City College and received a law degree in 1937 from the University of Wisconsin. In World War II he was a legal officer for the general purchasing agent in the European Theater of Operations.
        He is survived by his wife, Paula; two daughters, Tamara Kaiser of Minneapolis and Rebecca Cooprider of Newton, Mass.; a brother, Philip, of Washington, and three grandchildren.
