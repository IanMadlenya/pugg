        Valentina Cormona, a friend and colleague, said Mrs. Lampkin died of a heart attack.
        Mrs. Lampkin, a graduate of the Columbia School of Social Work, was a former associate dean of the Hunter College School of Social Work, where she also taught for many years. During the 1950's and 1960's, she served in various posts on the New York City Youth Board, now part of the Division of Youth Services, Mrs. Cormona said.
        In the 1950's, she was among the first social workers to try to develop programs intended to appeal to youths in East Harlem, as an alternative to the youth gangs that were rampant in the area at that time. She worked with the United Neighborhood Houses, the Urban League and the Young Men's Christian Association, and was a member of the International Federation of Social Workers.
        There are no immediate survivors. The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. today at the Church of the Intercession, 550 West 155th Street in Manhattan.
