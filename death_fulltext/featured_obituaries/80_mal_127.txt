        J. Lindsay de Valliere, a former budget director of New Jersey and an official who helped set up the Federal Railroad Retirement Board, died on Friday at a nursing home in Red Bank, N.J. He was 92.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Mary Louise van der Wilden.
        Mr. de Valliere was a lifelong state employee, starting his career as a clerk in a municipal accounts office and rising to the post of the state's deputy tax commissioner in 1937. From 1939 to 1940, he also helped organize the Railroad Retirement Board, which administers pensions for the nation's rail workers.
        In 1946, he was hired as secretary to Gov. Alfred E. Driscoll and from 1948 to 1959, he served as budget director in the Driscoll administration. During this time, he was also a trustee of Rutgers University. He lectured on fiscal management for more than a decade, beginning in 1950, at Princeton University.
        He is survived by his daughter, who lives in Fair Haven, N.J., and by one granddaughter.
