        Tommy Nutter, a Savile Row tailor who described his clothes as a "cross between the big-shouldered 'Miami Vice' look and the authentic Savile Row," died yesterday in the Cromwell Hospital in London. He was 49 years old.
        He died from complications from AIDS, said Peter Brown, a friend who lives in New York.
        Mr. Nutter, who was born in Wales, became an apprentice with Donaldson, Williamson & Ward, traditional London tailors, in the early 1960's. After he started his own busines on Savile Row in 1968, Mr. Nutter's clients included the Beatles, Mick Jagger, Elton John, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Hardie Amies, the fashion designer who makes clothes for the Royal family.
        Mr. Nutter is survived by his mother, Dolly, of London and a brother, David, of New York.
