        Mrs. Obendorf had periodically been hospitalized and remained disoriented and weak after the couple's ordeal, which began when they embarked on an automobile trip to Kansas on March 15. They were beset by bad weather, ill health and numerous wrong turns. At one point, they were stranded for 13 days with nothing to eat but a few cookies.
