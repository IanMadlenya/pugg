        Mack David, a composer and lyricist best known for his songs "La Vie en Rose" and "Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White," died on Thursday in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 81 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.
        Mr. David had a heart attack on Tuesday and had suffered from a weak heart for years, his family said.
        In a career of more than half a century, Mr. David was credited with writing or co-writing more than 1,000 songs, including the 1990 hit "Born to Be Blue," performed by the Judds.
        He wrote lyrics for the 1973 Broadway musical "Molly." Among his film scores was Walt Disney's "Cinderella." He received eight Academy Award nominations for best song.
        In 1975, Mr. David was granted a patent for inventing an electronic system for composing songs from fractional recordings. The system, which included playback units, stored records of lyrics and melodies. The operator selected words and music that fit together and recorded the combination.
        Mr. David was born in New York City, where he attended Thomas Jefferson High School. After two years at Cornell University, he left to study law at St. John's University. He abandoned that after a year to pursue a lifelong passion for composing songs.
        Besides his wife, Beatrice, Mr. David is survived by a brother, the composer and lyricist Hal David; a son, John, and a daughter, Rosemary Kramer, both of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
