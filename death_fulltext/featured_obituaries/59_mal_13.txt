        Jerome J. Donovan, a regional executive of Merrill Lynch & Company offices in New Jersey and New York, died on Saturday at the Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 51 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He died of stomach cancer, said a Merrill Lynch spokesman, Fred Yager.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Donovan, who was known as Jay, was New Jersey district director for Merrill Lynch's Private Client Group. In that post, which he assumed last year, he was in charge of the securities firm's 30 retail branch offices in New Jersey.
        Before that, he oversaw Merrill Lynch offices in northern New Jersey, New York City and Long Island. He joined the firm in 1970.
        He was born in Boston and graduated from Boston College.
        He is survived by his wife, Marolyn; twin sons, Keith and Kevin, and two daughters, Kelly and Kathleen, all of whom live at home.
