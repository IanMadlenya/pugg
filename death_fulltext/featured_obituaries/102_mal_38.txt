        Harry S. Tishelman, who as a New York City finance official earned a tribute for helping the city get the biggest returns on its investments, died on Thursday in Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. A New York City native, he was 71 and had lived in Tarrytown in recent months.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.

        In 1976, Mr. Tishelman was one of eight city employees honored as "representative of the best" in the municipal ranks by the Fund for the City of New York, a nonprofit organization created by the Ford Foundation to encourage better government. The First Deputy Commissioner of Finance at the time, Mr. Tishelman was given a $5,000 award for mastering the arcana of bank investments to the city's benefit.
        From 1980 to 1983, he was New York district director of the Small Business Administration. In 1983, he joined M & T Bank in Buffalo, serving as senior vice president until 1994, when he became executive vice president. He retired later that year.
        Mr. Tishelman graduated from the City College of New York in 1946, from Harvard Law School in 1949 and from the Columbia University Graduate School of Business in 1974.
        Surviving are his wife, Beulah; two daughters, Carol, of Stockholm,and Amy, of Boston; a son, Edward, of Irvington, N.Y.; two brothers, Joseph, of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and William, of Yonkers, and seven grandchildren.
