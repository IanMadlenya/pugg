        Ken Englund, a film and television writer whose credits included the screenplay for "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," died on Tuesday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles. He was 79.
        He had lived in the hospital's long-term care facility since suffering a stroke in 1985, said his daughter, Patricia Englund Lefferts.
        Mr. Englund was born and reared in Chicago. As a youngster, he contributed jokes to college humor magazines. In his early 20's, he was hired as a writer by the "The Phil Baker Hour," a radio show produced in Chicago, after submitting a joke about King Kong.
        He began working for Paramount in 1937, where he wrote the screenplays for "No, No, Nanette," "This Thing Called Love," "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," "The Unseen" and "The Vagabond King."
        He was lead writer for Dr. Joyce Brothers's television series and contributed scripts to "The Jackie Gleason Show," "My Three Sons," "That Girl" and "The Loretta Young Show."
        Mr. Englund served as first vice president of the council of the Writers' Guild of America, West, in 1961, after serving as president of its screen branch from 1958 until 1961.
        In addition to his daughter, of Westport, Conn, he is survived by two sons, George, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Steven, of Waupaca, Wis., and seven grandchildren.
