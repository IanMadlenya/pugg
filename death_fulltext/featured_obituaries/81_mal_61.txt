        Dr. Israel Glasser, an educator and administrator in the municipal college system for 45 years, most recently at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, died on Monday at his Brooklyn home. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Glasser graduated from City College in 1943 and received a master's degree in public administration and a Ph.D. in political science from New York University. He started his academic career at City College in 1946.
        In 1951, he joined the staff of New York City Community College in Brooklyn and spent 18 years as a member of its social sciences faculty. He was first associated with Kingsborough in 1966 as dean of the faculty and professor of political science but then returned to New York City Community College, now known as New York City Technical College. Was Acting President
        Kingsborough named him a vice president and dean of the college in 1971. He served as acting president in the early 1980's, became senior vice president and college dean in 1983 and retired two years ago.
        Under his guidance, Kingsborough began a number of programs, including My Turn, which since 1981 has allowed older people to earn college credits by taking free courses. He also organized a visiting-scholar lecture series. The two-year college, in Manhattan Beach, has an enrollment of 15,500 students working toward associate degrees in 30 areas. It began in 1964.
        Dr. Glasser is survived by his wife, Julia Birstein Glasser; a daughter, Susan Lubowsky; a son, Marc, both of Brooklyn, and three grandchildren.
