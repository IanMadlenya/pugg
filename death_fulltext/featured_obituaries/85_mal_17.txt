        Thomas D. O'Connell, an engineer who managed New York City's water supply through the droughts of 1981, 1985 and 1989, died on Sunday at the Bay Shore Hospital in Holmdel, N.J. Mr. O'Connell, who lived in Matawan, N.J., was 62.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said his son, Dr. Brian T. O'Connell.
        Thomas O'Connell retired a year ago as the chief of strategic services for the Bureau of Water Supply of the city's Department of Environmental Protection. In that position he had guided the supply and administration of water to and around the boroughs. He was also the city's liaison with the Delaware River Basin Commission.

Over the years he advanced to the positions of director of technical services, deputy chief engineer, and in 1978, chief engineer of the Bureau of Water Supply.
