        David Sinclair, a retired research physicist and a son of Upton Sinclair, the American writer and journalist, died Saturday of lung cancer at Cabrini Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85 years old and lived in Martinsville, N.J., and Manhattan.
        Dr. Sinclair, who was born in New York City, graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1924 and received a Ph.D. in physics from Columbia University in 1937.
        In World War II he was part of a group of scientists engaged in research for the Federal Government at Columbia University's chemistry department. The group devised an aerosol generator that was used to create protective smokescreens for Allied troops in the invasion of Normandy in 1944.
        In 1944 Dr. Sinclair joined the Johns-Manville Research and Engineering Center in Manville, N.J. Upon his retirement from Johns-Manville in 1965, he joined the United States Atomic Energy Commission, now the Department of Energy, as a research scientist in aerosol physics.
        He developed a method for measuring submicron aerosols that eventually became used in the detection of radon and other pollutants. He retired from that position in 1985.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jean Weidman; a daughter, Diana Sinclair of Manhattan, and a half brother, Lester Keane of Abilene, Tex.
