        Dr. Edward Joseph, a prominent psychoanalyst and professor of clinical psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, died at White Plains Hospital on Tuesday. He was 72 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He died after a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Joseph had planned to be a cardiologist and was promised training in that specialty when, just out of medical school in 1943, he joined the Army. The Army chose to train him in psychiatry, the field in which he remained for the rest of his life.
        He maintained a private practice while teaching at Mount Sinai in Manhattan, and was affiliated with Mount Sinai for most of his career. He served two terms as president of the American Psychoanalytic Association and one term as president of the International Psychoanalytic Association. He was particularly noted for his psychoanalytic work with twins.
        Among his many papers was a psychoanalytic study of Joseph Conrad.
        Dr. Joseph was born in Pittsburgh and raised in New York City. He attended Queens College for one year then transferred to McGill University in Montreal for both his undergraduate and medical degrees. The Joseph family had come to the United States from Canada where they had settled in the 18th century.
        He is survived by his wife, Harriet Bloomfield Joseph; two sons, Alan, of Voorheesville, N.Y., and Brian, of Columbus, Ohio; a daughter, Leila Joseph, of Weston, Mass., and a brother, Horace, of Ridgecrest, Calif.
