        A. H. Weiler, a writer, editor and critic whose career at The New York Times spanned more than 50 years, died on July 22 at his home in Astoria, Queens. He was 93.
        News of his death was delayed by the illness of his daughter and sole survivor, Susan L. Weiler. Mr. Weiler's wife, Ann, died earlier.
        As motion picture editor of The Times, Mr. Weiler served a term as chairman of the New York Film Critics Association. For a time, he wrote a Sunday column about movies and moviemakers. Mr. Weiler was known around the office either as Abe or, just as often, Doc, thanks to his readiness to diagnose and prescribe treatments for the aches and pains of his friends and co-workers.
        Abe H. Weiler was born on Dec. 10, 1908, in Russia and brought to New York by his family as a child; he grew up on the Lower East Side.
        As a young man, he hoped to practice medicine and in later years was delighted when one of his friends, the novelist Richard Condon, regularly began including a character named Dr. Weiler in his books.
        Part of Mr. Weiler's legacy is his memorable response when the long-independent arts reporters and critics of The Times were put under the supervision of Joseph G. Herzberg, the paper's first cultural news editor. As related by Richard F. Shepard, a colleague, in ''The Paper's Papers: A Reporter's Journey Through the Archives of The New York Times,'' Mr. Weiler was summoned by his new chief and could not resist taking a jab at what he regarded as culture's highfalutin new identity.
        ''Sorry, Joe,'' he replied, ''I'm busy painting a fresco.''
