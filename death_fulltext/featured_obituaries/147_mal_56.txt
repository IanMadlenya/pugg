        Edmund M. Braun, a psychiatrist and labor advocate who worked to obtain better health care for the poor and Social Security coverage for physicians, died April 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was a heart attack, his son Carl said.
        As an organizer and spokesman for the progressive doctors' organization, Physicians Forum, Dr. Braun championed causes like national health insurance, an end to racial discrimination in the field of medicine, and the legislation that extended Social Security benefits to physicians, which was adopted by Congress in 1965.
        In the late 1950's, he was one of the leaders of the physicians' campaign against nuclear weapons tests, which began in 1957 as the Committee on Radiation Hazards and later became the Physicians for Social Responsibility.
        Born in New York City, where his father practiced medicine, Dr. Braun graduated from Columbia University in 1937 and received his medical degree from New York University Medical Center.
        During World War II, he was a flight surgeon in the Army Air Force, and in 1954, he received his certificate in psychoanalysis from the William Alanson White Institute in New York.
        In the late 1950's, Dr. Braun was chairman of the Physicians Forum, which focused on an unsuccessful effort to create a program of national health insurance and a Federal Department of Health with full Cabinet rank.
        In 1961, he became one of the original members of the department of psychiatry at the Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem, where he developed programs, including an alcohol treatment program.
        He was an assistant professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College.
        Dr. Braun is survived by two sons, Carl and Martin, both of Manhattan. He was predeceased by a daughter, Andrea.
