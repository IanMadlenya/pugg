        Mr. Horton, who was born in Providence, R.I., was a graduate of Princeton. He taught English at Harvard and served as curator of poetry at Harvard's Widener Library from 1937 to 1942. During World War II he served in the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, London, Germany and Paris. In 1946 he became the first station chief in Paris of the Central Intelligence Agency, an outgrowth of the O.S.S.
        In 1947 he joined Time magazine as an associate editor and two years later left for The Reporter, where he became executive editor, a post he held until the magazine ceased publication in 1969.
        At the Fletcher School, administered by Tufts University and Harvard, Mr. Horton was also director of the Edward R. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy.
        His wife, Tessa Gilbert, a painter, died several years ago. There are no immediate survivors.
