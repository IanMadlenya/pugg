        Charles N. Breed Jr., a surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died at his home in Manhattan on Friday. He was 78.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Breed, an expert in breast cancer, was an early advocate of the idea that a radical mastectomy was not necessary in all breast surgery cases. He performed limited breast surgery followed by radiation treatment on many patients, treating or consulting thousands of patients over the years.
        In addition to more than 30 years as a surgeon at Memorial, he served for many years at Beth Israel North Division, formerly Doctors Hospital. From 1962 to 1970, he was president of its medical staff and chief of surgery.
        He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Medical School and served as a captain in the United States Medical Corps during World War II, specializing in the care of Army and Navy cancer patients.
        He became a fellow of the National Cancer Institute in 1947 and served at Memorial Hospital. In 1951, he was appointed to the surgical staff at Memorial and as associate professor of surgery at Cornell Medical School.
        Dr. Breed remained on the staff of Memorial Hospital until retiring at 70 in 1984. Until he contracted cancer of the esophagus two years ago, he continued to see patients in private practice.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, Anne, and a daughter, Nancy Ryerson Breed of Old Brookville, L.I.
