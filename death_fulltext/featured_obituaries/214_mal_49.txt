        Peter K. Loeb, an investment manager and a philanthropist, died last Tuesday in New York City. He was 68.
        The cause was a stroke, according to his wife, Jeanette W. Loeb.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Loeb, a lifelong New Yorker, was managing director of Neuberger Berman, an investment firm.
        A graduate of Yale and the Columbia Business School, he began his career on Wall Street at Loeb, Rhoades & Company, a brokerage firm, and continued with its successor company, Shearson/American Express Inc. He later served as managing director of PaineWebber Inc.; as a partner at Shufro, Rose & Ehrman, a Manhattan money management firm, and as president of Delta Capital Management, an investment management firm that was sold to Neuberger Berman.
        Mr. Loeb also served as a board member at City Center, a trustee at Columbia University and a member of the Board of Overseers of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. He promoted numerous charitable organizations, including City Harvest and Food Chain.
        In 1980 he became involved with the Special Olympics, a relationship that continued until his death and included program development, fund-raising and coaching New York Special Olympics teams. Besides his wife, he is survived by their son, Alexander, of New York; three other children from a previous marriage: Karen, of New York; Peter Jr., of Redwood City, Calif., and James, of Boca Raton, Fla.; and three grandchildren.
