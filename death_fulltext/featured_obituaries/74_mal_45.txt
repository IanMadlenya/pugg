        Melvin E. A. Bradford, a conservative political theorist and professor of English at the University of Dallas, died last Wednesday at Midland Memorial Hospital in Midland, Tex. He was 58 and lived in Irving, a Dallas suburb.
        His wife, Marie, said he died after heart surgery.
        Mr. Bradford gained national attention in the early 1980's as the Reagan Administration's choice for chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Supported by conservative Republican Senators like Jesse Helms of North Carolina but denounced by neo-conservatives led by the writer Irving Kristol, Mr. Bradford finally lost the appointment to William J. Bennett.
        At the heart of the dispute were several scholarly works that Mr. Bradford had written criticizing Abraham Lincoln for his egalitarian philosophy. In addition, Mr. Bradford had supported the 1972 Presidential candidacy of George C. Wallace of Alabama.
        Mr. Bradford began teaching English at the University of Dallas in 1967 and was named professor in 1977.  Among the more than a dozen books he wrote or edited, his most recent one, which some critics consider his best, was "Against the Barbarians and Other Reflections" (University of Missouri Press, 1992).
        Besides his wife of 38 years, he is survived by a son, Douglas, also of Irving.
