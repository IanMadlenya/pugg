        William Clark Brinkley, a novelist known for his books about the Navy and the sea, died on Monday at his home in McAllen, Tex., near the Gulf of Mexico. He was 76.
        The cause was an overdose of barbiturates, said Ralph Graves, a friend who edited some of Mr. Brinkley's writings. He said Mr. Brinkley had been clinically depressed for a long time.
        In World War II, Mr. Brinkley was a naval officer in Europe and the Pacific and spent part of that time in public-relations duties. He went on to write nine books, eight of them novels.
        His best-known work is "Don't Go Near the Water," a 1956 best seller that satirizes Navy public relations efforts in a Pacific backwater late in the war. The 1957 movie version starred Glenn Ford. Of Landing Ships and Life
        Mr. Brinkley's last novel was "The Last Ship" (1988), in which the crews of an American destroyer and a Soviet nuclear submarine seem to be the only survivors of a nuclear war.
        His other novels are "Quicksand" (1948); "The Fun House" (1961), a comic account of the goings-on at the offices of a picture magazine resembling Life, where Mr. Brinkley worked in the 1950's; "The Two Susans" (1962); "The Ninety and Nine" (1966), about life on board an LST in World War II; "Breakpoint" (1978), and "Peeper" (1981).
        His only nonfiction book is "The Deliverance of Sister Cecelia" (1954), the memoirs of a nun as told to him.
        Mr. Brinkley was born in Custer, Okla. He graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1940 and then was a reporter with The Daily Oklahoman in Oklahoma City. He was later a reporter for The Washington Post for several years.
        At Life, where he worked from 1951 to 1958, he was a correspondent, an assistant editor and then a staff writer.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; a stepson, David Shelander of Pensacola, Fla.; a brother, Paul D., of Auburn, Ala., and a sister, Virginia McCabe of Garden Grove, Calif.
