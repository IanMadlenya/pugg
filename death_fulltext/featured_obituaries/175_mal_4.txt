        Miklos Vasarhelyi, press secretary to the reformist prime minister,  Imre Nagy, during Hungary's unsuccessful anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 and one of the few survivors among Nagy's close associates, died on Tuesday, a Hungarian government radio broadcast said. He was 83.
        The cause of his death was heart problems, said Janos Kenedi, a friend of his family.
        Mr. Vasarhelyi, whose full name is pronounced mick-LOHSH VAH-shahr-HAY-ee, was Nagy's spokesman when Nagy, a Communist, headed a new coalition government during the revolution and renounced Hungary's adherence to the Warsaw Pact.
        Mr. Vasarhelyi joined the Communist Party in 1938 and was expelled from it in 1955 after becoming a reformist. He was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the uprising, but served only part of his sentence.
        Mr. Nagy (pronounced nudge) was hanged in 1958 for heading the revolt. He and four others were condemned to death in a secret trial, at which Mr. Vasarhelyi was convicted.
        By 1989 Mr. Vasarhelyi, who was working as a writer, was the only survivor in Hungary of the Nagy trial.
        Born in what is now Rijeka, Croatia, Mr. Vasarhelyi studied at universities in Hungary and Italy and became a journalist. He is survived by his wife, Edit; two daughters, Julia and Maria; and a son, Istvan.
