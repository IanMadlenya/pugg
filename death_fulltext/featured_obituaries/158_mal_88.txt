        Klaus Piper, a German publisher who helped build his family's business into one of Europe's most respected intellectual imprints, died on Saturday at his home in Munich. He was 88.
        Mr. Piper (pronounced PEE-per) learned the trade after joining his family's publishing house in 1932 as an apprentice. The Munich-based firm R. Piper Verlag was founded in 1904 by his father, Reinhard, who grounded it in philosophy, literature and the arts.
        When his father died in 1953, Klaus Piper took the helm and broadened the Piper catalog to encompass history, politics and the natural and social sciences. His stable of internationally known authors included the German philosopher and psychopathologist Karl Jaspers, the German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin and the pianist Alfred Brendel.
        He personally brought Kurt Vonnegut Jr. into the fold with the 1977 publication of Mr. Vonnegut's novel ''Slapstick'' in German translation, no mean feat considering the author's inimitable style. Complimented on his ''large vision,'' Mr. Vonnegut, on a visit to Frankfurt, said it was obvious that Mr. Piper was ''the publisher for me.''
        Mr. Piper, who spoke English and French, agreed: ''I don't publish books, I publish authors.''
        He sold his majority share in Piper Verlag to the Swedish publishing group Bonnier in 1994, saying he wanted to assure the company's future. Until two years ago he remained an adviser to the firm.
        His survivors include his wife and five children.
