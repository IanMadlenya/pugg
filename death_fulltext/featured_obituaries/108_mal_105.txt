        F. Gordon Foster, a metallurgical engineer whose interest in microscopy led him to become an authority on ferns, some of the oldest plants on earth, died on Sunday at the Monroe Village retirement community in Jamesburg, N.J. He was 91.
        Mr. Foster was the author of "Ferns to Know and Grow" (Timber Press, 4th ed.  1993), a classic he richly illustrated with the aid of microscopy. It originally covered solely the ferns of the American Northeast, but he expanded it over the  years to include species native to the Western and Southern states.
        Mr. Foster, who was born in Orange, N.J., received a degree in mechanical engineering from Newark College of Engineering. He studied metallurgical engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and electron microscopy at  the Stevens Institute of Technology. He later taught those subjects at both Newark and Stevens.
        Mr. Foster spent more than 35 years on the technical staff of Bell Laboratories until his retirement in 1968. His job was to put metals used by the Bell System under the microscope to ascertain why they failed.
        He became fascinated with ferns in 1948 when he first studied their unique spores microscopically and began to grow them in his woodland garden.
        In the mid-1980's, 70 species from Mr. Foster's garden became the F. Gordon Foster Collection at the New York Botanical Garden, where they take up a third of an acre in the Native Plant Garden.
        He was a past chairman of the committee on microscopy of the American Society for Testing and Materials and president of the New York Microscopical Society. He was a Fellow of Britain's Royal Photographic Society and Royal Microscopical  Society.
        Mr. Foster is survived by a son, Carleton, of Boston; a daughter, Bernice Keebler of Willow Grove, Pa.; a sister, Lois Kemp of Bricktown, N.J., and a grandson. His wife of 54 years, Ethel Bergen Foster, died in 1988.
