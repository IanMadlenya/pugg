        The Davidson County medical examiner, Dr. Charles Harlan, said an alcohol overdose had caused the singer's death.
        Mr. Whitley's latest album, ''Don't Close Your Eyes,'' has had three No. 1 singles since it was released last year: the title song, ''When You Say Nothing at All'' and ''I'm No Stranger to the Rain,'' a song that has been on the Billboard country-music charts for 17 weeks and reached No. 1 a month ago. The album has been on the charts for 47 weeks.
        His other hit singles include ''Miami My Amy,'' ''Ten Feet Away,'' ''Homecoming '63'' and ''Hard Livin'.''
        Mr. Whitley is survived by his wife, Lorrie Morgan; a son, Jesse Keith, and a daughter, Morgan.
