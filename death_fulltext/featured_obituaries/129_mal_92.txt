        Buddy Hirsch, a Hall of Fame horse trainer and the son of the renowned trainer Max Hirsch, died Saturday in Bal Harbour, Fla., after a long illness. He was 88.
        Max and Buddy Hirsch formed one of the rare father-son combinations inducted into horse racing's Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Max, who trained three winners of the Kentucky Derby, was inducted in 1959. Buddy, who trained more than 1,000 winners in nearly every state that conducted racing and who won more than $15 million in purses, went into the Hall of Fame in 1982.
        William James (Buddy) Hirsch was born in 1909 in San Francisco, graduated from Georgetown University and worked in a Wall Street brokerage firm during the Depression. During World War II, he served as an Army officer and was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
        Buddy Hirsch followed his father into thoroughbred racing and worked in Max Hirsch's stable until he struck out on his own as a trainer. Max Hirsch gave his son a one-way railroad ticket to Chicago, four horses and the advice, ''When you run out of money, sell a horse.''
        But Buddy Hirsch proved an instant success, especially when his filly Columbiana won the Widener Handicap and later was sold to Calumet Farm and became one of the farm's foundation broodmares. He also trained many champions, including Gallant Bloom in 1969 and Canonero II in 1982. He served as a trainer for the King Ranch of Texas for more than 40 years.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Sandy; two sons, the trainer W. J. (Bill) Hirsch of Floral Park, N.Y., and Michael of San Marino, Calif.; a daughter, Marilyn of Bal Harbour, and a sister, Catherine Reynolds of Coral Springs, Fla.
        A private burial service was planned for Holy Road Cemetery in Westbury, N.Y., and a memorial service will be this winter in Bal Harbour.
