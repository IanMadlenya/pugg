        William R. Brennan Jr., a former New York State Supreme Court Justice and former president and chief executive of the Apple Bank for Savings, died Tuesday in Winthrop University Hospital in Mineola, L.I. A resident of Manhasset, he was 72 and formerly lived in Garden City.
        His death came after a brief illness, his family said.
        In the administration of Gov. W. Averell Harriman, Mr. Brennan served as assistant counsel, deputy superintendent and chief counsel in the State Department of Banking. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed him Acting Superintendent of Banks in 1959 while looking for a Republican replacement.
        In a strong Democratic showing later that year, Mr. Brennan was elected a State Supreme Court Justice, sitting in Mineola. He left the bench in 1967.
        In 1970, he was named president and chief executive officer of Harlem Savings Bank, which later became Apple Bank for Savings. He retired as chairman of the bank in 1986.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Brennan was raised on Long Island, where he became active in Democratic Party affairs. He graduated from Manhattan College and Fordham University Law School.
        Mr. Brennan's wife of 33 years, the former Mary Morrissey, died in 1979. He is survived by six sons, William R. 3d, of Key West, Fla., John Paul, of Summerland Key, Fla., Christopher, of Albuquerque, N.M., Vincent, of Hicksville, L.I., Timothy, of Manhattan, and Andrew, of Sacramento, Calif.; a daughter, Ellen Robinson of Los Angeles; three sisters, Margaret Mitchell of Ridgefield, Conn., Sister Beatrice Brennan, of Manhattan, and Joan Armstrong of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a brother, John C. of Manhasset, and four grandchildren.
