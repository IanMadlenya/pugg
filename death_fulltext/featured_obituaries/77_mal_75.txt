        Philip H. Dorn, a New York computer expert who advised corporate clients, died on June 8 while returning home from an evening at the ballet. A resident of Manhattan, he was 62.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Michael Roos, a family friend.
        Mr. Dorn spent a 34-year career in the field and operated his own company, Dorn Computer Consultants, for the last 20 years. He gained international recognition as a regular columnist writing for industry periodicals in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Japan and New Zealand. He also was a member of the editorial board of Datamation, a magazine on computers and information processing published in Newton, Mass.
        He was a native of Manhattan and graduated from Princeton.
        Mr. Dorn is survived by his wife of 38 years, Sue B. Dorn; a son, Charles, of Rye, N.Y; a daughter, Martha Maurer, of Seattle, and two grandchildren.
