        Noah M. Bee, a retired New York graphic artist and political cartoonist published in Jewish newspapers throughout North America, died on Sunday at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. He was 76 years old and lived in Encino, Calif.
        His family said he died of prostate cancer.
        Born Noah Birsowski in Warsaw, he emigrated to Israel in 1933 and came to the United States in 1943. He worked as an art director for McGraw-Hill in New York City for more than 30 years before retiring in 1977.
        Mr. Bee also worked as a freelance artist for the Jewish National Fund and designed the J.N.F. Blue Box, which was used to raise funds for the new Israeli state. His cartoons, which he continued to produce until two months ago, featured Jewish and Israeli topics.
        Three collections of his work were published in New York by Bloch Publishing: "In Spite of Everything" (1973), "The Imposssible Takes a Little Longer" (1983), and "Israel at 40 -- Years of Triumph, Trials & Errors" (1988).
        Mr. Bee is survived by his wife of 52 years, the former Marian Beder; a son, Carmi Bee of Brooklyn; a daughter, Sharon Herman of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.
