        Robert Sharp Stitt, a retired New York lawyer who raised warnings five years ago about the instability of Rhode Island banks, died on Wednesday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was 64 years old and lived in East Greenwich, R.I., where he had moved from Manhattan in 1984.
        His death is believed to be the result of a heart attack, his wife said.
        In 1985 Mr. Stitt prepared a report as a volunteer in the office of the State Attorney General, Arlene Violet, warning that the private fund that insured Rhode Island banks would probably not be able to survive the collapse of a member institution. Ms. Violet pressed unsuccessfully for legislation requiring Rhode Island financial institutions to convert to Federal deposit insurance.
        Five years later the private insurance fund collapsed, and three hours into his new administration, Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun closed 45 banks and credit unions. Twelve remain closed. Mr. Stitt's reports were made public only after the collapse.
        Before his retirement, he was a partner in Thacher, Proffitt & Wood in Manhattan for more than 30 years. He was an alumnus of Amherst College and Columbia Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Penelope Anne Cruden, a son, Roderick of Brooklyn; a daughter, Stephanie Stitt of Washington, and a brother, Edward W. 3d, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
