        Paul Bodin, an abstract painter associated with the New York School, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Aaron.
        Mr. Bodin, who was born in New York City, studied at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. During the 1930's and early 40's, he was part of a circle of artists that included Milton Avery, Mark Rothko and Adolf Gottlieb, and worked on the Federal Art Project begun by the Works Progress Administration.
        Mr. Bodin made his first abstract paintings in 1945 and exhibited regularly in Manhattan until the early 1960's, including two shows at the Betty Parsons Gallery. His work is represented in the collections of the Albright Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and West Virginia University.
        In addition to his son, of Washington, Mr. Bodin is survived by two grandsons.
