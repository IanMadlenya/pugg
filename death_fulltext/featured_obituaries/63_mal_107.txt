        James L. Yassky, a founding member of the Lesbian and Gay Law Association of Greater New York, died on Saturday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 40 years old.
        The cause of death was asthma, his companion, George Piette, said.
        Mr. Yassky, a partner in the New York firm of Yassky & Lederle, specialized in probate law. He was widely respected as a defender of the property rights of survivors in gay relationships.  He worked as a political organizer and fund raiser to insure that homosexuals would be treated without prejudice by elected officials.
        "Jimmy was a lawyer with courage and brains," said Eve Preminger, Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan. "His direct approach to problem-solving was remarkable."
        Mr. Yassky was born in Manhattan. He attended Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, later receiving a bachelor of arts degree from Sarah Lawrence College. He earned a law degree from Golden Gate University in San Francisco and was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1978. Mr. Yassky practiced law in New York City until his death.
        He is survived by his parents, Herb and Paula, and a sister, Brahna Yassky-Janovsky, all of New York City.
