        Elizabeth Ball Holmes, a University of Hawaii speech professor who was one of the state's foremost experts on Hawaiian pidgin English, died on Dec. 17. She was 95.
        Professor Holmes, also known as Elizabeth Carr, devoted most of her research  to the study of Hawaii's pidgin dialect, a combination of English, Hawaiian and  other languages.
        In her book, "Da Kine Talk, from Pidgin to Standard English in Hawaii," she  contended that the language had evolved into a distinct regional dialect and could no longer be considered in its pidgin stage, the period when Asian immigrants learned a modicum of basic English from plantation bosses.
