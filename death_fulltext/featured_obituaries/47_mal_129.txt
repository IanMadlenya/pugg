        John D. Brockmeyer, a leading actor in the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, died on Sunday at his parents' home in Columbus, Ohio. He was 50 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Lola Pashalinski, a friend.
        He was born in Columbus, attended Ohio State University and served in the United States Navy.
        Beginning with his role in 1970 as the Boris Karloff-like servant Sheemish in Charles Ludlam's "Bluebeard," he became expert at playing invidious, cowardly villains in Mr. Ludlam's plays, including "The Enchanted Pig" and "Stage Blood". He portrayed heroes (Siegfried in "Der Ring Got Farblonjet") and women (Maw McCoy in the 1972 musical "Corn").
        Reviewing "Corn" in The New York Times, Mel Gussow wrote: "Mr. Brockmeyer, who is so tall that whenever he comes onstage he looks as if he is stooping to avoid hitting the ceiling, is a natural in his usual roles as sniveling pea-brained servants and monsters. But he is just as much in character as the termagant Maw McCoy."
        In his calico dress and droopy stockings, "advising his daughters to 'have no truck with city slickers,' he is hilarious," the review said of the actor.
        His last appearance was in Georg Osterman's musical "Don't Remind Me," in 1988 at La Mama.
        He is survived by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Brockmeyer of Columbus, two brothers and four sisters.
