        Herbert Sadkin, a former Long Island builder and developer, died of cancer Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach, Fla. He was 72 years old and lived in Fort Lauderdale.
        At his death, Mr. Sadkin was president of Sadkin Enterprises and of Bonadventure, builders of homes and commercial buildings in the Fort Lauderdale area. Before moving to Florida in the early 1980's, he was president of All State Realty, which built homes in Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
        In 1959, he built a one-family home that was shown at an American exhibition in Moscow to help the Soviet people get the feel of ''an average American home.'' He asked Stanley H. Klein, the architect, to design a conventional six-room house with one-and-a-half baths, priced at $11,000 to $12,000, exclusive of land.
        Mr. Sadkin was born in Syracuse and graduated from City College in 1937.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betty Drew; a daughter, Fern, and two sons, Martin and Mark, all of Fort Lauderdale; five grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
