        Ken Germann, a former football star and later athletic director at Columbia, and for 14 years the commissioner of the Southern Conference, died Aug. 24 in Glen Ellen, Va. He was 84.
        Mr. Germann was born in Garden City Park, N.Y. At Columbia, he was a football wingback and punter for a team led by Paul Governali, an all-American tailback. In 1941, Mr. Germann averaged 41.6 yards a punt, still the Columbia record. He also played basketball for two years.
        Mr. Germann graduated in 1943 and spent three years in the Marines, leaving as a captain. In 1946, he signed a contract with the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference, though he never played.
        Instead, he spent 11 years as football coach at Iona Prep in New Rochelle, four years as freshman coach at Columbia and seven years as assistant athletic director and lightweight football coach at Rutgers. He returned to Columbia in 1968 and served as athletic director through 1973. He helped spearhead the drive to build the Marcellus Hartley Dodge Physical Fitness Center, which opened on campus in 1974.
        Mr. Germann left Columbia to become the commissioner of the Southern Conference. He served from 1974 until his retirement in 1987. He is credited with having expanded the conference's women's programs. Its top performance award for women's sports is called the Germann Cup.
        Mr. Germann, who lived in Glen Ellen, is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Wiesendanger; a son, Kenneth, of Medford, Mass.; two daughters, Debby Baker of Aptos, Calif., and Kathe Henke of Glen Ellen; and three grandchildren.
