        Prof. Gerald H. Storzer, who taught French language and literature and African and Caribbean literature at Brooklyn College, died yesterday at Tisch Hospital of New York University. He was 54 and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of a coronary thrombosis, the college said.
        Professor Storzer graduated from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis., and earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he began his teaching career. He joined the Brooklyn campus of the City University of New York in 1974.
        He was named a full professor in 1983 and served as chairman of the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures from 1980 to 1985. He recently completed a manuscript, "West African Elements of Culture," which has been submitted to a publisher.
        Professor Storzer is survived by a sister, Ann Stascak, a resident of Wisconsin; and a brother, Dan, who lives in Georgia.
