        Dennis McGee, a fiddler who performed on some of the earliest recordings of Cajun music, died on Tuesday. He was 96 years old and lived in Eunice.
        Mr. McGee performed on the radio show ''Prairie Home Companion'' and often appeared at festivals and on college campuses around the country well into his 90's.
        Mr. McGee performed with Amede Ardoin, Joe Falcon and Amede Breaux when Cajun music was first being recorded in the late 1920's.
        ''He was very well known and very much respected in lots of different circles around the country, and none of that affected him,'' said Barry Ancelet, who chronicles the Cajun culture and history.
        ''Dennis McGee was around when what we now call Cajun music was invented or was developing,'' Mr. Ancelet said.
