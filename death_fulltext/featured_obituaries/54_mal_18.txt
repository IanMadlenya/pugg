        William Edward Dugan, a Wall Street executive and former chairman of Laidlaw & Company, died on Friday at his home in Manchester Center, Vt. He was 84 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his daughter, Isabell.
        A graduate of the Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Dugan joined Laidlaw in 1929 as a runner. He spent his entire career with the firm, and before retiring in 1972 as chairman oversaw its formation as Laidlaw Coggeshall & Company.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Marshall; three daughters, Isabell LaCrosse of Granville, Mass., Dr. Ellen Dugan of Greencastle, Pa., and Martha Erskine of Fulton, Md.; 11 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
