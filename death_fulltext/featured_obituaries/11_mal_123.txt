        Joe Rosenfield Jr., who was the host of a radio talk show called ''The Happiness Exchange'' for many years, died on Nov. 22 at a nursing home in Falmouth, Me., after a long illness. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Rosenfield, who was known as Big Joe, did a nighttime show during what was called ''the insomnia stretch'' from 2 to 5 A.M. Broadcast over several New York radio stations from 1949 to 1962, the show raised large sums in contributions by letting the unfortunate air their troubles.
        Born and raised in Tennessee, Mr. Rosenfield began his first nighttime program with his son, Joe 3d, in New Orleans. His nickname, Big Joe, evolved to differentiate him from his son.
        Mr. Rosenfield is survived by his second wife, Ruth, of Falmouth, Me.; a son, Joe, of Acton, Mass., and a daughter, Dorothy Fisher-Smith, of Ashland, Ore.; six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
