        Sheldon B. Satin, who helped make cable television popular by consulting in marketing and customer service, died Friday in Stamford, Conn. He was 69 and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
        The cause was a brain tumor, his wife, Joan Throckmorton, said.
        In the late 70's, when cable television was just starting to gain favor, Mr. Satin helped teach cable operators how to work more effectively with customers.
        His company, Sheldon Satin Associates, offered training programs and helped executives and service representatives manage their relationships with customers. The company, which was later moved to Pound Ridge, worked for clients like Comcast, DirecTV, HBO, Showtime and TCI.
        In addition to his wife, of Pound Ridge, Mr. Satin is survived by his daughter and son from a former marriage; Elizabeth, of New York, and David, also of New York; and three grandchildren.
