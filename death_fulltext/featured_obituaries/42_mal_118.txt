        In 1968 he became the founding president of First Israel Bank, now Bank Leumi.
        He had been chairman of the board and a director of the Henry Street Settlement for many years.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Weiss; a son, Robert, of Manhattan; a sister, Henrietta Simerman of Danbury, Conn., and two granddaughters.
