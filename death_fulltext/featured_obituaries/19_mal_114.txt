        Leon McAuliffe, one of the early members of Bob Wills's popular swing band the Texas Playboys, died today at a local hospital after a long illness. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. McAuliffe played steel guitar with the Texas Playboys from 1935 to 1942 and then formed his own band after World War II. In recent years, he and other members of Mr. Wills's band occasionally played dance halls in the Southwest, reprising the songs that had made them famous.
        Among Mr. McAuliffe's contributions to the Texas Playboys's repertoire was ''Steel Guitar Rag,'' an instrumental that remained a favorite for years. He also co-wrote the classic ''San Antonio Rose.''
        For the past several years, he taught a class for aspiring musicians at Rogers State College in Claremore, Okla.
