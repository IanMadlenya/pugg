        Dr. Dawon Kahng, the president of the NEC Research Institute and a physicist whose inventions led to significant advances in electronic technology, died on May 13 at St. Peter's Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 61 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        Dr. Kahng died of complications following emergency surgery for a ruptured aortic aneurysm, said Star Wilmarth, a spokeswoman for the institute.
        Born in Seoul, South Korea, Dr. Kahng emigrated to the United States in 1955 to attend Ohio State University, where he received a doctorate in physics in 1959. He joined Bell Telephone Laboratories (now AT&T Bell Laboratories) in Murray Hill, N.J., and over the next two decades was an inventor in the field of solid-state electronics.
        Dr. Kahng's most significant inventions included the first operative silicon MOS transistor, a semiconductor that is the basic element in most of today's electronic equipment, and the floating gate memory cell, the foundation for many forms of semiconductor memory devices. He also made important contributions to the field of electroluminescence.
        Dr. Kahng received many honors. He was a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and a fellow of the Bell Laboratories. He was also a recipient of the Stuart Ballantine Medal of the Franklin Institute and the Distinguished Alumnus Award of the Ohio State University College of Engineering.
        After retiring from Bell Laboratories in 1988, Dr. Kahng became the founding president of the NEC Research Institute, which conducts long-term basic research in computer and communications technologies.
        Dr. Kahng is survived by his wife, Young Hee; five children, Kim U. Kahng-Wiesner, Vivienne, and Lily, all of New York City, Eileen, of Oakland, Calif., and Dwight, of Yardley, Pa., and one grandchild.
