        Richard Edes Harrison, one of the country's foremost map makers and a well-known New York bird-watcher, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 92.
        He had had a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Harrison, known as Ricki, was born in Baltimore. He was a 1923 graduate in zoology from Yale University, where he also earned a master's degree in architecture. He honed his skills as an illustrator and architect before going to work for Time-Life as a cartographer.
        He had come to that craft after studying a government publication on the nature of map projections. He opened his own company in Manhattan in the 1940's and remained active in his trade until five years ago.
        Mr. Harrison was known for his technique of hill shading, which renders a page in such a way that it appears three-dimensional. Using different maps from different sources, he could create new projections to fit his maps to the particular purposes for which they were intended.
        A striking example of this was Look at the World: The Fortune Atlas for World Strategy, which firmly established his reputation in 1944. His maps seemed to add the qualities of both sculpture and aerial photography to the more ordinary techniques of cartography. The text by the editors of Fortune magazine was brief and to the point, and the atlas became a great success.
        Mr. Harrison was a past president of the Linnaean Society of amateur photographers and professional ornithologists. A bird-watcher from the age of 10, he was frequently seen until a few years ago with groups scouting the parks of New York City in quest of unusual bird sightings.
        Mr. Harrison's wife of 47 years, Elizabeth Briggs Harrison, died in 1981. He is survived by two sons, Ross G. of Manhattan, and Samuel E. of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Dr. Elizabeth R. Harrison of New Haven, Conn., and two grandsons.
