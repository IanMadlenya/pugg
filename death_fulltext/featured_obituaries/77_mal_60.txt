        Dr. Alfred Funk, executive director of the German Society of the City of New York, died on Thursday at Jersey City Medical Center in Jersey City. A resident and native of Jersey City, he was 43.
        The cause was a heart attack, the society reported.
        Dr. Funk, an ordained minister, trained at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Oberursel, Germany, and received a doctor of theology degree from the University of Tubingen. He served in a number of pastorates in German-language churches in New York and New Jersey.
        He formerly was international editor of The Staats-Zeitung and Herold, the German-language newspaper published in New York City. He became executive director of the German Society in 1988.
        The society, formed in 1784, is one of the oldest chartered welfare organizations in the country. Among other things, it founded the Legal Aid Society, Lenox Hill Hospital and what is now the Apple Bank for Savings, and it helped set up the Travelers Aid Society. It continues to lend social assistance to German-speaking immigrants and their descendants.
        Dr. Funk is survived by his father, Alfred Funk of Brooksville, Fla., and a sister, Janice Wesermann of Hudson, Ohio.
