        Eugene Weintraub, a music publisher who helped introduce the music of contemporary Russian composers to American audiences, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications following surgery, said his wife, Lilien.
        In the early 1940's Mr. Weintraub worked with Toscanini, Horowitz and others to arrange the first American performances of works by Prokofiev, Kabalevsky, Khachaturian and others. He was instrumental in arranging the premiere of Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, using a microfilm of the score that had been smuggled out of the war-torn Soviet Union.
        The Russian-born Mr. Weintraub studied violin and conducting at the Juilliard School and performed with several orchestras before moving into music publishing. From 1944 to 1950 he was in charge of Soviet music for Leeds Publishing. He left Leeds to establish his own concern, Weintraub Music Company, which specialized in the works of such American composers as George Antheil and Virgil Thomson. He also was an editor for Music Sales Corporation, a New York publishing company, and sold his company to it in 1987 when he retired.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, David, of San Francisco; two brothers, Herman, of Brooklyn, and Irving, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Tillie Shulman of Manhattan.
