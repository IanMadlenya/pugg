        John R. McDermott, a former reporter, editor, publishing executive and documentary filmmaker, died on Friday in Hilton Head, S.C. He was 66 and lived in Hilton Head.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At the time of his death, Mr. McDermott, a former executive editor of Golf Digest magazine, was the editor of The Masters Journal, an annual publication he helped create for the Masters golf tournament.
        A native of New York, Mr. McDermott graduated from Columbia University in 1954 and began working as a reporter for Life magazine, where he eventually became senior editor for sports and adventure.
        During the late 1960's, he began working for the Delaware Museum of Natural History, writing and producing five documentary films. One of the films, "The Thing at Foxcatcher Farm," won a silver medal at the 1968 New York Film Festival.
        Mr. McDermott joined Diners Club International in 1969 as editor and president of Signature magazine, and in 1979 he became editorial director of Sport magazine.
        He joined The New York Times Company's magazines in 1982, initially as the executive editor of Golf Digest. In 1985, he became director of the company's special services division, overseeing its book, video, foreign licensing and custom publishing operations. He left The Times Company in 1993.
        He is survived by his wife, Polly, and two daughters, Megan Hersam of Wilton, Conn., and Morna Flanagan of Hilton Head.
