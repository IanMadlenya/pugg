        Richard C. Squires, who built a career on racket sports, including serving as publisher of tennis magazines, died Wednesday at his home in Rowayton, Conn. He was 72.
        The cause was emphysema, his wife, Dr. Joan Finn Squires, said.
        Mr. Squires won national titles in three racket sports: tennis, squash and platform tennis. He was versatile enough to compete in a sport he had never played before, frontenis, in the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Frontenis, a Latin-American racket game played on a three-walled court, was a demonstration sport at the Games.
        He went on to a successful business career, designing and operating the Downtown Racquet and Fitness Club in New Haven; becoming national advertising manager for Tennis Magazine; and publishing Tennis Buyer's Guide and Tennis USTA, both of which were owned by The New York Times at the time.
        He also wrote several books about racket sports, including ''Play Platform Tennis''; he did much to popularize platform tennis.
        Mr. Squires was born Sept. 27, 1931, in Manhattan and spent much of his youth in Bronxville, N.Y. In 1953, he graduated from Williams College, where he was captain of the tennis and squash teams.
        He is survived by his wife; his son, Gary Willard Squires of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; his daughters, Cathleen Ruth Squires of Rowayton, Conn., and Pamela Susan Reiss of Fairfield, Conn.; eight grandchildren; and his sister, Susie Leighton of Duxbury, Mass.
