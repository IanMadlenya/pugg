        Art Porter Jr., a saxophonist known for his work in jazz, rhythm-and-blues and pop music, died Nov. 23 in a boating accident in Bangkok, Thailand. He was 35.
        Mr. Porter, who grew up in Little Rock, Ark., was a prodigy. His father, Art Porter Sr., a professional musician,encouraged his son in his musical education. At 16, Mr. Porter attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for a year. When he returned to Little Rock, he worked with his father again until he was barred from playing in clubs because of his age. Then the Arkansas Attorney General, Bill Clinton, who had heard of his case, pushed a law through the Legislature allowing under-age performers to work under the supervision of a parent or guardian.
        Later, Mr. Porter worked with the organist Jack McDuff, the saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, the rhythm-and-blues singer Gene Chandler and the pop group After 7.
        In 1991, he signed with Verve Forecast records. He recorded four albums, his last, ''Lay Your Hands on Me,'' with the producer Chuckii Booker and the singers Lalah Hathaway and Brian McKnight.
        Mr. Porter is survived by his wife, Barbie, and two sons, Arthur 3d and Arrington.
