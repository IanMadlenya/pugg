        Frederick M. Stern, a Wall Street broker for more than 60 years and the chairman emeritus of Gruntal & Company, died of complications after a stroke on Thursday at Montefiore Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        Mr. Stern, who came to the United States from his native Germany in 1926, worked for several securities firms before opening his own, Stern & Company, in 1945. A specialist in bonds, he joined Gruntal in 1950.
        After he gave up the chairman's post three years ago, Mr. Stern remained active in the brokerage until last week.
        Mr. Stern is survived by his wife, the former Lotte Loewenstein, and by a sister, Gertrude Bodenheimer of Baltimore.
