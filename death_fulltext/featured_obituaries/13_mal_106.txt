        James Molinski, the host and dining-room manager at Sardi's restaurant for more than 30 years, died of a stroke Feb. 6 after gall stone surgery at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 74 years old and lived in Bayville, L.I.
        Mr. Molinski, who was known as Jimmy, began at Sardi's in 1937 as a glass washer, gradually working his way up to dining room manager. Vincent Sardi, his longtime employer, said Mr. Molinski ''was not the typical standoffish professional head waiter -he was always very warm.''
        His post just inside the door of the well-known theater district restaurant on West 44th Street allowed him to keep a paternal eye on diners and on the acting careers of many.
        ''He watched everyone grow up in the theater,'' said Max Klimavicius, Sardi's current dining-room manager. Mr. Molinski retired in 1980.  He is surivived by his wife, Rose; three daughters, Barbara Leto of Queens, and Joan Vicari and Diane Molinski, both of Bayville; six grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
