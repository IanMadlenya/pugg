        Robert E. (Bobby) Dill, a former New York Rangers defenseman and member of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame, died Tuesday in St. John's Hospice. He was 71 years old.
        His son Robert Jr. said that Mr. Dill had died of liver cancer.
        Mr. Dill earned a reputation for feistiness and skating ability with the Rangers from 1943 to 1945. In the five seasons that followed, he played with the minor league St. Paul Saints.
        After his playing career ended in 1950, Mr. Dill was a scout for the Rangers, the Chicago Blackhawks and the Minnesota North Stars.
