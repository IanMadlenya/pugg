        Lucille H. Loeb, a board member of the National Crime Prevention Council and a leading supporter of the Visiting Nurse Service, died on Sunday at her home in La Quinta, Calif., her family said. She was 92.
        Mrs. Loeb was the widow of Carl M. Loeb Jr., who helped to found the National Crime Prevention Council in 1982 and served as its chairman. The agency, based in Washington, works closely with the Justice Department and the Advertising Council to reduce crime, especially among teen-agers, and uses a dog named McGruff as its symbol. When Mr. Loeb died in 1985, Mrs. Loeb continued his work as a board member of the nonprofit organization.
        Lucille Helen Loeb was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 13, 1905, the only child of Lewis and Claudia Schamburg. Her mother's father was Samuel Snellenburg, the founder of the Philadelphia department store that bears his name.
        After graduating from Vassar, she married Mr. Loeb, a metallurgical engineer who was an executive with the Climax Molybdenum Company, which later became AMAX Inc. He was also a limited partner in Loeb, Rhoades & Company, a brokerage and investment banking firm that his father, Carl Sr., and his brother John had helped found, and that was later merged into Shearson and then American Express.
        Mrs. Loeb was a volunteer for the Visiting Nurse Service from 1936 to 1980. She was a member of its board and had been an important fund-raiser for many decades.
        She is survived by two sons, Carl M. Loeb 3d and Peter K. Loeb, both of Manhattan; a daughter, Constance Cohn of Edmonds, Wash., 10 grandchildren and 9 great-grandchildren.
