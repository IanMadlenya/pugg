        Robert T. Zintl, a journalist who was head of the Rome bureau of Time magazine and was a deputy managing editor of The Daily News in New York in the early 1980's, died yesterday in his office in Rome. He was 44 years old.
        The cause of his death remained uncertain, pending an autopsy by the Italian authorities, said Robert Pondiscio, a Time spokesman in New York.
        Mr. Zintl, who was known as Terry, worked as a reporter and editor for The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., and The Detroit Free Press before joining The Daily News in 1977.
        Mr. Zintl became Sunday editor of The Daily News in 1982 and later deputy managing editor. He joined Time as Nation Editor in 1984 and was named bureau chief in Rome in September 1990.
