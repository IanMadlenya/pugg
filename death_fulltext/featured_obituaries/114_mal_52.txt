        Soledad Seanez Holguin, the widow of the Mexican revolutionary hero Pancho Villa, died here on Thursday. She was 100.
        Over the years, several other women claimed to be Villa's widow, including some who had become his wife by his own proclamation.
        But in 1946 the legislature recognized Miss Seanez Holguin as Villa's wife after proving the pair had a civil and a church wedding on May 1, 1919.
        Villa formed his famed Northern Division in 1913 in an effort to gain control of Mexico after President Porfirio Diaz fled to Europe.
        He entered Mexico City in December 1914 in alliance with the revolutionary land reformer Emiliano Zapata.
        Villa was assassinated in 1923.
