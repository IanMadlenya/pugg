        Howard Sternheim, longtime president of the Thriftway Drug Corporation, a chain of 13 New York City drugstores including the East Side landmark Zitomer's, died on April 22 at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        The cause was leukemia, said his wife, Sharon.
        Mr. Sternheim was a founder and one of the main owners of Thriftway, which reported $66 million in sales during 2001.
        What has been called the Thriftway chain's crown jewel is Zitomer Pharmacy, a luxurious drugstore-cum-department store on Madison Avenue between 75th and 76th Streets. Its wares range from pharmaceutical products to toys to women's hats.
        In 1958 Mr. Sternheim founded Vanderveer Pharmacy in Brooklyn, which became the first store in the Thriftway chain. Two stores were added within the next two or three years. He became Thriftway's president in the late 1950's.
        The chain eventually had more than two dozen stores; 16 of them, including stores in all five boroughs of New York, were acquired in 1998 by CVS, another chain.
        Mr. Sternheim was on the board of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores and on the board of overseers of Long Island University's Arnold and Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy, which he attended after graduating from Brooklyn College. He was a native of Brooklyn.
        In the 1950's he was an Air Force medical supply officer, stationed in the United States.
        He was a supporter of the College of Pharmacy and of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan; two daughters from an earlier marriage, Deborah Corhan of Rockville Centre, N.Y., and Pattie Karnofsky of Roslyn, N.Y.; and five granddaughters.
