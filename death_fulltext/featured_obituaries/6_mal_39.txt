        Dr. Richard Langendorf, a cardiologist credited with helping to perfect interpretations of the electrocardiogram, died Wednesday. He was 79 years old.
        He served at Michael Reese Hospital here for almost 50 years.
        Along with other cardiologists, Dr. Langendorf established new principles in reading the electrocardiogram, which displays the electrical impulses of the heart and plots them graphically for interpretation.
        Dr. Langendorf fled his native Czechoslovakia after the Nazi invasion and moved to Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife, Raya, and three children.
