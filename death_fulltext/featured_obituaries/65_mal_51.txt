        Franklin F. Snyder, an associate professor emeritus of obstetrics and anatomy at Harvard Medical School, died on Tuesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 94 years old and lived in Newton Center, Mass.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his nephew, Frank Roth.
        Dr. Snyder was an authority on the respiration of the unborn, and his research was instrumental in showing that respiratory movements begin some weeks before birth.
        A 1919 graduate of Princeton University, he received his medical degree from Johns Hopkins Medical School in 1923, and a year later became a founding member of the faculty of the University of Rochester Medical School.
        Dr. Snyder was a professor of anatomy there until 1928, moving then to Johns Hopkins, the University of Chicago Medical School and finally Harvard, from which he retired in 1964.
        He is survived by a daughter, Dr. Elizabeth Lazar of Manhattan, and a grandson.
