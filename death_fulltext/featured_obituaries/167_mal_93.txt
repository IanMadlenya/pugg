        Stanley Blacker, a prominent maker of men's clothing who stitched his name to labels sold at upscale department stores across the country and overseas, died Monday at New York University Medical Center. He was 79 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer complicated by pneumonia, said Richard M. Squire, an executor.
        Mr. Blacker, who liked to be known as ''Mr. Sportcoats'' in the industry, was president of Stanley Blacker Inc., a company he started in 1955. The business is known as a designer and manufacturer of men's sport coats and men's and women's tailored clothing.
        It also licenses manufacturers in other countries to spread the Blacker imprint. They produce a wide array of apparel, from sportswear and dress shirts to women's walking shorts and socks.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Blacker studied business at New York University and design at the Philadelphia Textile School. After serving in the Army in World War II, he joined his father at Blacker Brothers, a clothing firm where he became familiar with all the aspects of the trade and rose to president.
        Upon the death of his father, Morris, he sold his interest in the company to form his own. Under his guidance, Stanley Blacker Inc. and its designer-brand labels found their niche in the American apparel industry.
        Mr. Blacker was a supporter of philanthropies and charitable causes. He served as a trustee of the Metropolitan Synagogue of New York for over 20 years.
        Mr. Blacker is survived by three daughters, Patricia Goldman of Manhattan, Gail Blacker of Sicily, Italy, and Lauren Blacker of Manhattan; a son, David, also of Manhattan; a sister, Elaine Uhlfelder of Manhattan; his companion, Vivienne Stevens, of Manhattan; and a grandson. His marriage to Jean Valente Blacker, of Manhattan, ended in divorce.
