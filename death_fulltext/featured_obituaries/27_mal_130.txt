        Richard Horn, a writer and design critic, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. He was 34 years and lived in Manhattan.
        A colleague and friend, Elizabeth Heyert, said death was caused by complications from tuberculosis.
        Mr. Horn wrote two books on design, ''Fifties Style: Then and Now'' and ''Memphis,'' which introduced the Memphis design movement to this country. With William Bergman, he wrote ''Recombinant Do-Re-Mi: Frontiers of the Rock Era,'' a book on contemporary music, and he contributed articles on new-wave design and contemporary culture to national publications.
        He also wrote plays, including ''Attached,'' written in collaboration with Phil Kline and performed at P.S. 1. He was an associate editor of Victoria, a magazine devoted to the romantic spirit of the Victorian era.
        Mr. Horn is survived by his father, Jerome, of Brooklyn, and his brother, Kenneth, of Scarsdale.
