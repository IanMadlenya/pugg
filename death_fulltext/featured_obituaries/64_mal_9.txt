        Purnell Handy Benson, a professor emeritus of business at Rutgers University and an expert on the fluctuations of stock prices, died on Monday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. He was 78 years old and lived in Madison, N.J.
        A family spokesman said that Dr. Benson died of a bone marrow disease.
        Dr. Benson joined the faculty of the Rutgers University Graduate School of Management in 1967, teaching marketing and price theory. After retiring in 1984, he lectured at the graduate business schools of New York University and Columbia University.
        In the early 1980's, Dr. Benson traced "disturbances" in the normal supply and demand functions in stock prices to the growing use of computerized trading programs. He became a vocal advocate of regulations to control program-induced stock market trading, lecturing at economic conferences and publishing his views in various newspapers.
        He is also author of a college textbook, "Religion in Contemporary Culture," published by Harper & Brothers in 1960.
        Surviving are his wife, Mary A.; a son, John C. of Wilton, Conn.; two daughters, Alice V. of Brooklyn Heights and Janice Sabky of Madison; two brothers, Jack of Fairfield, Conn., and George of Laconia, N.H., and six grandchildren.
