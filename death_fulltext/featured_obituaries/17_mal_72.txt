        Leon Temerson, a violinist who played in the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony and who was concertmaster of the Philharmonic Chamber Ensemble, died of heart failure Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 83 years old, and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Temerson was born in Paris in 1904, and studied at the Paris Conservatory with Lucien Capet. In 1921, he became associate concertmaster of the Paris Symphony Orchestra, under Pierre Monteux, and he remained in the orchestra until 1933, when he joined the National Orchestra. In 1941 he took a position with the Pittsburgh Symphony under Fritz Reiner.
        Mr. Temerson's career flourished in the United States. In 1942, he became assistant concertmaster of the Chicago Symphony, and in 1945 he made his New York recital debut at Town Hall. He joined the New York Philharmonic in 1946, and was a founder of the Philharmonic Chamber Ensemble, which gave premieres of works by such composers as Stravinsky, Milhaud, Carter, Hindemith and Babbitt, often under the composers' direction, between 1950 and 1960.
        After he retired from the New York Philharmonic, in 1972, Mr. Temerson continued giving solo recitals, and held teaching posts at Sarah Lawrence College and at schools in France and Switzerland.
        He is survived by his wife, Nadia, and a daughter, Catherine.
        A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue at 81st Street.
