        Mr. Stanley worked as a reporter for several newspapers in the Midwest and South and as a domestic and foreign correspondent and editor for The Associated Press.
        After serving in the Office of War Information in World War II, he worked in magazine publishing and public relations. He was the author of two historical novels, ''Thomas Forty'' and ''And the Rock Cried Out,'' and wrote for many magazines.

        One of his most notable series was ''Continental Classroom,'' an on-the-air course for which viewers could obtain college credit. After leaving NBC in 1968, he published the ''Teachers Guides to Television'' for 17 years.
        Mr. Stanley is survived by his wife, Gloria, of Tucson; two sons, Michael, of Calexico, Calif., and David, of Minneapolis; and 11 grandchildren.
