        Craig Raupe, a former top aide to House Speaker Jim Wright, died of a burst aorta today at Washington Hospital Center. He was 63 years old.
        The two men met in Weatherford, Tex., shortly after Mr. Raupe lost his job as a political science professor at West Texas State University. Mr. Raupe then taught at Weatherford College, and Mr. Wright, Mayor of Weatherford, hired him to run the town swimming pool.
        Mr. Raupe managed Mr. Wright's first campaign for Congress, in 1954, and followed him to Washington as his administrative assistant for nine years. He then worked as a Foreign Service officer in Indonesia, was twice deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee and spent 10 years as a vice president of Eastern Airlines.
        Mr. Raupe returned to work for Mr. Wright when the Congressman became majority leader. He later formed his own public relations company, Campbell-Raupe, with his fiancee, Jeanne Campbell.
        Mr. Raupe, a widower, is survived by two sons, Carl and Joel.
