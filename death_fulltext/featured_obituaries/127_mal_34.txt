        Saul Poliak, an innovator in industry trade shows and a major donor to his alma mater, Columbia University, died Aug. 2 at his home in West Redding, Conn. He was 92.
        Mr. Poliak's company, Clapp & Poliak, which he founded with Truman Clapp in 1929, was one of the first to manage trade shows, which were previously run by industry associations. Clapp & Poliak's trade exhibitions also expanded the reach of such shows, presenting products to different kinds of companies instead of to those in one field. For example, a double Chicago exposition produced by the company in 1960, the Product Engineering Show and the Machine Tool Exposition, featured 401 vendors with more than 11,000 products ranging from electronic sensor equipment that could measure moisture content in grain to a device to collect diamond dust from grinding wheels.
        Mr. Poliak headed the company after Mr. Clapp retired in 1953. In 1982, the company was sold to Reed International. In 1987, Mr. Poliak and Rita Kotch founded Kotch & Poliak, which also produces trade shows.
        Mr. Poliak was born in Russia and raised in Colorado. He graduated from Columbia in 1926, and before starting Clapp & Poliak worked as a reporter in Mexico for The Christian Science Monitor. In 1983, he and his wife, Janice, donated $3 million to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to establish a center for First Amendment issues. The center is named for the Poliaks.
        Mrs. Poliak died in 1989. There are no immediate survivors.
