        Thomas M. Coffey, a biographer and historian, died on Feb. 24 at his home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Linda.
        Mr. Coffey's book ''Hap: The Story of the U.S. Air Force and the Man Who Built It, General Henry 'Hap' Arnold'' (1982) was lauded by the British military historian John Keegan in a review in The Atlantic. General Arnold was chief of the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1946.
        Mr. Keegan said the book ''offers us a major study of the growth of American air power'' and ''depicts with great frankness an almost Freudian portrait of a supreme achiever.''
        Mr. Coffey's book ''Iron Eagle: The Turbulent Life of General Curtis LeMay'' (1986) was praised by Robert Sherrod, an authority on World War II, in The New York Times Book Review as ''an interesting biography of a major military figure'' who was one of the other great air commanders in World War II.
        Among the other books written by Mr. Coffey were ''Decision Over Schweinfurt: The U.S. 8th Air Force Battle for Daylight Bombing'' (1977), ''The Long Thirst: Prohibition in America 1920-1933'' (1975) and ''The Donkey's Gift'' (1984), a Christmas fable.
        A native of Aberdeen, S.D., Mr. Coffey grew up in Madison, Wis., studied at the University of Wisconsin and elsewhere and was a military pilot in the Pacific during World War II. In his early years as a writer he was a critic for the old Los Angeles Mirror.
        His first wife, the former Margaret Shindler, died in 1969.
        Besides his wife, no immediate family members survive.
