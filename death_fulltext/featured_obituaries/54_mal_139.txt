        Robert S. Dunham, former senior partner in Cooper & Dunham, a New York law firm, died on Monday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Dunham died of congestive heart failure, his son, Christopher, said.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Dunham represented American and foreign corporations in patent litigation. He retired in 1984.
        As patent counsel to Rutgers University's Institute of Microbiology, he obtained the basic patent granted to Selman A. Waksman for the development of the antibiotic streptomycin, an achievement for which Dr. Waksman won the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1952.
        From 1968 to 1971, Mr. Dunham was a director of the New York Patent, Trademark and Copyright Law Association, and from 1965 to 1968, he was chairman of the patents committee of the New York City bar association.
        During World War II, Mr. Dunham was a patent lawyer for the Manhattan Project, the initial effort to develop the atomic bomb. He was also a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserve.
        He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wesleyan University in 1927 and from Columbia University Law School in 1930.
        He was chairman of the Westport Board of Education from 1955 to 1961 and a former trustee of the Saugatuck Congregational Church.
        Besides his son, Christopher C., of Westport, Mr. Dunham is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Cooper; two daughters, Sally S. Dunham of Westport, and the Rev. Makanah E. Morriss of Yorklyn, Del., and five grandchildren.
