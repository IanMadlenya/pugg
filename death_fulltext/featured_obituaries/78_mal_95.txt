        Kingsley G. Morse, founder and president of Command Airways and a pioneer in commuter airlines, died on Saturday at his home in Millbrook, N.Y. He was 62.
        His wife, Ann Lawrance Morse, said the cause of death was a heart attack.
        Mr. Morse, a young entrepreneur with a dream, established his commuter company in 1965 in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., with seven employees and a fleet of five antiquated small planes flying a single route to Kennedy International Airport. In those early days, it was not uncommon to see the young airline president loading the baggage at his Dutchess County Airport terminal. Thriving Regional Airline
        He built Command Airways into a thriving regional airline with 538 employees and 15 planes operating out of 13 airports by 1988, when the airline was bought by AMR Eagle Inc. He had first teamed up with American Airlines in 1986 under a marketing agreement, operating under the name of American Eagle, and stayed on for one year after the sale, retiring in 1989.
        As the large national airlines gradually absorbed commuter companies or drove them out of business, Mr. Morse led an unsuccessful bid by a dozen small airlines to get the Civil Aeronautics Board to ban such takeovers. In 1985, their petition was rejected by the United States Department of Transportation.
        After relinquishing control of his airline, Mr. Morse remained active as a trustee of Vassar College, trustee emeritus of Vassar Brothers Hospital and chairman of the Riverside Bank in Poughkeepsie. He was also a member of the board of Fairchild Aircraft of San Antonio and former chairman of the Regional Airline Association.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Kingsley Jr., of Mountain View, Calif., and Charles W., of Brooklyn; two brothers, Charles, of Pasadena, Calif., and Wellslake of Dallas, and a sister, Barbara, of Sequim, Wash.
