        Dr. Steven R. Kohn, professor of dermatology at the Yale University School of Medicine, died on March 23 at his home in Guilford, Conn. He was 51.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said a brother, Donald.
        Dr. Kohn joined the Yale faculty four years ago after serving on the staffs of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Hackensack Medical Center. He was a graduate of Rutgers University and the Boston University School of Medicine.
        He is survived by his mother, Adele Kohn of Fort Lee, N.J., and two brothers, Dr. Donald Kohn and James Kohn, both of Guilford.
