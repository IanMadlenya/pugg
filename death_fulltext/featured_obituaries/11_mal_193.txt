        Charles J. V. Murphy, a biographer of the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor and Winston Churchill and a longtime journalist, died of lung cancer Tuesday at his home in Grafton, Vt. He was 83 years old and moved to Grafton in 1980 from Washington, where he had lived for many years.
        Mr. Murphy was the co-author, with J. Bryan 3d, of ''The Windsor Story,'' published in 1979. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Anthony Howard said it contained ''the best documented and least inhibited account we are ever likely to get of the long lonely years the Windsors spent in exile.''
        Mr. Murphy was also the co-author, with John Davenport, of ''The Lives of Winston Churchill'' (1945).
        Mr. Murphy was born in Newton, Mass., the son of an artist. He entered Harvard College at the age of 16 but left, without graduating, to join the staff of The Associated Press in Manhattan in 1925. He went on to work for the United Press, The New York Evening Post and The New York World before becoming a freelance writer in 1930.
        In 1936 he began a long association with Time Inc., joining the staff of Fortune magazine, from which he retired in 1966. He also did much reporting and writing for Life magazine.
        Mr. Murphy's wife, the former Jane Brevoort Walden, died in 1980.
        He is survived by a brother, Philip, of Waltham, Mass; two daughters, Anne Cappelen Smith of Trondheim, Norway, and Edythe M. Holbrook of Manhattan; two sons, Reginald, of Charlottesville, Va., and Charles, of Washington, and seven grandchildren.
