        Stanley F. Learned, former president and chief executive of the Phillips Petroleum Company, died on Saturday at his home in Charlotte, N.C. He was 92.
        Mr. Learned led the company, which refines and markets oil and natural gas, when it was expanding in Puerto Rico. He became president in 1962 and chief executive in 1964. After his retirement in 1967 he remained on the board for three years as vice chairman.
        In 1976, Phillips Petroleum and its chairman, as well as Mr. Learned and another former chairman, were indicted by a Federal grand jury in Tulsa, Okla.,  on charges that they had concealed $3 million in overseas bank accounts, some of which went to illegal corporate contributions to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972. The indictment was dismissed by a Federal judge in 1977.
        Mr. Learned joined Phillips Petroleum after receiving a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering from the University of Kansas in 1924. He was appointed chairman of the corporate operating committee in 1944, and a vice president of the company in 1949.
        For most of his 43-year career with Phillips Petroleum, Mr. Learned lived in  Bartlesville, Okla., where the company is based.
        His wife, Mary Helms Learned, died in 1984. He is survived by a daughter, Ann Fitch of Asheville, N.C., four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
