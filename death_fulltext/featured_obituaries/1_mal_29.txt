        Hundreds of people mourned Liberace at a memorial service today while a coroner, questioning the pianist's reported cause of death, examined his body for signs of AIDS.
        Liberace's body was taken to the Riverside County coroner's office on the order of the coroner, Raymond Carrillo, who wanted to know if AIDS was involved in the entertainer's death.
        Dr. Ronald Daniels, Liberace's personal physician, had reported the cause of death as cardiac arrest caused by congestive heart failure brought on by subacute encephalopathy, an inflammation of the brain. But Dr. Carrillo said, ''This is a case that should have been reported to the coroner's office.''
        Spokesmen for Liberace have repeatedly denied published reports that he had acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He died Wednesday at the age of 67.
        The squabble overshadowed the memorial service at Our Lady of Solitude Roman Catholic Church, less than a block from Liberace's home. About 250 mourners, including such film stars as Kirk Douglas, Isabel Sanford and Charlene Tilton, attended the service.
