        Kenneth L. Muse, a Hollywood animator who drew Mickey Mouse for Walt Disney, Tom and Jerry for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the Flintstones for Hanna-Barbera, has died. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Muse, who had lived in this San Luis Obispo County suburb since March, died Sunday, said Jay Sarbry, an animator at Hanna-Barbera. Mr. Muse was paid $22 a week to draw Disney's most famous character, said his granddaughter, Deborah Delcoure.
        He later moved to M-G-M, where he worked on the movie ''Anchors Aweigh,'' starring Gene Kelly. In one scene, the 1945 film combined live action and animation as Mr. Kelly danced with a cartoon mouse, which was drawn by Mr. Muse.
        Mr. Muse worked on the first Tom and Jerry cartoons and was known throughout the business for his drawing speed and prolific output, Mr. Sarbry said.
        When William Hanna and Joseph Barbera left M-G-M to form Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1959, Mr. Muse went with them. He worked on the Flintstones, the Jetsons, Scooby-Doo, Yogi Bear and numerous others.
