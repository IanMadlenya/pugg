        Wilmer C. Ames Jr., a writer and the founder and editor of a national magazine, died on Feb. 16 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 43 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Ames was the editor in chief of Emerge, a magazine he founded for middle- and upper-income black readers. It began publication in 1989 and has a circulation of 150,000.
        He began planning Emerge in 1984, in response to a memo from the Magazine Development Group at Time Inc., where he was a reporter for 11 years at Sports Illustrated and Time. Among the major issues he covered were the use of steroids by bodybuilders and brain damage from boxing.
        He also wrote freelance articles for other magazines, including cover articles for People and Family Weekly. He was the co-author of the book "Toughen Up: The Chuck Norris Fitness System."
        Earlier Mr. Ames held writing and editing jobs at the Equitable Assurance Company, New York City Health Services Administration, Columbia Press Encyclopedia and Broad Jump, an educational organization.
        Born in Nassawadox, Va., he grew up in Crosswicks, N.J. After graduating from Lincoln University, he earned a master's degree in journalism at Columbia.
        Surviving are his parents, Wilmer and Gertrude of Crosswicks; two brothers, Herbert, of Roebling, N.J., and Marvin, of Crosswicks, and a sister, Aurthuryne Barnes of Crosswicks.
