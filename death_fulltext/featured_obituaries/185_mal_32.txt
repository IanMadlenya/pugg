        Malcolm Bosse, an author of best-selling historical fiction and children's books, died on May 3 at his home in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. He was 75.
        The cause was esophageal cancer, his wife, Lori Mack, said.
        Mr. Bosse was perhaps best known for ''The Warlord,'' his 1983 historical novel set in China in the 1920's. It follows an American missionary who is attacked by bandits soon after arriving in China and joins their gang. The novel's characters include Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong and the warlords and generals fighting for control of China.
        Mr. Bosse wrote 22 novels, including ''Ganesh,'' made into the movie ''Ordinary Magic'' in 1993, and ''The Man Who Loved Zoos,'' which in 1987 became a movie starring Catherine Deneuve called ''Agent Trouble.''
        Malcolm Joseph Bosse Jr. was born in Detroit and grew up in Moline, Ill. After high school, he became a merchant marine and served in Asia, where he first experienced the cultures that would provide the backdrop for many novels.
        Mr. Bosse earned a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1950, then served in the United States Navy in Vietnam. It was then that he started his first novel, ''The Journey of Tao Kim Nam'' (1959). He earned a master's degree in English from the University of Michigan in 1956 and a Ph.D. in literature from New York University in 1969, and then began writing novels for young readers.
        He taught English literature at City College from 1969 to 1992. He traveled in India on a Fulbright scholarship and lectured for the United States State Department in China and India.
        His first wife, Janet Bosse, died after their divorce. His second marriage, to Marie-Claude Bosse, also ended in divorce. He is survived by Ms. Mack, his wife since 1996; their son, Mark; and a son from his second marriage, Malcolm-Scott Bosse.
