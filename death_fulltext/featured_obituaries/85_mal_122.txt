        Robert Trojanowicz, a professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University who was the leading academic advocate of community policing, died on Feb. 11 at his home in Holt, Mich. He was 52.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the university said.
        In 1983, Mr. Trojanowicz founded and became the director of the National Center for Community Policing, which was based at Michigan State. He had previously been the director of the university's School of Criminal Justice and a faculty member for 25 years.
        Community policing favors taking police officers out of patrol cars and putting them on foot in neighborhoods to help prevent crime rather that reacting to it.
        Mr. Trojanowicz was a consultant to police forces in Brazil, South Africa and India, as well as in many American cities. He wrote 12 books on police procedure and criminal justice and was regarded as one of the leading academics in law enforcement.
        Mr. Trojanowicz, whose father was a foot patrolman, received degrees in police administration and social work and a doctorate in social science from Michigan State.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; a son, Eric, of Lansing, Mich., and a daughter, Elise, also of Lansing.
