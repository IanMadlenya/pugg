        Jorge Dalto, an Argentine-born jazz pianist whose version of ''This Masquerade'' with the guitarist George Benson won a Grammy Award in 1976, died of cancer Tuesday in New York, his family said. He was 39 years old.
        Mr. Dalto died in his sleep after a long bout with the disease, which had kept him away from the music scene for more than a year, said a family spokeswoman, Dina D'Oyen.
        Mr. Dalto was born July 7, 1948, in Jorge Perez, Argentina. He studied piano in his home country and came to the United States in 1969.
        In 1973, he settled in New York, playing with Latin jazz groups such as Tito Puente's Latin Jazz Ensemble and the Machito band.
        Shortly afterward, he became a member of his fellow countryman Gato Barbieri's group, and got involved in the mid-1970's fusion movement, which mixed jazz and rock.
        He is survived by his wife, Adela, who is a singer, and two children.
