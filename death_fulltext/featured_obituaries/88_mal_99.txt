        Cecil Gould, a specialist in Renaissance painting and former keeper and deputy director of the National Gallery in London, died on April 7. He was 75 years old and lived in a village in Somerset, southwest England.
        Mr. Gould worked at the London museum from 1946 until his retirement in 1978. He wrote the catalogue of the gallery's collection of 16th-century Italian paintings as well as studies of Leonardo da Vinci, Correggio and Bernini and "Trophy of Conquest," an account of Napoleon's looting of artworks for the Louvre.
        In 1970, Mr. Gould, acting on a hunch and using X-rays, determined that the National Gallery's portrait of Pope Julius II, in the collection since 1824 and thought to be a copy, was the original by Raphael.
        No immediate family members survive.
