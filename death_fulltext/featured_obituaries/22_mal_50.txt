        Alfred D. Schiaffo, a judge in New Jersey Superior Court and a former Republican majority leader of the State Senate, died Saturday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital after a brief illness. He was 68 years old and lived in Hackensack.
        Judge Schiaffo, a native New Yorker, had planned to retire in December. He was elected to the State Senate in 1967 from Bergen County and re-elected in 1971. He was honored by the New Jersey Association of County Freeholders in 1971 as the Legislator of the Year. In 1973, he was named Senate majority leader.
        That same year he announced that he would not seek re-election for financial reasons. Several months later, Gov. William Cahill appointed him to the Bergen County Court. He was elevated to the Superior Court in 1976 by Gov. Brendan T. Byrne.
        He held a degree from John Marshall Law School and did graduate work in labor and municipal law at Cornell University.
        A widower, he is survived by two sons, Ronald, of St. Louis and Richard, of Fort Lee, N.J.; two daughters, Susan Folsom of Boulder, Colo., and Reene Fullam of Hackensack; a brother, Henry, of Lodi, and four grandchildren.
