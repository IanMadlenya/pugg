        Brother Albert Bernard McKenna, whose career as a Roman Catholic educator in New York and New Jersey spanned 54 years, died on Saturday in Lincroft, N.J.
        He was 77 years old and died of heart failure after several strokes, said associates at the Christian Brothers residence hall, a retirement home where he had been living.
        He was born in Pawtucket, R.I., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Manhattan College. He served as a teacher, principal and administrator at several Christian Brothers schools in Lincroft, New York City, Syracuse and Oakdale, N.Y. At one point he returned to his college alma mater to be director of student activities.
        He is survived by four sisters, Dorothy Brodeur, Anna Lynch, Lynne Tvenstrup and Mae McKenna.
