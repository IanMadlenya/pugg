        R. Leslie Kelley, who in 1926 first published the Blue Book to evaluate used-car prices, died Wednesday after a long illness. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Kelley opened his first used-car dealership in 1918. By the time he closed his dealership and retired in 1962, the Kelley Blue Book was being used widely by the automotive trade, banks and courts to determine the value of a used car.
        The Blue Book, still a Kelley family enterprise, was expanded in recent years to include new cars, motorcycles and recreational vehicles.
        Survivors include his wife, IngLis; two daughters, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter.
