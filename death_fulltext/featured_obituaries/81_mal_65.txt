        Dr. Eliot Stellar, a physiological psychologist associated with the University of Pennylvania since 1954, died on Tuesday at the University Medical Center in Philadelphia. He was 73 and lived in Ardmore, Pa.
        The cause was cancer, the university said.
        Throughout his academic career, Dr. Stellar conducted research on behavior and motivation, both human and animal. His work shed light on the physiological processes of the brain as they affect behavior.
        He wrote or co-wrote many books that appeared in foreign translations. He was the co-author of an influential textbook, "Physiological Psychology" (McGraw-Hill, 1950), as well as "Eating and Its Disorders" (Raven, 1983), and "The Neurobiology of Motivation and Reward" (Springer, 1985).
        He co-edited the five-volume "Progress in Physiological Psychology," which was published by Academic Press in the 1960's and 1970's. The series is still in print.
        Dr. Stellar served as university provost in the 1970's. He returned to teaching in 1978 as University Professor of Physiological Psychology in Anatomy. In 1990, at 70, he accepted a four-year term as interim chairman of the anatomy department, now the department of cell and developments biology.
        He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1977, serving as president for six years.
        A native of Boston, he graduated from Harvard University in 1941 and earned his master's and doctoral degrees in psychology at Brown University.
        Dr. Stellar is survived by his wife of 49 years, Betty; a son, James, of Boston; a daughter, Liz Fallon of Westfield, N.J.; a brother, Lawrence, and two sisters, Anita Karp and Ruth Klein, all of Boston; another brother, Stanley, a resident of New Jersey; and five grandchildren.
