        Mr. Steptoe came to national attention in 1969 when his first work, ''Stevie,'' was published in its entirety by Life magazine before its issuance by Harper & Row. ''Stevie'' was about a young boy living in a black ghetto.
        ''Stevie'' was named by the American Library Association as a notable children's book. Mr. Steptoe began work on it when he was 16 years old in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. The model for the character was Mr. Steptoe's younger brother. The author was not yet 19 when ''Stevie'' was published. Illustrated 15 More Books
        Mr. Steptoe illustrated 15 more volumes, 9 of which he also wrote. Two books, ''The Story of Jumping Mouse'' (1985) and ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters'' (1988), were named Caldecott honor books by the library association, recognizing the quality of their illustrations.
        Mr. Steptoe also received the Coretta Scott King Award for Illustration for ''Mother Crocodile'' (1982), and for ''Mufaro's Beautiful Daughters,'' which was based on an old African tale.
