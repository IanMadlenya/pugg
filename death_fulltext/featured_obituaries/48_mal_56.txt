        Dr. Isadore Schlamowitz, a specialist in cardiology and gastroenterology for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at Cabrini Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He apparently suffered a heart attack, said his wife, the former Beatrice Siegal.
        Dr. Schlamowitz, who developed techniques for managing elevated cholesterol levels in cardiac patients, was an attending physician at Beekman Downtown Hospital and a staff physician in internal medicine and gastroenterology at the Beth Israel Medical Center. He maintained a private practice in Manhattan.
        He was a graduate of City College and of the New York University Medical School. An accomplished violinist, Dr. Schlamowitz was concert master of the City College Symphony Orchestra.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Frances Grodzinsky of New Haven, Merry Burke of Putnam, Conn., and Patricia Eckstein of Los Angeles; a son, Daniel Venet of Chappaqua, N.Y.; two stepdaughters, Kate Venet of Manhattan, and Marjorie Strauss of Queens; two brothers, Dr. Sam Schlamowitz of Vero Beach, Fla., and Dr. Max Schlamowitz of Houston; a sister, Helene Peritz of the Bronx, and six grandchildren.
