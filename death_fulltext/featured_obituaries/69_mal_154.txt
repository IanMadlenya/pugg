        Ralph Ettlinger, an inventor and co-developer of a long-term health-care program that serves the elderly in their homes, died on Wednesday at the Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Md. He was 75 years old and lived in Annapolis.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Kansas City, Mo., Mr. Ettlinger graduated from Northwestern University. He was a longtime resident of Highland Park and Glencoe in Illinois before retiring to Heritage Harbour in Annapolis.
        Mr. Ettlinger held 18 patents in the food-service industry, including one for a plastic dishwashing rack. More recently he was co-founder and president of the Heritage Harbour Health Group.
        Mr. Ettlinger is survived by his wife of 51 years, Margery; a daughter, Betsy Chotin of Washington; a son, Steve, of Manhattan; two brothers, Edward and Richard, both of Highland Park; and three grandchildren.
