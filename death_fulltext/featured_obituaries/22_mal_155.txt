       Alphaeus Philemon Cole, who began his career as a portraitist when Post-Impressionists like Seurat and Signac were considered avant-garde painters, died of heart failure yesterday at his home in the Chelsea Hotel. He was 112 years old.
        Alphaeus Philemon Cole, who began his career as a portraitist when Post-Impressionists like Seurat and Signac were considered avant-garde painters, died of heart failure yesterday at his home in the Chelsea Hotel. He was 112 years old.
        Mr. Cole, whose work is in the permanent collections of London's National Portrait Gallery, the Brooklyn Museum and several universities, became a member of the Salmagundi Club, the nation's oldest professional art club, in 1918, and was elected to the National Academy of Design in 1930. He was said to enjoy telling of his tea in London with John Singer Sargent and William Merritt Chase.
        Mr. Cole, whose father was Timothy Cole, a noted 19th-century engraver of Old Master paintings, was born in Jersey City, N. J., on July 12, 1876.
        He studied in Paris at the Academie Julian, under Jean Paul Laurens and Benjamin Constant, and at the Ecole des Beaux Arts.
        His preference was for the work of 19th-century salon painters, and he expressed little admiration for Modernism and its progeny. Mr. Cole said in an interview 10 years ago of an exhibition of Lee Krasner's paintings at the Whitney Museum: ''I thought it was even worse than her husband's. What was his name? Pollock.''
        Mr. Cole was married to Margaret Ward Wamsley, a sculptor, in 1903; she died in 1961. The next year he married Anita Rio Higgins, a singer, who died in 1973.
