        Gerald M. Quinn, dean of Fordham University's College at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, died in a traffic accident in New Jersey on Tuesday. He was 50 years old and lived in the Bronx.
        Mr. Quinn was a passenger in a car that went out of control and crashed, killing him instantly, the university said.
        He worked most of his career at Fordham in a variety of academic and administrative posts.
        Born and reared in Brooklyn, he was a graduate of Fordham College and earned his master's and doctoral degrees in classical philosophy at Harvard University. He was a Capps Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens and wrote a textbook on Greek.
        He was on the Fordham faculty from 1967 to 1969, then taught at Herbert H. Lehman College in the Bronx and the City University of New York. In 1979 he returned to Fordham's Bronx campus as an assistant dean and later associate dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. In 1985 he became associate vice president of academic affairs and was promoted to dean of the Lincoln Center campus in 1989.
        He is survived by his mother, Elizabeth, of the Bronx; a brother, Kevin E., of Voluntown, Conn., and a sister, Sheila Gargano of Mahopac, N.Y.
