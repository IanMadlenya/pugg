        Caesar Nobiletti, a New York real estate lawyer associated with a number of well-known building projects, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 89 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Nobiletti graduated from City College and Fordham University Law School and practiced for 60 years, until his retirement in 1990 as a consultant in real estate law.
        Over the years, he was affiliated with various law firms and financing concerns, including the City Investing Company, of which he was a vice president in the late 1940's, and later its legal counsel.
        He had a role in the development of Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. He was a past president of the Council of Savings Bank Attorneys, a governor of the Real Estate Board of New York, a director of Home Title Insurance Company, and a member of the advisory board of the Forest Hills Gardens Corporation.
        He also directed annual fund drives in his industry for the American Red Cross, the March of Dimes and the Legal Aid Society.
        Mr. Nobiletti is survived by his wife of 48 years, Eleanor Musante Nobiletti; four daughters, Ann Rodi of Burr Ridge, Ill., and Jane Nobiletti, Donna LaSala and Paula Nobiletti, all of Manhattan; a son, Michael, of Westhampton Beach, L.I.; a brother, John; a sister, Mary Curcio, and six grandchildren.
