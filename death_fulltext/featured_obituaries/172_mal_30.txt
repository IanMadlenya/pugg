        Terry Ryan, an award-winning comedy writer, died on Saturday at his home in New York. He was 78.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ryan began his career writing for the Fred Allen radio show in the late 1940's. After he switched to television, he became a staff writer for ''The Phil Silvers Show'' from 1954 to 1959. His writing for the series won him Emmy Awards in 1955 and 1957. He went on to write for ''Car 54, Where Are You?'' and received an Emmy nomination for his work on that show in 1962.
        Born in Cleveland, Mr. Ryan attended Case Western Reserve University and served in the Army during World War II.
        His other television credits include ''Love, American Style,'' ''The Betty Hutton Show,'' ''The Ann Sothern Show'' and ''The Sid Caesar Show.''
        He is survived by his wife, Maren; a daughter, Cynthia Ryan of Brooklyn, N.Y.; a son, Douglas of Bennington, Vt.; a brother, Gordon of Australia; and three grandchildren.
