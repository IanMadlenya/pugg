        Sigmund L. Miller, a prominent Connecticut lawyer, died on Tuesday in Bridgeport Hospital. He was 82.
        Mr. Miller, who lived in Easton, Conn., died from injuries sustained in a head-on automobile collision in Fairfield, Conn., on Sept. 22, Harold Rosnick, Mr. Miller's law partner for 23 years, said.
        Mr. Miller was the founding partner of Miller, Rosnick & D'Amico of Bridgeport and a member of the Connecticut bar for 59 years.
        He specialized in the divorces of prominent people and had a civil trial practice, mostly negligence matters. In a recent case before the state's Supreme Court, he won a decision that overturned 62 years of precedent in Connecticut workers' compensation cases, allowing a decedent's estate to recover benefits that had previously been denied.
        Born in New York and raised in Bridgeport, Mr. Miller graduated from Harding High School, received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1932 and a law degree from Harvard University in 1935.
        He was a founder of Park City Hospital in Bridgeport.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; two daughters, Sophia, of Athens, Ga., and Elizabeth A. Weatherford of San Antonio; two sisters, Bonnie Burstein of Passaic, N.J., and Lani Schechter of Manhattan.
