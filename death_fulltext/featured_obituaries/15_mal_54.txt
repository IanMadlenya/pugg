        C. Gilbert Taylor, a self-taught aircraft designer whose Taylor Cub evolved into the overwhelmingly successful Piper Cub of the 1930's and 1940's, has died March 29 in Houston. Mr. Taylor, who was 89 years old, had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than a year, said his daughter, Carol Taylor Sharp.
        In 1928, Mr. Taylor was invited by the Chamber of Commerce of Bradford, Pa., to come to town to begin production of a two-seat airplane called the Chummy. Chamber members, who invested $50,000 in the product, selected William Piper to represent them on the board of Mr. Taylor's company, Taylor Brothers Aircraft.
        In partnership with Mr. Piper, Mr. Taylor designed and sold the Taylor Cub, a lightweight two-passenger airplane. It sold well, but Taylor Brothers went bankrupt in the Depression and Mr. Piper, who had become treasurer in the reorganization, bought out Mr. Taylor's interest in 1936.
        Mr. Piper manufactured the aircraft under the Piper Cub label.
        The Piper Aircraft Company went on to build more than 20,000 of the simple, yellow airplanes, which sold at first for about $700 apiece.
        Mr. Taylor designed another single-engine aircraft in 1936, the Taylorcraft, which was also highly successful.
        Mr. Taylor, who was born in Rochester, is survived by five children.
