        Gerald Chapman, the founder, first artistic director and for the past three years education director of the Young Playwrights Festival in New York City, died Wednesday night at Beth Israel Hospital. He was 37 years old.
        The guild and the hospital did not give the cause of death. David Levine, the guild's president, said Mr. Chapman's parents, who live in Taunton, England, were flying yesterday to New York.
        Mr. Chapman, who graduated with honors from Cambridge University in 1971, was director of the Young People's Theater and the annual Young Writers' Festival at the Royal Court Theater in London the late 1970's. In 1980, he was invited by Stephen Sondheim, who was Dramatists Guild president then, to start a similar project here. The festival won a Drama Critics Circle Award in 1983.
        Mr. Chapman also directed many new plays by fledgling and established writers at the Circle Repertory Company, the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and the Double Image Theater at Vassar, among others.
        Two years ago he directed a season of new American plays in London, and was a guest director in the same year at the International Young Playwrights Festival in Sydney, Australia. Last November Mr. Chapman directed Sloane Bosniak in the New York premiere of Arnold Wesker's ''Annie Wobbler,'' a trio of one-act monologues about the plight of women, at the Westbeth Theater Center. He taught drama workshops at Bard and Smith colleges, New York University, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn., and the Aspen Institute in Colorado.
        He is survived by his parents and a brother, who also lives in England.
