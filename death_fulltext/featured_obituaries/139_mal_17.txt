        Everett Hafner, a founding dean of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., died on Sunday when the plane he was piloting crashed near Worthington, Mass. He was 78 and lived in Williamsburg, Mass.
        The cause of the crash was under investigation, the authorities said.
        Hampshire College, an experimental college created in 1965, gives its students major responsibility for planning their courses of study. Dr. Hafner, was the college's first dean of natural science and mathematics, retired in 1976 and pursued other interests, including composing.
        Dr. Hafner is survived by two daughters, Sarah Hafner of Conway, Mass., and Katie Hafner of Sonoma, Calif.; three sisters, Marylin Hafner of Cambridge, Mass., Sylvia Sloan of Carlsbad, Calif., and Katherine Gottsegen of Bedford Hills, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
