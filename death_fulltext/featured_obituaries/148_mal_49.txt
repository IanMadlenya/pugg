        Dr. David Fox, a physicist who was blacklisted and indicted for contempt when he refused to testify fully before the House Un-American Activities Committee at the dawn of what would become known as the McCarthy era, died last Monday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived in Setauket, N.Y.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Margalit Fox of Manhattan.
        Mr. Fox, who was born in Brooklyn, received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from the University of California at Berkeley.
        While working on his Ph.D., in 1949, Dr. Fox, a Communist sympathizer, testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee but declined to answer all of the questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right to protect himself from self-incrimination. The refusal resulted in Dr. Fox's losing his teaching assistant post, even though he had signed an oath pledging allegiance to the United States. It also effectively kept him from being employed as a physicist in the United States after he received his doctorate in 1951.
        Dr. Fox, who was later acquitted of his contempt charge after the Supreme Court clarified its position on the Fifth Amendment in 1951, then taught at Haifa Technion in Israel for four years. In 1956, he won a teaching position at the University of Rochester, moving three years later to the College of Long Island of the State University in Oyster Bay, N.Y. He stayed at the school, which moved to Stony Brook and changed its name to the State University at Stony Brook, until retiring in 1991.
        Dr. Fox, whose expertise was in solid state theory, was also the first dean at the graduate school at Stony Brook.
        Besides his daughter, Margalit, an editor with The New York Times Book Review, he is survived by his wife, the former Laura Garfield; two other daughters, Robin Fox of Portland, Ore., and Erica Fox of Pusan, South Korea, and one grandchild.
