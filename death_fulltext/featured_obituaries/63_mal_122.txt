        Milton Rosenstock, a music director who worked in theater and ballet, died on April 24 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 years old in Manhattan.
        He died of heart disease, said a spokesman for Dance Theater of Harlem, where Mr. Rosenstock had been principal conductor since 1981.
        From the 1940's to the late 1970's, Mr. Rosenstock was the music director for some 25 Broadway shows, including "Funny Girl," "Finian's Rainbow," "Gypsy," "The Music Man," "Bells Are Ringing" and "The King and I." He was also the music director of American Ballet Theater and of the Lyric Chamber Theater, a small opera group that toured Eastern colleges, in the 1960's. A Job Offer From Irving Berlin
        Born in New Haven, Mr. Rosenstock began playing the clarinet at the age of 10 and received a New York Philharmonic scholarship three years later. He also trained in conducting and composition at the Juilliard School of Music and received the Alice M. Ditson award for American conductors, given by Columbia University. Mr. Rosenstock was an Army sergeant when he conducted his first musical, "This Is the Army," at the request of Irving Berlin.
        On his discharge from the Army, he went to work on Broadway, telling himself he could always compose "on the side," as he once told an interviewer. He abandoned composing, but he eventually worked with stars like Judy Holliday, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand and Yul Brynner.
        His companion was Karen Stefko of New York City.
        He is survived by a son, George, of Los Angeles; two daughters, Karen Greene of South Sandwich, Mass., and Linda Estrin of the Bronx, and four grandchildren.
