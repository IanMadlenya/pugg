        Gerald J. Lieberman, a former Stanford University provost and an expert in statistics and operations research, died on Tuesday at his home on the Stanford campus in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 73.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, according to a statement from the university.
        In his later years, as his condition worsened, Mr. Lieberman was a research subject at Stanford's Center for the Study of Language and Information, working with engineers who were designing communications devices for the disabled.
        He tested a variety of equipment, including a voice synthesizer that researchers outfitted with special word-prediction software. His synthesizer was programmed so that he could rattle off his favorite catch phrase -- ''Take the rest of the day off!'' -- with a single stroke.
        Mr. Lieberman was provost or acting provost during the presidencies of three Stanford leaders and held several other administrative positions, including vice provost and dean of graduate studies and research and associate dean of humanities and sciences.
        Mr. Lieberman was born on Dec. 31, 1925, in Brooklyn. He graduated from Cooper Union in 1948 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1949. He received his doctorate from Stanford in 1952. The next year, he joined the Stanford faculty in statistics and industrial engineering.
        He retired in 1995. At the time of his death, he was professor emeritus of operations research and statistics.
        Mr. Lieberman is survived by his wife, Helen; three daughters, Janet Lieberman Argyres of Castro Valley, Calif., and Joanne Lieberman and Diana Lieberman, both of Palo Alto; a son, Michael Lieberman of Palo Alto; a sister, Shirley Ross of Great Neck, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
