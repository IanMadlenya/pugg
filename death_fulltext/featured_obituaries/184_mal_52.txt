        Michael Maas, a versatile New York architect who had been president of the Fifth Avenue Association, died last Sunday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in Westhampton Beach, N.Y.
        The cause was complications from cancer, said his wife, Jane.
        Mr. Maas retired 10 years ago as senior managing partner of the Manhattan-based architectural, engineering and interior design firm HLW, formerly Haines Lundberg Waehler, where he worked for 40 years.
        He was one of the architects of the early 1980's project that added a glass-enclosed atrium to the front of the Chemical Bank building on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Among his other projects were buildings for the Bank of New York, the United States Army and Harvard University.
        A native New Yorker, he received his architectural degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Kate of Manhattan and Jenny of Remsenberg, N.Y.; and a granddaughter. His brother Peter Maas, the writer, died last year.
