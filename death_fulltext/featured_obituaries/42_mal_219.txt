        Patrick Butler, who helped establish the Hazelden Foundation as an international leader in the treatment of alcoholism and drug addiction, died Saturday after a four-month illness. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Butler began his 20-year term as the foundation's president in 1952 and had been senior chairman of the board since April 1989.
        Through his work, Hazelden in 1953 established Fellowship Club in St. Paul, one of the nation's first halfway houses for alcoholics.
        The methods of treating alcoholism that originated at the center have become the model for such treatment around the world.
