        Frank Harris Johnson, a retired professor of biology at Princeton University, died on Saturday at Princeton Medical Center in New Jersey. He was 82 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He died of complications from a recent stroke, a university spokesman said.
        In 1960, Dr. Johnson helped separate luciferin, a light-emitting compound, from a South Pacific luminescent fish and isolate the luciferin crystals. He also focused his bioluminescent investigations on studies of antibiotic compounds, basic mechanisms of drug action and environmental factors like deep-ocean temperature and pressure. His research led to the development of the most sensitive test for calcium in muscle tissue.
        He was a native of Raleigh, N.C., and a 1930 graduate of Princeton. He received a master's degree from Duke University in 1932 and a doctorate from Princeton in 1936. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1937 and retired in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Frances McGhee; three daughters, Lanie Johnson of Manhattan, Mary Frances Cunningham of Bridgeport, N.Y., and Charlie Pierce of Lawrenceville, N.J., and four grandchildren.
