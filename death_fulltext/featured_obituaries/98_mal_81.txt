        Judge Juan G. Burciaga, whose 1982 ruling put the National Collegiate Athletic Association out of the business of televised football, died on March 5 at Presbyterian Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. He was 65 and lived in Albuquerque.
        The cause was an aortic aneurysm, said a spokeswoman for the Federal District Court in Albuquerque, where Judge Burciaga was formerly Chief Judge.
        Judge Burciaga was an appointee of President Jimmy Carter and one of the few Hispanic judges on the Federal bench. He served as Chief Judge from 1990 until last summer, when he became a senior judge carrying a full case load.
        In 1982 he wrote that the N.C.A.A. had acted like a "classic cartel" and had violated antitrust laws with its television football contracts. With this ruling, 30 years of the N.C.A.A.'s exclusive control over viewing rights crumbled. The ruling opened the way for athletic conferences, independent colleges and others to compete for those rights and negotiate their own terms.
        The United States Supreme Court upheld Judge Burciaga's decision in 1984, and the N.C.A.A. left the business of televised football.
        Judge Burciaga was born in Roswell, N.M. He dropped out as a pre-medical student at the University of Colorado to accept an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point.
        He earned his law degree at the University of New Mexico and was in private practice before President Carter named him to the bench.
        Judge Burciaga is survived by his wife, Dolores; four daughters, Lisa Segura, Lora Trujillo, Amy Nieto and Pamela Kirchner; a son, Charles; and 10 grandchildren. His first wife, Carolyn Jacoby Burciaga, died in 1973.
