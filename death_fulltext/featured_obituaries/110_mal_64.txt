        Craig Logan Jackson, an interior designer best known for the innovative D. F. Sanders & Company housewares stores in the 1980's, died on Thursday at Tisch Hospital of New York University Medical Center. He was 45 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, a friend, William Hibsher, said.
        Mr. Jackson and David F. Sanders, who were companions, opened the first Sanders store on West Broadway in 1980. A showcase of high-style furniture and objects, the store drew crowds and spawned branches on Madison Avenue and East 57th Street. Mr. Sanders died of complications from AIDS in 1989.
        Mr. Jackson was a board member of the Hetrick-Martin Institute, a social-service agency for lesbian and gay youths, and helped furnish its quarters at 2 Astor Place.
        He is survived by his companion, Manuel Casteleiro Fernandez; his mother, Win Locke, a brother, Keith, and a sister, Susan Miller, all of Chicago.
