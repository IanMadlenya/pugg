        Oscar H. Davis, a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, died of cancer yesterday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 74 years old and lived in southwest Washington.
        Judge Davis had served on the Federal bench for more than 25 years.
        Born in Manhattan, Judge Davis attended public schools in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He graduated summa cum laude from Harvard in 1934 and from Columbia Law School in 1937.
        After two years in private practice in New York, he joined the Justice Department. He represented the Government in a number of sensitive cases, including Washington's efforts in the late 1950's to deport aliens who had been members of the Communist Party.
        After serving as a captain in the Army Air Corps in World War II, Judge Davis returned to Washington and joined the Solicitor General's office in 1946. In 1954 he was named the first assistant to the Solicitor General. In 1962, President Kennedy appointed him an Associate Judge to the United States Court of Claims, which has since become of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
        Judge Davis is survived by a brother, Dr. Lawrence Davis of Louisville, Ky.
        The funeral will be 11 A.M. tomorrow at the Adas Israel Congregation in Washington.
