        Mr. Warren died of complications after surgery for an aneurysm, said his wife, Mildred.
        Mr. Warren, who was also a novelist, producer and director, wrote the pilot episode for ''Gunsmoke'' for CBS, and in 1955 he began producing the series, which starred James Arness. He directed 26 episodes in the first year and also wrote five of the original teleplays.
        In 1958, he created ''Rawhide'' for CBS, starring an unknown actor named Clint Eastwood, and three years later ''The Virginian.'' He also wrote for ''Playhouse 90'' and produced the ''Iron Horse'' series, which starred Dale Robertson.
        Charles Marquis Warren was born in Baltimore and graduated from Baltimore City College, where he began writing musical plays. It was then that he met F. Scott Fitzgerald, who became Mr. Warren's mentor and friend.
        Mr. Warren began his career writing fiction for magazines and became a regular contributor to The Saturday Evening Post. Three of his Post serials became best-selling novels. Another, ''Only the Valiant,'' was made into a film with Gregory Peck in 1950.
        Mr. Warren is survived by his wife, the former Mildred Lindeberg; three daughters from a previous marriage, and four grandchildren.
