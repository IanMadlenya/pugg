        Israel Cohen, the chief executive officer of Giant Food Inc. and chairman of  its board of directors, died at his home here on Wednesday, company officials said today. He was 83.
        The cause was complications associated with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a spokesman said.
        Mr. Cohen is credited with the expansion of Giant from one store in 1936 to  the current 164.
        His father, N. M. Cohen, and Samuel Lehrman opened the first Giant Food store in February, 1936, in Washington. At that time, Mr. Cohen drove the company's only truck.
        Giant Food now operates 164 supermarkets in Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. The company said it had sales of $3.8 billion last year.
        In addition to his sister, Mr. Cohen is survived by a daughter, Dana, of McLean, Va; a son, Peter, of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; and two grandchildren.
