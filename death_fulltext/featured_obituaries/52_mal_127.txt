He then co-founded Hirshon, Roth & Company. He retired in 1982.
        In addition to his daughter Joy Briggs of Manhattan, he is survived by his wife, the former Helen Gross; another daughter, Wendy Morse of Northridge, Calif.; two stepsons, John Raiss of Los Angeles and James Raiss of Philadelphia; a stepdaughter, Linda Dodd of Bronxville, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
