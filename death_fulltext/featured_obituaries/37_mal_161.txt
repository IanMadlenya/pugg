        Mr. Ostwald fled from Nazi Germany to England in 1938 and came to the United States two years later. He served in the Army during World War II. He later became blind from retinitis pigmentosa, an inherited disease that destroys the retina and optic nerve.
        A graduate of Harvard Law School, he was in private practice in Manhattan, first as a partner with Ostwald & Weinberg and later with his own firm. He was on Cape Cod serving as a guide for sighted visitors to the Cape Cod National Seashore. He was active in many organizations, including Art for the Blind, Self Help Community Services and the National Foundation for Eye Transplant Research.
        He is survived by two daughters, Julie Lowy and Susan Barnes, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Laura Ostwald, also of Manhattan.
