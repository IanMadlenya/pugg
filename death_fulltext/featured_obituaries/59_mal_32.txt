        Stanley Platos, a fashion designer and manufacturer, died on Wednesday at Christiana Hospital in Wilmington, Del. He was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver failure resulting from complications from AIDS, said Robert Weinstein, chief executive officer of Stanley Platos/Martin Ross.
        Stanley Platos/Martin Ross, a Seventh Avenue dress house, was begun eight years ago by Mr. Platos and Mr. Ross, who served as co-designers. The company will be continued by Mr. Ross, Mr. Weinstein said.
        Mr. Platos attended the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Traphagen School of Design and New York University. He worked for Givenchy and Valentino before opening his company, which specializes in festive cocktail and evening dresses. It made clothes for private clients, including Linda Evans, Mary Tyler Moore, Ethel Kennedy, Jan Chipman, Buffy Cafritz and Anne Ford Johnson. The clothes are sold by such stores as Neiman-Marcus, Bergdorf-Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue.
        Mr. Platos was a member of the Empire State Plaza Art Commission, the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committe and a trustee of St. Michael's Home for the Aged.
        His companion was Mr. Ross.
        He is survived by his parents, Irene and Thomas Platos of Wilmington and his brother, Michael, of New York City.
