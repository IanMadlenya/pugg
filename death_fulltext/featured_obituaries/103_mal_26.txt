        John Coolidge, arts professor emeritus and former director of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, died on Monday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 81 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        Born in Cambridge on Dec. 16, 1913, Mr. Coolidge held a bachelor's degree from Harvard and a master's degree and Ph.D. from New York University, where he studied at the Institute of Fine Arts. He was a founding member of the Society of Architectural Historians in 1940. He taught at Vassar and at the University of Pennsylvania before going to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1947.
        He was named director of the Fogg Art Museum in 1948, a position he held for 20 years. Mr. Coolidge is credited with strengthening the museum's holdings in contemporary art and with expanding its educational services. He played a central role in mounting the show "Three American Painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella" in 1965 and acquired for the Fogg its first paintings by Morris Louis and Mr. Noland.
        Professor Coolidge resigned as director of the Fogg in 1968, but continued to teach at Harvard until 1984. He was a trustee of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts from 1949 to 1975 and served as president of the museum during the years 1973-75.
        He was the author of several books, including "Mill and Mansion" (1942), a socio-architectural study of Lowell, Mass.; "Patrons and Architects: Designing Art Museums in the 20th Century" (1989), and "Gustave Dore's London" (1994). He also wrote a number of articles on American architecture and Baroque sculpture. He was appointed the Samuel H. Kress Professor for the 1991-92 academic year at the National Gallery of Art's Center for Advanced Study in Visual Arts, a position reserved for a distinguished art historian.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Welch Coolidge; a daughter, Mary-Elizabeth Warren; a brother, Archibald; four sisters, Theresa Cerutti, Rachel Kimball, Jane Whitehill and Elizabeth Moizeau; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
