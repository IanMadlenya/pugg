        Donald J. Sutherland, the founder and chief executive of Quincy Partners of Glen Head, N.Y., one of the first leveraged buyout firms, died on Sunday at his home in Glen Head. He was 71.
        The causes were cancer and complications from Parkinson's disease, said a daughter, Paige C. Sutherland.
        Mr. Sutherland started Quincy Associates in 1970 and, with other investors including Credit Suisse and the Hillman Company, took the lead in buying 18 companies. The firm became Quincy Partners in 1975.
        Mr. Sutherland graduated from Princeton University in 1953 and received an M.B.A. from Harvard in 1958. He served in the Navy for three years. From 1985 to 1987, he was the president of the Joffrey Ballet, where he met and married Denise Jackson, at that time a principal dancer for the Joffrey. He was also a trustee of the Joffrey, a trustee of Hofstra University and a governor of the New School for Social Research.
        In addition to his wife and his daughter Paige, of New York, he is survived by two sons, Donald J. Jr., of Wake Forest, N.C., and Conor Jackson Sutherland, of Glen Head; two other daughters, Shelley Sutherland Woodruff, of Winchester, Ky., and Julie Peters Sutherland, of Locust Valley, N.Y.; five grandchildren; and a brother, Robert B. Sutherland, of Old Saybrook, Conn.
