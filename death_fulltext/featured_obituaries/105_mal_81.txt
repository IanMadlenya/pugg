        Bernard Safran, whose portraits of celebrities and world leaders appeared on  the covers of more than 70 issues of Time magazine, died on Saturday at his home in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, said John Malyon, his son-in-law.
        Born in New York City in 1924, Mr. Safran attended the New School for Music  and Art and studied at the Pratt Institute. He worked for Time from 1957 through 1966. His subjects included Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mao Zedong, Tennessee Williams, Fidel Castro and Charles de Gaulle. He left Time in 1966 to pursue a career as an artist and later exhibited his work at galleries in New York and Washington.
        He is survived by his wife, Adele; two daughters, Barbara Safran de Niverville of Moncton and Elizabeth Malyon of Toronto; a sister, Rhoda Newman of Chevy Chase, Md., and four grandchildren.
