        George Rapee, one of the world's foremost bridge players, died Thursday at his home in Floral City, Fla. He was 83.
        Mr. Rapee was a winner of three world championship titles at the start of the modern series of competitions: in Bermuda in 1950, in Naples in 1951 and in Manhattan in 1953. He is the last survivor of those teams, which included stars like Charles Goren, Howard Schenken, Sam Stayman and B. Jay Becker.
        Mr. Rapee's tournament career, which spanned more than half a century, began with a national victory in 1936. From 1942 to 1980 he was the most successful player in the three major team championships.
        About 1940 Mr. Rapee had an idea that became world famous as the Stayman Convention: a response of two clubs to an opening one no-trump to ask for a major-suit. His partner, Mr. Stayman, enlarged and publicized the idea.
        Mr. Rapee was inducted into the Bridge Hall of Fame in 1997.
        Mr. Rapee was born in New York City of parents from Hungary. His father, Erno Rapee, was an orchestra conductor.
        He graduated from New York University and later from its law school. After three years in the Army in  World War II, he became a real estate lawyer, and continued assembling packages for development until he retired.
        Mr. Rapee is survived by his wife, Joellen Hall Rapee, one daughter, Christina Winkler, of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
