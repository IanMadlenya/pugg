        Nicholas Colchester, a prominent British financial journalist, died Wednesday in New York. He was 49.
        Mr. Colchester died of heart failure at the St. Moritz Hotel after an early morning run, said Helen Alexander, managing director of the Economist Intelligence Unit, where Mr. Colchester was editorial director.
        An enthusiastic runner, Mr. Colchester was training for a marathon next month in Greece.
        Mr. Colchester was one of the more influential British journalists of his generation. He had been deputy editor of The Economist magazine and foreign editor of The Financial Times of London. The Economist Intelligence Unit is a sister company of the magazine that provides political and economic analysis.
        In his history of The Financial Times, David Kynaston wrote that ''at a critical juncture for the paper -- as critical in its way as the need after the war to attain an authoritative industrial presence -- it would be only a slight exaggeration to say that Colchester 'saved' the F.T.''
        As foreign editor, Mr. Colchester was widely credited with improving integration of the paper's international economic and political coverage.
        He joined The Financial Times in 1968, served as Wall Street correspondent, and later transferred to Bonn, in charge of the Financial Times's coverage of Germany. He returned to London in 1977 as financial news editor and became foreign editor in 1980.
        In 1986 Mr. Colchester joined The Economist, becoming its deputy editor three years later. In 1993 he moved to the Economist Intelligence Unit.
        Mr. Colchester is survived by his wife, Laurence, and two sons, Max and Felix, all of London; his mother, Rosanne of Oxfordshire, England; three brothers -- Marcus, also of Oxfordshire, and Jonathan and Charles of London, and a sister, Chloe, of Fiji.
