        Frederic Bernhardt Mueller, a former partner in the Pace Gallery, a prominent contemporary-art dealership in Manhattan, died on May 1 at his home in Oahu, Hawaii. He was 53 years old.
        His former partner, Arnold Glimcher, said he died of heart failure.
        An avid collector of contemporary art, Mr. Mueller met Mr. Glimcher, the founder of the Pace Gallery, in Boston, and in 1963 was instrumental in the gallery's move to New York City. He became a partner and was active in the business until he left in 1974 to become a private dealer in Oriental antiquities. For the last few years he had made his home in Oahu.
        Mr. Mueller was born in Fort Huron, Mich., and grew up in Hawaii. He graduated from Harvard University in 1957 with a B.A. in art history, and attended acting classes at the American Theater Wing. In 1961 he produced ''Another Evening with Harry Stoones,'' an Off Broadway revue that featured such newcomers as Barbra Streisand, Dom De Luise and Diana Sands.
        Mr. Mueller is survived by his mother, Alberta Gillette Dyson; a sister, Cynthia Gillette Wenner, and a brother, Gregory Gillette, all of Hawaii.
