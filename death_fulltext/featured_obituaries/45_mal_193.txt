        Berthold Lubetkin, an architect who played a leading role in founding the Modernist school in Britain in the 1930's, died on Tuesday in Bristol, England. He was 88 years old.
        No cause of death was given.
        The son of an industrialist, he was born in Tblisi, Georgia. In 1922 he accompanied an exhibition of Soviet art to Berlin and went on to study architecture and engineering in Europe. He came to London in 1931 and set up Tecton, a co-operative of young architects committed to radical ideas, the next year.
        In 1933 he was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at Highgate in north London. Highpoint One, as the block was called, was the most conspicuous statement of the new "white architecture" in Britain. Many of its details, like S-curved balconies, became cliches in the 1950's.
        After World War II, he concentrated on designing homes for blue-collar workers. Tecton broke up in 1948, and Mr. Lubetkin abandoned architecture to take up farming in Gloucestershire in western England.
        In 1982, the Royal Institute of British Architects awarded him its Royal Gold Medal for Architecture.
        Mr. Lubetkin married the architect Margaret Church in 1936. She died in 1978. They had two daughters and a son, who survive.
