        Samuel W. Hawley, a former president of the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, died on Feb. 28 at his home in Fairfield, Conn. He was 92.
        From 1956 to 1975, Mr. Hawley was president of what is now People's Bank, based in Bridgeport, Conn., which was formerly the People's Savings Bank. Beginning in 1971, he served as its chairman for a time.
        Under him, the bank opened branches in Fairfield County and laid the groundwork for expansion into the rest of Connecticut. It now has 150 branches in the state. By 1977, People's was the largest savings bank in New England and the largest residential-mortgage lender in Connecticut. He was a director until 1999.
        As president of the mutual savings banks association in the 1960's, Mr. Hawley supported the idea that wage and salary earners should be able to look to savings banks as a primary source of financial advice and aid.
        Under him, People's became one of the first financial institutions to offer payroll savings to workers in nearby factories.
        Samuel Waller Hawley was born in Bridgeport and graduated from Yale College in 1931 and from Harvard Business School in 1933. He went to work for the bank as a clerk later in 1933.
        His wife of 64 years, Sissy, died before him.
        He is survived by two sons, Bruce B., of Easton, Conn., and Samuel W. Jr., of Fairfield; a daughter, Carolyn H. Davis, of Fairfield; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
