        Christopher W. French, a journalist and administrator with The Associated Press for 23 years, has died at the age of 49.
        The cause of and date of death were not immediately determined. Mr. French's wife, Sarah, discovered his body at their home here Friday after returning from a visit to relatives out of state.
        Since 1980, Mr. French was editor of the A.P. Stylebook, a 284-page manual that prescribes word usage, punctuation and other guidelines for news writing. It is used not only by the wire service but by news media around the country.
        Mr. French was born in Boston. After graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and serving in the Navy, he joined the A.P. in 1966 as a newsman in the Chattanooga, Tenn., bureau. In 1972 he was named Nashville state editor, overseeing news coverage throughout Tennessee, and in 1974 he moved to the general desk in New York, where he worked as a national editor and supervisor.
        Along with the A.P. Stylebook, he was editor of the A.P. Industry News Advisory, a weekly compilation of reports on developments in the news industry. It is transmitted weekly by the wire service.
        Besides his wife, the former Sarah Quackenboss, he is survived by two daughters, Emily and Catherine; a sister, Suzanne French O'Brien of Hopkinton, N.H., and his mother, Thelma Westerling French of Massachusetts.
