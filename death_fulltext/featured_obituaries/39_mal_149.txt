        Dr. Charles Edward Huggins, a physician and cryobiologist who helped develop the process for freezing and reusing red blood cells, died of pancreatic cancer on Wednesday at his home in Boston. He was 60 years old.
        Dr. Huggins had been director of Blood Transfusion Services at Massachusetts General Hospital since 1972 and was formerly associate director of the blood bank and transfusion services there. He had also taught surgery at Harvard Medical School since 1960.
        A 1952 graduate of Harvard Medical School, Dr. Huggins was a Harvard University Moseley Traveling Fellow in 1958 and 1959 and an American Cancer Society Fellow in 1959 and 1960.
        In 1963, he helped revolutionize blood bank procedures by developing a practical way of freezing and storing red blood cells for extended periods. Before the introduction of his technique, which involved immersing the red cells in a solution of glycerol, freezing them and later removing the glycerol with a sugar compound, scientists could freeze the cells, but the cells were damaged while thawing.
        The technique allowed people having elective surgery to donate blood and have it frozen until needed for the surgery. It is generally used in cases of rare blood conditions.
        Dr. Huggins was the son of Dr. Charles Brenton Huggins of Chicago, a 1966 co-winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology. His other survivors are his wife, Gareth; a sister, Emily Fine of San Francisco; five children from a prior marriage, Elizabeth Reiser of San Diego, Margaret Franchi of Barrington, R.I., Nancy Huggins of Cambridge, Mass., Charles Jr. of Belmont, Mass., and Gordon of Chicago, and one grandson.
