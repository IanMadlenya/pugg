        State Representative Leslie T. Young, who served in a district covering New Canaan and Wilton since 1984, died on Thursday. He was 65.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the Connecticut House Republican Caucus.
        Mr. Young was the ranking Republican on the bonding subcommittee of the Legislature's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee and a member of the Commerce Committee. He also served on task forces concerning telecommunications  taxes, corporate taxes and the sales and use tax.
        A retired stockbroker, he is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two children, William, of Mansfield, Conn., and Anne Walker of Jarrettsville, Md.
