        Charles Gulden, former chairman and president of Charles Gulden Inc., the mustard company, died on Sunday after an extended illness at his home in Thompson, Conn. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Charles Gulden Jr. of Vero Beach.
        Mr. Gulden attended St. Paul's, a Garden City, L.I., prep school and joined the family company 60 years ago as vice president. He became chairman of the board and president in 1956. Six years later, he sold the company to American Home Products.
        He was an avid sailor. After his retirement, he spent much of his time boating and was a member of the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club and the International Association of Cape Horners, whose membership is limited to people who have sailed around Cape Horn.
        His wife, Mary Bulkley Gulden, died three years ago.
        In addition to his son, Charles, he is survived by another son, Michael Isham of Palm Beach, three grandsons and a great-granddaughter.
