        Joseph R. Burstin, a theater producer and the founder of an advertising company, died on Dec. 27. He was 85 and lived in Blauvelt, N.Y.
        He died after a lengthy illness, said Camille Burstin, his daughter-in-law.
        Mr. Burstin produced several plays during his 50-year career in the theater, among them "To Be Young, Gifted and Black" and "Raisin in the Sun." He was also instrumental in organizing the Yiddish Theater in New York City in the early 1940's.
        In 1940, he started the Burstin Company, which managed theater groups and engaged in advertising.
        He is survived by his wife, Etta Trost Burstin; a daughter, Marcelle Zaraya, of Spring Valley, N.Y.; a son, Stuart, of Summit, N.J., and four grandchildren.
