        Louis A. Novins, a motion picture executive who tried unsuccessfully to introduce pay television in the 1950's, died after a heart attack Wednesday at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. He was 79 years old and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        Mr. Novins, who held high posts at Paramount Pictures from 1946 to 1963, headed an effort by Paramount in 1957 to establish cable systems in several cities, including New York and Los Angeles. Coin-box devices would have been attached to home television sets so that a fee could be collected for watching feature attractions such as baseball games and movies.
        The venture met with strong opposition and caught on only in a suburb of Toronto. Within four years the International Telemeter Company, a Paramount subsidiary, collapsed, and it was more than a decade later that pay television finally came into being.
        Before entering the film business, Mr. Novins, a lawyer, served as an assistant attorney general in Massachusetts and general counsel to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. He was chairman of the executive committee of the American Heritage Foundation.
        Mr. Novins leaves his wife, the former Jane Wessel; a son, Andrew, of Falls Church; a daughter, Susan, of White Plains, N.Y.; two brothers, Murray, of Manchester, Conn., and Stuart, of Middlebury, Vt.; a sister, Anne G. Slovin of Newton, Mass., and one grandchild.
