        Hugh W. Kelsey, one of the world's leading bridge writers, died on Saturday in Edinburgh, where he lived. He was 69 and had suffered from repeated cardiac problems, his son George said.
        Mr. Kelsey's first bridge book, "Killing Defense," published by Hart in 1967, was an immediate success. It set a standard for clear lay-out of a problem, challenging the reader to solve it before viewing the explanation.
        He went on to write 48 more books on every aspect of the game, including "Advanced Play at Bridge" (Faber & Faber, 1968), "Match-Point Bridge" (Faber & Faber, 1970), "Slam Bidding" (Faber & Faber, 1973) and "Deceptive Plays in Bridge" (Robert Hale, 1982). "Adventures in Card Play" (Gollancz, 1979), written with Geza Ottlik, broke new ground in many technical areas and is still considered the most advanced book on the play of the cards.
        Mr. Kelsey was the general editor of the Master Bridge series published by Victor Gollancz, which included books by many major writers on the game. He was the bridge columnist of The Scotsman, the Edinburgh newspaper, and wrote many articles for bridge magazines.
        Mr. Kelsey also had a considerable reputation as a player. In 1969 and 1980, he won the Gold Cup, Britain's premier bridge championship. He represented Scotland 12 times in international competition and won every major Scottish title several times.
        In addition to his son George, of Edinburgh, Mr. Kelsey is survived by his wife, Flora; another son, Richard, of Edinburgh; two daughters, Jane Kelsey of Edinburgh and Anne Lane of Glasgow, and two sisters, Ruth Miller of Fort William, Scotland, and Jean Berry of Ayr, Scotland.
