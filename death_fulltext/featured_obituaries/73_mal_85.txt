        Justice Morris L. Schwalb, a retired State Supreme Court judge whose complaining about prostitutes in midtown Manhattan drew national attention in 1971 and was followed by a police crackdown on them, died on Saturday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 82 and lived on the Upper West Side until he moved to the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale two years ago.
        His daughter, Susan Schwalb, said the cause of death was pneumonia.
        The judge was named to the state Criminal Court in 1968 and to the Supreme Court in 1978. He retired in 1981 and later practiced law in Manhattan.
        In July 1971, Justice Schwalb irately ordered that two women who had been charged with prostitution be held without bail. He took that action -- which was without known precedent in New York in a prostitution case -- after imposing increasingly stern measures to deal with a growing load of such cases. 'Inundated With Prostitution'
        In denying bail at the arraignment for the women in Manhattan Criminal Court, he declared from the bench that "the midtown area is inundated with prostitution," which had "created a hazard to business, theater, restaurant and hotel interests."
        He was praised in hundreds of letters and telephone calls from around the country, and within days Mayor John V. Lindsay announced the crackdown. One of a long series of such measures over the years, it was accompanied by considerable fanfare and kept numbers of prostitutes off the streets for a time, although appraisals of its effectiveness varied.
        The judge was born on the Lower East Side and earned bachelor's and law degrees from St. John's University. He practiced law in New York and was chairman of the Bronx Republican Party law committee before going on the bench.
        He is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Evelyn Rosenhain; a daughter, Susan Schwalb of Manhattan; a brother, Nathan, of Manhattan, and a sister, Rose Morgan, of the Bronx.
