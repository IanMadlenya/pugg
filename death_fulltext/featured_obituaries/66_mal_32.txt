        Charles Andrew Barber, a critic, poet and theater director, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 35 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Jonathan Sheffer, a friend.
        Mr. Barber was a freelance dance critic whose work appeared in The Advocate, The New Dance Review, Outweek and elsewhere. His poems appeared in a collection called "Unending Dialogue," and one, "Fairy Book Lines," was set to music for the "AIDS Quilt Songbook," which had its premiere last month at Alice Tully Hall.
        A graduate of Ohio Wesleyan University with a degree in theater, Mr. Barber directed several plays, some at the Ubu Repertory Theater, and acted with the Jean Cocteau Repertory Theater.
        He is survived by his parents, Kathleen L. and D. Robert Barber of Cleveland; two brothers, Robert L., of Eugene, Ore., and John C., of Baltimore, and a sister, Ann B. Keane of Gorham, Me.
