        Kenneth Reese Cole Jr., a White House aide in the Nixon era and an occasional commentator on Watergate, died on Thursday at his home in Willsboro, N.Y. He was 63.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Cole served in the White House throughout Richard M. Nixon's presidency, from 1969 to Aug. 9, 1974, when Nixon, battered by Watergate, resigned.
        In January 1974, amid the Watergate furor, Mr. Cole was appointed assistant to the president for domestic affairs and became Nixon's chief domestic adviser.
        He served the Ford administration until early 1975 and then left government. He became an executive at a paper company in New Jersey. Later he founded a venture capital corporation and stayed with it until he retired.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from Bucknell University.
        Surviving are his wife, Marilyn; two daughters, Corinne Ryan of Charlotte, N.C., and Megan Kellogg of Summit, N.J.; two sisters, Priscilla Perkins of Terrell, N.C., and Connie Cole of Denville, N.J.; a brother, Brady, of Corinth, Vt.; and five grandchildren.
