        Lord Swann, the governor and chairman of the British Broadcasting Corporation from 1973 to 1980, died on Saturday, the BBC said. He was 70 years old.
        The cause of death was not disclosed, and it was not known if he had been ill or died in a hospital.
        He was born Michael Meredith Swann on March 1, 1920. He studied at Cambridge University and served in the British Army in World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        On his discharge in 1946 he lectured in zoology at Cambridge University.
        Lord Swann had a distinguished scientific career as a biologist before joining the BBC. He also served on a number of government and scientific committees.
        A Tough Administrator
        He was elected professor of natural history at the University of Edinburgh in 1952. In 1965, he became principal and vice chancellor at Edinburgh, where he earned a reputation as a tough administrator.
        An opponent of student-power politics, Lord Swann advocated the use of the police to end sit-ins and urged the replacement of student grants with partial loans.
        In 1970 he refused a campus call to resign over university investments in South Africa.
        When Lord Swann's term as chairman of the BBC ended, he became provost at Oriel College in Oxford. After a year there he was named chancellor of the University of York, a position he held until his death, the BBC said.
        He was knighted in 1972 and made a life peer, becoming Lord Swann, in 1981.
        He is survived by his wife, Tess, and their two sons and two daughters.
