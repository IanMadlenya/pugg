        William Cotton, a photographer and a teacher for many years at the Walden School, a private school in Manhattan, died on Monday in Brandon, Vt. He was 76 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        Mr. Cotton died of a heart attack, said his wife, Cornelia.
        A devoted amateur violin player in string quartets, Mr. Cotton and his wife were in Brandon, Vt., participating in a chamber music festival when he was stricken.
        Mr. Cotton joined the faculty of the Walden School in 1946 and taught woodworking to students in all 12 of the school's grades for nearly four decades. He also served terms on the school's board of directors. Mr. Cotton retired in 1985.
        Mr. Cotton's photographs are in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the National Gallery of Canada.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Cotton is survived by three daughters, Amy, of Ossining, Eve Hillyer, of Purdys, N.Y., and Peggy Hurley, of Cortlandt, N.Y., and two grandsons.
