        Aaron D. Duberstein, the finance director and chief fund-raiser for the Greater New York Councils of the Boy Scouts of America for 26 years and a Scouting advocate most of his life, died on Friday at St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he lived. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Duberstein was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and became an orphan at the age of 11. In retiring in 1972, he said he had turned early to Scouting in search of "fellowship and a sense of community." In time he attained the group's highest rank, Eagle Scout.
        He grew up in Brooklyn and earned a law degree at St. John's University. But he came to devote less time to private practice and more to volunteer Scouting, and in 1981 he received the highest honor in volunteer Scouting, the Silver Beaver Award.
        In West Palm Beach, Mr. Duberstein helped lead the Scouts' Gulf Stream Council, which made him an honorary vice president. He was also a director of the local symphony and opera and a trustee of Temple Israel.
        Surviving is his wife of 56 years, Jewel; a daughter, Susan Ravitz of Charlotte, N.C.; a son, Kenneth, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Rose Holiber of West Palm Beach, and six grandchildren.
