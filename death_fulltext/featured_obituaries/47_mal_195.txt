        Peter H. Brandt, a lawyer who specialized in real estate, died on Sunday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 94 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the borough.
        He died of pneumonia, his wife, Rose, said.
        Mr. Brandt's first wife, the former Elsie Finestone, died in 1977. His survivors, in addition to his second wife, the former Rose Haber, and his son, who lives in Long Beach, L.I., include a daughter, Carol Ferranti of Manhattan, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 26, 1990, Wednesday
        An obituary yesterday about Peter H. Brandt, a real estate lawyer from the Bronx, omitted the name of his son and misstated the son's residence. He is Hubert J. Brandt, of Lido Beach, L.I., not Long Beach.
