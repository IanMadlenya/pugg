        Aaron Weintraub, one of the last survivors of the Jewish Legion, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 97 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, the family said.
        Born in Warsaw, Mr. Weintraub came to the United States in 1912 and worked for many years as a designer and production manager in the garment industry.
        In 1916, he enlisted as a member of the 38th Battalion of the City of London Regiment of Royal Fusiliers. The 38th was one of three battalions in the Jewish Legion, which fought for the British Army in World War I in hopes of gaining a homeland in Palestine.
        A member of the Zionist Organization of America, he attended the World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem in 1956 as a delegate for the conservative Revisionist party.
        He is survived by a daughter, Carol Sege of Potomac, Md.; a son, Dr. Herbert Weintraub of Bethesda, Md.; eight grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
