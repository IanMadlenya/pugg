        Minos Volanakis, a translator and director who specialized in ancient Greek plays, died on Sunday in Athens, where he lived. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
        Early on Mr. Volanakis distinguished himself with his translations of Jean Genet's plays into Greek, as well as with his translations of American plays for the Greek director Carolos Koun, with whom he studied theater arts. He also presented critically acclaimed productions of ''Waiting for Godot'' and ''Lysistrata'' for the Athens Festival.
        In 1966 he left Greece in protest of the government and lived in England, where he translated and directed classical Greek plays, including Aristophanes' comedies, for American and British universities.
        As associate director of the Oxford Playhouse he put on the first public performance of Genet's ''Balcony'' and a production of Jean Giraudoux's ''Madwoman of Chaillot,'' with the return of the actress Elisabeth Bergner to the English-speaking stage. In 1968 he made his professional debut in the United States with his staging of Euripides' ''Bacchae'' for the A.P.A.-Phoenix at the Lyceum Theater in New York.
        After returning to Greece he was the general manager at the Northern State Theater, where he had begun his directing career, from 1975 to 1978. He also worked with the Greek National Theater, which presented his staging of ''Oedipus Rex'' at the Vivian Beaumont in 1984.
        No immediate family members survive.
