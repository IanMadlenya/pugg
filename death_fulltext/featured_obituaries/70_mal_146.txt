        Wilfred P. Cohen, a retired men's-clothing executive and a philanthropist who helped hospitals, universities and other causes, died on Thursday at his home in Sands Point, L.I. He was 93 years old.
        For more than 30 years, Mr. Cohen headed Joseph H. Cohen & Sons in Manhattan, manufacturers of men's suits and sport coats. In 1956 he sold the company, which became part of Botany 500.

        Mr. Cohen was also a founder and president of Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I. He endowed a chair in Judaic studies at Brandeis University and contributed to the Whitney Museum of Art and the American Friends of Hebrew University, among other causes.
        An accomplished artist, he assisted art students through the Wilfred P. Cohen Foundation, financed by more than $100,000 he donated from sales of his paintings.
        Mr. Cohen was born in New York City. In World War I, he served briefly in the Navy. After attending City College and New York University, he joined his family's company as a salesman.
