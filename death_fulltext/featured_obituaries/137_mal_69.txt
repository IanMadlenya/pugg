        Robert Leslie, a high school baseball coach who counseled against the use of smokeless tobacco in a video widely shown in the nation's high schools, died on Monday in Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital. He was 31 and lived in Cotati.
        Mr. Leslie had been suffering from cancer of the mouth, and said he believed that the cancer had resulted from years of stuffing wads of smokeless tobacco between his gums and lower lip.
        He continued coaching after his  cancer was diagnosed four years ago. Mr. Leslie was the third-base coach on June 6 when his Casa Grande High School team won the North Coast Section 2A title game against crosstown rival Petaluma High School.
        After learning of his diagnosis, Mr. Leslie made a videotape for Joe Garagiola, the former major league catcher and commentator, cautioning against the use of tobacco.
        The video has had more impact on tobacco users than anything previously used in the campaign against smokeless tobacco, said Mr. Garagiola, who heads a national campaign against smokeless tobacco.
        Mr. Leslie, who was a star pitcher at Rancho Cotate High School, turned to coaching after a brief attempt at playing professional baseball.
        Mr. Leslie is survived by his wife, Amy; a daughter, Nicole; his parents, Richard, of Sebastopol, and Patricia; two brothers, John, of Pengrove, and Steve, of Rohnert Park, and a sister, Joanne, of Sebastopol.
