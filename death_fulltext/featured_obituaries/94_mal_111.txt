        Prof. Bernard Garniez, an expert in 20th-century French literature, died last Friday at the Village Nursing Home in Manhattan. A Manhattan resident, he was 69.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, his family said.
        A native of Remscheid, Germany, Professor Garniez joined the faculty of New York University in 1950 and taught French at Oberlin College for four years before returning to N.Y.U. in 1961. Teaching both literature and French language courses, he became a full professor in 1966. He retired four years ago.
        He is survived by a daughter, Rachelle Garniez; a son, Jacob, both of Manhattan; and two sisters, Regine Traks and Erna Zaif, both of Brussels.
