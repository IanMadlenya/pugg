        Louis Lowell Bennett, a former dean at Bernard M. Baruch College, died on Wednesday in Miami Beach. He was 82 years old and lived in Miami Beach.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Bennett was dean of students and chairman of the student personnel services department at Baruch College from 1970 until his retirement in 1972. In 1970, faced with 1,500 freshmen entering the college, or more than double the previous year, Mr. Bennett trained nearly 100 upperclass students to help the school handle orientation.
        Active in many Jewish philanthropic organizations, he was named the first executive director of the New York Association for New Americans in 1949, a post he held until 1952. Set up to help Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, the agency has become the largest resettlement agency in the country.
        Mr. Bennett held many Government positions before becoming a dean at Baruch College. He was a housing official for the National Housing Agency from 1945 to 1947, a regional representative for the Office of Aging in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare from 1962 to 1965 and a deputy commissioner for the Social and Rehabilitation Service of H .E. W. from 1967 to 1970.
        A native New Yorker, he received his law degree from St. John's University in 1931 and a master's degree in social work from Columbia University in 1941. He practiced law in New York City from 1931 to 1971.
        During World War II, he was assistant regional director of the United States Office of Community War Services. He was also the organizer and executive director of the Veteran Service Center in New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Estelle; two sons, Peter Charles, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Richard, of San Rafael, Calif.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
