        Cedric Phatudi, who rejected South African Government attempts to make his tribal homeland of Lebowa an independent nation, died today. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Phatudi, Chief Minister for 14 years in the northeastern homeland for the North Sotho people, had suffered from diabetes and bone cancer, according to a statement from the Little Company of Mary Hospital in Pretoria.
        The homeland, made up of six sections, each completely surrounded by South Africa, has a population of more than 1.8 million people spread over 10,000 square miles.
        Lebowa is one of the so-called self-governing black tribal states in South Africa that the Government considers on the road to becoming independent nations.
        Mr. Phatudi became Lebowa's first Minister of Education and Culture in 1972, three years after it was designated as a self-governing state. He became Chief Minister in 1973.
