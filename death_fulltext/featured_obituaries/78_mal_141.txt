        Jacob Wittner, who spent nearly three decades enforcing equal-opportunity legislation at various levels of government, died on Saturday at White Plains Hospital. He was 85 and had homes in Scarsdale, N.Y., and Deerfield Beach, Fla.
        The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.
        Mr. Wittner, who was born in Manhattan, studied at New York University and Brooklyn Law School, where he received his LL.B. degree in 1931. He went into private practice but entered public service in 1946 when he was recruited by the recently formed New York State Commission Against Discrimination (now Division of Human Rights).
        As field representative and later senior field representative he investigated complaints of racial, religious and sex bias in employment, housing, public accommodations and education. He left the state agency in 1963 to join the New York City Commission on Human Rights, where he did much the same work until 1969.
        From then until his retirement in 1974 he helped enforce equal-opportunity guidelines for the Defense Contract Supply Agency of the Department of Defense in the New York City area. After retiring, he served as a volunteer lawyer in the Office for the Aging in Yonkers and for Westchester County.
        Mr. Wittner's first wife, the former Rose Barnett, died in 1964. He is survived by his second wife of 28 years, Marjorie Ganzman Levy Wittner; a son, Lawrence S. of Albany; a daughter, Jane Solomon of Scarsdale; a brother, Murray of Long Beach, and five grandchildren.
