        Vic Upshaw, an American choreographer who brought modern jazz styles to France in the mid-1960's, died on Nov. 5. He was 50 years old.
        A spokeswoman for a dance society with which he worked said he died of a stomach disorder.
        Born in Birmingham, Ala., in 1940, Mr. Upshaw played minor roles in the 1958 film version of "South Pacific" and in the Judy Garland version of "A Star Is Born" before moving to France in 1964.
        Mr. Upshaw designed dance routines for the Lido cabaret. His own dance group, the Vic Upshaw Six, was a staple for years on French television variety shows.
        He taught steps to some of France's best-known show-business personalities, including Catherine Deneuve, Sylvie Vartan, Pierre Mondy and Jean-Claude Brialy.
