        Robert Goldworm, a retired fashion designer and executive who was a leader in developing women's knitwear, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.
        He was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan and Pacific Palisades, Calif. He had pancreatic cancer and died of an embolism, friends said.
        Mr. Goldworm developed Goldworm Sportswear, the small family business founded by his mother, Gertrude, into a pace-setting international company. He helped introduce colored patterns in knitwear, and his lightweight wrinkle-free outfits proved popular. Goldworm factories in the New York region and in Milan, Italy, produced more than 200,000 garments a year. They were sold and sometimes showcased at Lord & Taylor, Bloomingdale's and Neiman-Marcus. He won the Coty Award in 1957 and five Woolknit Design Awards and was knighted by the Italian Government.
        Upon graduating from New York University in 1947, Mr. Goldworm grounded himself first in the technical details of knitting machines, dyeing and printing, then moved on to style and pattern design.
        The company closed when he retired as its president in 1981. He enrolled at the School of Visual Arts and the Sculpture Center and devoted himself to painting and sculpture.
        He is survived by his wife, Carla, and their sons, Sam and Luke, both of Manhattan, and a son and daughter by a prior marriage, Robert and Susan.
