        John W. Lederle, who as president of the University of Massachusetts in the 1960s led the transformation of a rural campus with fewer than 6,000 students in Amherst into a major research center with more than 18,000 students and who also directed the development of two campuses, died on Feb. 13 near his home in Naples, Fla. He was 94.
        The cause was heart failure, said Ed Blaguszewski, a spokesman for the university.
        As president of the university from 1960 to 1970. Dr. Lederle oversaw the start or completion of nearly 50 major buildings at Amherst, including a 28-story library. The medical school opened in 1962, and two years later its Boston campus was started.
        The university now has two more campuses, in Dartmouth and Lowell.
        Also during Dr. Lederle's tenure, an astronomy observatory and research centers on water resources, polymers and labor relations opened at Amherst.
        John William Lederle was born on May 26, 1912, in Royal Oak, Mich., the son of Emil and Minnie Shore Lederle. His father was a school superintendent, and his mother was a high school teacher.
        Dr. Lederle earned his bachelor's degree in 1933, his master's in 1934, a law degree in 1936 and a Ph.D. in political science in 1942, all from the University of Michigan. From 1941 to 1944, he taught political science at Brown University and for part of that time was an assistant dean. He then returned to the University of Michigan, where he taught and held several administrative positions until he was named president of the University of Massachusetts.
        Surviving are his wife, Angie; a daughter, Pamela Marro of Marco Island, Fla.; a son, Thomas, of Pelham, Mass.; and a grandson.
