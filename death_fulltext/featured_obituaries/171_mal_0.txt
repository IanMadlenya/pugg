        Dr. Morton M. Polokoff, a foot surgeon who broke new ground with his operating procedures and innovative appliances, died last Friday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 93 and formerly lived in Paterson, N.J., where he practiced for 55 years, until the mid-1990's.
        Dr. Polokoff made a name for himself as an early practitioner of what became known as minimal incision surgery, or ambulatory foot surgery. Earlier, podiatry consisted mainly of efforts to ease pain with palliatives  rather than curing the underlying malady, or in a few cases surgery requiring hospitalization.
        Dr. Polokoff devised techniques to correct crooked and deformed toes, corns and bunions. He also advanced the use of handmade contrivances of felt, latex and tape to relieve pain from disfigured feet and to straighten toes the way braces straighten teeth.
        He taught his techniques to foot specialists across the country and lectured for many years at the Temple University School of Podiatry in Philadelphia. He wrote textbooks and many articles about his methods and foot surgery.
        Morton Meyer Polokoff, known as Mac, was born in St. Louis and came to Paterson as a teenager. He graduated from the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine in 1932.
        His contributions were cited by the American Podiatry Council and the American Board of Ambulatory Foot Surgery.
        Dr. Polokoff is survived by his wife of 63 years, Sally Fisher Polokoff; three daughters, Linda Landaw of Fort Lee, N.J., Barbara Sheldon of Westport, Conn., and Audrey Schwartz of Gulf Stream, Fla; a sister, Anne Josephson of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.
