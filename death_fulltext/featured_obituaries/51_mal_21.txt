        Samuel Joseph Powers, a White House lawyer who found the 18-minute gap on President Richard M. Nixon's Watergate tapes, died Friday. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Powers, a Florida trial lawyer, served on Mr. Nixon's legal staff during the Watergate hearings. He and Leonard Garment, then the White House counsel, discovered the gap, in a conversation on June 20, 1973, between Mr. Nixon and H. R. Haldeman, the President's chief of staff.
        The disclosure contributed to Mr. Nixon's decision to resign in 1974. It fueled charges of a high-level cover-up. The White House said Mr. Nixon's personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods, had accidentally created the gap.
