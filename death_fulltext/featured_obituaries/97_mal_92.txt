        Michael Shall, a leading American expert in origami, the popular Japanese art of paper folding, died on Feb. 9 at New York University Medical Center. He was 45 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said a brother, David Shall, of Harrisburg, Pa.
        The youngest of three sons to whom Herman Shall taught the traditional Japanese art form, Michael Shall learned to create complicated objects like a dinosaur and a mother pushing a stroller, all fashioned from a single piece of paper.
        Mr. Shall, raised in Carlisle, Pa., graduated from Lycoming College in Williamsport, Pa., and taught English in New Jersey high schools for four years before moving to Manhattan in 1974 to try to become the art's first full-time professional.
        He studied and worked with Lillian Oppenheimer, who for generations had been the primary force in furthering the popularity of origami through a loosely organized group that she operated from her home, the Origami Center of America.
        In 1980, he helped to found an affiliated group that is now called Origami, USA. The organization has grown to include more than 60 affiliate clubs across the country.
        Mr. Shall taught at schools and museums, including the American Museum of Natural History, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
        He was also a consultant to the National Geographic Society and the United States Committee for UNICEF. He was also well-known for designing origami Christmas trees. The best-known were "Paper Magic on Fifth Avenue" for Japan Airlines and "The Origami Holiday Tree" for the American Museum of Natural History.
        In addition to his brother David, Mr. Shall is survived by his mother, Tillie Shall, of Winter Park, Fla.; a sister, Maxine Burkholder, of Media, Pa., and another brother, Donald, of Ann Arbor, Mich.
