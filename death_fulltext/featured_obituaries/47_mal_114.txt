        Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis, a Bavarian banker and industrialist who was one of the wealthiest men in Europe, died yesterday at a heart clinic connected with Munich University Hospital. He was 64 years old and lived in a castle his family had been in since 1790 in Regensburg, Germany.
        He died of complications after a second heart transplant in seven weeks, a spokesman for the hospital said, according to Reuters.
        Prince Johannes, who had his first heart transplant on Oct. 29, was head of a family bank, the Furst Thurn und Taxis Bank in Regensburg, and had large holdings in breweries, forest land and art collections valued at more than $1.5 billion.
        His family was given a monopoly on mail service by the Holy Roman Empire in the 15th century. Emperors, popes and the Prussian kings awarded the family with titles and landed estates, and from then onward his family amassed fortunes.
        In World War II, Prince Johannes served in German intelligence. He was imprisoned by the British Army from 1945 to 1947. In the 1950's he began building a diversified business empire and in 1982, at his father's death, inherited the family fortune, including the single largest real estate holding in Germany, 80,000 acres of forest.
        He is survived by his wife, Princess Gloria, Countess of Schonburg-Glauchau, whom he married in 1980 when he was 53 and she was 20; and three children, a 7-year-old son and heir, Albert; and two daughters, Maria Theresia and Elizabeth.
