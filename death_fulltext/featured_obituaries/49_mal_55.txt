        Allan A. Lewis, a teacher and writer on Shakespeare and modern drama, died on Thursday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 85 years old.
        Dr. Lewis, a victim of Parkinson's disease, died of heart failure, said his daughter, Lanny Lewis, of Murrieta, Calif.
        Dr. Lewis wrote "The Contemporary Theater" and "American Plays and Playwrights." Both were considered major works in the field. He also wrote "El Teatro Moderno." The latter was published in Mexico where, during an extended stay, he taught at the National University and directed several plays.
        At the University of Bridgeport, in 1965, Dr. Lewis was named Littlefield Professor of Shakespearean Studies and director of the Shakespeare Institute. He was also a faculty member at the New School for Social Research, lecturing on contemporary theater, and he taught at Bennington College in Vermont.
        Until his retirement several years ago, Dr. Lewis, who had written numerous articles for periodicals, was a drama critic for The New Haven Register. He was executive director of the New Dramatist Guild in 1960-61.
        He is also survived by his wife, Brooke Waring Lewis.
