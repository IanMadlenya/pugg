        George Montgomery, a poet, photographer and museum curator and director, died on April 7 at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was Huntington's disease, said Dan Wagoner, his companion.
        A witty, vividly perceptive poet, Mr. Montgomery collaborated with Mr. Wagoner, a choreographer and performer, on many of his dances, sometimes performing with Mr. Wagoner's company as a narrator. His poems were celebrated in Mr. Wagoner's 1991 ''Songs to Dance,'' performed to music by William Bolcom and Joan Morris.
        Born in Berlin, Conn., Mr. Montgomery entered Harvard University at 15 and graduated, after service in the Coast Guard, with a degree in philosophy.
        His many interests included photography, and his work was exhibited in Boston galleries. He also designed posters for Paul Taylor and his dance company.
        He worked with the Poet's Theater in New York City in the mid-1950's and acted in several productions at the theater, among them Frank O'Hara's ''Change Your Bedding'' and John Ashbery's ''Compromise.'' He was an active member of the group of Abstract Expressionist artists, writers and film makers who met regularly at the Cedar Tavern in Greenwich Village.
        An authority on early American art and antiques, Mr. Montgomery was a director of the Museum of American Folk Art and the Asia House Gallery and a curator for the Museum of Modern Art. Three volumes of his poetry were printed in the 1970's and 80's by Cruz del Sur of Caracas, Venezuela, in translations by the poet Isaac Chocron.
        In addition to Mr. Wagoner, he is survived by a brother, Bruce, of Wayland, Mass.
