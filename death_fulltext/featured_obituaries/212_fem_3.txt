        Lenore Benson, a former executive director of the Fashion Group International, died on Wednesday at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. She was 80.
        From 1984 to 1993, Ms. Benson directed the Fashion Group, a 6,000-member organization that promotes the advancement of women in the fashion industry.
        During that time, she inaugurated an annual Night of Stars awards dinner honoring outstanding designers, retailers and fashion icons and expanded the group's activities to include seminars and workshops.
        Until several weeks ago, she had been at work developing an archival program for the group, in partnership with the New York Public Library. So far, the program has cataloged more than 600,000 fashion slides dating from the 1950's to the present.
        From November 2001 until last June, Ms. Benson was the director of external affairs for the Laboratory Institute of Merchandising, a professional school in New York.
        Ms. Benson, who was born in Cleveland and raised in Minneapolis, was the only daughter of Charles Benson, a specialty store executive, and his wife, Eleanor.
        Ms. Benson came to New York in 1947 and worked for eight years for the Fifth Avenue store Franklin Simon.
        In 1955, she became merchandise and marketing director of Mademoiselle magazine, and later Harper's Bazaar and then Vogue, before accepting a position with the Fashion Group.
        Ms. Benson leaves no immediate survivors.
