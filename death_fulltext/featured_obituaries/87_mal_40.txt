        Dr. Luther S. Cressman, an anthropologist whose discoveries helped revolutionize thinking about prehistoric cultures in the Pacific Northwest, died on Monday at his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 96.
        On an archeological dig at Fort Rock in south-central Oregon in 1938, Dr. Cressman's crew unearthed a trove of woven tule grass-and-sagebrush bark sandals. The 75 shoes had been preserved under layers of pumice and ash from an old eruption at Mount Mazama. The find proved that humans had lived in the Northwest 9,000 years ago. Anthropologists had previously believed that humans began inhabiting the region 4,500 years ago.
        From 1934 to 1940, Dr. Cressman and his crews recovered hundreds of other human artifacts in the Great Basin. He organized the University of Oregon Museum of Natural History and was a founding director of the Oregon State Museum of Anthropology.
        Dr. Cressman was born in Pottstown, Pa. He graduated from Pennsylvania State College in 1918 and received a doctorate from Columbia University in 1925. He joined the University of Oregon as a sociology professor in 1929 and in 1935 formed the anthropology department, which he headed until 1963.
        Dr. Cressman married the anthropologist Margaret Mead in 1923. They were divorced five years later. Dr. Mead died in 1978. His second wife was Dorothy Loch, who died in 1977.  Surviving is a daughter, Gem Nelson of Coopersburg, Pa.
