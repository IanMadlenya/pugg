        Jane Reid-Petty, director, playwright and founder of New Stage Theater in Jackson, Miss., died on Thursday in Jackson at the home of her daughter, Diane Petty Maddux. She was 70.
        The cause was cancer, The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., reported.
        In 1965, Ms. Reid-Petty created New Stage in a former church, opening the following season with a production of ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' For more than 30 years, her company was known for presenting challenging theater. She directed her last play, Brian Friel's ''Molly Sweeney,'' in October.
        As a writer, she dramatized several stories by Eudora Welty. With the participation of Ms. Welty, she began the Eudora Welty New Plays Series in 1985. Ms. Reid-Petty was ''a perceiving and selfless contributor to the art of the theater,'' Ms. Welty said.
        Ms. Reid-Petty was born in Meridian, Miss. She graduated from the University of Alabama and was the theater critic and arts editor for The States Times in Jackson before starting her theater. Last year New Stage was renamed the Jane Reid-Petty Theater. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.
