        Frank Renkiewicz, an historical interpreter at the Ellis Island Immigration Museum and an expert on Polish history, died on Saturday at his home in the Bronx. He was 58.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his mother said.
        Mr. Renkiewicz was a history professor and chairman of the history department at the College of St. Teresa in Minnesota in the 1960's and 1970's and director of Polish studies during the 1980's at St. John Fisher College in Rochester. He joined the National Park Service, which operates the Ellis Island museum, in 1990.
        Mr. Renkiewicz, who received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Notre Dame, was the author of "Poles in America: a Chronology and Fact Book."
        He is survived by his mother, Estelle, of the Bronx, and a sister, Dorothy McKeown of Shenorock, N.Y.
