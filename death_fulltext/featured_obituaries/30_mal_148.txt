        Judge Burton J. Jacobson, who was credited with streamlining civil-court procedures in Connecticut, died of amyloidosis on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center. He was 60 years old and lived in Fairfield, Conn.
        When his condition was diagnosed eight years ago, doctors told him he had less than a year to live. Amyloidosis is a disease that attacks the body's tissues and organs.
        Judge Jacobson was elevated last February to the State Appellate Court. Previously a Superior Court judge, he served as chief administrative judge for the State Civil Division and chief administrative judge for the judicial district that includes Bridgeport, where he was credited with drastically cutting the backlog of civil cases.
        He graduated from Columbia College and Boston University Law School. He was a Republican and served in the State House of Representatives in 1959 and 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda Newton Jacobson; a son, Bruce, of Norwalk, Conn.; two daughters, Deborah, of North Dartmouth, Mass., and Lisa, of Fairfield; a brother, Howard, of Fairfield, and a sister, Muriel Novack of Stamford, Conn.
