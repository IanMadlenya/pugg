        Millicent Ellis Selsam, an author who filled bookshelf upon bookshelf with primers seeking to still the nagging why's with which children tax their parents' patience and knowledge, died on Saturday at Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Fire Island, L.I.
        A writer of simple science booklets, she was credited with some 130 titles, scores of which remain in print. While they were tailored for young readers from kindergarten through the early grades, she also wrote science books for teen-agers and a few for adults.
        Mrs. Selsam published her first book in 1946, ''From Egg to Chick,'' after having taught high school science in the New York City public school system. Since then her work found outlets at Harper & Row, Morrow, Macmillan, Doubleday and Walker, among other publishers.
        She started a series of ''I Can Read Books'' for Harper and regularly contributed to the ''First Look at . . .'' series published by Walker. Both series introduced inquisitive children to the animal kingdom and the marvels small children discover all around them.
        Her books received many awards, including the Thomas Alva Edison Award for the best juvenile science book, ''Biography of an Atom'' (1965).
        She was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree at Columbia University.
        She is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
