        Correction:  February 16, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about James M. Edwards, a senior partner in the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, misstated the day of his death and the given name of his wife. He died on Feb. 7, not Feb. 8. His wife, who died in 1998, was Veronica, not Marian.
