        Mr. Kunii began his singing career traveling with a tango orchestra in South America in the 1960's. The tour ended in San Juan, P.R., in 1968, where he joined the Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music. In 1970 he sang his first operatic role, and in 1971 moved to New York to continue his career. He gave recitals at Town Hall, Alice Tully Hall and Merkin Concert Hall and sang with opera companies in the United States and Israel.
        He is survived by two sisters and a brother in Japan and a niece, Tomoko Shibata of Brooklyn.
