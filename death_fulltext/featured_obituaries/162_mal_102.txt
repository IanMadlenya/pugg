        Roberto Suarez Garcia, once one of the most-wanted drug traffickers in the world, died on July 20 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. He was 68.
        His family said the cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Suarez entered the cocaine trade in the mid-1970's. He came to be called the godfather of the trade in Bolivia and was a major supplier to the Medellin cartel in Colombia. He claimed to have amassed $40 million.
        But in 1989, the Bolivian police arrested him. Margaret Daly Hayes, a political scientist and an expert on Latin America, wrote in 1990, ''This was the first time Bolivian authorities had taken action against a drug kingpin.''
        The police surprised him at one of his ranches, in northern Beni, where he had been born.
        The arrest was made when nearby Chapare Province reportedly accounted for half the world's crop of coca leaf.
        Mr. Suarez was convicted of producing and selling cocaine and began serving a 15-year prison sentence, but was released in 1996. His wealth dwindled. At his death, he owned 500 head of cattle, by one account. Weeks before, he said on television that selling cocaine was ''the worst mistake I ever made.'' His lawyer said he had 18 children with several wives. A son, Roberto Suarez Levy, was killed in 1990 in a gun battle with the police.
