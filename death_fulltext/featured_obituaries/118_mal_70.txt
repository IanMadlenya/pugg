        Andreas Freund, for many years an editor and correspondent of The New York Times, died here on Sunday, family friends said. He was 71.
        He had been under treatment for lung cancer for many years, friends said.
        Mr. Freund was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), and moved to Switzerland after the Nazis came to power.
        After World War II, he moved to Paris and worked for the Paris edition of The New York Herald Tribune before joining The Associated Press, which he left in 1961.
        A year later, he joined the Paris bureau of The New York Times and worked as a copy editor and reporter. He left The Times in 1979 and went to Agence France-Presse, where he worked for the English-language service until his retirement in 1983.
        Mr. Freund, a naturalized French citizen, is survived by a sister, Gabrielle Falk, who lives in North Carolina.
