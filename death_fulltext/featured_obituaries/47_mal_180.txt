        Ishak Mousa Husseini, a noted Palestinian writer and teacher who sought to explain Arab history to the West, died on Tuesday, family members said today. He was 86 years old.
        Arab leaders including the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, and President Elias Hrawi of Lebanon have sent condolences to the family of Mr. Husseini, who died at his home in East Jerusalem and was buried on Wednesday, family members said.
        The cause of death was not dislosed.
        Mr. Husseini was the author of 22 books and many academic essays during a teaching career that spanned more than four decades. He taught at Arabic College in Jerusalem, the American University of Beirut and the American University of Cairo.
        In 1982 he founded the Women's Art College, which is part of Jerusalem University, and was its president until his death. His fellow Palestinian writers in 1986 gave him the honorary title of "dean of Palestinian literature."
        An expert in Semitic languages, Mr. Husseini was a leading figure in the Arabic linguistic academies in Egypt and Iraq. He often lectured in Canada and the United States and sought to explain Islam and Arab history to the West.
        Among his books is "Moslem Brothers," a study on how fundamentalism began to work its way into Islam. His best-known fiction work is "Memoirs of Chicken," written in 1943. It was considered controversial in the Arab world because it criticized the low status given to Arab women.
        He is survived by his wife, Alawieh, and three children.
