        William L. McGowan, a retired president of the Civil Service Employees Association, the largest statewide public-employee union in New York, died on Friday near Buffalo. He was 69.
        He suffered a heart attack at his home in Orchard Park, the union said.
        When Mr. McGowan was elected president in 1977, he found a loosely linked alliance totaling 150,000 members. A year later he steered the union into affiliation with the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and, with that, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., to build it into one of the state's most influential labor organization.
        Though first elected by a thin margin, he won re-election overwhelmingly three times and retired in 1988 after 11 years as president. He helped establish day-care centers for members and standards to end wage discrimination based on sex.
        Mr. McGowan was born in Buffalo.  He dropped out of high school to join the Navy in World War II and earned an equivalency diploma. On returning to New York he became an electrician at the West Seneca State Hospital and became active in the union.
        He was an early supporter of Mario M. Cuomo in 1982, and Mr. Cuomo called him "the working person's president, having risen through the ranks of state service and his union." The Governor had earlier put Mr. McGowan's name on a college-tuition program for the children of C.S.E.A. members who had died of job-related injuries.
        Surviving are his wife, Jeanne; two daughters, Judy Drexmiller and Kathy McGowan, both of West Seneca; a son, Michael, of Pelham; two sisters, Martha Galvin of Eggertsville and Louise Pelow of Buffalo; two brothers, Norman and James, also of Buffalo, and two grandchildren.
