        Dr. Harold C. Wiggers, president and dean of the Albany Medical College of Union University for 21 years, died on Wednesday at the Pitt County Memorial Hospital in Greenville, N.C., where he lived. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter Janet Smith.
        Dr. Wiggers taught at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Case-Western Reserve University School of Medicine and the University of Illinois College of Medicine. He became a member of the Albany Medical College faculty in 1947, and directed the school from 1953 to 1974.
        After leaving Albany, Dr. Wiggers moved to Greenville, where he was acting dean of the East Carolina School of Medicine. He retired in 1978.
        Dr. Wiggers graduated from Wesleyan University and received a doctorate in physiology from Case-Western Reserve.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia, and two daughters, Kathrine Gosling of Albany and Mrs. Smith of Greenville.
