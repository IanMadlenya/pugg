        After being active in Nassau County Democratic politics in the late 1950's, Mr. Kramer successfully managed the campaign of Eugene S. Nickerson. In 1960, Mr. Nickerson became the first Democratic county executive in what was traditionally a Republican stronghold. Mr. Nikckerson named Mr. Kramer vice chairman of the county's Board of Assessors, which was the first of many fiscal posts he would hold in the county.
        By the early 1970's, Mr. Kramer was a fiscal adviser to Marvin Cristenfield, the county Democratic Chairman at the time. And for much of his life Mr. Kramer was outspoken about fiscal issues.
        In his later years, Mr. Kramer was fiscal adviser to the Nassau and Suffolk County Patrolmen's Benevolent Associations, and to the New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. For the last 13 years, he was chief counsel for the New York State Assembly's Committee on Real Property Taxation. He retired in June.
        Mr. Kramer was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va., in 1937. He received his law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1941. From then to 1946, he served as a first lieutenant in the Army.
        Mr. Kramer was an associate in the firm of Jaspan, Ginsberg, Ehrlich, Schlesinger & Hoffman of Garden City, L.I.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen C.; two sons, Jonathan, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Peter, of Woodmere; a daughter, Linda Evans, of Suffern, N.Y.; a brother, Franklin, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
