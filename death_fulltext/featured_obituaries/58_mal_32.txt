        Sigmund Rothschild, an art restorer and appraiser of paintings and other collectibles, died yesterday in Del Mar, Calif. He was 74 years old and lived in Del Mar.
        He died of complications from diabetes, said a former colleague, Juliana C. Nash of Manhattan.
        As an appraiser, Mr. Rothschild advised Lauren Bacall, George M. Cohan, Joan Crawford, Stuart Davis, Ira Gershwin, William Randolph Hearst, Clare Booth Luce, Eugene Ormandy, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Billy Rose, Edward Durell Stone and Igor Stravinsky. He also advised such institutions as the Museum of the City of New York, the New-York Historical Society, the Smithsonian Institution, the Philadelphia Museum of Fine Arts and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, and corporations including General Foods and Mobil Oil.
        Mr. Rothschild was born on Aug. 20, 1917, in Newark and was self-taught, Ms. Nash said. He lectured on appraising at New York University for 14 years.
        In the 1950's he was the host of two television shows, "Trash or Treasure" and "What's It Worth?" He wrote "A Beginner's Guide to Antiques and Collectibles," published by Pharos Books in 1987.
        Mr. Rothschild is survived by a brother, Ted Lowry of Orange, N.J.; two daughters, Sigrid, of Lenoir, N.C., and Beryl, of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Stephan, of San Diego, and five grandchildren.
