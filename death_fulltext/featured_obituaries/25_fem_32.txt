        Rosa Slade Gragg, a civil rights advocate appointed in the 1940's to a national advisory post by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died Monday at Harper Hospital. She was 86 years old.
        Mrs. Gragg's work to improve racial relations in the United States began in the late 1930's with her association with Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor. In 1942 the President appointed Mrs. Gragg to a national advisory board of the Federal Office of Civil Defense.
        In 1946 she founded the Slade-Gragg Academy of Practical Arts in Detroit. She and her husband, James, also opened a headquarters for the Association of Colored Women's Clubs, an organization that later elected her national president and president emeritus.
        Mrs. Gragg, who lived in Detroit, is survived by a son, J. Robert Gragg, a retired probate judge; and two sisters, Ann Henderson and Marie Moore, and two grandchildren.
