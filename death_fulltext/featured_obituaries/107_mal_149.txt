        Bob Woolger, who helped shape the career and muscles of the bodybuilder-turned-actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, has died, The Daily Telegraph reported today. He was 83.
        Mr. Woolger, who suffered a stroke in April, is recognized as the founding father of British bodybuilding. Mr. Woolger, a former Olympic referee and British Royal Air Force physical training instructor, was a pioneer of bodybuilding in the 1930's.
        He became close friends with Mr. Schwarzenegger when the young Austrian athlete trained at his gym in Portsmouth, in southern England, in the 1960's. Mr. Schwarzenegger never forgot Mr. Woolger and arranged an 80th birthday party  for his former instructor at his Planet Hollywood restaurant in London.
