        Herb McCracken, a college football player and coach credited with inventing the huddle and co-founder of the Scholastic publishing company, died last Saturday in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 95. His family said the cause of death was renal impairment.
        It was before a game in 1924 that Coach McCracken earned his spot in football lore. Aware that Penn had scouted his Lafayette team's previous five games and had memorized its offensive signals, he ordered his players not to start each down at the line of scrimmage. Instead, he told them to gather behind the line to learn the next play in secret, and the huddle was invented.
        He is survived by his second wife, Martha; a son, George Herbert McCracken Jr., and a daughter, Judith McCracken Clark of Old Saybrook, Conn.
