        The Rev. Hans Urs von Balthasar, a prominent Swiss theologian who was appointed a cardinal four weeks ago by Pope John Paul II, died today, church officials said. He was 82 years old.
        Bishop Otto Wust of Basel, in a brief statement, called Father von Balthasar ''one of the century's greatest theologians.'' The cause of death was not announced.
        Father von Balthasar had been scheduled to leave for Rome on Monday to be elevated to cardinal along with 24 others chosen by the Pope.
        Father von Balthasar was born on Aug. 12, 1905, in Lucerne. After studying in Switzerland, Germany and France, he was ordained in 1936. Except for a brief period in the 1940's, when he served as a religious caretaker of Swiss students, Father von Balthasar concentrated on writing theological works.
        An essay he wrote in 1952, ''The Razing of the Bastions,'' was considered one of the most important works published in preparation of the Second Vatican Council. But after Vatican II, which went forward from 1962 to 1965, Father von Balthasar wrote texts critical of the papal council's reforms.
        His nomination by Pope John Paul II on May 29 came as a surprise to many Catholics. Father von Balthasar told reporters that as an obedient member of the church he accepted the honor but that he had asked the Pope several years ago to ''spare me any titles.''
        Father von Balthasar held honorary doctorates from the University of Washington in St. Louis, Mo., and from universities in Scotland and West Germany.
