        Stanley J. Love, president of Joseph Love Inc., a manufacturer of children's wear, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 68 years old.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone cancer, said his son, William.
        Mr. Love was born on March 1, 1926, in Manhattan, and graduated from the Horace Mann School. He attended the Citadel, then the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1946. He served in the Army in Japan until 1949.
        He later went to work for the company founded by his father, Joseph Love, which was one of the nation's first to specialize in making children's clothing.
        A collector of Japanese art, he was a founder of the Japan Society Gallery. He was also a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the New York Public Library and other institutions.
        He served as a governor of the West Point Society of New York, a group of alumni of the Academy. He was a leader in the effort to establish a Jewish chapel at West Point, which was dedicated in 1988, and the military academy established an award in Asian history in his name.
        He is survived by a daughter, Victoria Love of San Francisco; a son, William K. Love of Manhattan; his former wife, Diane Love of Manhattan; a sister, Jane Love Lee of Manhattan, and two brothers, Robert Love of Santa Fe, N.M., and Matthew Love of Manhattan.
