        Dr. Aufranc was instrumental in developing the first replacement hip in the United States and designing surgical tools for insertion in patients, officials at New England Baptist Hospital said.
        He was chairman of the orthopedics department at the hospital for 14 years, beginning in 1969. In addition to his surgical practice, he trained hundreds of surgeons.
        A native of Missouri, Dr. Aufranc graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1934. He was trained in orthopedics at Children's Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Randolph Arnold; a son, Dr. St. George Tucker Aufranc of Dedham, Mass., and three grandchildren.
