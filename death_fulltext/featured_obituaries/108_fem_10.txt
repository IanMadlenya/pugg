        Denise Grey, a theater and film star whose career spanned nine decades, died  on Saturday at her home in Paris. She was 99.
        Miss Grey, who retired four years ago, came to personify the ideal grandmother to many French audiences. But as a young woman she was a leading can-can dancer at the Folies-Bergere.
        She became a hit in Paris theaters after World War I. During World War II she was a member of the Comedie Francaise and also appeared in films. Her best-known movie work was a co-starring role in 1946 in "Le Diable au Corps" ("Devil in the Flesh"), directed by Claude Autant-Lara.
        In the 1980's she starred in Claude Pinoteau's film "La Boum" ("The Party") and on the stage in a French version of the play "Arsenic and Old Lace," with the roles of her sister and her daughter played by her daughter and her granddaughter. Both survive her.
