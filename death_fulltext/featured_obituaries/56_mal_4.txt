        Edward R. Sammis, an editor and writer, died on Saturday in Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. He was 89 and lived in Westport, Conn.
        He died of heart failure, his brother, Fred Sammis, said.
        Mr. Sammis worked primarily as an editor with a number of publishing houses, from Fawcett Publications, which he joined in 1929, to Macmillan Publishing Company, where he worked when he retired in 1980.
        He also wrote plays, short stories and novels, including "Day in the Sun," a play he wrote with Ernest V. Heyn, which was performed in 1939 at the Biltmore Theater in Manhattan, and "The Stranger in the Mirror," a story of a defrocked minister.
        In addition to his brother, who lives in Darien, Conn., he is survived by a daughter, Ann Sammis of Bisbee, Ariz.
