        Dr. Melville G. Rosen, a physician and educator who encouraged the practice of family medicine at a time when his profession was becoming one of increasing specialization, died on Tuesday in his home in Deer Park, L.I. He was 71.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter, Jane Rosen of San Gregorio, Calif., and Manhattan.
        At his death, he was professor and chairman emeritus of family medicine at the SUNY School of Medicine at Stony Brook, L.I. At University Hospital in Stony Brook, he had been chairman of its family medicine department and had served on the board since its establishment in 1980. Earlier, he had led the department of family medicine at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, L.I., from 1966 to 1978.
        In 1971, he helped to set up a voluntary program in Suffolk County among physicians and pharmacists to ban the dispensing of amphetamines except in severe emergencies. He also served on several statewide panels that concentrated on family care and drug treatment programs.
        He was born in Brooklyn, and received an undergraduate degree from Tulane University in 1942 and a medical degree from Middlesex University in 1945.
        Also surviving are his wife Norma Smith Rosen; his mother, Betsy, of Commack, L.I.; a son, Joseph, of Hanover, N.H.; a sister, Hildreth Bauer of Carl Place, L.I., and two grandchildren.
