        Gunnar W. E. Nicholson, a chemical engineer and paper industry executive for more than half a century, died of heart failure Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Nicholson, who was born in Vaxjo, Sweden, and was a graduate of Chalmers University of Technology in Goteborg, Sweden, came to North America in 1921 to supervise paper mills in the United States and Canada.
        After managing several large mills for the International Paper Company in the 1930's, he moved to the Union Camp Corporation, where he became an executive vice president. In 1956 he was named president of the Tennesse River Pulp and Paper Company, a Tenneco subsidiary, a post he held until he retired in 1968.
        There are no immediate survivors.
