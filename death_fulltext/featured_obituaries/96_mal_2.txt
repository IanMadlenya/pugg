        S. Steven Brody, co-founder and former president of Cadoro Jewels Corporation, a Manhattan-based costume-jewelry manufacturing company, died on Dec. 23 at Beth Israel North Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, and he had been in declining health, said his companion, Max Frescoln.
        Mr. Brody, who was also a costume-jewelry designer, was president of Cadoro from 1960 until he retired in 1987. At that time, the company, which had been founded in 1954, ceased operations.
        Cadoro made a wide variety of high-fashion costume jewelry, which was sold in such stores as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue.
        Mr. Brody and the company's other founder, Daniel Stoenescu, jointly won a special Coty award in 1970 for costume-jewelry designs.
        Mr. Brody was born in Philadelphia, graduated from the Curtis Institute of Music there and became a singer and actor.
        In addition to his companion, Mr. Frescoln, he is survived by two nieces, Pamela Trimble of Chalfont, Pa., and Emily Abbott of Florida, and a nephew, Robert Abbott of Ambler, Pa.
