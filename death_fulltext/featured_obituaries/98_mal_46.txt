        Dr. Herbert M. Katzin, an ophthalmologist who was a pioneer in corneal transplant surgery and eye bank research, died on March 4 in his Manhattan home. He was 81.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his son, Dr. Richard Katzin of Goshen, Conn.
        For most of his career, Dr. Katzin was associated with the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, where he served at various times as director of research for the eye bank, director of the corneal clinic, president of the medical board and chairman of the department of ophthalmology.
        He also was a clinical associate professor of ophthalmology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and an adviser for the Graduate School of Science of Yeshiva University.
        In 1981, he spent three weeks in China teaching surgical techniques. The trip became the subject of a documentary film, "China Eye," that was shown on many Public Broadcasting System stations.
        He was born in Newark and received a medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1937. In addition to writing scores of journal articles, he was co-author of the "Atlas of Eye Surgery" (McGraw-Hill, 1957 and 1962) and the "Rehabilitation of a Child's Eyes" (Mosby, 1961), among other books.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife of 52 years, Annette; a daughter, Mary Katzin-Simon of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
