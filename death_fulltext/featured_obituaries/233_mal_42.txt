        Frank S. Streeter, an investor, philanthropist and collector of rare books and records from sea voyages during the Age of Exploration, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 88. He died after a short illness, his family said.
        Mr. Streeter's collections included books and maps from the travels of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, Capt. James Cook and Ferdinand Magellan.
        Mr. Streeter's father, Thomas W. Streeter, was also a book collector whose collection of Americana was considered one of the most important of its type. It was sold after his death and inspired Mr. Streeter's own interest in book collecting.
        Mr. Streeter was a trustee of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the New-York Historical Society as well as a former president of the Fresh Air Fund and of the Grolier Club.
        After beginning his career at investment firms, Mr. Streeter was a financial adviser to John Hay Whitney, an investor and the last publisher of The New York Herald Tribune. After Mr. Whitney's death, Mr. Streeter was an executor of his estate and continued to work for the Whitney family until his retirement.
        Frank Sherwin Streeter was born in 1918 in Manhattan and reared in Morristown, N.J. He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1940 and served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II. His two brothers and his mother, Col. Ruth Cheney Streeter, a director of the Women's Reserve of the Marine Corps, also served during that war.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy Angell Streeter of New York City, Greenwich, Conn. and Sun Valley, Idaho; three daughters, Ellen Rhodes of New York City, Ruth Streeter of Greenwich, Conn., and Meg Streeter Lauck of Houston; his sister, Lilian Chance of Malvern, Pa.; and his brother, Thomas W. Streeter Jr., of Pacific Grove, Calif.; nine grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
