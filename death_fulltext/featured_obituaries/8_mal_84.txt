        Joseph T. Weingold, a leader in providing humane conditions and community care for retarded and disabled children in New York, died of heart failure Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He was an architect of the Federal consent decree that led to the closing of the State Developmental Center at Willowbrook on Staten Island.
        As executive director of the New York State Association for Retarded Children, he was widely recognized as one of the leading advocates for retarded and disabled children and worked to improve their legal rights, living conditions and services. He helped design a system of community care and neighborhood residences for that has served as a model adopted by many states.
        As the parent of a retarded son who lives in a community residence and as the association's director, Mr. Weingold led demonstrations in front of the Governor's New York City office in 1973 and lobbied extensively in the State Legislature for improved conditions for the retarded.
        As patients began to be moved out of Willowbrook in 1975, he fought to make sure the community residences where they were sent provided humane care.
        Mr. Weingold, who was born in New York City, received a bachelor's degree in literature from Oxford University and a law degree from Columbia University. He practiced law from 1929 until 1950, when he became director of the association that he and other parents of retarded children helped start.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and son, Jonathan. Funeral services will be private.
