        Paifong Robert Cheng, a former Foreign Service Officer of the Nationalist Chinese Government, died on Friday at his home in Queens. He was 93.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        A native of Guangzhou, Mr. Cheng attended Canton College and studied English at Queens College Secondary School in Hong Kong. He served for a year in the Chinese Army and then was invited to go to France as a "worker-student" by the Franco-Chinese Education Association.
        Mr. Cheng graduated from the Ecole des Sciences Politique, and from 1924 to 1934 he served as press secretary for the Chinese at the Secretariat of the League of Nations in Geneva.
        In 1939, after the Japanese invasion of China, Mr. Cheng joined the Chinese Government in Chungking. He held that post until the end of World War II.
        He then was posted to Cuba as first secretary and charge d'affaires, remaining in Havana until the Nationalist Government was forced to flee to Taiwan, in 1949. From 1953 to 1960 he served at the United Nations. Mr. Cheng then became a consultant to Northwest Airlines. He retired in 1975 to write for Chinese news agencies.
        He is survived by his wife Yu-fan Rosita Cheng; two daughters, Sybao Cheng-Wilson of Manhattan, and Mary Molan Wolfson of Washington; a son Pax Cheng of San Jose, Calif.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
