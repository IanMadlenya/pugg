        Lucretia Speziale Robertson, an interior designer, died on Monday at her home in Montclair, N.J. She was 48 years old.
        She died of cancer, her family said.
        A native of Pittsburgh, she was a principal in Lang/Robertson Ltd., a residential and commercial design firm in Montclair that she helped to establish 17 years ago.
        She and her partner, Donna Lang, published a book, "Decorating With Fabrics," and were working on a book on decorating with paper, scheduled for publication next year.
        Mrs. Robertson is survived by her husband, William Sterling Robertson 3d, and two sons, Evan Alexander and Ian Stewart.
