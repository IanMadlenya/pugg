        David Rittenhouse Inglis, emeritus professor of physics at the University of  Massachusetts, who campaigned to dismantle the nuclear arms he helped to build in World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Amherst, Mass. He was 90.
        A native of Detroit and a 1928 graduate of Amherst College, Dr. Inglis received a doctorate in physics from the University of Michigan in 1931. He was  an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University when he was recruited for the Ballistics Research Laboratory at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and, later, for the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb at Los Alamos, N.M.
        After the war he joined the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois as the leader of a team of nuclear theorists. But a growing concern over the spread of  atomic arsenals prodded him to become an outspoken advocate of nuclear disarmament.
        To that end he joined the Federation of American Scientists as its founding chairman in the late 1950's. He and other spokesmen for the group pleaded the cause of a controlled worldwide ban on nuclear weapons on Capitol Hill and before the public.
        Dr. Inglis joined the faculty at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in 1969.
        A particular interest was generating power using wind. He wrote several books on nuclear power and alternative energy sources. He became an emeritus professor in 1975.
        Dr. Inglis's wife, Dorothy, died two years ago. He is survived by a son, John, of Orange, Tex.; a sister, Carol Spicer, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and two grandsons.
