        Ernest Charles Pascucci, an architectural theorist, editor and critic, died on June 12 in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. He was 29 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        He committed suicide, said his sister, Christina McCarthy.
        Mr. Pascucci was part of a small but growing group of young theorists who are trained to write about architecture, not to practice it. Peter Eisenman, the architect, said, ''He was one of the bright young people in architecture theory with a great career in front of him.''
        Mr. Pascucci was born in Yonkers in 1968 and was a graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass. Since January 1996 he had been an editor at Any magazine, a journal of architectural theory and social criticism. Last month, he resigned from the magazine, said its editor, Cynthia Davidson.
        He also contributed exhibition reviews on art and architecture to Artforum magazine.
        Before joining Any, he was the program coordinator at the Temple Hoyne Buell Center for the Study of American Architecture at Columbia University.
        He was a Ph.D. candidate in the art and architecture program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        In addition to his sister, of Wyckoff, N.J., he is survived by his parents, Ernest E. and Jeanne C. Pascucci of Sarasota, Fla.
