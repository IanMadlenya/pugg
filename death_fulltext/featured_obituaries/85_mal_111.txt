        James L. Daly, who served as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan from 1943 to 1960, died on Thursday at Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Mr. Daly, who lived in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. was 80.
        The cause was lung disease, said his wife, Doris.
        After leaving the District Attorney's Office, Mr. Daly became the co-founder of the law firm of Daly & McCarthy in Manhattan, from which he retired in 1988. He was a 1938 graduate of St. John's University Law School.
        He is survived by his wife and three daughters, Joanne McGilton of Hopewell Junction, Barbara Van Tassell of LaGrangeville, N.Y., and Doris Waddington of Wappinger Falls, N.Y.
