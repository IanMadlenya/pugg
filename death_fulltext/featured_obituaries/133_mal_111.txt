        Alfred Terlizzi, board chairman of Capezio/Ballet Makers and an unassuming friend to performers and other dance professionals, died on Feb. 8 at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 58 and also lived in Wayne, N.J.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, said Jane Remer, director of the Capezio/Ballet Makers Dance Foundation.
        Mr. Terlizzi began his career in the 1950's fitting shoes for ballet and Broadway dancers at Capezio. The company, which manufactures shoes and dance clothes, was founded more than a century ago by his great-uncle Salvatore, shoemaker to Anna Pavlova and to singers at the Metropolitan Opera House, across the street from his small cobbler's shop.
        Alfred Terlizzi became president of Capezio in 1977. With his brothers, Nicholas Jr. and Donald, he created jazz oxfords, the Dansneaker and other specialized shoes and tools for dancers.
        Mr. Terlizzi was known for his personal involvement in dance; he attended performances and festivals throughout the country. In 1985, he became president of the Capezio/ Ballet Makers Dance Foundation, formed in 1953, which gives grants to dance companies.
        The foundation also presents the annual Capezio Dance Award, a major honor that carries a cash prize of $10,000 and is given to individuals and organizations that have helped to create a greater awareness and appreciation of dance in the United States. Winners have included Martha Graham, Agnes de Mille, Alvin Ailey, Fred Astaire and Rudolf Nureyev.
        Mr. Terlizzi was also on the boards of the Regional Dance Association of America, Dance U.S.A. and the American College Dance Festival.
        He is survived by his wife, LuAnne, of Naples, Fla., and Wayne, N.J.; two sons, Nicholas, of Toronto, and Michael, of Wayne; his brothers, Nicholas, of Kinnelon, N.J., and Donald, of Pompton Plains, N.J., and his twin sister, Aldine Franz of Elmwood Park, N.J.
