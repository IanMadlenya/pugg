        Bruce Campbell, the press representative of the New York Shakespeare Festival, died of a gunshot wound to the head on Friday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 42 years old.
        The shooting was apparently a suicide, said Merle Debuskey, a friend.
        Mr. Campbell, a summa cum laude graduate of McGill University in Montreal, served on the public relations staff of the Shakespeare Festival from 1982 to 1986, then became the press agent for the La Jolla Playhouse in California. From 1987 to 1988 he was the senior East Coast press agent for Walt Disney Productions, and from 1988 to 1990 he worked for Merle Debuskey & Associates. He became the press representative of the Shakespeare Festival in November 1991.
        Among the shows he represented over the years were "A Chorus Line," "Mastergate," "Anything Goes," "Waiting for Godot," "Six Degrees of Separation," " 'Tis Pity She's a Whore," "Woyzeck," "Fires in the Mirror" and "Marisol."
        Several years ago, Mr. Campbell was told he was H.I.V.-positive. He worked for several groups fighting AIDS, and last summer he spoke on AIDS at the Democratic National Convention.
        He is survived by his father, John Campbell of Atlanta; his mother, Jean Naismith, and stepfather, Capt. J. A. Naismith, U.S.N., both of Savannah, Ga., and a sister, Joyce Newsome of Atlanta.
