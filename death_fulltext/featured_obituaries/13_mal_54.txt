        Lieut. Col. Ambrose H. Nugent, a prisoner of war in Korea who was later tried and acquitted of charges of collaborating with the enemy, died after a long illness Monday in Spohn Hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex.. He was 78 years old and lived in Corpus Christi.
        Colonel Nugent, a career artilleryman in the Army, was captured by North Korean forces on July 5, 1950, a little more than a week after the Korean War began. A captain at the time, he was held prisoner 38 months, his release in September 1953 coming shortly after the war ended.
        In 1955, he was court-martialed on 13 charges, later reduced to 9, that included making propaganda broadcasts and signing leaflets urging American soldiers to surrender.
        The colonel's defense was that he participated in propaganda only under extreme duress and to save the lives of fellow prisoners.
        The seven-week trial at Fort Sill, Okla., ended with his acquittal on all charges. Then a major, he was commended and promoted to lieutenant colonel. He retired in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, Bertie; three daughters, Barbara Skinner of Aransas Pass, Tex., and Marcia Wirtz and Nancy Meier, both of Merrill, Wis.; three sisters, Mary Louise Otto of Peoria, Ill., Fern Duskey of Wausau, Wis., and Evelyn Geise of Phoenix, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
