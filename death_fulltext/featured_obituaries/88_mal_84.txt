        H. William Fitelson, an entertainment lawyer in New York for 50 years who was active in the Theater Guild and Actors Studio, died yesterday at his home in New York. He was 89.
        The cause was obstructive cardiopulmonary disease, said his son, Dr. David Fitelson.
        After graduation from New York Law School in 1927, Mr. Fitelson entered law practice in New York concentrating on clients in the theater and films. He also served as the general counsel and managing director of radio and television programming for the Theater Guild.
        From the 1940's through the 1960's Mr. Fitelson represented many Broadway personalities and investors and was involved in the production of musicals and dramas, as well as motion pictures. He was a member of the original board of directors of the Actors Studio when it was formed in 1948.
        He retired from his law firm, Fitelson & Mayers, a decade ago.
        He is survived by his wife Anita; two daughters, Margaret Fitelson and Robin Fitelson, and his son, all of Manhattan.
