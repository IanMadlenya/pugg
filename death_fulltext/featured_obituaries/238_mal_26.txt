        Nate Gooden, who recently retired as a vice president of the United Automobile Workers union and who served on the board of the German automaker DaimlerChrysler AG, died on Tuesday, the union said. He was 68.
        The union did not announce a place or cause of death for Mr. Gooden, who lived in Southfield, Mich. He had been in ill health for some time.
        Mr. Gooden, who was born in 1938, was a longtime union official and activist for the Democratic Party. He joined the U.A.W. in 1964, when he was hired as an assembly line worker at a Chrysler plant in Warren, Mich. He was elected to his first union position, chief steward, in 1967, and became president of U.A.W. Local 140 in 1975.
        Rising through a series of union positions, Mr. Gooden became a union vice president in a special election in 1999 after the death of another U.A.W. vice president, Jack Laskowski. Mr. Gooden was appointed by the union's president at the time, Stephen P. Yokich, to head the DaimlerChrysler department.
        In 2002, Mr. Gooden joined the supervisory board of DaimlerChrysler, which was formed in 1998 after the merger between Chrysler and Daimler-Benz. Under German law, DaimlerChrysler is required to provide board seats for union representatives. Mr. Gooden held that position until earlier this year.
        In 2002, Mr. Gooden also led the union's negotiating team with Chrysler on a new national contract.
        Mr. Gooden failed to achieve one of his goals: organizing workers at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Vance, Ala., which remains non-union. However, the union was successful under Mr. Gooden in organizing workers at Freightliner, the heavy truck division of DaimlerChrysler, at its plants in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee.
