        Rhea Robinson, the mother of a socialite whose death was dramatized in the Tommy Thompson best seller ''Blood and Money,'' died in a hospital here Sunday. She was 86 years old.
        Mrs. Robinson's husband was the Houston oilman Davis Ashton Robinson. Their daughter, Joan Robinson Hill, died of an unidentified infection at the age of 38 in March 1969, and her husband, Dr. John Hill, a plastic surgeon, was charged with murdering her by withholding medical care. In September 1972, while awaiting his second trial on those charges - the first had ended in a mistrial - Dr. Hill was shot to death at his Houston home.
        In a civil suit filed by Dr. Hill's third wife, his mother and a son of his, Mr. Robinson was accused of hiring the killers as a way of avenging his daughter's death. A jury declined to award damages.
        Mr. Robinson died in 1985.
