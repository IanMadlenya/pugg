        Capt. Giovanni Ruffini, who commanded a series of luxury ocean liners and cruise ships for Home Lines, including its flagship Oceanic for 28 years, died on Sunday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The causes were cancer and complications from diabetes.
        Born into a seafaring family in Italy, Captain Ruffini started out as an apprentice on a three-masted schooner at age 14. He graduated from the Academia Navale in Livorno and served as an officer in the Italian Naval Reserve before returning to the merchant marine. He also held a degree in marine business administration from the University of Naples.
        He joined the Italian-based Home Lines in 1946 as a third officer. When he took the helm of the Argentina in 1949 at age 35 he was the youngest master of a trans-Atlantic passenger liner. Later he was in command of the Atlantic, the Homeric and the Italia.
        In 1964 he was named captain of the Oceanic, which was being built in Italy exclusively for cruising. At 39,000 tons and 774 feet she was the largest cruise ship of her time. Captain Ruffini took her on a Mediterranean shakedown cruise, sailed her across the Atlantic and weighed anchor in New York for a much-noted maiden voyage to the Bahamas in April 1965.
        He continued as her skipper until his retirement in 1982.
        Captain Ruffini is survived by his wife of 38 years, Daria Muzyka Ruffini; a daughter, Nina Ruffini, and a son, John, all of Manhattan.
