        Ralph H. Demmler, who served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first two years of the Eisenhower Administration, died in  Pittsburgh on Saturday. He was 91.
        A lawyer, Mr. Demmler began his practice in Pittsburgh in 1928. A specialist  in corporate banking law, he joined the law firm Reed Smith Shaw & McClay in 1943 and was elected a partner in 1948.
        For years, the firm was generally known as the principal legal adviser for the Mellon banking interests. Today, it has more than 350 lawyers practicing in  Harrisburg, Pa.; McLean, Va.; New York; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh; Princeton, N.J., and Washington.
        In June 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower selected Mr. Demmler, also a Republican, as the Security and Exchange Commission's chairman. Mr. Demmler had  been appointed as a member of the commission just a short time before.
        Mr. Demmler resigned in May 1955, citing personal reasons, but that did not end his service to the commission.
        In 1972, he was one of three members appointed by the commission to serve on  a Special Committee on Enforcement Policy. And from 1969 until 1980, he was an adviser on an American Law Institute project to codify Federal securities laws.
        A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Allegheny College, Mr. Demmler received his law  degree from the University of Pittsburgh. He served as a trustee of Allegheny from 1957 until 1980, and he was chairman of its board from 1968 to 1972.
        At various times Mr. Demmler served as a board member of some of Pittsburgh's leading corporations, including the Duquesne Light Company, the Sharon Steel Corporation and the Hammermill Paper Company.
        Mr. Demmler is survived by his wife of 66 years, Catherine, a son, John H., and three grandchildren, all of Pittsburgh.
