        Louis Grudin, a poet and artist, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had had a brief illness, his family said.
        In the 1920's, Mr. Grudin belonged to the circle that formed around the avant-garde poet Maxwell Bodenheim in Greenwich Village. A prominent figure in literary bohemia, Bodenheim wrote to shock conventional readers and helped to shape the Modernist movement of American poetry.
        Mr. Grudin's early poems and reviews appeared in The Nation, The Saturday Review of Literature and such avant-garde publications of the 1920's and 1930's as The little Review, Broom and The Dial. Over the decades he published several collections of verse as well as novels and essays that sought to define esthetics through logical procedures. Praise From a Peer
        His "Dust on Spring Street," included in "The Outer Land" (1951), drew high praise from William Carlos Williams, who called it "the best poem written in my language in this generation." Among modern poems, Williams declared, "there is none that in vigor, perception of the modern requirements in sheer metrics, imaginative invention and honesty of diction can touch it." "An Eye on the Sky" (1960) was a narrative poem about winter in Manhattan.
        Mr. Grudin, a native of Ukraine, was educated at the University of Alabama, City College of New York, Art Students League and the National Academy of Design. Until the early 1930's, he made a living as a freelance artist and editor. More recently he was employed as the art director of a downtown advertising agency, from which he retired 30 years ago.
        His paintings, in oil and water colors, were representative portraits and scenes from life in the city and countryside.
        He is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Lillian Steigman.
