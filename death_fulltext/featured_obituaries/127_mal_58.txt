        Martin Diskin, a professor of anthropology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an authority on agrarian economies in Latin America, died on Aug. 3 in Mount Auburn hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 62 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He had leukemia, the M.I.T. news office said in announcing his death.
        He received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of California in Los Angeles. For his doctoral dissertation he studied the economy of Oaxaca, Mexico, and later wrote of the experience, ''Living intimately with rural peasant Indians, I saw how anthropology systematically ignores the desperate poverty and the absence of benefits their state could provide.'' He joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1967.
        He was the editor of the 1984 book ''Trouble in Our Backyard: Central America and the United States in the Eighties,'' which was praised by Ronald Radosh, professor of history at the City University of New York, in The New York Times Book Review as providing ''solid knowledge'' about ruling elites.
        Professor Diskin was also a consultant to the American Civil Liberties Union; Oxfam America, a Boston-based organization that works to combat hunger abroad and in the United States; the Inter-American Foundation, a United States Government agency that finances small projects in Latin America, and the International Council of Voluntary Agencies, for which he studied Miskito refugees in Honduras and their repatriation to Nicaragua.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Vilyuna Firstenberg; a daughter, Leah Judith, of Cambridge; a son, Aaron, of Brooklyn; his mother, Rhoda Diskin of Los Angeles; and two brothers, Saul of Phoenix and Philip of Los Angeles.
