        He graduated from Williams College and in 1949 from Yale Law School. He served as law clerk to Justice Hugo L. Black in 1949-50.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Frank M. Jr., of Houston, and George W., of Manhattan; a daughter, Ann Wozencraft Willey of Pleasanton, Calif.; and a brother, John M. of Carmel.
