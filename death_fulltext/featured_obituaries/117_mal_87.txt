        Harold Feinberg, a professor of pharmacology who conducted early studies of basic biological mechanisms that protect the heart during open heart surgery, died on Oct. 11 at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. He was 74 and lived in Chicago.
        The cause was pulmonary disease, said his wife, Mary Kay Vaughn.
        At his death, Dr. Feinberg was doing research at the University of Illinois Medical School on protecting infant hearts in the operating room and on the function of platelets in heart disease. He was also active at the Illinois Masonic and Michael Reese Hospitals.
        He was born in Chicago, graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles and received his Ph.D. in pharmacology at the university's Berkeley campus in 1952. He was a researcher in biochemistry at several institutions before joining the faculty of the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 1963.
        Retiring as a professor of pharmacology and surgery in 1989, he became head of cardiothoracic surgery research at New England Deaconess Hospital/Harvard Medical School. He returned to Chicago in 1992 to resume his research there.
        A student radical on Chicago's West Side, he became a staunch advocate of faculty rights and academic freedom. In 1963 he helped found a biomedical careers program that prepared minority students for medical school and made the University of Illinois a leader in the graduation of doctors from minorities.
        He was the author of nearly 100 papers, book chapters and abstracts.
        In addition to his wife, Dr. Feinberg is survived by a daughter, Marla Feinberg, of San Francisco; a son, David, of Fairfield, Conn.; a sister, Dorothy Glick, of Pasadena, Calif.; a stepdaughter, Alicia Gonzalez, of Providence, R.I., and two grandchildren. A previous marriage to Marjorie Harberg ended in divorce.
