        Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits, an authority on Jewish theology and philosophy, died Aug. 20 at his home in Jerusalem. He was 84 years old and had lived in Jerusalem since 1973.
        Rabbi Berkovits died of heart failure, said a niece, Leah Berkovits.
        Born in Oradea, Transylvania, in 1908, Rabbi Berkovits led congregations in Berlin in the 1930's, in Leeds, England, from 1940 to 1946 after fleeing Nazi persecution, and in Sydney, Australia, from 1946 to 1950, when he immigrated to Boston.
        In 1958 Rabbi Berkovits joined the faculty of the Hebrew Theological College in Chicago, where he became chairman of the department of philosophy. The author of many books and articles, he retired in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Sali; three sons, Abraham, of Haifa, Israel, Shimson, of Brookline, Mass., and Bernard, of Shiloh, Israel, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
