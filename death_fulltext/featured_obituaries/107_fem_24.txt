        Claire Tracy Townsend, a documentary film maker and the author of an expose on nursing homes, died on Tuesday at her parents' home in Los Angeles. She was 43 and lived in Ojai, Calif.
        The cause was breast cancer, said her sister Joan.
        Ms. Townsend was born in Manhattan and grew up in Locust Valley, L.I. She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature, magna cum laude, from Princeton University in 1974. In 1970, she and some classmates working with Ralph Nader, investigated abuses of the elderly in nursing homes in Washington. Their findings were published in 1971 as "Old Age: The Last Segregation," for which Ms. Townsend was editor and principal author.
        After college, she worked in the film industry, becoming a vice president of  creative affairs at United Artists and 20th Century Fox. After earning a law degree from the Southwestern University of Law in 1990, she produced a video documentary, "The Spirit of Peace," about Peace Pilgrim, a woman who renounced all worldly goods and wandered across America preaching the cause of peace.
        In addition to her sister Joan, of Crestone, Colo., she is survived by her parents, Robert and Joan Townsend, whose principal residence is Reno, Nev.; another sister, Jill, of Ojai; and two brothers, Robert, of Reno, and Jeffrey, of Hollywood Hills, Calif.
