        Evarts Ziegler, a Hollywood literary agent, died Saturday at his home in Pasadena, Calif. He was 74 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Among Mr. Ziegler's clients were William Goldman, Joan Didion, John Dunne and Mario Puzo.
        He moved to Los Angeles in 1940 and began his career with the Jaffe Agency. In 1958, with Jerome Hellman and Hal Ross, he founded the firm of Ziegler, Hellman & Ross, a literary talent agency. The firm later became Ziegler Ross when Mr. Hellman left to become a producer. In 1975, Ziegler, Diskin & Roth was formed. In 1983, it merged with International Creative Management. Mr. Ziegler retired in 1985.
        He was a native New Yorker and a graduate of Princeton University.
        During World War II, he served as a captain in the Army and with the Office of Strategic Services.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Maryanne Tucker; three daughters, Susan Arthur of Winnetka, Ill., Cynthia Ziegler of San Francisco and Faith Kleveland of Santa Barbara, Calif., and five grandchildren.
