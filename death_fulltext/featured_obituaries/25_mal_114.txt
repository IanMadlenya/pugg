        Dr. Joseph Jordan Eller, a dermatologist and skin-cancer specialist, died Monday at the West Palm Beach (Fla.) Hospice. He was 92 years old and lived in West Palm Beach.
        Dr. Eller, a 1919 graduate of the Fordham University School of Medicine, was in private practice in New York City for more than 60 years. He moved to West Palm Beach about 10 years ago and maintained a practice.
        He was president of the Pan American Medical Association, an organization he helped organize in 1925. His role as an officer of the association brought him into contact with every President from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan and won him acclaim as a medical ambassador of good will.
        He is survived by his wife, Marguerite; a daughter, Adriana Williams of San Francisco, and a grandson.
