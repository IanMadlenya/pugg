        Harold J. Boreanaz, a defense lawyer in Buffalo whose many clients included a former mayor of Syracuse, died on Friday in the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo. He was 62 and lived in Williamsville, a Buffalo suburb.
        The cause was a small intestinal cancer diagnosed several weeks ago, said his son Robert L., who was also a law partner of his.
        Mr. Boreanaz (pronounced Bore-ee-AH-naz) specialized in complex criminal cases. At his death he was the senior partner in the Buffalo law firm of Boreanaz, Carra & Boreanaz.
        His clients over the decades included figures in the New York judiciary, in Buffalo city government and in racketeering in New York City.
        With Mr. Boreanaz representing him, the former mayor of Syracuse, Lee Alexander, pleaded guilty in 1988 to Federal charges that he had turned the Syracuse City Hall into a racketeering enterprise that extorted at least $1.2 million over 16 years from city contractors.
        Under a plea bargain, Mr. Alexander agreed to serve up to 10 years in prison, to pay a maximum $100,000 fine and to return $1.2 million that he had admitted extorting from contractors. He remains in prison.
        Mr. Boreanaz was born in Buffalo, received his law degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1955, and practiced mainly in Buffalo from then until a few weeks ago.
        In addition to his son Robert, of Buffalo, Mr. Boreanaz is survived by his wife of more than 40 years, the former Patricia Sansone; two other sons, Harold A. of Waterbury, Vt., and Brian J. of Chico, Calif.; two daughters, Lynn Taylor of Waterbury, Vt., and Laurie Carra of Buffalo, and seven grandchildren.
