        Roger M. Herriott, an educator and scientist who advanced the understanding of viral diseases, died March 2 at his home in Baltimore. He was 83 years old.
        Dr. Herriott died of cancer, his family said.
        He headed the biochemistry department at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health for 27 years. He was the first researcher to suggest how a virus spreads its infection, which is by injecting its DNA into victim cells, the school said.
        He was born in Des Moines, graduated from Drake University in 1927 and earned his master's and doctoral degrees in chemistry from Columbia University.
        In 1932 he joined the team headed by the Nobel laureate John H. Northrop at the Rockefeller Institute in Princeton, N.J. There he studied the digestive action of the pepsin enzyme. During World War II he studied the effects of mustard gas on organic material.
        He went to Hopkins in 1948, retired there in 1975 but continued his research and writing.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Cynthia Peggy Walker; a daughter, Alison Wilder of Rochester, N.Y.; a son, Jon of Seattle, who teaches biochemistry at the University of Washington; six grandchildren and two great grandchildren.
