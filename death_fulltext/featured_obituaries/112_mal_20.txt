        Ai Qing, one of modern China's most famous poets, died at a hospital here today. He was 86.
        Mr. Ai, born in 1910 to a prosperous landed family in coastal Zhejiang Province, spent his first five years living with his nursemaid, a poor peasant woman.
        Those early years among China's poor shaped Mr. Ai's social consciousness. One of his most famous poems, "Dayanhe -- My Nurse," has been translated into a  dozen languages, including Japanese, English, German, French, Russian and Portuguese.
        Trained first as a painter, he fell in love with poetry when he studied in France. He started writing poems after returning to China, when he was imprisoned for three years for opposing the ruling Nationalist Government.
        He sided with the Communists in the civil war, joined Mao Zedong in his mountain-cave headquarters and followed Mao's troops into Beijing in 1949 when the Communists took power. He later fell victim to the Communist purge of intellectuals in 1957, and his voice was repressed for nearly two decades.
        Today his works are part of standard college courses on modern Chinese literature.
        Mr. Ai is survived by his wife, Gao Ying, five sons and three daughters.
