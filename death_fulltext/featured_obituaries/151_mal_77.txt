        Harold Brown Ehrlich, a former Republican Assemblyman from upstate New York whose persistence made kindergarten a fixture in New York public schools of the 1940's, died Aug. 11 at his retirement home in Laguna Hills, Calif. He was 97.
        A Buffalo lawyer, he entered the State Legislature in 1933 and became the chief Assembly architect of the Ehrlich-Coudert bill, which recognized a year of kindergarten before first grade as part of the state's educational system. It had taken several years to find the money for state support for kindergarten, but Gov. Herbert H. Lehman signed the bill into law in April 1942.
        Mr. Ehrlich was born in McKeesport, Pa., but was brought up in Buffalo and graduated from the University of Buffalo Law School in 1922. He served as an assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of New York from 1928 until his election to the Assembly.
        He left the Legislature at the end of 1944, when Gov. Thomas E. Dewey appointed him an associate attorney for the State Tax Commission in Erie County. He left that position in 1955 to serve as general counsel and administrative director of the Erie County Port Authority until 1969.
        Mr. Ehrlich's survivors include two daughters, Sue Schwartz of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and Carol Rae Ehrlich of Albuquerque, N.M.; six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
