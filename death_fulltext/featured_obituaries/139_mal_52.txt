        Paul Maslin, a former real estate executive in Manhattan and the Bronx, died on Thursday in Goose Bay, Labrador, while returning to New York from a vacation that included a visit to the North Pole. Mr. Maslin, a resident of Roslyn, N.Y., and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was 82.
        The cause of death was an apparent stroke, said his daughter, Janet Maslin, who is the chief film critic for The New York Times.
        With a cousin, Seymour Moslin, and an uncle, Solomon Moslin, Mr. Maslin began Paul Maslin & Company in 1948, and built it into a concern with 70 properties.
        In the early 1970's, the company bought Nehring Brothers and Herbert Charles, two Manhattan-based real estate companies. The partnership sold both those operations in 1982.
        Mr. Maslin is survived by his wife, Lucille, of Roslyn and Fort Lauderdale; his daughter, Janet, of Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and two grandsons.
