        Dr. Eleanor A. Bliss, former dean of the graduate school of Bryn Mawr College and a pioneer researcher in the clinical use of sulfa drugs before World War II, died of kidney failure Saturday at her home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 88 years old.
        As a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore in 1939, Dr. Bliss, with Dr. Perrin H. Long, published a major work on sulfanilamide, sulfapyridine and other sulfa compounds that became known as miracle drugs for their effectiveness against some forms of pneumonia and bacterial infections.
        Her work, which consolidated and expanded the knowledge of those drugs, gave the medical profession a window on the modern world of antibiotics and, with their use in treating battle wounds, helped save thousands of lives in World War II.
        A 1921 graduate of Bryn Mawr who earned a doctorate at Johns Hopkins in 1925, Dr. Bliss was on the staff at Johns Hopkins until 1952, when she returned to Bryn Mawr as the graduate dean and professor of biology. Dr. Bliss held the posts until she retired in 1966. She wrote for many scientific journals.
        Dr. Bliss is survived by a nephew, William Bliss Tyson, of South Strafford, Vt.
