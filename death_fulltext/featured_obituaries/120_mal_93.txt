        Henry Briggs Silsbee, a professor emeritus of physics at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I., whose research centered on molecular beams and low-temperature physics, died on Jan. 15 at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 74 and lived in Stony Brook and Malibu, Calif.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Silsbee taught at Stony Brook from 1964 until 1995. He also managed the physics department's graduate admissions program.
        A 1944 Harvard graduate, he worked as a junior scientist on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in 1944. One of his final assignments would have been to help arm a third atomic bomb over Japan -- a task he gladly forfeited.
        Returning to Harvard, he received an M.A. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in physics in 1951, after which he worked at the University of California at Berkeley  and the University of Washington. He moved to Long Island to join the staff of Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1963 and joined the SUNY faculty the following year.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Joan Malloy, and a brother, Robert, of Ithaca.
