        Paul Devlin, a Wall Street investment banker for almost half a century, died of heart failure Saturday at his home in Golf, Fla. He was 86 years old and lived in Rye, N.Y., for many years.
        Mr. Devlin joined Blyth & Company in 1924 and became chairman in 1967. He was known in the financial community for an astute sense of stock market conditions that helped make Blyth one of the top investment banking concerns.
        He was born in Chicago and worked as a salesman at Blyth's office there while he attended the University of Illnois. Within a few months he was given a place on the company's trading desk and soon earned a reputation as a shrewd trader.
        During much of his career he specialized in pricing stock issues. He was credited with building Blyth's national trading division into one of its most profitable parts. He retired in 1972, two years after Blyth was acquired by the I.N.A. Corporation, a holding company in the insurance field.
        Mr. Devlin is survived by two daughters, Mary Lou O'Rourke of Damariscotta, Me., and Joann Roath of Morrison, Colo.; 7 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
