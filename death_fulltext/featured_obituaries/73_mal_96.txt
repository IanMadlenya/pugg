        Walter Teller, the author and editor of books on American landscape and literature, died yesterday at a hospital in Princeton, N.J., where he lived. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Walter S. Teller of Los Angeles.
        Mr. Teller was best known for three personal narratives about New England and the Middle Atlantic States: "An Island Summer" (1951), about Martha's Vineyard, "Area Code 215: A Private Line in Bucks County" (1962) and "Cape Cod and the Offshore Islands" (1972). He also won recognition for "The Search for Joshua Slocum" (1956) and "Joshua Slocum" (1971), biographies of a reclusive New England sailor who was first to sail around the globe alone, from 1895 to 1898.
        As an editor Mr. Teller revived the works of forgotten writers in the collections "Five Sea Captains" (1960), "Twelve Works of Native Genius" (1972) and "On the River" (1976). He brought to light the work of several neglected black writers, including Harriet Jacobs and Charles Chesnutt.
        Mr. Teller was born in New Orleans and grew up in New York City, where he attended Public School 132 and the Friends' Seminary. He graduated from Haverford College in 1931 and, after earning a master's degree in English from Columbia University in 1934, found work with the Farm Security Administration in Bucks County, Pa. He wrote several books on farming, and in 1948 helped found the Bucks County Gazette, for which he was an editor and publisher until 1952. In 1959 he earned a doctorate in English from Columbia, and in 1975 he became a member of the advisory council to the English department at Princeton University.
        In addition to his son Walter, he is survived by two sisters, Sophia Teller Block of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Amelia Teller Stolwein of Bethesda, Md., and three other sons: Raphael, of Martha's Vineyard, Joseph, of Portland, Ore., and David, of Derby Line, Vt., and six grandchildren.
