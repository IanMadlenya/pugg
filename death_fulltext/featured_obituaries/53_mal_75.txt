        John Michael Pierce, a North Sea oil developer and the chairman and chief executive officer of Ranger Oil Ltd. of Calgary, Alberta, died on Saturday at his ranch in Turner Valley, Alberta. He was 67 years old.
        A spokesman for the oil company said Mr. Pierce collapsed while taking part in a cattle roundup and that the cause of death was not available.
        Mr. Pierce founded the Ranger Oil Company in Wyoming in 1954 and a year later also became president of West Maygill Gas and Oil Ltd. In 1958, the companies merged into Ranger Oil Ltd. of Canada and, with Mr. Pierce as president and later chairman, became an international oil company, with leaseholdings in the North Sea. In 1985, he relinquished the presidency but remained chairman.
        He was in the Royal Air Force in World War II, graduated from McGill University in 1948 and then joined the Sun Oil Company in Texas. He was an avid flyer and served as chairman of the Calgary Transportation Authority for seven years.
        He is survived by his wife, Erna-May; three sons, Richard and Michael, both of London, and Robert of Calgary; and two daughters, Caroline and Andrea, both of Calgary.
