        Walter E. Rogers, a Texas Democrat who served eight terms in the House of Representatives, died on May 31 at a hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 92.
        Mr. Rogers, who investigated the television quiz show scandals of the 1950's and the Northeast blackout of 1964, was also a witness to some of the country's most violent political history.
        He was in President John F. Kennedy's motorcade in Dallas in 1963, when the president was assassinated, and in the House chamber in 1954 when Puerto Rican nationalists fired onto the floor.
        When the shooting in the House began, another representative said, ''They're setting off firecrackers.'' Mr. Rogers knew better, exclaiming,  ''Hell no! That's gunfire!'' and dragged his colleague to safety.
        Walter Edward Rogers was born on July 19, 1908 in Texarkana, Ark., and reared in McKinney, Tex. After graduating from the University of Texas Law School, he practiced law in Pampa, Tex., and then represented Texas' 18th Congressional District from 1951 to 1966.
        Mr. Rogers is survived by his wife, Catherine, of Naples; six children, John Edward, of Manhattan; Walter Edward Jr., Thomas Kelly and Susan Rogers Healey, all of the Washington area; Robert Peter Joseph, of Seely Lake, Mont., and Samantha Rogers Cutter of Boca Grande, Fla.; a brother, Fred Rogers of Austin, Tex.; 12 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.
