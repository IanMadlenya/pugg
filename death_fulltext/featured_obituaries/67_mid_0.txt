        Laura Peart Bechtel, who helped her husband expand the Bechtel Group into one of the world's largest engineering and construction companies, died on Sunday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 89 years old.
        A family spokesman said she died of natural causes.
        Mrs. Bechtel was married for 66 years to Stephen D. Bechtel, who inherited the San Francisco-based company from his father, Warren, in 1933 and headed it until 1960. He died three years ago.
        She was his active partner and adviser in the business and often traveled with him to projects around the world.
        Among the company's projects during Mr. Bechtel's stewardship of it were the Hoover Dam; the first commercial nuclear reactor, at the since-closed Dresden plant in Morris, Ill.; shipyards that built 560 vessels during World War II; petroleum refineries, and oil and gas pipelines in Alaska, Canada and the Middle East.
        Mrs. Bechtel was born in Yolo County, Calif., grew up in Woodland, near Sacramento, and was educated at the University of California at Berkeley. She became a director of the Ladies' Home Society of Oakland and was active in several other organizations.
        Surviving are her son, Stephen Bechtel Jr. of San Francisco, chairman emeritus of the company; a daughter, Barbara Bechtel Davies of Oakland; seven grandchildren, and 21 great-grandchildren.
