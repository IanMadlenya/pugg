        Gavin Miller, a lawyer who specialized in corporate and securities law and a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association, died on June 15 at his home in Pasadena, Calif. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said Bronwyn Long of Davis Polk & Wardwell, the Manhattan firm where Mr. Miller practiced from 1953 to 1961. At his death, Mr. Miller was counsel to the firm of Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe, in Los Angeles.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Miller graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1950 and cum laude in 1953 from Harvard Law School, where he edited the law review. After moving to California in 1961, he was a founding partner in Agnew, Miller & Carlson, later Hufstedler, Miller, Carlson & Beardsley. He moved to Heller Ehrman in 1990.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife, Suzanne; three daughters, Katherine Conrad of Vashon Island, Wash., Emily Verea of Los Angeles, and Louise Franklin of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a brother, George, of New York; two stepchildren, Cynthia Sue Garlough of Seattle, and Stephen Janes of Pasadena, and two grandchildren.
