        Jim Yestadt, a graphic designer who helped create corporate identities and packaging for MasterCard International, Bell Atlantic Corporation and Sterling Drug Inc., died on Wednesday at his home in Fire Island Pines, L.I. He was 41 and lived on Fire Island and in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was AIDS, said his companion, Richard Barbieri.
        Mr. Yestadt was born in New Orleans, where his father was conductor of the New Orleans Philharmonic Symphony. He graduated from the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1974.
        From 1977 to 1985, he worked at Chermayeff & Geismar Associates of Manhattan, on projects for the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, Barneys New York, Union Pacific and the I.B.M. Corporation.
        Mr. Yestadt was at Lister Butler Inc. from 1985 to 1992. He was senior project designer in the team that revised MasterCard's corporate identity, which included a new design of the interlocking-circle logotype that made it brighter and bolder.
        He was also senior project designer of packaging for Sterling Drug products like Midol and Panadol and for identity programs for Bell Atlantic and Discover Card Services.
        Besides Mr. Barbieri, Mr. Yestadt is survived by his parents, James and Victoria, of Surprise, Ariz., and two brothers, Rick, of Larchmont, N.Y., and Greg.
