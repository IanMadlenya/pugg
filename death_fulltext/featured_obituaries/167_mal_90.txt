        Dr. George Edward Wantz, a New York surgeon known for his innovative approach to hernia operations, died on Dec. 15 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause was complications from a spinal cord injury he had suffered in a fall, his family said.
        At his death, Dr. Wantz was a clinical professor of surgery at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and an attending surgeon at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, where he had worked for more than 50 years.
        He gained an international reputation for his advanced techniques in the operating room and for teaching them to young doctors. His technique in repairing hernias was outlined in several textbooks.
        They included the illustrated ''Atlas of Hernia Surgery,'' which remains in print. Also in print is a text he edited with Dr. V. Schumpelick, ''Inguinal Hernia Repair.''
        He also published an illustrated history of groin surgery and its pioneers, ''Hernia Healers,'' and edited ''Problems in Surgery.''
        He built on the procedures developed by the French surgeon Rene Stoppa, which he introduced into this country. He applied their principles and added his own innovations, including the Wantz procedure in unilateral repair of complex hernias on just one side of the groin or inguinal region.
        Dr. Wantz is survived by his wife of 35 years, Diana Dilworth Wantz; a son, David D. Hoguet of Cincinnati; a daughter, Diana L. Hoguet of Boulder, Colo.; a sister, Dorothy Armstrong Elliott of Cleveland; and two granddaughters. His first wife, Mary Jane Dyble Wantz, died in 1961.
        In 1988, Dr. Wantz repaired a simple hernia on former President Richard M. Nixon, who was released from New York Hospital two days later.
