        Gene Clark, one of five founding members of the Byrds, a leading folk-rock musical group of the 1960's, was found dead Friday at his home in Sherman Oaks, a Los Angeles suburb.
        Books about the recording industry say Mr. Clark was 49 years old. But his manager, Saul Davis, said he was 46.
        A police sergeant, Joseph Brazas, said a physician had certified that the death appeared to have been of natural causes. The coroner's office said it had not received the case for investigation.
        Mr. Davis said he did not know whether Mr. Clark had undergone treatment for any ailment since 1988, when, he said, surgeons removed part of Mr. Clark's stomach because of ulcers.
        The Byrds were formed in 1964 and helped start the folk-rock genre, taking folk songs like "Mr. Tambourine Man" and adding Beatles-influenced guitars and harmonies. Among the group's other hits was "Eight Miles High."
        Mr. Clark played harmonica and tambourine and assisted with vocals. The other band members were Roger McGuinn, lead guitar and vocals; Chris Hillman, bass guitar and vocals; David Crosby, rhythm guitar and vocals, and Michael Clarke, on drums.
        Mr. Clark left the band in 1967 and later recorded a number of albums, some solo and some with other musicians. His most recent work was the 1987 album "So Rebellious a Lover," with Carla Olson.
        Mr. Clark was a native of Tipton, Mo. He was divorced and is survived by two teen-age sons, Kai and Kelly.
