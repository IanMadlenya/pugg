        Robert Chesley, the author of "Night Sweat," the first full-length drama dealing with the AIDS crisis to be produced in New York, died on Wednesday evening at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco. He was 47 years old.
        His literary executor, Nicholas Deutsch, said he had died of AIDS.
        Mr. Chesley was born in Jersey City, and had lived in San Francisco since the early 1980's. His first play to be produced was a one-act drama, "Hell, I Love You," at Theater Rhinoceros in San Francisco. In New York City, the Chelsea Gay Association Theater Project presented three of his one-acts under the title "City Pieces" in 1981. "Stray Dog Story" and "Night Sweat" were produced by the Meridian Gay Theater Company at the Shandol Theater. "Night Sweat" went on to have extended runs in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
        Among his seven full-length and nearly two dozen one-act plays, the most successful was "Jerker, or the Helping Hand," which ran for seven and a half months at the Sanford Meisner Theater in New York City in 1987. An anthology of Mr. Chesley's plays was published in October by Alamo Square Press in San Francisco.
        His companion was Gene Weber of San Francisco.
        Mr. Chesley is survived by his mother, Mrs. Betty Rottger of Redondo Beach, Calif.; his father, D. Leon Chesley of Valley Stream, L.I., and a sister, Joan Apodaca of Redondo Beach.
