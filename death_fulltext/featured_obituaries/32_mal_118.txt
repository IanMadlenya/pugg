        Many of Mr. Whyte's plays dealt with the disabled. The playwright himself was born with physical disabilities and both legs were later amputated. He was on the President's Committee for the Employment of the Handicapped.
        Among his plays are ''Welcome to Andromeda,'' ''Andromeda II,'' ''Funeral March for a One-Man Band,'' ''Horatio'' and ''Disability: A Comedy,'' which was nominated for a 1983 Pulitzer Prize.
        Mr. Whyte was the coordinator of the playwrights and directors unit at the Actors Studio, where he was also playwright in residence. He wrote screenplays for ''Pigeons'' and ''The Happiness Cage'' and was arts and book review editor for The SoHo Weekly News and theater and film editor for The American Book Review. He wrote a children's book, ''The Flower That Finally Grew,'' and, with Gregory Battcock and Paul W. Bradley, a textbook, ''The Story of Film.''
        He is survived by his mother, Eva M. Whyte of Spokane, Wash.
