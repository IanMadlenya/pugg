        Luis A. Amill, a retired specialist in internal medicine, died yesterday at Ocean County Medical Center in Point Pleasant, N.J. He was 92 years old and lived in Sea Girt, N.J.
        He died of congestive heart failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        Dr. Amill joined the medical staff of St. Luke's Hospital in 1924, the year he opened a private practice, and was associated with the hospital continuously until he retired in 1970.
        In 1924 he also was appointed to take charge of the Medical Dispensary at the Old Mission House on Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan. When the Mission House closed in 1955, Dr. Amill had been its head for 31 of its 75 years of existence.
        In 1932 he founded St. Luke's Hematology Clinic and was its chief for 30 years.
        He was born in Puerto Rico and graduated from Columbia College. He received a medical degree from the College of Physicians & Surgeons in 1921.
        A widower, he is survived by a son, Richard L., of Weston, Conn.; two sisters, Iraida Rodriguez, and Palmira Amill, both of Bronxville; four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
