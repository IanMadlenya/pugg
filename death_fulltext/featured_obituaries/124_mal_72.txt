        Richard E. Carlton, a lawyer who defended the Eastman Kodak Company in a landmark patent infringement case, died of a heart attack last Sunday while on vacation in Bath, England. He was 57.
        Mr. Carlton was with the New York law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, which he joined in 1966 and later became a partner in, specializing in antitrust, trademark and other corporate legal issues. Mr. Carlton's clients included the Phillips Petroleum Company and the Ford Motor Company, both of which he defended in antitrust cases.
        He was best known for representing Eastman Kodak in the late stages of a patent infringement suit brought by Polaroid in the mid-1980's. Kodak had been found guilty of violating seven of Polaroid's patents by its entry into the instant photography business. Mr. Carlton was defending Kodak from Polaroid's claim that it should pay $12 billion in damages.
        In 1990, a Federal judge ruled that Kodak was liable for $909 million in damages -- a record amount, but still far less than Polaroid and analysts on Wall Street were expecting.
        Mr. Carlton, who was born in Maynard, Mass., graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. He was a Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, of Bedford, N.Y.; his father, Edwin Carlton Jr., of Maynard; two daughters, Catherine Carlton and Beth Camp, both of New York City, and two brothers, Edwin Carlton, of Las Vegas, Nev., and Stephen Carlton, of Brattleboro, Vt.
