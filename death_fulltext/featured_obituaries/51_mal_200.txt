        Samuel L. Becker, a retired chairman of New York City's Board of Standards and Appeals who worked for city government for 51 years, died on Wednesday at Long Island Jewish Hospital. He was 90 years old and lived in the Bronx.
        He died of heart failure, said his son-in-law, Sheldon Lobel.
        Mr. Becker, who went on the city payroll in 1921 as a $1,200-a-year engineering assistant with the old Bronx Parkway Commission, retired on Jan. 1, 1973 as the $35,000-a-year chairman of the Board of Standards and Appeals, the agency that establishes standards for materials and equipment used in construction and rules on requests for zoning variances. He had been on the board for 22 years, as its first executive director and as a commissioner.
        A graduate of St. Johns and of Cooper Union, Mr. Becker was a lawyer and professional engineer and had also served as counsel to the Department of Buildings. In a 1972 interview, he said that only once during his half-century in Civil Service did he have any misgivings about working for the city -- during the boom years of the late 1920's when his colleagues were making fortunes in private practice.
        "Then, the Depression set in," he recalled, "and I saw how much better off I was than my friends."
        He is survived by his wife, Mabel; two sons, Dr. Jerrold of Lake Success, L.I., and Dr. Stanley, of Westfield, N.J.; a daughter, Adele R. Lobel of Great neck, L.I.; eleven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
