        Stewart Ashley Kingsbury, who did research on the origins of proverbs, folk wisdom and place names and edited several reference books on the subjects, died on Sunday at his home in Marquette, Mich. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Northern Michigan University, where Dr. Kingsbury was a professor of English and linguistics from 1969 until he reached emeritus status three years ago.
        At his death, Dr. Kingsbury was serving as an editor of American Pronunciation, which was written by John Samuel Kenyon in 1924 and had not been revised since 1950. The book, co-edited by Donald M. Lance, is being reissued by the original publisher, Wahr Publishing of Ann Arbor, Mich.
        Dr. Kingsbury was also an editor of the monumental Dictionary of American Proverbs, published by Oxford University Press in 1991. It contains some 150,000 American and Canadian sayings and their variations, as well as information on their origins. In addition, Dr. Kingsbury was working on another collection, Weather Proverbs: Signs and Superstitions.
        Born in Wayne, Mich., Dr. Kingsbury graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946. After 12 years as a naval officer, he received a master's degree in Russian and master's and doctoral degrees in linguistics at the University of Michigan.
        Dr. Kingsbury is survived by his wife, Mildred; two daughters, Susan Uballe of Austin, Tex., and Elizabeth Meegan of Minneapolis; a son, Stewart B., of Ann Arbor; two sisters, Elizabeth Davenport, also of Ann Arbor, and Doris Hoffman of Alexandria, Va., and four grandchildren.
