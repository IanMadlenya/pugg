        Alfred E. Clark, a reporter for The New York Times for more than 40 years, died on Tuesday at St. Clare's Hospital. He lived in Manhattan and was 80 years old.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Frances.
        Mr. Clark started at The Times as a copy boy in 1932 while a student at Stuyvesant High School and later at St. Peter's College in Jersey City.
        After becoming a reporter in 1941, he covered a wide range of subjects, especially crime, the police and politics in the city.
        He was a former president of the Newspaper Reporters Association and a member of the Inner Circle of political writers and of the Silurians, a group of veteran newspaper reporters and editors. He retired in 1983.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years.
