        Sam M. Rose, a Bronx car dealer who became well known in the New York area for appearing in his own local television commercials, died yesterday at the St. Joseph Medical Center in Yonkers after a brief illness. He was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        For 35 years, Mr. Rose owned and operated the S. M. Rose Corporation, a Chevrolet dealership on East Fordham Road. He became a familiar figure to late-night television viewers in the 1960's and 70's when he appeared in commercials for the dealership. The advertisements sometimes ran 50 to 60 times a week on local channels. He was one of the first business owners to use the in-person television technique.
        Mr. Rose was born in St. Louis, where he owned a small chain of retail shoe stores. He moved to New York City in 1942 and worked as a Plymouth DeSoto dealer in Brooklyn until 1956, when he opened his Chevrolet dealership.
        Mr. Rose is survived by two sons, Joseph M. Rose of Manhattan and Ivan F. Rose of Miami, and four grandchildren.
