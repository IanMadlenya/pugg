        Michael Kermoyan, an actor who starred in revivals of "The King and I," died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 73 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his nephew, Loren Toolajian.
        Mr. Kermoyan played the first minister in the 1977 Broadway revival of the musical "The King and I," which starred Yul Brynner. In 1978, with Mr. Brynner on vacation, Mr. Kermoyan played the king, as he had in an earlier revival at the City Center.
        Mr. Kermoyan, who made his Broadway debut in 1954 in "The Girl in Pink Tights," appeared in the 1962 play "Angels of Anadarko" and was featured as a former Cossack general in the 1965 Broadway musical "Anya."
        He is survived by his wife, Katia; a brother, Art, of Novato, Calif.; a stepson, Vladimir Wardell of Dingmans Ferry, Pa.; and three grandchildren.
