        Wolfgang Lotz, an Israeli soldier who spied in Egypt from 1960 to 1965 while posing as a well-to-do German riding teacher and horse-breeder, died Thursday in Munich, the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported yesterday.  He was 73 and had lived in Germany since the 1970's after living in Tel Aviv.
        Der Spiegel said the cause of death was heart trouble.
        During his years as an Israeli agent, Mr. Lotz befriended influential Egyptians but was caught in 1965, sentenced to 25 years in prison, and freed in an exchange of prisoners after the 1967 Middle East war. He and his wife, Waltrud, were then turned over to the Israelis.
        In a 1970 interview, he said that spying was "the greatest game in the world."
        That same year, he disclosed that during the years he spied in Egypt he was an Israeli officer and not a German being paid by Israel, which is what he said the Egyptian authorities had believed.
        By some accounts, Mr. Lotz transmitted information to Israel from Egypt in a miniature radio hidden in a riding boot, and the data he provided included appraisals of Egyptian armaments and confirmation that a suspicious Egyptian installation near the Suez canal was a rocket site.
        He was born in Mannheim, Germany, to a Jewish mother who took him to Palestine after the Nazis came to power.
