        Michael Kasdan, a former Broadway producer and theater manager, died on Saturday at his home in Mahopac, N.Y. He was 66.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Susie Goldsmith, his cousin.
        Mr. Kasdan began his career at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, where he worked for the producing team of Clinton Wilder, Richard Barr and Edward Albee. He went on to manage the Broadway premieres of most of Mr. Albee's plays, including "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," and "Tiny Alice."
        Off Broadway, he served as manager of "The Boys in the Band," "Everything in the Garden" and "The Grass Harp," among other plays.
        He also managed the Broadway engagements of many dance companies, including those of Paul Taylor and Martha Graham.
        Mr. Kasdan was born in New York City and attended Oberlin College, where he majored in dance. Upon retiring from the theater 10 years ago, he became an accomplished potter whose works are included in the Smithsonian Institution's American crafts collection.
        No immediate family members survive.
