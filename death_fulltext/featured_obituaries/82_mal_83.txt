        Rabbi Hyman Muss, a trustee of a theological seminary who was a real-estate developer and philanthropist, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        The cause was cancer, said Sam Hartstein, a spokesman for Yeshiva University, which is affiliated with the seminary.
        Rabbi Muss (pronounced like fuss) had been a trustee of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary in Washington Heights for 23 years.
        He was also a partner with his son Joshua in the Muss Development and Muss Management Companies, which built shopping centers, apartment houses and other structures in Queens and Brooklyn, on Staten Island and elsewhere in the New York metropolitan region. Rabbi Muss also built synagogues and yeshivas.
        He and his wife, the former Ruth Elkin, donated an endowment for the Ruth and Hyman Muss Residence Hall at the main center of Yeshiva University in Washington Heights.
        Rabbi Muss was born and raised in Brooklyn, graduated from a high school affiliated with Yeshiva University and was a member of the first class that graduated from Yeshiva College, in 1932. That year he received his ordination from the seminary. In addition, he earned a law degree from Columbia University.
        The rabbi had been president of the Yeshiva College Alumni Association and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Yeshiva University in 1986.
        In addition to his wife and son Joshua, surviving are another son, Stanley; seven grandchildren, and three sisters, Lillian November, Ida Bobrow and Bessie Gladstone.
