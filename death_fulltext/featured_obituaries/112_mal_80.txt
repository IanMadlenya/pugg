        Barton Heyman, an actor whose last three words uttered in front of a camera brought him more acclaim than 30 years on stage and screen, died last Wednesday  in his Manhattan home. He was 59.
        The cause was heart failure, his son, Sean Heyman, said.
        Mr. Heyman, who played the captain of the prison guards in the highly acclaimed film "Dead Man Walking" and uttered the title of the film as he cleared the way for Sean Penn in his path to his death, starred in many Broadway and Shakespearean productions as well as feature films. But he said he had never achieved such high acclaim as in the film that turned out to be his last.
        A graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles with a major in the theater arts, Mr. Heyman said he saw himself as a "working actor" who took great pleasure in helping to make up the mosaic that is the cast.
        Mr. Heyman appeared on the stage in several New York Shakespeare Festival productions, including "A Doll's House," "Henry V," "A Midsummer Night's Dream"  and "A Private View," an autobiographical play by the Czech playwright Vaclav Havel. His Broadway credits include "Indians," "Sleep" and "The Enclave."
        His most recent theater role was as the truck driver who recognizes a resemblance between a diner waitress and Elvis Presley in the 1995 play "Him," which took the idea that Elvis never really died to a new height.
        In addition to "Dead Man Walking," Mr. Heyman's screen credits include "The Exorcist," "Incident in Baltimore," "Awakenings," "Bonfire of the Vanities" and  "Raising Cain."
        Mr. Heyman is survived by his son, Sean, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren, Nicki, 11, and Samantha, 4.
