        Robert Lasch, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for editorial writing in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, died Monday of kidney failure at a hospice in Green Valley, Ariz. He was 91 and had lived in Green Valley since 1971, when he retired from The Post-Dispatch as editor of the editorial page.
        As an example of Mr. Lasch's work, the Pulitizer judges cited an editorial published in early 1965 that argued for an end to United States military involvement in Vietnam even before the big troop buildups had begun.
        Mr. Lasch began his career as a part-time police reporter in Lincoln, Neb., while studying philosophy at the University of Nebraska. Then, after spending three years at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar he reported for The Omaha World-Herald, won a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University and became an editorial writer at The Chicago Sun. He joined The Post-Dispatch's team of editorial writers in 1950.
        Mr. Lasch is survived by his wife, Iris Anderson; a daughter, Catherine Allen of Aurora, Colo.; a sister, Marion Williams of Little Rock, Ark., seven grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
