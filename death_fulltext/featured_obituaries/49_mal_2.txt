        John McIntire, the character actor who portrayed the stolid, laconic wagonmaster in the hit television series "Wagon Train" in the early 1960's, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. He was 83 years old and had a home in Laguna Beach, Calif., and a cattle ranch in northern Montana.
        The actor died of emphysema and cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. McIntire was a tall, leathery veteran of more than a thousand roles, first in radio and then in television and more than 100 films, often playing law officers and politicians. He was a no-nonsense police chief in "The Asphalt Jungle" in 1950, a meek sharecropper in "A Lion Is in the Streets" in 1953 and a stunned sheriff in "Psycho" in 1960.
        He also won acclaim as a sardonic villain in three 1950's westerns directed by Anthony Mann -- "Winchester .73," "The Far Country" and "The Tin Star." Reviewing "The Far Country" in The New York Times, A. H. Weiler wrote, "Credit John McIntire with the top characterization."
        As Chris Hale, a wagonmaster, he appeared on "Wagon Train" from 1961 to 1965, succeeding Ward Bond in the role. Also on television, Mr. McIntire performed in specials, mini-series and the series "Naked City" and "The Virginian." In the latter he appeared with the actress Jeanette Nolan, whom he married in 1935.
        Mr. McIntire was born in Spokane, Wash., and grew up in Montana, where his father, a lawyer, knew many Indian leaders and where the son learned to ride broncos and love the Old West. He completed high school in Santa Monica, Calif., studied for two years at the University of Southern California, saw the world as a seaman and learned acting on radio, including announcing national "March of Time" broadcasts.
        The McIntires' son, Tim, an actor and musician, died in 1986. Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Holly Wright, a fine-arts photographer, of Charlottesville, Va., and a grandson, Luke Savin Wright.
