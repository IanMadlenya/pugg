        Former Vice President Paulo Muwanga died today, the state radio reported. He was 70 years old.
        The radio said Mr. Muwanga had died at Nsambya Hospital near Kampala, where he had been under treatment since Friday. The broadcast did not give the cause of death, but he was known to suffer from hypertension and had a heart attack in 1988.
        Mr. Muwanga was freed from jail in October after the Government dropped charges on which he had been imprisoned for four years. He had been accused of kidnapping two truck drivers in 1981 while serving as Vice President and Defense Minister in the Government of President Milton Obote, who was ousted in a military coup in 1985.
        Mr. Muwanga was de facto President in 1980 as chairman of a military commission that ruled this East African nation after a combined force of Ugandan exiles and Tanzanian troops ousted the military dictator Idi Amin in 1979.
