        Walther R. Volbach, a theater director, historian and educator, died yesterday in Amherst, Mass. He was 98.
        Dr. Volbach specialized in theater directing, opera production and scenic design. He translated many modern European plays into English, including works by Schiller, Franz Grillparzer and Montherlant. He was an early champion of the Swiss scenic artist and esthetician Adolphe Appia and translated many of his essays.
        In all, he published more than 100 scholarly articles and several books on theater and opera history. His books include ''Adolphe Appia: Prophet of the Modern Theater,'' a biography published in 1968, and ''Memoirs of Max Reinhardt's Theaters'' (1972).
        Dr. Volbach was born in Mainz, Germany, on Dec. 24, 1897, and conducted his first opera there when he was 17. As a young man in Berlin, he served as assistant to the director Max Reinhardt and wrote theater and opera criticism for the Berliner Morgenpost.
        After coming to the United States in 1936, he taught at Marquette University in Milwaukee and in 1946 joined the faculty of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth as professor of drama. He was also a founder of the Fort Worth Opera Association. After his retirement in 1965, he was a visiting professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst until 1971.
        No immediate family members survive.
