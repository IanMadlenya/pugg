        Schroeder Boulton, a 67-year veteran of Wall Street, died on Feb. 13 at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Boulton was fond of saying that he was one of just four people who began their careers on Wall Street in the depth of the Depression. He was hired in 1931 to be a research trainee at Baker, Weeks & Harden. In 1936, he graduated from Columbia University, receiving a degree in business.
        He went on to work at Lazard Freres & Company and Jesup & Lamont. He retired two years ago as first vice president of Tucker Anthony Inc.
        Mr. Boulton was born in Brooklyn in 1909. He was a grandson of Frederick Schroeder, mayor of the City of Brooklyn and founder of the Germania Bank.
        In 1935 he married Marjorie Clayton; she died in 1964.
        A year later he married Dr. Mary Holzman Bancroft, a psychotherapist who died in 1998.
        Mr. and Dr. Boulton were outspoken supporters of the civil rights movement and their Greenwich Village apartment was known as a meeting place for civil rights workers.
        His daughter, Nancy Boulton-LeGates, remembers driving through a neighborhood when she was 5 years old and asking her father why anyone would want to live there. She said he answered: ''Some people don't have a choice. They need to be helped, and it's our role in life to help them.''
        Mr. Boulton is survived by two daughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, and Nancy Boulton-LeGates, of Lincoln, Mass.; and three stepsons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle.
