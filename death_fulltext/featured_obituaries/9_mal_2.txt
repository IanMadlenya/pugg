        The community health plan, founded by Mr. Haight in 1973, was the first such federally qualified health-maintenance organization to be established in Westchester County and the New York metropolitan area.
        Mr. Haight was chairman of the Digitronics Corporation, a data acquisition and communications equipment manufacturer, from 1957 until the late 1960's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Frances L. Hoge; two sons, Courtenay, of Greenwich, Conn., and Peter, of Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.
