        Dr. Marcel Bessis, a French physician who was applauded in the United States 30 years ago for his role in developing instruments and techniques for studying portions of single live cells, died on March 28 in Paris. He was 76 and lived in Paris.
        Dr. Bessis, a leader in that field, was given an ovation in 1964 in Atlantic City, N.J., at a meeting of the American College of Physicians after he described how it had become possible to study a single cell.
        The methods the doctor described made it possible, as he put it, to treat the single cell as the diminutive organism it is, damaging or amputating selectively all of its various parts, one at a time, to see how the whole thing works.
        He was born in Tunisia and studied medicine in Paris. He taught in Paris, headed the research laboratories of the National Blood Transfusion Center there from 1946 to 1966 and later directed a cell-pathology institute, also in Paris. He did considerable research on hematological diseases and blood cells.
        He was married in 1952 to Claude Desserteaux and had a son and two stepdaughters.
