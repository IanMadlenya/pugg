        Jacques Schwalbe, a Manhattan business executive who was a prominent supporter of Jewish institutions, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. He was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
        Among Mr. Schwalbe's principal beneficiaries were Yeshiva University, where he established a Samson Raphael Hirsch Professorship in Torah to keep alive the  writings of a man considered important to Jewish tradition, and the Wurzweiler School of Social Work, which he helped found. He was also a financial supporter  of the university's affiliate, the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary.
        Mr. Schwalbe also supported Bar-Ilan University of Israel, where he endowed  a Hirsch chair.
        He was a founder of the orthodox Kew Gardens Synagogue in Queens in 1945 and  its president for about 20 years.
        Mr. Schwalbe was born in Antwerp, Belgium, and came to the United States in 1939, first settling in Kew Gardens. He went into the real estate business and became an owner of Manhattan office buildings. He founded the Rexon Realty Corporation in 1944, followed in 1965 by the Hilson Management Corporation, which owns and manages commercial properties. At his death, he remained its president.
        Mr. Schwalbe is survived by two daughters, Gaby Goldblatt of London, and Vicky Nathan of Larchmont, N.Y.; two sons, Peter and Robert, both of Manhattan,  16 grandchildren and 26 great-grandchildren. His wife, Hanna Breuer Schwalbe, died five years ago.
