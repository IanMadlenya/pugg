        He died of a heart attack, his son Andrew said.
        He was on the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital Center from 1961 to 1977. Dr. Shenker was also director of obstetrical and gynecological services at Booth Memorial Medical Center in Flushing, Queens.
        He was among the first to do research in fetal monitoring, and he wrote a number of papers on the subject. More recently he devoted his research to the fetal heart.
        He was for many years an examiner of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and was president of the New York Obstetrical Society in 1977.
        After moving to Tucson in 1977, Dr. Shenker joined the faculty of the University of Arizona, where he was teaching at his death. He received a degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1952.
        In addition to his son Andrew, of Rockville, Md., a pediatrician, he is survived by his wife, the former Cynthia Sorkin; another son, Abraham, of Lexington, Mass. a computer engineer; a daughter, Nancy, of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; a sister, Jean Gallner of Penbroke Pines, Fla., and three grandchildren.
