        Hamish N. Munro, a nutrition scientist and doctor who was the first director of the Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, died on Oct. 28 in a nursing home in Glasgow, Scotland. He was 79.
        He had suffered from Parkinson's disease for eight years, the university said.
        For six decades, Dr. Munro studied the biochemical effects of nutritional change, particularly protein metabolism. His studies led to a deeper understanding of the role of nutrition in aging.
        Hamish Nisbet Munro was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on July 3, 1915, and began his studies of protein metabolism while a student at Glasgow University, where he completed his medical training in 1939. From then until 1966, he held academic positions in medicine at the university. He wrote a four-volume work, "Mammalian Protein Metabolism" (Academic Press, 1964-70).
        In 1966, he became a professor in the department of nutrition and food science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1980, he was appointed professor of medicine at Tufts and director of the world's first research center devoted to the nutritional needs of the elderly. He was director of the center for three years and continued to teach at Tufts and conduct nutrition research until he retired in 1991.
        From 1975 to 1980 he was chairman of the United States Recommended Dietary Allowances Committee of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also a member of international nutrition committees. He was a former president of the American Institute of Nutrition and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and the recipient of several awards.
        His wife, Dr. Edith Munro, died in 1985. He is survived by a daughter, Joan Munro of London; three sons, Colin and Michael, both of Glasgow, and Andrew, of Acton, Mass., and three grandchildren.
