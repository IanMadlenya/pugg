        Arnold Billig, founder and president of the United Probation Officers Association of the City of New York, died of a heart attack Saturday at a restaurant in Savannah, Ga. He was 70 years old and was en route from his home in Queens to his winter home in Delray Beach, Fla.
        Mr. Billig spent 34 years working for the city as a caseworker for the Department of Welfare, a probation officer and as probation supervisor for State Supreme Court in Queens. He founded the citywide probation officers group in the late 1970's because he felt officers were not represented well by the union that probation officers across the state belonged to. He retired in 1982.
        He was a graduate of Brooklyn College and held a master's degree in public administration from New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Adele Kempin; three children, Ronda, of Chevy Chase, Md., Melinda, of Yonkers, and Michael, of Lancaster, Pa.; a half brother, Joseph Watkins of Albany; a sister, Midge Erdheim of Royal Palm, Fla., and six granddaughters.
