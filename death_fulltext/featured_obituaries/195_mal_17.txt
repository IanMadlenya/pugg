        Richard T. York, a dealer in American art who was president and founder of the Richard York Gallery in Manhattan, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 52.
        The cause was cancer, his gallery announced.
        He opened his gallery at 21 East 65th Street in 1981 and concentrated on American art from the mid-18th to the mid-20th centuries. He represented the estates of John Marin and Joseph Stella.
        He soon gained a reputation for museum-quality shows. He sold major paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe, Charles Demuth, Thomas Anshutz and Rembrandt Peale to museums throughout the country.
        In 1999 he represented a purchaser who bought a circa 1837 version of ''Peaceable Kingdom'' by Edward Hicks at auction for $4.7 million.
        Among his most important sales were those of O'Keeffe's ''Petunias,'' which went to the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco; and Peale's ''Michael Angelo and Emma Clara Peale,'' which went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Before opening his gallery, he had worked in New York with Knoedler & Company, Hirschl & Adler and the Hammer Galleries. He was vice president of the Art Dealers Association of America for three years and recently served for seven years on the Art Advisory Panel of the Internal Revenue Service. He was also a William Cullen Bryant Fellow with the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Born in Nashville, he graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1972 and studied conservation at the University of Copenhagen.
        He is survived by his partner, Kevin Scott; his parents, James S. and Jeane York of Murfreesboro, Tenn.; a brother, James L. York of Nashville; and a stepsister, Brenda Phillips of Indianapolis.
