        Stane Dolanc, a former deputy to Marshal Tito, the Yugoslav leader, and later a member of a joint presidency that governed the nation, died on Monday in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He was 74.
        He died after illness brought on by a stroke several months ago, news reports said. In recent years, he had lived in seclusion in a village near Kranjska Gora in western Slovenia.
        Mr. Dolanc was born in 1925 in Hrastnik in southeastern Slovenia and was a Yugoslav army officer. He joined the Liberation Front of Slovenia in World War II, in 1941, and was arrested by the Gestapo that year. He rejoined the Liberation Front in 1944 and became a member of the Communist Party that year.
        Mr. Dolanc was considered energetic, ambitious and shrewd. He received a law degree in 1958, held numerous Communist Party posts and worked his way up the ladder in Slovenia until he was elected to the executive bureau of the League of Communists in 1968.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Dolanc rose to the No. 2 position in the government, party secretary general, behind Tito, and he was sometimes mentioned as his successor. In 1979, however, Mr. Dolanc lost the position.
        After Tito died in 1980, a collective presidency governed. In 1982, Mr. Dolanc, still an influential party member, was named interior minister. In 1984, he was elected to the joint Yugoslav presidency, remaining there until retiring in 1989, two years before the nation broke apart.
        Survivors include a wife, a daughter and a son.
