        Dr. Morris F. Steinberg, who was an associate professor at the New York University School of Medicine and who practiced internal medicine and cardiology in Manhattan for more than five decades, died on Thursday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 85.
        The cause was pulmonary complications, said Roland J. Kalb, a friend.
        Dr. Steinberg, who lived in Manhattan, retired six years ago as a senior attending physician at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He also was an associate physician at Beth Israel North and Cabrini Hospitals.
        He is survived by his wife, Evelyn Sachs Steinberg, and a brother, Max, of Montreal.
