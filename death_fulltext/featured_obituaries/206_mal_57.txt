        Leo Hausman, a retired textile executive and philanthropist who was a senior official of United Cerebral Palsy of New York for more than 40 years, died at his home in Hallandale, Fla., last Friday. He was 94.
        Mr. Hausman, who lived in Hallandale and Manhattan, died of natural causes, said William White, director of development for United Cerebral Palsy of New York.
        A native of the Bronx, Mr. Hausman held top posts in a series of textile concerns operated by his family, beginning in 1932 after he graduated from New York University.
        His philanthropic work, focusing largely on health care, began in 1958 when his older brother, Jack, asked him to become president of the fledgling New York cerebral palsy organization. Jack Hausman, who had a son with cerebral palsy, had been one of the group's founders in 1946.
        Leo Hausman remained a guiding force in the agency until his death, when he was its chairman.
        Mr. Hausman worked for more than 20 years with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, and joined his two brothers, Jack and Sam, in helping to found the Long Island Jewish Medical Center and the North Shore Medical Center.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jane Karp of Palm Beach, Fla; a son, Martin Hausman of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
