        Dr. Harry J. Johnson, a Manhattan physician who believed that sensible habits and a positive attitude led to a healthy life, died on Saturday at his Park Avenue apartment. He was 91.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Michael.
        Dr. Johnson was an expert in the field of preventive medicine and through how-to books and seminars advised Americans on how to maintain vigorous health and live a long life.
        Over the years Dr. Johnson, who was tall and thin, crusaded against negative thoughts, heavy drinking, overeating and sloth. He called obesity "the plague of the 20th century."
        In 1937 he became the medical director of the Life Extension Institute in New York, one of the nation's oldest preventive health centers. The institute offers periodic physical examinations and health counseling. It has became a multimillion-dollar business that is now on Madison Avenue but is moving to Rockefeller Center.
        Dr. Johnson retired in 1978, and in 1983 he and his wife donated $1 million to the Daniel Hand High School in Madison, Conn., where they had a second home, to be used for college scholarships for graduating seniors.
        He graduated from Columbia College and the Harvard Medical School, and over the years held a series of academic and administrative positions at hospitals in Manhattan.
        Dr. Johnson was the author of "Invitation to Health, a Guide to Successful Living," (1944), "The Life Extension Institute Guide to Better Health," (1959), "Your Health Is Your Business," (1965) "A Life Extension Institute Report on Alcohol, Sex and Health" (1974) a survey of 6,000 American business executives.
        He is survived by his wife, Teresa, of New York and Madison; two sons, Michael, of Madison, and Keith, of Nashville, and five grandchildren.
