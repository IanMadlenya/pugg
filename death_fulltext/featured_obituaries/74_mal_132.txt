        Alden S. McWilliams, a cartoonist and co-creator of the first black lead character in an American comic strip, died last Friday at a hospital in Stamford, Conn. He was 77 and a resident of Darien, Conn., and Eastham, Mass.
        The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.
        For 55 years, he drew and wrote for syndicated strips and comic books. Noted for his realistic style, he won the Cartoonist Society's 1978 award as the Best Story Cartoonist.
        In 1968 he and the writer John Saunders introduced Danny Raven as the black co-star of "Dateline: Danger," a strip about two reporters. Eventually other regular black roles began appearing on the previously segregated comic page, where they had been relegated to bit parts and stereotypes like cannibals.
        The idea for a black-and-white pair originated with Mr. McWilliams's work on the "I Spy" comic book, based on the television serial's interracial cast of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp.
        The comic books he worked on were Military Comics, Crack Comics, Airboy, Star Trek, The Wild West, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and He-Man. Among the syndicated strips, he was the co-producer of "Twin Earths" and also drew "Davy Jones," "Rip Kirby," "Curly Kayoe," "On Stage" and "Dan Flagg."
        He served in the Army in World War II.
        Surviving are his wife of 46 years, the former Ruth Jensen; two sons, Chris J., of Westford, Mass., and A. Richard, of Millbrook, N.Y.; a sister, Faith Dargay of Riverside, Conn., and four grandchildren.
