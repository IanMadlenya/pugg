        Brian Coffey, an Irish poet whose experimental, nearly hermetic verse explored the possibility of love and poetry in a dehumanized world, died on April 14 at his home in Southampton, England. He was 89.
        Neil Baldwin, the executive director of the National Book Foundation, notified The New York Times yesterday of Mr. Coffey's death.
        Mr. Coffey was born in Dun Laoghaire, near Dublin. His father was a professor of anatomy and the first president of University College, where Brian earned a bachelor's degree in arts and sciences and a master's degree in science. At University College he became friends with the poet Denis Devlin, with whom he jointly published "Poems" (1930), his first work.
        Mr. Coffey spent the early 1930's in Paris, studying physical chemistry and, under Jacques Maritain, the philosophical problems of physical science. He eventually wrote his doctoral dissertation under Maritain on St. Thomas Aquinas. While in Paris, he also struck up a lifelong friendship with Samuel Beckett.
        He taught high school mathematics and science in London from 1939 to 1947, when he received a doctorate from the Institut Catholique in Paris. From 1947 to 1952 he taught philosophy in the United States, at St. Louis University, a Jesuit institution. He returned to England in 1954 and taught high school mathematics until he retired in 1972.
        His major works are the long poems "Advent" (1975) and "The Death of Hektor" (1979) and his translation of "Un Coup de Des" ("A Throw of the Dice") by Stephane Mallarme, an important influence on his own work. In 1985, he published "Chanterelles," a book of short poems. He also edited Mr. Devlin's "Collected Poems" (1964). At the time of his death he was at work on a long poem, "The Prayers."
        He is survived by his wife, Brigid; five daughters, and three sons.
