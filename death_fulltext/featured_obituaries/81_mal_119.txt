        Jiri Hajek, the Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia during the short-lived liberal reforms in 1968 that became known as the Prague Spring, died Friday in a hospital in Prague, the Reuters news agency reported. He was 80.
        The agency, citing a human-rights advocate, Libuse Silhanova of the Czech Helsinki Citizens Assembly, said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Hajek was an intellectual leader of the brief period of democracy in 1968 that led to an occupation by other Warsaw Pact countries. Caught abroad by that invasion, he delivered an impassioned plea against the occupation to the United Nations Security Council before the takeover silenced him.
        In later decades, Mr. Hajek was a leading human-rights figure and was chairman of the Citizens Assembly from 1988 until 1992. He was also a founder of the Civic Forum, which led the nonviolent revolution that rid Czechoslovakia of Communist domination in 1989. Early Associate of Havel
        Mr. Hajek was also a founder of the Charter 77 human-rights movement; another founder was Vaclav Havel, now President of the Czech Republic. (The republic and Slovakia separated on Jan. 1.)
        After studying at Charles University in Prague, Mr. Hajek held a variety of academic posts. In 1965, while representing Czechoslovakia at the United Nations, he was concurrently Professor of the History of International Relations at Charles University.
        He was also active in the Social Democratic party before 1948, when the Communists took power. He was a member of the National Assembly from 1945 to 1954 and chairman of its foreign relations committee from 1952 to 1954.
        He served as Ambassador to Britain (1955-58), Deputy Foreign Minister (1958-62), representative to the United Nations (1962-65), Minister of Education and Culture (1965-67) and Minister of Education (1967-68).
