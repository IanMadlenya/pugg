        Kurt Bernheim, a literary agent who helped bring the works of prominent European authors to the United States and American writers to Europe, died on Wednesday in Hewlett, L.I., at the home of his longtime companion, Erica Amsterdam. He was 85.
        The cause was cancer, said Monica Bernheim, his daughter.
        Among the authors Mr. Bernheim helped introduce to this country were Hermann Hesse, Peter Handke and the psychologist Alice Miller. He represented some of Europe's best-known literary houses, including the German firm Suhrkamp, Bonniers in Sweden and Presse de la Cite in France. "He was not just an ordinary scout or translator," said Roger Straus, the president of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. "He understood the problems of the writer as well as the publisher."
        Mr. Bernheim was born in Salzburg, Austria, in 1908, and received a doctorate in literature at the University of Vienna. In 1933, fleeing the Nazis, he moved to Stockholm, and in 1941 he came to the United States. After he became an American citizen, he was drafted, and he went to Germany as a counterintelligence officer. He was awarded a Silver Star and two Bronze Stars.
        After the war, he was one of the first literary agents to advise American publishing houses on European books. He also translated some of those works into English.
        In addition to his daughter, of New York City, and his companion, he is survived by a grandson, Eli.

        An obituary headline yesterday about a literary agent who helped bring the works of European authors to the United States misspelled his surname. He was Kurt Bernheim.
