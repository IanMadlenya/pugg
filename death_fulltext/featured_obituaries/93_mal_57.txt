        Peter David Gould, a production designer for such Broadway shows as "Cats" and "Miss Saigon," died yesterday at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 50 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said his wife, Jane Stuttell.
        At his death, Mr. Gould was working as associate production designer on "Sunset Boulevard." He also served in that capacity on such Broadway shows as "Starlight Express," "Sophisticated Ladies," "Hurlyburly," the 1984 revival of "Little Me," "The Real Thing" and "I'm Not Rappaport." He had long creative relationships with the designers Tony Walton and John Napier, and was appointed the director of John Napier Designs in 1988.
        He was also a set designer, on productions that included those for the Alley Theater in Houston, the Roundabout Theater Company, the Milwaukee Repertory Company, the New York Theater Workshop and the Juilliard School.
        He was a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Antioch College and the Bristol Old Vic Theater School in England. He taught in the theater departments at Williams College, Skidmore College and Queens College and in the school of drama at the University of Washington.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Rachel, and two sons, Gabriel and Dylan, all of Brooklyn Heights; his mother, Eleanor, of Queens, and a brother, Stephen Jay Gould, the Harvard paleontologist and author, of Cambridge, Mass.
