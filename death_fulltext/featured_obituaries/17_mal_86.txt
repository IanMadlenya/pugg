        Archbishop Philippe Nguyen Kim Dien, who defied Communist attempts to control Vietnam's Roman Catholic Church, died on June 8 in Ho Chi Minh City, the official Vietnam News Agency said today. He was 67 years old.
        The press agency, in a report monitored in Bangkok today, said only that Archbishop Dien died of an illness in a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
        In 1984, Archbishop Dien was barred from work as a priest and was put under house arrest for urging priests not to join the Committee for Solidarity of Patriotic Vietnamese Catholics. The state had formed the group the previous year, and critics said it was designed to control the church.
        The clergyman spent his last years under house arrest. He continued to circulate letters among parishioners, however, and the authorities apparently made no serious attempt to replace him.
        In 1986, cardinals and bishops from 40 countries issued a protest letter when Vietnam barred Archbishop Dien from traveling to Rome to attend the Vatican's Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.
        The Vatican said Archbishop Dien was born in March 1921 in Vinh Long, in southern Vietnam. He was ordained in July 1947 and became a bishop in 1961 and Archbishop of Hue in 1968, the Vatican said.
