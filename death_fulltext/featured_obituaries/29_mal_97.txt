        Richard Quine, a film actor who went on to become a successful director, died of a gunshot wound on Saturday at the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Center. The police said the death appeared to be a suicide. Mr. Quine was 68 years old.
        Mr. Quine had been despondent for years over poor health, said Sgt. Jerry Schlotthauer of the West Los Angeles division station.
        Mr. Quine did most of his directing during the 1950's and 60's. He had switched to directing from acting, ending a film-acting career which had begun with his debut in ''Counsellor-at-Law,'' when he was age 12. He acted in a dozen films, including ''Little Men,'' ''Babes on Broadway,'' ''My Sister Eileen,'' ''Command Decision'' and ''No Sad Songs for Me.''
        He directed his first film in 1952. It was ''Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder,'' which he also co-wrote. He then directed ''So This Is Paris,'' ''My Sister Eileen,'' ''Solid Gold Cadillac,'' ''The World of Suzie Wong'' and ''Sex and the Single Girl.''
        Mr. Quine also directed ''Bell, Book and Candle,'' ''It Happened to Jane,'' ''Operation Mad Ball'' and ''How to Murder Your Wife.''
        He is survived by his wife, Diana, of Bel Air, Calif.
