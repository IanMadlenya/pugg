        Peter Hujar, a photographer known for his portraits of personalities in the cultural world, died of AIDS-related pneumonia at Cabrini Medical Center on Thursday. He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Starting as a fashion photographer, Mr. Hujar later turned to fine-art photography and portraits. Among his subjects were Susan Sontag, Robert Wilson, Charles Ludlam and William Burroughs. In 1976, he published a book, ''Portraits in Life and Death,'' with an introduction by Ms. Sontag, in which his portraits of living personalities were accompanied by a group he had taken in the catacombs at Palermo, Sicily. In his last exhibition, at the Gracie Mansion Gallery in 1986, he showed - besides portraits - animal pictures, interiors, machinery and landscapes. His work is in the collection of several institutions, among them the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
        Mr. Hujar, born in New York City in 1934, graduated from the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and later studied with the photographer Lisette Model, who was an important influence in his turning from fashion to fine-art photography.
        Mr. Hujar is survived by his mother, Rose Murphy of Brooklyn. A requiem mass will be held at 9:30 A.M. today at St. Joseph's Church, 371 Avenue of the Americas, at Waverly Place.
