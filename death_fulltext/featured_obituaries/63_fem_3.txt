        Musa McKim Guston, a poet and painter who was the widow of the Abstract Expressionist artist Philip Guston, died on Monday at Kingston Hospital in Kingston, N.Y. She was 83 years old and lived in Woodstock, N.Y.
        She died of congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Musa Mayer of New York City.
        Mrs. Guston was born on Aug. 23, 1908, in Oil City, Pa. She studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, where she met Mr. Guston, and had an early career as a painter. In the Depression, she worked on mural projects for the art agencies established by the Works Progress Administration, and in 1941 she collaborated with her husband on a mural for the United States Forestry Sevice in Laconia, N.H.
        In later life, she turned to poetry, publishing in small literary magazines. She also modeled for Mr. Guston in many of the figurative paintings he did in the latter part of his career.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Josephine McKim Chalmers, also of Woodstock, and two grandsons, David Kadish of White Plains and Jonathan Kadish of Hoboken, N.J.
