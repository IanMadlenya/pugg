        Raymond Parker, who made the Concord Resort Hotel the biggest resort in the Catskills and one of the world's largest, died on Thursday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Kiamesha Lake, N.Y.
        He had a short illness, his family said.
        Mr. Parker was the chairman and chief executive of the Concord. For 40 years he ran the company with his wife, the former Clara Winarick, whose family founded the hotel. She died in 1991.
        All five of their children are involved in running the 1,200-room resort, which was once the biggest hotel anywhere. Stars, Skiing and Swimming
        Under his leadership, the Concord billed headliner nightclub performers like Bob Hope, George Burns, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand, Alan King, Buddy Hackett and Jackie Mason.
        The Concord added an 18-hole golf course and 40 tennis courts that drew stars like Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and Billie Jean King.
        The Concord developed the first commercial snow-making machine for skiing. It was also the first resort in the Catskills to build an indoor pool for year-round swimming. And Mr. Parker opened a Concord Hotel on St. Maarten in the Caribbean.
        He was also a rancher and was a leading breeder of registered quarter horses at Thunder Hill Ranch and of championship Brown Swiss cattle at Concord Farms. Both the ranch and farm are in Grahamsville, N.Y.
        Mr. Parker was born in Queens. He qualified for the Olympics in track and field and was a close friend of Jesse Owens, his family said. Before joining the Concord, he worked in the hardware business.
        His survivors include two daughters, Naomi Friedman of Rye, N.Y., and Laurie S. Parker of Kiamesha Lake; three sons, S. Robert, George N. and James L., all of Kiamesha Lake; two sisters, Ceil Greenfield of Bayside, Queens, and Ruth Price of Greenville, S.C.; 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
