        Alexis George Pincus, a retired ceramics engineer who had written 18 books on glass manufacturing, died suddenly on Friday while visiting his son in Princeton, N.J. He was 82 years old and had been living in Caracas, Venezuela.
        The cause of death was not immediately known, said his daughter Betty Balcomb.
        Dr. Pincus, who received a doctorate in ceramic engineering at Pennsylvania State University, specialized in developing industrial applications for ceramics, first at American Optical Company in Massachusetts and later at General Electric. He also taught at the Illinois Institute of Technology and at Rutgers University. His books were published after he retired in 1983.
        Dr. Pincus's first two marriages ended in divorce. Besides his daughter, who lives in High Point, N.C., and his son, Richard, he is survived by his third wife, Carmen Cabrera Pincus of Caracas; another daughter, Judy Amster of Portland, Ore.; a sister, Sophie Dutton of Cheshire, Conn.; a brother, Maurice Pincus of La Jolla, Calif.; six grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
