        Dr. Albert E. Manley, who in 23 years as its president guided Spelman College to becoming a highly ranked institution for career-minded women, died on March 28 at his vacation home in Montego Bay, Jamaica. He was 89.
        Dr. Manley had lived in Washington with his wife, Dr. Audrey Forbes Manley, the acting United States Surgeon General.
        He headed the Atlanta liberal arts college from 1953 to 1976 and overcame considerable odds to shape its future. He was the first man and the first black to lead the college, at a time of much student unrest.
        Having had their consciousness raised socially and politically, Spelman's students, virtually all of whom are black, found much to demonstrate for and against: racial equality, women's rights, the Vietnam War. In the aftermath of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the campus seethed.
        It was a time, Dr. Manley said, ''when someone over 25 years old couldn't tell a student anything.''
        But in upgrading the college's academic requirements and faculty, Dr. Manley left an enduring imprint. His administration added five buildings, including a student center named in his honor. Under his tutelage, the college also placed new emphasis on the natural sciences and mathematics. Enrollment rose from 453 students in 1953 to 1,200 in 1976. By then, students measuring up to the college's toughened admission standards came from 38 states and 14 foreign countries.
        Dr. Manley was born in Honduras. He graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C., in 1930. He earned a master's degree from  Columbia University's Teachers College in 1938 and a doctorate from Stanford University in 1946.
        From 1946 until he took charge of Spelman, he was professor of education and the dean of arts and sciences at North Carolina College in Durham.
