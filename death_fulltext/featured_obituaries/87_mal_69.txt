        Paul V. Gardner, an international expert on ceramics and glass who for almost 30 years was the curator of those fields at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Friday. Mr. Gardner, who lived in Washington, was 85.
        He collapsed while attending Good Friday services at the Washington National Cathedral, to which he was a consultant on stained glass. He died at the Georgetown University Hospital.
        In 1948 Mr. Gardner became the Smithsonian's first curator of ceramics and glass, working in the National Collection of Fine Arts. Later he organized and became the curator-in-charge of the Smithsonian's division of ceramics and glass in the Museum of History and Technology. He retired in 1977.
        Mr. Gardner's interest in glass began while he was a student in the school of ceramics at Alfred University. While there, he became an assistant to Frederick Carder, the founder of the Steuben Glass Works in Corning, N.Y., who later was the art director of Corning Glass.
        In January the ceramics school, which is now part of the state university system, opened its Paul Vickers Gardner Glass Center, created to support education in glass art and glass technology.
        After graduation in 1930 with a degree in ceramic art, Mr. Gardner continued with the Steuben company, designing Pyrex ovenware and glass architectural details for the Empire State and the RCA Buildings in Manhattan. He served four years in the Navy as a gunnery instructor.
        Mr. Gardner was the author of many articles about ceramics and glass as well as "The Glass of Frederick Carder" (1971).
        He is survived by a niece, Bernita Howard of Seattle.
