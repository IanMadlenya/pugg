        Arthur Tillman Merritt, a specialist in Renaissance music who was a professor at Harvard University and director of the university's music department for many years, died on Sunday in Bedford, Mass. He was 96.
        Mr. Merritt was an influential scholar whose publications included ''Sixteenth Century Counterpoint'' (1939) and editions of the vocal works of Janequin (1971, with Francois Lesure) and Andrea Gabrieli (1981-84).
        Although illuminating the music of the Renaissance was his principal work, his classes covered everything from harmony and counterpoint to the history of 20th-century music, and throughout his career, involvement with contemporary music was a major part of his work. When he organized a symposium on music criticism at Harvard in 1947, he commissioned new chamber, choral and dance pieces from Copland, Hindemith, Malipiero, Martinu, Piston, Schoenberg and Schuman for the occasion. Mr. Merritt was also the chairman of the Fromm Music Foundation, which supports new music, in 1972 and 1973.
        He was born in 1902 in Calhoun, Mo. He earned degrees at the University of Missouri and Harvard, and from 1927 to 1929 was a student of Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas in Paris. He joined the Harvard music faculty as an assistant in 1929. In 1930 he left Harvard to establish the music program at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., but he returned to Harvard as a music instructor in 1932 and became a full professor in 1943.
        Mr. Merritt was chairman of the music department from 1942 to 1952 and from 1968 to 1972. He established several endowed professorships and raised money to build the Fanny P. Mason Music Building, which opened in 1971. He was also curator of the Isham Memorial Library at Harvard.
        No immediate family members survive.
