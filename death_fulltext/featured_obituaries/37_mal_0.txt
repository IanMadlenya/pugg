        Dr. Alexander Schiff, a longtime physician for the New York State Athletic Commission and president of the Actors' Temple, died Monday at the White Plains Hospital. He was 90 years old.
        From 1926 until the 1960's, Dr. Schiff was a familiar figure in New York boxing circles, conducting pre-fight examinations, presiding at weigh-ins and tending to boxers during and after bouts.
        He gained nationwide recognition with the advent of televised boxing, and the introductions before the Friday night fights from Madison Square Garden made him and his fellow ringside physician, Dr. Vincent Nardiello, household names.
        Dr. Schiff was also a well-known figure on Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, both as a raconteur and for his work at the Actors' Temple on West 47th Street, which he helped organize in the 1920's to serve the area's often-out-of-work cadre of Jewish actors, agents, musicians and vaudevillians.
        He is survived by two brothers, Hyman and Henry.
