        Dr. John A. Collins, a medical educator who led an Army research team in Vietnam that made a significant change in blood transfusion practices for casualties, died on Monday. He was 58 years old and lived in Stanford, Calif.
        He died of a heart attack while playing golf on vacation in County Galway, Ireland, his family said.
        Dr. Collins was a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine, the chairman of its surgery department from 1977-88 and a surgeon at its hospital.
        During the war, he and his colleagues studied shock and blood chemistry in wounded soldiers. Until then, the practice was to administer alkalinizing solution to balance accumulated acidity in stored blood and to reverse acidosis produced by injury.
        But the team's study of 450 patients showed that despite injury, the body on its own neutralizes acid in the blood and protects against acidosis. Further, the research found that administering alkalinizing solution was harmful as well as unnecessary.
        The findings changed medical practice, which eliminated the alkalinizing solution.
        Dr. Collins's work won awards from the Army, the American Association of Blood Banks and the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.
        Dr. Collins was born in the Bronx. He graduated from Fordham University in 1955 and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1959. He was a captain in the Army.
        Surviving are his wife of 32 years, the former Mary Maureen Sheil; four sons, Michael, of San Francisco, Owen,of Mountain View, Calif., John P., of Los Altos Hills, Calif., and Matthew, of University City, Mo.; a brother, Joseph Collins of New York City, and a sister, Margaret Collins of Indianapolis.
