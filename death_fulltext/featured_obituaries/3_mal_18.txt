        Mr. Shellman was best known as a teacher whose enthusiasm for architecture affected many of today's leading architects during their student years, including Robert Venturi, Hugh Hardy and Bartholomew Voorsanger.
        He taught at Princeton from 1941 to 1986, when he retired. Mr. Shellman, a native of Savannah, Ga., was co-author of the volume ''Prospective Drawing,'' wrote many articles in professional journals and designed several homes and gardens in the Princeton area as well as in South Carolina, Georgia and Spain.
        He is survived by his mother, Agnes Shellman, and a brother, Frederick,both of Savannah.
