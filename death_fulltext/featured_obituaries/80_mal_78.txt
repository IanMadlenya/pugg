        Ethan Allen, a major league outfielder who later coached Yale baseball teams whose players included former President George Bush, died Wednesday in Brookings, Ore., where his son, Toby, lives. Mr. Allen was 89 and until recently had lived in retirement in Chapel Hill, N.C.
        Mr. Allen entered the major leagues in 1926 with his hometown team, the Cincinnati Reds. He later played for the New York Giants, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Philadelphia Phillies, the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Browns, compiling a lifetime batting average of .300 for 13 seasons.
        He became the head coach at Yale in 1946, and his 1947 and 1948 teams played in the first National Collegiate Athletic Association baseball championships, losing to Southern California and California in the finals. Mr. Bush was captain of the 1948 team, three of whose players went on to the major leagues.
        "He was a close friend, a very good man," Mr. Bush told The Associated Press.
        Mr. Allen was the Yale coach for 23 years. He later worked as the National League's director of motion pictures. In addition, he filmed an instructional series widely used in schools and colleges. He was also the inventor of a popular board game, All-Star Baseball.
        He is survived by his son.
