        John Outlaw, an actor and musician who had fought AIDS since 1979 and used songs to dramatize issues about the epidemic, died of the disease on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 37 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Outlaw was one of the longest known survivors of AIDS, said Anne Levine Ezer, a friend. He had experienced early-stage symptoms before medical authorities recognized AIDS as a new illness.
        In 1987, Mr. Outlaw organized a rock band, the John Outlaw Project and led it as a singer and guitarist. He wrote songs on AIDS that the group performed in clubs in Manhattan. His song "Down at the Drugstore" was recorded in 1990 and was made into a music video that was shown on MTV.
        As an actor, he appeared in the television soap operas "All My Children," "Another World" and "Guiding Light." He also acted in Off Broadway plays and national commercials for Pepsi, Listerine, Jeep, Almond Joy and other products.
        Mr. Outlaw, whose original family name was Savage, was born in Methuen, Mass. He attended the University of New Hampshire and the Boston Conservatory, then studied acting under Geraldine Page, Shelley Winters and Bill Vespa.
        He is survived by his parents, Norma Clark of Dunedin, Fla., and John Savage of Quincy, Mass., and a sister, Holly O'Brien of St. Paul.
