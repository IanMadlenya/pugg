        Adalbert de Segonzac, a French journalist who was the Washington correspondent of the daily France-Soir from 1956 to 1976, died Dec. 27 at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb. He was 89.
        Mr. de Segonzac, a past president of the Foreign Press Association, was born in Paris. He attended the College of Normandy and started his journalistic career at 20 with the prewar Paris-Soir, which sent him to London as its sports correspondent from 1934 to 1939.
        He served with a French infantry unit in the war and was wounded in action. He escaped through North Africa to Gibraltar and became a fighter pilot in the Royal Air Force.
        Attached to a Free French air unit, he took part in the invasion of Normandy. He was shot down over the Rhine by the Germans and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner.
        He joined the refounded France-Soir after the war and was its London correspondent before taking up his assignment in Washington.
        Mr. de Segonzac's survivors include two sons, Lionel, of Paris, and Jean, of New York; and two daughters, Catherine Shainberg and Laurence de Segonzac of New York. His wife, Madeleine, died last year.
