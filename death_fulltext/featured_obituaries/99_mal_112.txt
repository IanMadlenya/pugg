        John N. McGovern, an innovator in the pulp and paper field and professor emeritus of forestry at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, died on March 21 in a nursing home in Madison. He was 87 and was a longtime resident of the city.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He received his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and received a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the university in 1936.
        He began his career in 1929 at the Department of Agriculture's Forest Products Laboratory in Madison. While there, he helped to perfect a new process by which 90 percent of raw wood could be turned into usable pulp, a development that led to a marked expansion of the industry.
        After World War II, Dr. McGovern helped to rebuild the pulp industry in Western Europe.
        He moved to New York in 1954 as chief process engineer and a vice president of Parsons & Whittemore Enterprises, a holding company for wood industries, to direct modernization projects for the industry in about 40 countries throughout the world. His projects helped to update the methods for handling native wood as well as nonfibrous raw materials.
        Dr. McGovern joined the Madison faculty in 1969 and did research on wood and vegetable fibers and their use in paper, chemicals and energy. He also promoted collaboration between the Forest Products Laboratory and pulp and paper mills throughout Wisconsin.
        Professor McGovern is survived by two daughters, Dr. Jill E. McGovern of Baltimore and Dr. Diane M. Billings of Indianapolis; a son, John F., of Salem, Ore., two sisters, Margaret Van Wagenen and Isabel Kerr, both of Milwaukee, and three grandchildren.
