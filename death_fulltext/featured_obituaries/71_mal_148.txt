        Edward Pessen, an expert on American history, died on Tuesday in Miami. He was 71 years old, and his permanent home was in Brooklyn.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Pessen was a Jacksonian scholar and also specialized in the study of social mobility.
        His latest book, "Losing Our Souls, the American Experience in the Cold War," is scheduled to be published next year. He also wrote and lectured on American popular music between the World Wars.
        Dr. Pessen taught history for 40 years. He was in Florida on a one year-appointment at Florida International University after retiring from the City University of New York Graduate Center and Baruch College, where he was chosen teacher of the year and had served as chairman of the History Department.
        Dr. Pessen's own life was a study in social mobility. He was born in Brooklyn and after high school became a welder and shop steward for the electrical workers' union. During World War II he fought with the United States Army in Europe. After the war he studied on a veteran's loan and graduated from Columbia University. He went on there to earn a master's degree and a doctorate in history.
        Surviving are his wife of 52 years, the former Adele Barlin; two sons, Jonathan, of Albany, and Andrew of Carmel, Calif.; three daughters, Beth Pessen and Abigail P. Wolf, both of Manhattan, and Dinah Altman of Sharon, Mass., and four grandchildren.
