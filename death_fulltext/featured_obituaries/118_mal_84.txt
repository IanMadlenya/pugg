        Mark Trauner, one of the New York metropolitan area's best amateur golfers in the 1980's, died at his home in Boulder, Colo., last Sunday. He was 35.
        The cause was brain cancer, members of his family said.
        Mr. Trauner, born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., earned a degree in economics at Dartmouth College, where he was an honorable mention all-America golfer for four years and served as captain of teams that won the Ivy League championship.
        Competing as an amateur in the New York area after graduation, he established himself as one of the top local performers. In 1985, his best year, he qualified for the United States Open as an amateur and earned amateur player of the year honors from the Metropolitan Golf Association.
        That year, he also qualified for the Maccabiah Games in Israel, where he won an individual silver medal and a team gold.
        Because of his success that year, he left his position as an oil analyst at Chemical Bank to turn professional. He played professionally on the Asian Tour, the Ben Hogan Tour and the Nike Tour. He was the club pro at the Boulder Country Club.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathy, and a daughter, Kimberly.
