        Maj. Gen. Robert N. Ginsburgh, retired, a former staff member of the National Security Council and military aide to President Lyndon B. Johnson, died on Monday at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. He was 68 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        General Ginsburgh was commissioned an Army officer upon graduation from West Point but, after duty in Europe during World War II and in postwar Japan, left the Army in 1951 to join the Air Force, from which he retired in 1975.
        From 1966 to 1969, he served simultaneously as an assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as a member of the National Security Council's staff. For part of that time he was also President Johnson's military aide.
        Among the other posts he held at various times were those of West Point professor and member of the State Department's Policy Planning Council.
        General Ginsburgh, who was born at Fort Sill, Okla., held master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard University.
        His marriage to Nancy Rowland Brand Niekirk of Charlottesville, Va., ended in divorce. Surviving are his second wife, Gail H. Winslow; four sons, Alan F. Winslow of Tateyama, Japan, William C. Winslow of Vienna, Va., Robert B. Ginsburgh of Bethesda and Charles L. Ginsburgh of Glen Echo, Md.; two daughters, Carolyn F. Grant-Suttie of Glen Echo and Anne Neville Ginsburgh of Washington; four grandchildren; his mother, Elsie Pinney Ginsburgh of Washington, and two sisters, Martha Ginsburgh of Washington and Ann Wolf of McLean, Va.
