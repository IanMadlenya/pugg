        Joseph Lawrence Reichler, a member of the sportswriters section of the Baseball Hall of Fame since 1980 and the editor of ''The Baseball Encyclopedia,'' died of cancer yesterday at his home in Roslyn Heights, L.I. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Reichler, who was born Jan. 1, 1915, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, was a sportswriter for The Associated Press from 1943 to 1965, known best for his coverage of major league baseball. In 1966, he joined the office of the commissioner of baseball as director of publicity, and in 1974, he became vice president of the Major League Promotion Corporation. He retired in 1985.
        In 1969, Macmillan published ''The Baseball Encyclopedia,'' a compilation of the statistical records of every player, pitcher and manager in major league baseball since its founding in 1876. The seventh edition of the book, which is generally regarded as the definitive reference work on baseball, was published early this year.
        Mr. Reichler is survived by his wife, Ricky; a son, Paul, of Washington; a sister, Sylvia, of Manhattan, and a brother, John, of New Rochelle, N.Y.
        A service will be held at noon tomorrow at the Jeffers Funeral Home, Hillsdale Avenue and 188th Street, Hollis, Queens. Burial will be in the Sharon Gardens cemetery in Valhalla, N.Y.
