        Frank Huber Partridge, a retired major general in the Army and former assistant commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, died on Tuesday at Mount Vernon Hospital in Alexandria, Va. A former resident of Arlington, he was 100.
        Born in Scranton, Pa., he began his military career in 1917 when he was commissioned as an infantry officer. He attended the University of Pennsylvania  and also graduated from the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
        He served tours of duty in the Philippines and in the United States and a stint as chief of staff at Fort Benning, Ga. At the end of World War II he was assistant commander of the 97th Infantry Division with the rank of brigadier general. The division distinguished itself in combat in the Ruhr Valley just before the German surrender.
        He was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star and the French Croix de Guerre with palm, among other decorations. He retired in 1953 as deputy commander of the Sixth Army, which had its headquarters in San Francisco.
        After retiring, General Partridge worked for the immigration service, first as a consultant and then as an assistant commissioner responsible for the Border Patrol. The appointment came only after heated arguments in Congress, which had  to exempt him from a law generally prohibiting retired military officers from holding such positions.
        Democratic opponents objected to the size of his consultant fee. They then asserted that President Dwight D. Eisenhower was illegally trying to load the Government with military men. And they accused the head of the immigration service, Joseph M. Swing, himself a retired lieutenant general, of surrounding himself with "cronies" in top-level posts. General Partridge retired from the immigration service in 1961.
        He is survived by his wife, Gertrude Drew Partridge.
