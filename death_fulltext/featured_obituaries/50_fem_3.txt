        Enid C. Baird, executive assistant to three presidents of the National Urban League, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte, Fla. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Charlotte and Brooklyn.
        Mrs. Baird died as the result of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mrs. Baird, who joined the League in 1940 as a secretary, was executive assistant to three chief executive officers, Lester B. Granger, Whitney M. Young Jr., and Vernon E. Jordan. She retired in 1978.
        In 1971 she was the second recipient of the League's Ann Tanneyhill Award, and in 1989 was given the League's Whitney M. Young medallion for promoting racial understanding and cooperation in American society.
        She is survived by her husband, Owen Baird of Brooklyn; a son, Buddy Scott also of Brooklyn; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
