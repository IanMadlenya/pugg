        Dominick R. Capello, Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police from 1962 to 1964 and later a private detective, died on Sunday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. He was 80 years old and lived in Hackensack, N.J.
        Mr. Capello served with the state police for 27 years until he gave up the Superintendent's post when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 55. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1970 released tapes of wiretaps of Mafia figures in which they spoke of bribing Mr. Capello. State officials found insufficient evidence to seek an indictment.
        In 1972, as a private detective, Mr. Capello was accused in an indictment of illegal wiretapping on behalf of a factory owner who suspected an employee of leaking trade secrets. The indictment was dismissed a year later by a judge who said it was based on evidence contrived by the State Attorney General's office.
        Mr. Capello, born in New York City, was a graduate of the New York Engineering Institute and worked for the New Jersey Highway Department before joining the state police in 1938. He rose to the rank of colonel before Gov. Richard J. Hughes appointed him Superintendent in October 1962.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Grace Ferrante; a daughter, Diane Kilduff of Silver Spring, Md.; a brother, James, of Hackensack; four sisters, Candita Graziano and Josephine Dwyer, both of Maywood, N.J., Netti Parry of Hackensack and Conchetta Capello of Teaneck, and two grandchildren.
