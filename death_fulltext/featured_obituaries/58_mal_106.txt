        In 1954, he served as the skipper of a research ship on an 11-person scientific expedition to the magnetic North Pole.  He served for a time as president of Sailors Snug Harbor, a trust providing quarters for retired seamen, and as counsel to the American Tramp Steamers Institute.
        In addition to his son, of New Orleans, who is the vice president of the two steamboat companies, he is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Elizabeth Paul; two daughters, Lynn Webster of Lake George and Ruth Lee Dow of Montpelier, Vt., and four grandchildren.
