        The Rev. Cornelius Aloysius Philip Forster, founding dean of the Providence College Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, died on Thursday at St. Joseph Hospital in North Providence, R.I. He was 74 and lived at the Priory of St. Thomas Aquinas in Providence.
        The cause was cancer, the priory said.
        Father Forster founded the graduate school in 1964 and had been dean since then. He was a professor of history and served as chairman of the undergraduate school's history department from 1962 until last year. At his death he was also the archivist of the Dominican Province of St. Joseph.
        A native of Manhattan, Father Forster earned his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at Fordham University. He also held a master's degree in history from Catholic University.
        He was ordained in 1948 and assigned to Providence College in 1949 as a history instructor, advancing to full professor by 1958. A student of 18th- and 19th-century British history, he wrote articles and book reviews for historical and religious publications as well as a book on a British politician in the early 1700's, "The Uncontrolled Chancellor -- Charles Townshend and His American Policy," which was published by the Rhode Island Bicentennial Foundation in 1979.
        Father Forster is survived by two brothers, William A., of Fishkill, N.Y., and Francis X., of Little River, S.C., and his sister, Virginia T. Forster McCaffrey of Blauvelt, N.Y.
