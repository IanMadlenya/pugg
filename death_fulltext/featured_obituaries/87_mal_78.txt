        Morton Dolinsky, who had retired as an official spokesman for the Israeli Government in Jerusalem, died in Israel yesterday. Mr. Dolinsky, who lived in Jerusalem, was 63.
        The cause was the effects of a stroke, said his brother, Hyman Dolinsky.
        Mr. Dolinsky served as the director of the Government Press Office during the 1980's.
        He attended the City University of New York and Yeshiva University.
        He is survived by a wife, Gloria, of Jerusalem; five children, Benjamin, Yael, Joseph, Don Menachem and Zev, all of Israel; his brother of Manhattan; a sister, Shirley Kalb of New Rochelle, and 10 grandchildren.
