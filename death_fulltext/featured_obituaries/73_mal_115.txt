        George Lovi, a writer and instructor on astronomy who was widely known in that field, died on Thursday at St. Peter's Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 53 and lived in Lakewood, N.J.
        The cause of death was cancer of the liver, said his sister, Jane Goldstein.
        At his death, Mr. Lovi (pronounced "LOE-vee") was a columnist for Sky and Telescope magazine and was a course instructor at the Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan.
        He had been writing the column "Ramblings Through the Sky" for 20 years and teaching and lecturing at the planetarium since 1983.
        Mr. Lovi was the author of "Men, Monsters and the Modern Universe" (Willmann-Bell, 1989) and a co-author of another, "Uranometria 2000.0" (Willmann-Bell, 1987), an atlas of the locations of stars, galaxies, nebulae and the like.
        Over the years, he also worked as a cartographer, preparing astronomical maps and maps of other types for various companies.
        Mr. Lovi was born in Debrecen, Hungary, and was brought to the United States as a small boy. He grew up in Brooklyn and studied at Columbia University.
        In addition to his sister, of Manalapan, N.J., he is survived by his mother, Eva Weinreb Lovi, of Lakewood, and a brother, Elliot, of Succasunna, N.J..
