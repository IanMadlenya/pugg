        Mr. Giovanni's agent and friend, Jeannine Edmunds, said death was caused by ''pneumonia with complications.''
        The capstone of Mr. Giovanni's career was his 1978 Broadway play, ''The Crucifer of Blood,'' a Sherlock Holmes drama. He wrote and staged the play, for which he received a Tony Award nomination as best director.
        Mr. Giovanni also directed ''Black Comedy/White Liars,'' by Peter Shaffer, in London and staged Britain's first national tour of ''Amadeus.''
        He played The Boy in the original New York cast of ''The Fantasticks,'' wrote music for theater and films, and wrote mystery plays and a musical.
        Since 1988 Mr. Giovanni taught theater craft and directed productions for the Theater and Speech Department at the University of South Carolina.
        He is survived by his sister, Maria di Giovanni Walters, of Atlantic City, N.J.
