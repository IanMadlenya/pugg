        Mary Bertina Carter Hunter, an arts patron and collector who served on New York City's advisory Art Commission under Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Nov. 23 in Newport News, Va. A former resident of Greenwich Village, she was 92.
        Her death was announced by the Studio Museum in Harlem, of which she was a trustee emeritus.
        Ms. Hunter, who did not use her first name, was a native of Guilford, Md. She was the founding director of the Norsam Gallery in New York, which dealt chiefly with local black artists. She collected art and donated many works to various institutions.
        She joined the board of the Studio Museum in the late 1970's and was elected a trustee emeritus in 2002. In 1974, Mayor Beame named her as an unsalaried lay member of his Art Commission, the first African-American woman to hold such a position.
        Ms. Hunter is survived by a sister, Naomi Gill of Newport News, and two grandchildren.
