        Viktor P. Polyanichko, Russia's top administrative official in a disputed region of the North Caucasus, was assassinated on Aug. 1 while traveling on a wooded road near Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, which is involved in a territorial dispute with neighboring Chechnya. He was in his mid-50's.
        A Moscow television station reported on Wednesday that an investigation had shown that Mr. Polyanichko had died when his convoy was ambushed. Officials have said that at least five guerrilla groups are possible suspects. Angereding Both Parties
        Mr. Polyanichko took up his duties as temporary regional administrator six weeks before his death. By some accounts, he swiftly incurred the wrath of both parties in the ethnic conflict,. the Ossetians and the Ingush.
        The Ingush were deported in large numbers to Central Asia by Stalin and Ossetians then availed themselves of much of the Ingush territory. The groups have blamed each other for the ambush, which also likked a Russian general, Anatoly Koretsky and, by some accounts, an official of the Russian Security Ministry.
        The Russian press has suggested that Mr. Polyanichko's killers might also have been Armenians, Azerbaijanis or Afghans. He was blamed for deporting the populations of entire Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabakh in 1991 while he was a high Communist Party official in Azerbaijan. He was also serving there in 1990, when Soviet troops killed more than 100 protesters.  Earlier, Mr. Polyanichko was an adviser to President Najibullah of Afghanistan while a Soviet occupation force was there.
        Viktor Petrovich Polyanichko was born in Rostov-on-Don in Russia. He was a journalist and served in the Soviet Army before rising in the ranks of the Communist Party.
