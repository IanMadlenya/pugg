        The Rev. Hugh D. Pickett, who oversaw pension plans and other employee benefits for 10,000 Baptist ministers, missionaries and lay workers around the world, died on Saturday in Tampa, Fla., where he was attending a church meeting. He was 60 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, church officials said.
        Mr. Pickett, who was associate executive director for benefit plans for the Ministers and Missionaries Board of the American Baptist Churches, graduated with honors from Denison University in 1953 and from the Yale Divinity School in 1956, the year he was ordained and the year he became the director of campus ministry at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. He joined the ministers and missionaries staff in 1963.
        He received a master's degree in higher education from the University of Michigan in 1961. He was a Carnegie Fellow in 1962.
        He is survived by his wife, Anna Lou, and a sister, Rachel Anne Anderson, of Arlington, Tex.
