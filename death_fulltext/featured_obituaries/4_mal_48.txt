        Robert Doud, who helped organize a ban on motor vehicles on this island between Michigan's peninsulas, died Monday. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Doud, a lifelong resident of Mackinac Island, served 40 years on the City Council and two years as Mayor, a position now held by his daughter, Margaret.
        He and W. Stewart Woodfill, owner of the Grand Hotel, joined forces shortly before World War II to write an ordinance banishing automobiles from the island and limiting transportation to ''horse and human-powered vehicles.''
        ''At that time, we weren't trying to preserve history,'' he said in an interview about 10 years ago. ''We just figured there was no place to park all the cars that would come.''
        Mr. Doud was the owner of the Windemere Hotel, which is celebrating its centennial this year.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Jeannette and a sister.
