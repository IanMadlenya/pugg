        Richard Buckle, an influential British dance critic and dance historian and the organizer of imaginative exhibitions, died on Oct. 12 while being taken by ambulance from his country cottage in Dorset to a hospital in Salisbury. He was 85.
        Mr. Buckle wrote sharp-tongued reviews and several major scholarly biographies, including ''Nijinsky'' (1971), ''Diaghilev'' (1978) and ''George Balanchine: Ballet Master,'' written with John Taras (1988).
        Ballet, the magazine he founded in 1939 and revived in 1946, after it had been suspended during World War II, encouraged new developments in choreography and stage design. It ceased publication in 1952. Mr. Buckle was also dance critic for The Observer (1948-55) and The Sunday Times of London (1959-75).
        He also sought to bring history to life, most prominently in the elaborate multimedia Diaghilev exhibition he organized in both Edinburgh and London in 1954 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Diaghilev's death and a comparable Shakespeare exhibition in Stratford-on-Avon in 1964.
        His many books include ''Adventures of a Ballet Critic'' (1953), ''In Search of Diaghilev'' (1955), ''Modern Ballet Design'' (also 1955), ''Jacob Epstein: Sculptor'' (1963), a volume of selected criticism called ''Buckle at the Ballet'' (1978) and two autobiographies.
        There are no immediate survivors.
