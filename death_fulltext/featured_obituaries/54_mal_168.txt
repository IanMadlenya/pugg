        The Rev. George N. Putnam, a Maryknoll priest who taught at universities in China and Africa, died on Tuesday at St. Paul's Hospital in Hong Kong. He was 82 years old and lived in Wuhan, China, where he had taught English at the Wuhan Institute of Technology since 1987.
        He died of heart failure following a stroke, said a spokesman for the missionary order.
        Father Putnam was born in the Bronx and was a graduate of Georgetown University. He worked on Wall Street for six years before entering the Maryknoll order in 1938. He was ordained in 1944, and after receiving a master's degree in sociology from the University of St. Louis in 1946, he was assigned to China to teach sociology at Lingnam University in Canton.
        He returned to the United States in 1951, and after teaching at the Maryknoll Seminary in Ossining, N.Y., he received a doctorate from Catholic University. He was vice rector of Maryknoll College in Glen Ellyn, Ill., from 1958 to 1964.
        Three years later Father Putnam was assigned to Africa, where he taught at seminaries in Tanzania and Kenya and served as secretary to the bishops of the dioceses of Musoma and Shinyanga in Tanzania.
        There are no immediate survivors.
