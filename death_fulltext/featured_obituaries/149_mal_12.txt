        Crombie Taylor, an architect and teacher who helped spread the influence of the Bauhaus to American architecture during the 1940's, died on May 24. He was 85 and lived in Santa Barbara, Calif.
        Born in Oakmont, Pa., Mr. Taylor was educated at Penn State and Princeton University. In 1944 he joined the Institute of Design, a Chicago school founded by a former Bauhaus instructor, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. The school was a successor to the New Bauhaus, so called because its faculty included prominent refugees from Nazi Germany. After Moholy-Nagy's death in 1946 Mr. Taylor became assistant director to the designer Serge Chermayeff.
        While in Chicago, Mr. Taylor became a passionate enthusiast of the work of Louis Sullivan, a pioneer of modern skyscraper design and the mentor of Frank Lloyd Wright. Mr. Taylor was instrumental in the restoration of interior spaces at Sullivan's Auditorium Building at Roosevelt University in Chicago. The Chicago architect John Vinci, Mr. Taylor's student at the time, said his restoration of the building's banquet hall in 1967 was ''a revelation that introduced a new way of thinking about Sullivan.''
        Mr. Taylor's work included unearthing Sullivan's long-neglected polychromatic stencils for the auditorium's ceilings and walls. Mr. Taylor had recently completed a book on Sullivan's work, written in collaboration with Jeffrey Plank. It is to be published next year by Harry N. Abrams.
        Mr. Taylor's own architectural work was spare, in the manner of Mies van der Rohe, but distinguished by interiors furnished with 18th- and 19th-century antiques. In 1973 Mr. Taylor was elected a fellow of the American Institute of Architects.
        He is survived by his wife, Hope; three children, Victoria Taylor of Los Angeles, Beth Fergon of Monterey, Calif., and John Taylor of Santa Barbara, and two grandchildren.
