        Geraldine Peroni, an Academy Award-nominated film editor known for her work with Robert Altman, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan, said her sister, Pamela O'Grady. She was 51.
        The New York City medical examiner's office ruled the death a suicide, but Ms. Peroni's family is disputing that finding.
        Ms. Peroni was Mr. Altman's favorite editor and worked on eight of his films beginning with ''Vincent & Theo'' in 1990 and continuing through ''The Company'' last year.
        She was nominated for an Oscar for her editing of ''The Player'' in 1992. She also edited Mr. Altman's ''Short Cuts,'' ''Prêt-à-Porter,'' ''Kansas City,'' ''Gingerbread Man'' and ''Dr. T and the Women.''
        Over the years Mr. Altman developed a close working relationship with Ms. Peroni and often praised her work and her judgment as being an essential part of his movie making.
        ''It gets to the point where I could be shooting a scene and a little bird will jump into my ear and say, 'Gerri's not going to like this,''' Mr. Altman said in a recent interview in DGA magazine, a publication of the Directors Guild of America.
        Ms. Peroni was born in Manhattan and raised in Rockaway Beach, Queens.
        She studied film at Hunter College, and her first job in the movies was as an editorial apprentice on the 1983 film ''Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.''
        She was the first assistant editor, under Thelma Schoonmaker, on Martin Scorsese's ''Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988) and received her first credit as editor on ''Iron & Silk'' (1990).
        She also edited ''Johnny Suede'' and ''The Safety of Objects,'' among other films.
        Besides her sister, of Belle Harbor, N.Y., she is survived by a brother, Peter, of Ormond Beach, Fla.
