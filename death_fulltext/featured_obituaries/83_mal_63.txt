        Dr. Francis A. Gagliardi of Jamaica, Queens, the former director of psychiatry at Baptist Medical Center in Brooklyn, died Tuesday at Mary Immaculate Hospital in Jamaica. He was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Alessandra Gagliardi, a daughter.
        A pioneer in the use of electroconvulsive therapy for the treatment of depression, Dr. Gagliardi served as the director of the psychiatry department at the Baptist Medical Center from 1978 to 1987.
        He was a graduate of Columbia University and New York Medical College and served as a major in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Vilma Gagliardi of Jamaica; four daughters, Sherril Senan, Suzanne Mobberley and Dr. Lisa Gagliardi, all of Pittsburgh, and Alessandra of Jamaica; one son, Dr. Francis S. Gagliardi of Garden City, and seven grandchildren.
