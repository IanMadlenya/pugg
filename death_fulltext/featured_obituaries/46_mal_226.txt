        Robert Hearin, a millionaire businessman whose wife was kidnapped from their home two years ago and was never found, died of a heart attack at Mississippi Baptist Medical Center on Wednesday after collapsing at his office. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Hearin was a major stockholder in Trustmark National Bank and chief executive and co-owner of Mississippi Valley Gas. His worth was estimated at more than $200 million.
        On July 26, 1988, his wife, Annie Laurie Hearin, 72, was abducted from her home after a bridge party. A ransom note asked that $1 million be sent to 12 people who, the note said, had been wronged by Mr. Hearin in a business deal. The money was mailed.
        Nineteen months later, in February 1990, a lawyer, Newton Alfred Winn, was sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to kidnap Mrs. Hearin. He was one of the 12 for whom compensation was demanded in the note.
        Mr. Hearin had been prominent for years in banking, oil and gas development, insurance and other businesses. He was formerly a part-owner of the New York Jets football team.
        Survivors include a son, Robert Jr. of New Orleans, and a daugher, Laurie McRee of Jackson.
