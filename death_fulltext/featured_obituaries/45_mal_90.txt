        He died of a heart attack, said his son, John, of Manhattan.
        A graduate of City College of New York, Mr. Gottfried was with several retail stores in New York and Chicago before joining Virginia Dare Stores in 1956 as executive vice president. He was part of a team of merchandisers that formed Atlantic Thrift Centers, one of the first discount department store chains in the United States.
        He helped negotiate Atlantic Thrift's merger with Spartan Industries and left in 1969 to form Gottfried Associates, a firm specializing in investment banking, mergers and acquisitions. He retired in 1980 but served on the boards of Purcells Stores and Nancy Scott Stores and was a consultant to the Bedford-Stuyvesant Urban Development Corporation.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Ruthe; a daughter, Phyllis Walt of Boston; a brother, George, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and two grandchildren.
