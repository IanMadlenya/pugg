        Jack R. Aron, an importer of coffee and a dealer in precious metals in Manhattan for 50 years, died yesterday in the Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans. Mr. Aron, who lived in New Orleans and Kings Point, L.I., was 86.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his son Peter A. Aron.
        Born in New Orleans, Mr. Aron moved to New York in 1915, graduated from Yale University in 1928 and joined a family concern, J. Aron & Company New York, importers of green coffee and dealers in precious metals.
        His father, Jacob Aron, founded J. Aron & Company New Orleans, in 1898, and the family established J. Aron & Company New York after moving to the city in 1915. The New York company was sold in 1981 to the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs. The Aron family retains an interest in the New Orleans company.
        At his death, Mr. Aron was chairman of Lafayette Enterprises, a private New York investment company, and the president of the J. Aron Charitable Foundation in New York. The foundation awards grants to educational, medical and cultural institutions.
        In the 1970's Mr. Aron also headed the Bark Peking Foundation, which acquired and brought the four-masted sailing ship Peking to the South Street Seaport Museum. Mr. Aron was a major benefactor of the Seaport Museum.
        Mr. Aron, who was a Navy lieutenant commander during World War II, also collected marine paintings and Oriental art. He owned several yachts and for years commuted by boat from Kings Point to Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Merryl; two sons, Robert and Peter A., both of Kings Point; a daughter, Jacqueline Morrison of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
