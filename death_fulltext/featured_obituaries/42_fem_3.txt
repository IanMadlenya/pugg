        Vicki Stein, founder of Victims Assistance Services of Westchester County, a group of professionals formed with state and county money to help victims of domestic violence and other crimes, died on Monday at White Plains Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        A friend, Melinda Bass, said Ms. Stein apparently had died of a heart attack.
        Ms. Stein was a volunteer who founded the victims assistance agency in 1984. She also organized the Coalition for Battered Women in Westchester, an umbrella group for voluntary and governmental agencies that deal with domestic violence.
        She lobbied and organized women's groups to put pressure on public officials to create a domestic violence prosecution unit in the Westchester District Attorney's office. In 1983 she was named Woman of the Year by a coalition of 33 Westchester women's groups.
        Ms. Stein was a founder of the Westchester chapter of the National Organization for Women in the early 1970's and started its divorce committee, which lobbied for legislation leading to the equitable distribution laws of 1980.
        A widow, Ms. Stein is survived by a son, Richard, of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and a daughter, Nancy Tunis of Rye Brook, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
