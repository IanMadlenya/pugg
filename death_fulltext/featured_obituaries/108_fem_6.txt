        Helen Weil Benjamin, a longtime benefactor of the Mount Sinai Medical Center  and the Whitney Museum of American Art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.
        Mrs. Benjamin was a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital from 1954 to 1979. A volunteer for the Mount Sinai Hospital Auxiliary Board from 1927 to 1991, she served as president for five of those years and was a founder of the hospital gift shop. She also established the Mrs. Robert M. Benjamin Educational Fund to  provide summer fellowships in gerontological social work.
        She and her husband, a corporate lawyer, developed an interest in contemporary art that led to her involvement with the Whitney Museum. She served as a member of its Painting and Sculpture Committee from 1978 to 1989.
        She was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Vassar College in 1925.
        Mrs. Benjamin is survived by a daughter, Mary B. Arnstein of Hamden, Conn.; two sons, Robert M. Jr., of Manhattan and Stephen, of Santa Fe, N.M., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
