He was 77 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J., before moving to Fort Pierce four years ago.
        Mr. Wollstadt, a native of Rockford, Ill., worked as a reporter and editor at The Rockford Register-Republic until 1945, when he became managing editor of The National Petroleum News and Platt's Oilgram. In 1951, he joined the public relations staff of Mobil Oil.
        He became a vice president in 1959 and senior vice president for personnel in 1962. His experience in personnel affairs brought him to Washington in 1969 as deputy assistant defense secretary, helping the Pentagon plan for the ''all volunteer'' army.
        In 1971, he joined the American Petroleum Institute, which moved from New York to Washington that year. He became vice president for policy development in 1974 and continued as a consultant after retiring two years later.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Peters Pieplow; three sons, Roger, of Arlington, Va., David, of Old Town, Me., and Loyd, of Rockford; a stepson, Jeff Pieplow of Columbia, Md.; a stepdaughter, Judy Shepard of Sag Harbor, L.I., and eight grandchildren. His first wife, the former Elzada Elizabeth Rogers, died in 1974.
