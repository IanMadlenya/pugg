        Kenneth L. Dawson, a leader and adviser of gay and lesbian and AIDS organizations, died on Thursday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan.
        He was 45 years old and lived in Brooklyn. He died of complications from AIDS, said Jed Mattes, a friend.
        Mr. Dawson was on the founding board of the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center in Manhattan in 1983. The center sponsors cultural, social and educational programs and provides offices and meeting space for numerous organizations for gay men and women.
        From 1981 to 1987 he was the executive director of Senior Action in a Gay Environment, an organization for elderly homosexuals.
        Starting in 1985 he also organized a series of national conferences for gay and lesbian leaders and advocates for AIDS services to share information and develop strategy.
        Mr. Dawson was born in East Rockaway, L.I. He graduated from Wesleyan University in 1968 and earned a master's degree in teaching from Antioch University in 1972 and also graduated from Columbia University's Institute for Not-for-Profit Management.
        Earlier in his career, he was the director of the Calhoun Lower School in Manhattan and of the East Harlem Block Elementary School.
        In recent years he was a partner and chief operating officer of Strub-Dawson, a direct-mail, fund-raising firm. He was also a consultant to nonprofit organizations and an adjunct teacher at the New School for Social Research's graduate school of management and urban policy.
        His companion was Todd Hunter.
        Mr. Dawson is survived by his mother, Marjorie Ruth Dawson of Epsom, N.H.; a brother, Steve of Brentwood, N.H., and a sister, Catherine Woodward of Dover, N.H.
