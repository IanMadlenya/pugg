        Mark Alan Isaacson, an expert on 20th-century decorative arts, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 38.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Gregory Nacozy.
        He was a founding partner of Fifty 50, a store specializing in moderne furnishings by such pioneers as Charles Eames, Florence Knoll and George Nelson. The small shop opened in 1981 in SoHo. Two years later he and two partners, Mark McDonald and Ralph Cutler, who has since died, expanded to a larger store at 793 Broadway, which will now close. How He Began
        With a collector's eye, Mr. Isaacson accumulated furniture, glass, ceramics and jewelry from the 1930's, 40's and 50's. He specialized in Italian glass, particularly by the firm Venini. He was called on frequently for advice and was also a source for acquisitions by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
        Mr. Isaacson began his career in decorative arts in the late 1970's in Paris, where he was struggling to support himself as a painter. At Fifty 50, Mr. Isaacson not only chose exceptional decorative objects but also created a vibrant contemporary ambiance for them.
        His talent for visual context took away the taint of kitsch that had clung to the decorative art of the 1950's and helped Mr. Isaacson attract some of New York's most prominent artists as clients, including Robert Mapplethorpe, David Salle, Francesco Clemente, Jasper Johns and David Byrne. Throughout the 1980's, his store was also notable for its friendly social atmosphere and many people came by just to admire Mr. Isaacson's exotic arrangements of flowers.
        In addition to Mr. Nacozy, he is survived by his parents, June and Marvin Isaacson of Glen Cove, L.I., and two brothers, Steven, of Gloucester, N.J., and Glenn, of Manhattan.
