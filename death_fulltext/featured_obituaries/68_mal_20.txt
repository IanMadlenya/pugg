        Peter Bernard Sheridan, a mathematical logician and I.B.M. researcher in computer sciences for the last 40 years, died Aug. 25 at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 66 years old and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.
        He died of pancreatic cancer after a brief illness, said Peggy Frye, a family friend.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Sheridan received electronics training on United States Navy vessels during World War II, in a program for gifted high-school students. He graduated from City College, took a master's degree in mathematical logic at Fordham University and in 1952 began to work at the International Business Machines Corporation's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
        He became engaged in an early Russian translation program and, between 1954 and 1957, belonged to a small team of researchers who developed an I.B.M. programming language. Known as Fortran for Formula Translating System, it remains in use today. Mr. Sheridan worked on its compiler and grammar sections. Compilers are the programs that translate high-level programming languages into machine-language instructions.
        Mr. Sheridan then worked for I.B.M. in France and Switzerland for several years before returning to the research center in Westchester.
        Mr. Sheridan is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Roscoe.
