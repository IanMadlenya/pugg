        Andre Racz, who taught painting and sculpture at Columbia University for three decades and who was known for his drawings and etchings, died on Sept. 29 at the Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. He was 77 and had homes in Demarest, N.J., and Vinalhaven, Me.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Andres, of Santiago, Chile.
        Mr. Racz exhibited his work in the United States, Europe and South America, and his paintings and sculptures were represented in major museums in New York City, Washington, Paris and Salzburg, Austria. His drawings and prints were used for illustrations in several volumes of fiction and poetry, including an edition of "Poemas de las Madres," by Gabriela Mistral, the Chilean poet and winner of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Literature.
        He taught at Columbia from 1951 to 1983, when he retired as a professor of painting and sculpture.
        He was born in Cluj, Romania, and graduated from the University of Bucharest in 1935. He came to the United States in 1939.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, Simone and Constanza, both of Santiago, and four grandchildren.
