        Yvonne Brown, the wife of Lee P. Brown, the former New York City Police Commissioner, died yesterday in Houston. She was 55.
        The New York City Police Department issued a statement saying that Mrs. Brown had died of cancer.
        Mr. Brown, who had been Police Commissioner since 1990, resigned unexpectedly last August, saying he wanted to spend more time with his wife, who was seriously ill. The Browns had been married for 34 years.
        Mr. Brown was succeeded by Raymond W. Kelly.
        Mrs. Brown is survived by her husband, four children: the Rev. Patrick Brown, Torri Clark, Jenna, and Robyn, and three grandchildren.
