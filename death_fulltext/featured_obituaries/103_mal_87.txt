        George Bekefi, a teacher and researcher known for his contributions to plasma physics, particularly in the field of extremely high-power microwave generators, died last Thursday at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 70.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Dr. Bekefi retired this summer and became professor emeritus of physics, having spent 38 years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1976, he and a staff researcher, Dr. Thaddeus Orzechowski, developed a source of radiation producing bursts of microwaves about 50 times as strong as the largest microwave generators then in use.
        More recently, he worked to develop free-electron lasers as power sources in high-frequency bands. Such lasers have wide applications in communications, bulk chemical processing and fusion experiments, as well as cutting, drilling and welding.
        He received seven patents, wrote more than 180 scientific papers and was the co-author of three books. One written with A. H. Barrett, was "Electromagnetic Vibrations, Waves and Radiation" (M.I.T. Press, 1978), an undergraduate text that remains in print.
        Born in Prague, Dr. Bekefi left Czechoslovakia in 1939 and spent the war years in London. He graduated from University College in London and earned advanced degrees at McGill University, where he was on the staff until he joined the Plasma Physics Group at the M.I.T. Laboratory of Electronics in 1957.
        Dr. Bekefi is survived by his wife, Chaia, a son, Ariel, and a daughter, Tamara Bekefi, all of Brookline.
