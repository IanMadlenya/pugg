        John Magee, a leading practitioner and popularizer of technical analysis of stock prices, died of heart failure last Monday at Mercy Hospital in Springfield, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Springfield.
        After graduating from the Pomfret Academy in Connecticut and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mr. Magee began a career in advertising. He was later told by his father that he would inherit some money and that he should learn about stocks.
        Studying the market became his life's work. In 1942, he joined with Robert D. Edwards to refine research into the method of stock investment known as the Dow Theory.
        In 1948, the two men published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends,'' which summarized their findings. Five editions of the book have been printed, and it has been translated into German and Japanese.
        Mr. Magee wrote two other books, ''The General Semantics of Wall Street'' and ''Wall Street, Main Street & You.''
        Mr. Magee is survived by his wife, Elinor; two sons, John 4th, of Westfield, Mass., and Alderson, of Sharon, Conn.; two daughters, Louise Hansen of Berkeley, Calif., and Abbigail, of Cambridge, Mass., and three grandchildren.
