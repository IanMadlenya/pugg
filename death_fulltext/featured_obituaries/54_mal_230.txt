        Louis Rossetto Sr., a former vice president of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company who helped develop the photographic typesetting process that revolutionized newspaper printing, died on Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. He was 78 years old and lived in Kings Point, L.I.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his son Louis Jr. said.
        Mr. Rossetto, a 1936 graduate of the Columbia University School of Engineering, worked on jet engines at the Westinghouse Corporation. During World War II he oversaw weapons systems production at various military sites, including early work on the first American rockets at the White Sands Proving Grounds in New Mexico.
        In 1948 he joined Mergenthaler, and in 1956 he helped develop Linofilm typesetting, one of the production systems that transformed typesetting from hot lead to photographic film. He was named vice president in 1958, and in 1965 he left to join the Harris Intertype Corporation. He retired in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, Marguerite; two sons, Louis Jr., of San Francisco and Amsterdam, and Philip, of Great Neck, L.I., and a daughter, Annamaria Rossetto of Roslyn.
