        Michael J. Parman, who became editor and then publisher of The Press Democrat, died Saturday at his home in Santa Rosa. He was 61.
        His death followed a 15-month battle with pancreatic cancer, the paper said. He posted an Internet journal about his fight with the disease.
        Mr. Parman, formerly an editor at The Sacramento Bee, became executive editor of The Press Democrat in 1985, shortly after the newspaper was acquired by The New York Times Company. He became publisher in 1991 and retired last December because of his health.
        Under his stewardship the newspaper won many awards, including a 1997 Pulitzer Prize for spot news photography and a Polk Award for a series in 2004 that investigated the flight of jobs from Sonoma County to foreign countries.
        Mr. Parman also became a community leader, promoting volunteerism, economic development, the arts and historic preservation in the newspaper's coverage area.
        Mr. Parman was born March 8, 1945, in Reno, Nev., the only child of May Parman. He did not know his father. His mother died when he was 14, putting him under the joint guardianship of a bachelor uncle, who was a rancher at one end of Nevada, and an aunt, who taught school at the other end of the state.
        Mr. Parman earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Reno. He served as a second lieutenant in the Army in Vietnam, winning a Bronze Star.
        He had journalism jobs in Chicago before returning to the West Coast in 1973. At The Sacramento Bee, he rose from copy editor to managing editor.
        In 1967, Mr. Parman married Michaele McCulloch, known as Dee Dee. She survives him, along with a daughter, Leah Clark of Kenmore, Wash.; a son, Chris, of Santa Rosa; and two granddaughters.
