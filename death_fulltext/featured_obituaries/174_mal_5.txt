        Kenneth Schuyler Lynn, an author, editor and educator best known for his writings on American thought and his analytical studies of Mark Twain, Charlie Chaplin and Ernest Hemingway, died June 24 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 78 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, his family said.
        Dr. Lynn was the former Lovejoy professor of history at Johns Hopkins University, where he taught from 1969 until he was given emeritus status in 1989. He previously was a professor of English and chairman of an American civilization program at Harvard University.
        His ''Hemingway,'' published in 1987, paid special attention to the fact that when Hemingway was a young boy he was dressed in girls' clothing, leading, in his opinion, to possible sexual confusion in later life. Dianne Johnson, reviewing the book in The New York Times, wrote that ''at the same time that the author gives a rather extreme interpretation of Hemingway's start in life, the concreteness of this biography lends a certain convincing reality others have lacked.''
        ''In the final analysis,'' she added, ''whatever Mr. Lynn means by sexual confusion or sexual duality seems finally not scandalous but, instead, a compliment to Hemingway.''
        A native of Cleveland, Dr. Lynn graduated from Harvard in 1947. He received his Ph.D. there in the history of American civilization in 1954, when he joined the Harvard faculty as an instructor.
        Dr. Lynn is survived by his wife of 53 years, Valerie Roemer Lynn; a son, Andrew S., of Manhattan; two daughters, Betsy, of Manhattan and Sophia, of Washington; a sister, Marcey L. Krum of Ohio; and three grandchildren.
