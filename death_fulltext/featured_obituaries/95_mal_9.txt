        Spencer J. Drayton, a former F.B.I. agent who founded the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau in 1946 and ran it for 33 years, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Stuart, Fla., near his home in Tequesta. He was 84.
        His family said the cause was congestive heart failure.
        A graduate of George Washington University, Mr. Drayton spent 13 years with the F.B.I., leading 13 field offices and serving as an administrative assistant to the director, J. Edgar Hoover, before resigning in 1946.
        Within months, he was back in law enforcement, this time in thoroughbred racing. "Racing was a mess in those days," Mr. Drayton's son, Spencer Jr., said yesterday, noting that the practice of switching horses and bribing jockeys had become so widespread that the Thoroughbred Racing Association decided to form a security agency.
        The association first approached Mr. Hoover, but he declined and recommended Mr. Drayton. Within a year, Mr. Drayton had initiated a number of measures, among them the identification of horses by lip tattoos.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Ella; another son, Alan, and two grandchildren.
