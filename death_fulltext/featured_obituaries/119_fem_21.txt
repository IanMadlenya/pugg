        Zoya Leporska, a dancer and choreographer and a founder of Dancers Over 40, died on Dec. 16 at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        She died after a short illness, said Barbara Meiste, a friend.
        Ms. Leporska was born in Siberia and raised in China. She began her dance training in Seattle. Her teachers included George Balanchine, Adolph Bolm and Charles Weidman.
        She performed with the San Francisco Opera Ballet and the Eugene Loring Players, but she was best known as a dancer and choreographer on Broadway. She was Bob Fosse's assistant on ''The Pajama Game,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''New Girl in Town,'' and was the dance captain for seven Broadway shows.
        Ms. Leporska also worked with Hal Prince, Shirley MacLaine and Gwen Verdon on revues and helped set dance sequences for productions by Frank Corsaro at the New York City Opera, where she appeared as Mrs. Winemiller in ''Summer and Smoke.'' Ms. Leporska's ''Looking for Talent'' was performed by Dancers Over 40 in September at Dance Theater Workshop.
        She is survived by a brother, Walter Leporsky of Santa Rosa, Calif.
