        Thomas B. Shearman, a newspaper publisher who crusaded against gambling in the 1950's, died after a long illness Monday at his home here. He was 94 years old.
        As a result of his crusade against gambling in southwestern Louisiana, he and four other journalists at The Lake Charles American Press were indicted in 1951 by a special Calcasieu Parish grand jury on charges that they defamed 16 public officials and 3 admitted gamblers.
        A special judge appointed to hear the case acquitted the journalists. He said every allegation made in articles and editorials asserting that gambling laws were not being enforced was without malice and either true or could reasonably be believed to be true.
        In 1977, Mr. Shearman was cited in the National Better Newspaper Contest for community service for the newspaper's coverage of labor violence, stemming from a union attack on a construction site in which one man was killed and several people were injured. Legislators cited the newspaper's work as a major factor in the state's adopting of a law prohibiting labor contracts requiring union membership as a condition of holding a job.
        Mr. Shearman, who was born in Olympia, Wash., graduated from the University of Wisconsin and entered the newspaper business as an advertising salesman for The Chicago Tribune in 1914.
        He bought the Lake Charles paper in 1943 and acquired The Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record in 1933 and The Hobbs (N.M.) Daily Sun and The Trinidad (Colo.) Chronicle News in 1936.
        Mr. Shearman also was active in the oil and gas business.
        He is survived by four children and a sister. One son, Hugh, manages the Lake Charles and Trinidad papers. A grandson, Bill Shearman, is the publisher at Hobbs.
