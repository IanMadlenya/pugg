        William F. Horvath, a Hungarian immigrant who founded two manufacturing companies, died on Friday at his home in Hampton Bays, L.I.
        He was 76 years old and died of heart and renal failure, his family said.
        Born in Budapest, he came to the United States with his family in 1923. After studying at night school and taking engineering courses at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, he became an apprentice tool and die maker.
        He started his own shop in a loft on Grand Street in Manhattan in 1941. It evolved into Dyna-Empire Inc. and moved to Garden City, L.I., where it now has 200 employees making aircraft engine components. He remained president of Dyna-Empire until his death.
        He is survived by two daughters, Valerie McCarthy of Old Brookville, L.I., and Marilyn Jean Lyons of Hampton Bays, L.I., and three grandchildren.
