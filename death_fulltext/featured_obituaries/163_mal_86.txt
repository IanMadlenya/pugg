        Jack Nitzsche, an Oscar-winning songwriter, keyboardist and arranger who worked with musicians like Phil Spector, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young and Miles Davis, died on Friday in Hollywood. He was 63 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause of death was cardiac arrest brought on by a recurring bronchial infection, said his son, Jack Nitzsche Jr.
        Mr. Nitzsche made a career as a prized collaborator, drawing on idioms as old as the blues and as new as electronic music. He wrote songs with Buffy Sainte-Marie, who was his wife during the 1980's (''Up Where We Belong,'' which won an Academy Award as Best Song in 1982, from ''An Officer and a Gentleman''), and with Sonny Bono (''Needles and Pins,'' a 1964 hit for the Searchers). He played piano with Neil Young and the Rolling Stones; he arranged full orchestras or skeletal, atmospheric handfuls of instruments as film soundtracks or as accompaniments for rock songs.
        Bernard Alfred Nitzsche was born in Chicago in 1937, and grew up on a farm near Newaygo, Mich. He hoped to become a jazz saxophonist and moved to Los Angeles in 1955, but dropped out of music school. Mr. Bono, who was an artists-and-repertory executive at Specialty Records, hired him as a copyist. Mr. Nitzsche then worked for Capitol Records, where he met the singer Gracia Ann May, who became his first wife.
        Mr. Nitzsche became Phil Spector's arranger in 1962, creating the thunderous orchestrations of the Wall of Sound for hits that included the Crystals' ''He's a Rebel,'' ''Da Doo Ron Ron'' and ''Then He Kissed Me''; the Ronettes' ''Be My Baby'' and ''Baby I Love You''; and Ike and Tina Turner's ''River Deep, Mountain High.''
        During the 1960's he was also a session keyboardist and arranger for the Rolling Stones, working on their albums from 1964 to 1974, including ''Let It Bleed'' and ''Sticky Fingers.''  He began a long association with Neil Young when he orchestrated ''Expecting to Fly'' for the Buffalo Springfield in 1967. He played piano on Mr. Young's albums ''Tonight's the Night'' and ''Time Fades Away'' and wrote arrangements for Mr. Young's 1972 album, ''Harvest,'' and his 1992 album, ''Harvest Moon.'' He also worked with Randy Newman, Marianne Faithfull, the Neville Brothers, Jackie DeShannon and the Monkees, among many others.
        Under his own name he recorded  an instrumental hit, ''The Lonely Surfer,'' in 1963, and released an album of orchestral pieces, ''St. Giles Cripplegate,'' in 1973. In the late 1970's, Mr. Nitzsche turned to new wave rock, producing Graham Parker's ''Squeezing Out Sparks'' and albums by Mink DeVille. Most recently, he produced recordings by the Louisiana rocker C. C. Adcock, which remain unreleased.
        But Mr. Nitzsche was most widely recognized for his film scores. His 1975 score for ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was nominated for an Academy Award, as was his score for ''An Officer and a Gentleman'' in 1982, the year ''Up Where We Belong'' won as best song.
        His first film music was for the 1964 rock and soul documentary, ''The T.A.M.I. Show,'' and he went on to write scores for more than 30 films, including ''Performance'' (1970), ''Greaser's Palace'' (1972), ''The Exorcist'' (1972), ''Heart Beat'' (1980), ''Cutter's Way'' (1981), ''Personal Best'' (1982), ''Starman''(1984), ''The Razor's Edge (1984), ''The Jewel of the Nile'' (1985), ''9 1/2 Weeks'' (1986), ''Stand by Me'' (1986), ''Revenge'' (1990) and ''The Crossing Guard'' (1995). His score for ''The Hot Spot,'' a 1990 film by Dennis Hopper, brought together John Lee Hooker, Taj Mahal and Miles Davis.
        Mr. Nitzsche had a persistent drug problem and was known, at times, for volatile behavior. In 1979 he was sentenced to three years of probation for breaking and entering following a domestic dispute with his girlfriend at the time, the actress Carrie Snodgress. In the late 1990's, The Los Angeles Times reported, his arrest was shown on the television series ''Cops'' after he waved a gun at someone who had stolen his hat.
        He is survived by his son.
