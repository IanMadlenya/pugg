        The Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, who presided over one of the nation's most high-profile collegiate athletic programs for more than three decades as a senior official at the University of Notre Dame, died on Sunday at the campus in South Bend, Ind. He was 87.
        His death was announced by Notre Dame.
        Father Joyce was the chief financial officer at Notre Dame from 1952 to 1987, serving as executive vice president. He was also chairman of the Faculty Board on Athletics and the university's building committee.
        During the 1950's, he was an early advocate of college football's seeking maximum opportunities for television coverage. He was a director and secretary-treasurer of the College Football Association, a grouping of dozens of the nation's major football powers created in the late 1970's.
        The Notre Dame football team was ranked No. 1 three times during his tenure. In 1977, the National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame presented him with its Distinguished American award.
        The overall Notre Dame budget went from $9 million during Father Joyce's first year as executive vice president to more than $400 million in 1987, when he retired.
        Father Joyce was born in British Honduras, now Belize. He received a bachelor's degree in accounting from Notre Dame in 1937, then became a certified public accountant. He entered Holy Cross College in Washington in 1945 and was ordained in 1949.
        He is survived by a brother, Lyle.
