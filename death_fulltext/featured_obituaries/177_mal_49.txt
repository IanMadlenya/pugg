        Joseph H. Crown, who was active in the Lawyers Committee on American Policy Towards Vietnam, died on Sept. 28 at his home in Cuernavaca, Mexico. He was in his mid-90's and also had a home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        Mr. Crown, a Manhattan-based lawyer, was secretary of the Lawyers Committee early in 1966, when it claimed 4,100 members across the country, including law professors as well as lawyers, and challenged the legality of the war in Vietnam in a letter to President Johnson.
        The letter was based on a 26-page memorandum of law, drawn up by some of the professors, that contended that Mr. Johnson's actions in Vietnam ''neither conform nor are consonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations.''
        Joseph Harold Crown was born in Brooklyn and held a law degree from Brooklyn Law School.
        Surviving are his wife, Sara Fuentes Crown; two sons, Raul, of Croton-on-Hudson, and Richard F., of Charlotte, N.C.; a daughter, Melissa F. Crown of Bethesda, Md.; and four grandchildren.
