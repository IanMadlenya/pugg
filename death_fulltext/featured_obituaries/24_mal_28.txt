        Nick Virgilio, a poet who specialized in haiku, died Tuesday at George Washington University Medical Center after a heart attack while taping an interview for the CBS television program ''Nightwatch.'' He was 60 years old and lived in Camden, N.J.
        Mr. Virgilio's mastery of haiku, the unrhymed Japanese poetry classically consisting of three lines of five, seven and five syllables, earned him admirers worldwide, among them Crown Prince Akihito of Japan, who translated one of Mr. Virgilio's best-known haiku. It departs from the traditional form.  Lily:  out of the water. . .  out of itself.
        Rod Willmot, a Canadian poet who published Mr. Virgilio's book, ''Selected Haiku,'' praised his work for its earthy, raw quality. Phil O'Connor, senior producer of ''Nightwatch,'' said CBS does not plan to broadcast the interview.
