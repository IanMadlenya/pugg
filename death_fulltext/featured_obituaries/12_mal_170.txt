        Carlos Rangel, an author and journalist and one of Latin America's most articulate conservative intellectuals, has died at age 58.
        Mr. Rangel's family did not provide information about his death, but people close to the family said he committed suicide last Thursday night.
        ''Carlos Rangel's sudden death constitutes an irreparable lose for Venezuela,'' President Jaime Lusinchi said at the burial service Friday. ''He was an exceptional man.''
        Mr. Rangel rejected political arguments blaming the United States and other industrialized countris for the ills of developing nations.
        His first widely distributed book, called ''The Latin Americans'' in its English edition, criticized what he called the tendency to blame the United States for most of the region's problems.
        In ''Third World Ideology,'' Mr. Rangel took issue with those inclined to blame rich nations for lack of development in the third world.
        Since 1968, Mr. Rangel and his wife, Sophia, had been hosts of ''Good Morning,'' a popular television interview program. He taped last Friday's program commemorating 30 years of Venezuelan democracy, returned home Thursday afternoon and was later found dead. He was said to have been suffering from severe depression.
