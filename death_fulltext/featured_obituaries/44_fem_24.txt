        She had suffered a heart attack earlier in the day at her home, said her son, Peter Osnos.
        Mrs. Osnos, who specialized in cancer research, joined Columbia in 1945, shortly after emigrating from Bombay, where she had settled after fleeing her native Poland in 1940. A graduate of Warsaw University and the Sorbonne, she spent 33 years at Columbia and was the author or co-author of 40 research papers published in French, Polish and English.
        From 1978 to 1988, Mrs. Osnos was a nutrition consultant at Cornell Medical School. In 1979 she translated ''Hunger Disease: Studies by Jewish Physicians in the Warsaw Ghetto,'' which was published by John Wiley and Sons.
        Mrs. Osnos was a daughter of Dr. Zygmunt Bychowski, a member of the first Zionist Congress, which was held in Basel, Switzerland, in 1897.
        Besides her son Peter, of Greenwich, Conn., she is survived by her husband, Joseph, of Manhattan; a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
