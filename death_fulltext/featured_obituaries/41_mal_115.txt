        Guy Paulin, the Parisian fashion designer, died on Wednesday at Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris. He was 44 years old. The cause of death was not made public.
        The designer was known for his casual, relaxed style and for his use of soft colors while contemporaries like Jean-Paul Gaultier, Thierry Mugler and Claude Montana offered clothes intended to change the shape of fashion and to shock. The Paulin style was gentle and unpretentious, carrying echoes of American sportswear.
        The high point of his career came in 1984, when he was named designer for Chloe, a producer of expensive ready-to-wear clothing. He replaced Karl Lagerfeld, who went on to design the Chanel couture collection. He stayed there only a year. After he left, Chloe was sold to Dunhill of Britain.
        Buyer and Designer
        Mr. Paulin's first job was assistant buyer for Au Printemps, the French department-store chain, in 1963. It was the beginning of a decade-long expansion of French ready-to-wear apparel, and he soon was in the middle of it when he moved to the manufacturing side of the industry in 1966.
        He joined Dorothee Bis, one of the big names of the time, as an assistant designer. In 1975 he opened a business under his own name, to which he returned after his Chloe contract expired. Faced with financial problems, he closed his company after he showed a collection last fall. His last job was as artistic director of Tiktiner, a French ready-to-wear company.
        In his 25-year fashion career, he worked as stylist or designer for a number of companies, including Paraphernalia in New York, Byblos and Max Mara in Italy, Rodier and Mic-Mac in France. He also designed shoe collections for Diego della Valle in Italy and others.
