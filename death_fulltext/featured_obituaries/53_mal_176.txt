        E. Reeseman Fryer, an assistant commissioner in the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs from 1961 to 1968, died on Wednesday in a hospital in Brunswick, Ga. He was 90 years old and lived on Jekyll Island, Ga.
        Mr. Fryer died of complications from a stroke, said his daughter Sue Fryer Ward.
        As an assistant commissioner, Mr. Fryer supervised the bureau's real-estate, forestry and roads programs.
        He had earlier held important field positions for the bureau and other Federal agencies.
        While he was general superintendent of the 16 million-acre Navajo reservation in Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, he was described in a 1937 article in The New York Times as "grim-jawed, tall and heavy, only 37 years old, holding the toughest assignment in the Indian service."
        He had also worked for Westinghouse and other companies overseas.
        Mr. Fryer was born in Mesa, Ariz., and attended the University of Washington.
        In addition to his daughter, of Clinton, Md., he is survived by his wife, the former Ione Pierce; another daughter, Ann Fryer Van Fossen of Toronto; two brothers; two sisters; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
