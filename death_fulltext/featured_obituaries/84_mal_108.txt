        Howard S. Browne, a New York investment broker and founding partner in the securities firm of Tweedy Browne Company, died on Sunday at his home in Morristown, N.J. He was 89.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of West Orange, N.J., Mr. Browne rose from modest beginnings, helping to support his widowed mother while still in high school. He worked afternoons in Thomas Edison's laboratories, then left school at 17 for a career of more than five decades on Wall Street.
        He started as a runner for E. A. Pierce Company and was made a full partner at 21. The firm was one of the predecessors of Merrill Lynch.
        In 1943, he was one of the founders of Tweedy, Browne & Reilly, now Tweedy Browne Company. He retired from the firm in 1978.
        Mr. Browne is survived by his wife of 60 years, Katherine Hall Browne; four sons, Stephen H. of Morristown, Anthony H. of Los Angeles and William H. of Greenwich, Conn., and Christopher H. of Manhattan, who both are partners in Tweedy Browne, and eight grandchildren.
