        Jeremiah Sullivan, a theater and television actor and a professional astrologer, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 58 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was AIDS, said a friend, Joe Regan.
        Mr. Sullivan received the Clarence Derwent Award in 1970 for his portrayal of a gravedigger in "A Scent of Flowers" at the Martinique Theater. At the Public Theater he was in the original cast of "The House of Blue Leaves" and "The Master and Margarita."
        He made his Broadway debut in the 1957 play "Compulsion," and later performed in the 1979 Broadway musical "The Grand Tour." He was standby for Ian McKellen in the part of Salieri in the original 1980 Broadway production of "Amadeus" and played the part for several performances.
        A graduate of Harvard University, Mr. Sullivan also acted in productions at the Virginia Museum Theater, the Great Lakes Theater Festival, the Buffalo Studio Arena Theater and the Alliance Theater in Atlanta.
        Among Mr. Sullivan's film roles was the part of a President of the United States in the 1982 movie "The Soldier." Mr. Sullivan also played Alexander Hamilton in "The Adams Chronicles" on public television, and had recurring roles in the "Knots Landing," "Guiding Light," "All My Children," "Another World" and "General Hospital" television series.
