        John Vincent Frank, the retired president of a New York travel agency, died on Sunday. He was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Frank died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        A graduate of the Collegiate School and Harvard, Mr. Frank was a first lieutenant in the Army Signal Corps before joining Frank Travel Service after World War II. The family business, established by Mr. Frank's great-grandfather in 1875, ceased operations upon Mr. Frank's retirement earlier this year.
        Mr. Frank is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Joan Carol Heming; their son, Daniel Heming Frank of Hastings-on-Hudson; their daughter, Katherine Page of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
