        Dr. Eric A. Blackall, professor emeritus of German literature at Cornell University, died of cardiopulmonary arrest Thursday at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 75 years old and lived in Ithaca.
        Dr. Blackall, a native of London, received bachelor's and master's degrees from Cambridge and a doctorate from the University of Basel, Switzerland. He taught at Cambridge for two decades before coming to Cornell as a visiting professor in 1957.
        A year later he returned to Cornell, where he became successively chairman of the Department of German Literature, Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities and Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of German Literature, a position established for him in 1967. He retired in 1985.
        While in Europe, Dr. Blackall was instrumental in rescuing the papers of Arthur Schnitzler, the Austrian dramatist, during the Nazi occupation of Vienna in 1938, for which the Government of Austria awarded him the Cross of Honor, First Class, in 1973.
        Dr. Blackall was the author of several books on Schnitzler, Johann Goethe and other writers of German. He was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the American Philsoophical Society.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jean Frantz; a son, Roger, of Ithaca, and two sisters, Molly Bernard and Joan Gleason, who live in England.
