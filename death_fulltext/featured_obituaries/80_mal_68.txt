        Irving Allen Dodes, an innovator in mathematics education in New York City's public schools and colleges, died, apparently of a heart attack, on Sept. 10 near his home in Quincy, Mass. He was 78.
        He had been missing for 13 days and was believed to have been stricken while taking a walk.
        Mr. Dodes was named mathematics coordinator for the New York school system in 1959 after serving for 12 years as chairman of the math department at the Bronx High School of Science. He also served as head of mathematics at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn, where he was dean of the faculty.
        He was the author of a number of widely used math textbooks and an innovator who helped to bring computers into some classrooms as early as the 1960's.
        Graduated from City College, he received his Ph.D. from New York University. He also won a fellowship in physics from the National Science Foundation.
        Mr. Dodes's wife, Dorothy, died in 1992. He is survived by a son, Dr. Lance M. Dodes of Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Pamela Douglas of Los Angeles; a sister, Sylvia Paymer of Coconut Creek, Fla., and three grandchildren.
