        George M. Shapiro, who was counsel to Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and a managing partner at the Proskauer Rose law firm in New York, died Sept. 8 at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Rita.
        A Manhattan native, Mr. Shapiro graduated from Long Island University, then from Columbia Law School in 1942. After service in the Army Air Force in World War II, he became  assistant counsel to Governor Dewey. He was promoted to counsel in 1951, a position he held until the governor's term ended three years later.
        Mr. Shapiro joined Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn (now Proskauer Rose) in 1955, becoming a specialist in international law and rising to become chairman of the firm's corporate department. Among his clients was the French branch of the House of Rothschild.
        In 1966 Mr. Shapiro broke the stalemate in talks between the city and the Port Authority over how much the city would receive in taxes from the proposed World Trade Center, winning widespread praise for brokering the agreement that led to construction of the twin towers.
        Active in a number of philanthropic and public organizations, he was a president of the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation, a trustee of the Caesarea Foundation, a member of the Board of Visitors of Columbia University Law School and the board of trustees of Long Island University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Karen Spector, of Charlotte, N.C., and three step-granddaughters.
