        Joseph Druffel, a prolific architect of low-income housing in New York City for the last 25 years, died on Friday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 60 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications from amyloidosis, a disorder in which protein accumulates in body tissues, said a close friend, Karen Jorgensen.
        Mr. Druffel spent most of his career on projects for poor people. He  worked with a number of organizations in the South Bronx, East Harlem and the West Side of Manhattan, including the Clinton Housing Corporation, Hope Community Inc. and Project Green Hope, helping design, renovate and build shelters, housing and other structures.
        Among his larger projects were the Msgr. Robert Fox Memorial Shelter at 111 East 117th Street, for St. Paul's Roman Catholic Church, and Pueblo En Marcha at 401 East 145th Street in the Bronx, for the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's Urban Homesteading Program.
        Mr. Druffel was born in Dayton, Ohio, on Aug. 21, 1938. He received two bachelor's degrees from the University of Detroit. He worked with several small firms in New York, Dayton and Detroit, and was self-employed since 1978.
        Survivors include his companion, Linda Bresnahan of Manhattan; a brother, Thomas H. Druffel of Western Springs, Ill., and a sister, Mary Hanaghan of Dayton.
