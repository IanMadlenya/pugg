        Albert Delacorte, an editor and teacher who helped guide his family's philanthropy, died yesterday at his home in San Francisco. He was 90.
        The cause was prostate cancer complicated by emphysema, said his daughter Erika Delacorte.
        Mr. Delacorte was a son of George T. Delacorte, who founded Dell Publishing and gave millions to embellish New York City with fountains, statues, theaters and schools bearing his name. He died in 1991.
        The younger Mr. Delacorte administered the trust that gave $4.3 million to Columbia University in 1985 to establish the George Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism and endow a professorship.
        Albert Delacorte was born on Oct. 30, 1913, and graduated from Princeton in 1935. He worked until 1961 at Dell, editing the magazines Modern Screen and Modern Romances and a line of pocket-size books.
        He then earned a master's degree in English from Teachers College at Columbia. He planned to teach high school English, but instead taught English as a second language for many years on the Lower East Side. He worked for Mobilization for Youth, part of the Johnson administration's war on poverty.
        He moved to San Francisco from Manhattan in 1984.
        In addition to his daughter Erika, of San Francisco, he is survived by his wife, Letitia; his son, Peter, of San Francisco; his daughters Fifi Spangler, of York, Pa., and Kate Delacorte, of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
