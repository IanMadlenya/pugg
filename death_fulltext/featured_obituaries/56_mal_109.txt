Under him the group developed a program to train professional lay workers for missionary work and expanded into new areas in Bangladesh, Brazil, Indonesia, Nepal, Samoa, Sudan, Yemen and Zambia.
        He served as an aviation mechanic in the Army Air Corps in the Pacific in World War II.
        He entered the Maryknoll Seminary in 1949 and was ordained in 1957. Father Hill was the regional superior in Chile from 1967 to 1972. Later he worked two years in Katmandu, Nepal, with an organization for disabled children. He received a doctorate in ministry in 1984 from St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore and, in 1985, became superior of the United States region.
