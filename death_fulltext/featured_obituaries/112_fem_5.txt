        Hedwig Adele van Ameringen, a philanthropist who was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic, died on April 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.
        Mrs. van Ameringen, born Hedwig Pfaltz in Newark, first heard the Philharmonic as a child at Carnegie Hall and became the orchestra's friend for life. She had been a member of the board since 1980.
        She gave $5 million in 1991 to establish the Hedwig van Ameringen Guest Artist Endowment Fund, which helped engage scores of the world's leading soloists to play with the Philharmonic.
        Mrs. van Ameringen was also a supporter of Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic's home since it left Carnegie Hall. Another of her principal beneficiaries was Fountain House, which helps people with mental illness find housing, schooling and the way back to productive lives.
        In 1919, she married Arnold Louis van Ameringen, a founder and later chairman of what has grown into a billion-dollar company, International Flavors and Fragrances, based in Manhattan. Her husband, who died in 1966, formed the van Ameringen Foundation in 1950 to support programs in mental health. At her death, Mrs. van Ameringen was the foundation's honorary chairwoman.
        She is survived by two daughters, Lily Auchincloss of Manhattan and Patricia  Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa.; a son, Henry P., of Manhattan; 6 grandchildren,  and 15 great-grandchildren.
