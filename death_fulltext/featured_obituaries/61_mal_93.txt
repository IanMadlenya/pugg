        Gilbert Chase, a musicologist, critic and the author of important studies of American and Spanish music, died on Saturday at North Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill. He was 85 years old and had lived in Chapel Hill since his retirement from teaching in 1979.
        He died of pneumonia, said his wife, Kathleen van Barentzen Chase.
        Mr. Chase was born in Havana, where his father was a naval officer, on Sept. 4, 1906. He studied music history at Columbia University and the University of North Carolina. In 1927 he moved to Paris, where he worked as a music critic for the European edition of The London Daily Mail and as a correspondent for Musical America and Music and Letters.
        During his years in Europe, he pursued an early interest in Spanish music, and on his return to the United States he wrote his first book, "The Music of Spain" (1941), still a central text on the subject. His studies of Spanish music led him to investigate Latin American music, and he published his "Bibliography of Latin American Folk Music" (1942) while working as the Latin American specialist in the music division of the Library of Congress.
        Mr. Chase served as a cultural attache in Lima, Peru (1950-53), Buenos Aires (1953-55) and Brussels (1960-63).  Books and Reviews
        In 1955, he published his most frequently cited work, "America's Music From the Pilgrims to the Present." The work was the first to treat the music of Charles Ives and Carl Ruggles as important additions to the 20th-century repertory, and the first to deal with American popular and art music as being equally significant. His other books include "Music in Radio Broadcasting" (1946) and "The Composer Speaks: A Historical Anthology 1770-1965" (1967). He also contributed book reviews and reports on Latin-American music to The New York Times from the late 1930's to the mid-1950's.
        He was the director of the Tulane School of Music in New Orleans from 1955 to 1960. He was also a professor of music at the University of Oklahoma, in Norman, where he founded the Inter-American Institute for Musical Research, and a visiting professor at the University of Texas, in Austin.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons: Paul, of San Raphael, Calif.; Peter, of Columbia, S.C., and John, of Chapel Hill.
