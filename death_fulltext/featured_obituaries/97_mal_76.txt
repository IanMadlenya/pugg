        Bob Randall, the author of the Broadway comedy "6 Rms Riv Vu" and the head writer and co-producer of the television series "Kate and Allie," died yesterday at his home in New Milford, Conn. He was 57.
        The cause was AIDS, said Gary Pratt, his companion.
        Mr. Randall, whose original name was Stanley B. Goldstein, was born in the Bronx. He attended the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, earned a bachelor's degree from New York University, and acted with a Gilbert and Sullivan troupe for four years before becoming a copy writer and associate creative director at the Marschalk advertising agency. He had worked there for 10 years when "6 Rms Riv Vu," about two strangers locked in a Riverside Drive apartment, opened on Broadway in 1972. Clive Barnes, in his review in The New York Times, called the play "as cheerful as a rising souffle," and the Drama Desk named Mr. Randall the most promising playwright of the year.
        Mr. Randall adapted the play for a television special in 1974 that starred Alan Alda and Carol Burnett. In 1974, his musical "The Magic Show," written for the magician Doug Henning, opened at the Cort Theater.
        Mr. Randall also wrote three suspense novels: "The Fan" (1977), a mystery that was made into a film starring Lauren Bacall; "The Next" (1981), and "The Calling" (1981).
        In addition to his work on "Kate and Allie," from 1984 to 1988, he wrote for the CBS series "On Our Own" (1977) and the television movie "David's Mother" (1994), which he adapted from his 1991 play of the same name. "Goodbye, Lou," a television drama he wrote for CBS, is scheduled to go into production this spring. He also wrote the screenplay for "Zorro: The Gay Blade" (1981).
        In addition to Mr. Pratt, he is survived by a son, Edward, and a daughter, Julia, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Mathilda Stollman of Royal Palm Beach, Fla.
