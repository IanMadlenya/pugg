        Oliver William Wolters, a professor of Southeast Asian history at Cornell University who did pioneering work on the ancient Malay kingdom of Srivijaya, died on Dec. 5 in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 85.
        Professor Wolters, who retired in 1984 after holding for 10 years the Goldwin Smith chair for Southeast Asian history, came late to academic life after spending 20 years, from 1937 to 1957, working in the Malayan civil service.
        His most important academic work related to the history of Srivijaya, the maritime and commercial kingdom that flourished from the 7th to the 13th centuries in the Malay Archipelago, centered on Palembang on the island of Sumatra.
        After lecturing at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London from 1957 to 1963, he moved to Cornell the next year, publishing ''Early Indonesian Studies and the Origins of Srivijaya'' in 1967. In 1970 his ''Fall of Srivijaya in Malay History'' appeared.
        A recipient of the Distinguished Scholarship Award of the Association of Asian Studies in 1990, he was chairman of the department of Asian studies at Cornell from 1970 to 1972.
        Born in Reading, England, on June 8, 1915, he graduated from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1937 before joining the Malay Civil Service. He married the former Euteen Khoo in 1955. She survives him, along with their daughter, Pamela Gwyneth Gillespie of Cortland, N.Y., and a son, Nigel Christopher, of Seattle.
