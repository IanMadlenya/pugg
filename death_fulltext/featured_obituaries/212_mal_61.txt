        Tsai Wan-lin, a financier and the wealthiest man in Taiwan, died on Monday in Taipei, his family told Agence France-Presse. His age was variously reported as 79, 80 and 81.
        The cause was a liver ailment, news agencies reported.
        Mr. Tsai was founder of the Lin-Yuan Group, which includes Cathay Financial Holdings, one of the largest financial services firms in Taiwan. Mr. Tsai's son, Hong-tu, currently manages the holding company, parent of the Cathay Life Insurance Company and several banking and construction concerns.
        Mr. Tsai was ranked 94th this year on Forbes magazine's list of the 100 richest people in the world, with a fortune estimated at $4.6 billion.
        Born in 1924 to a family of poor tenant farmers, Mr. Tsai started out peddling fruit and selling soy sauce with his two brothers, Wan-chun and Wan-tsai. They eventually created a business empire comprising about 70 enterprises, in varied industries like banking, plastics and commercial real estate. After the family split the conglomerate in 1979, Mr. Tsai formed the Lin-Yuan Group with his share of holdings.
        Survivors include his brother Wan-tsai and four children.
