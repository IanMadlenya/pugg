        Edward Schaumberg Quade, who helped develop the problem-solving method of systems analysis, died after suffering a stroke, a Rand Corporation spokesman said. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Quade, who had cancer of the spine, died Saturday at Saddleback Hospital after suffering the stroke a week earlier, Paul Weeks, a spokesman for Rand, a research organization based in Santa Monica, said Monday.
        Mr. Quade, of Jacksonville, Fla., who was a consultant to Rand at the time of his death, joined the research group when it was founded in 1948 and retired in 1973.
        He and some colleagues devised and developed systems analysis as a recognized scientific discipline, Mr. Weeks said.
        Mr. Quade's book published in 1968, ''Systems Analysis and Policy Planning: Applications in Defense,'' defined systems analysis as ''a systematic approach to helping a decision-maker choose a course of action by investigating his full problem, searching out objectives and alternatives, and comparing them in the light of their consequences.''
        Mr. Quade studied physics and mathematics at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and earned his doctorate at Brown University. After serving in tyhe Navy in World War 2, he returned to the University of Florida, where he headed the math department until joining Rand.
        Survivors include his wife, Sylvia, of Laguna Hills, and three children.
