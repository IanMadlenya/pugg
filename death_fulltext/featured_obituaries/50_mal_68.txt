        Jack Warren, a retired deputy police chief in Birmingham whose arrest of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 led to Dr. King's "Letter From Birmingham Jail," died Tuesday of complications of a heart attack. He was 73 years old.
        Despite his role in the arrest, the white officer was considered a friend by many blacks in the city. In 1982 he was awarded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Martin Luther King Jr. Award.
        Chief Warren was a police captain in 1963 when he relayed orders from Public Safety Commissioner Eugene (Bull) Conner for the police to use fire hoses and attack dogs against civil rights marchers. Later, Captain Warren arrested Dr. King and took him to the Birmingham jail, where Dr. King wrote the letter that reinvigorated the civil rights movement.
        "We always knew that Chief Warren found those things distasteful, even as he was giving the orders," said the Rev. Abraham Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Council.
