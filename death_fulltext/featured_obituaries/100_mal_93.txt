        John S. Pingel Jr., a senior executive who led the international snack food business of Pepsico Inc., died on Wednesday in his home in Dallas. He was 53.
        The cause was degenerative heart disease, the company said.
        After joining Pepsico in 1971, Mr. Pingel held senior management positions in the company's domestic and international beverage businesses. He worked on such successes as the Pepsi Challenge campaign and the marketing of Mountain Dew, the company's fastest-growing brand.
        In 1983, he was named president and chief executive of Pepsico Foods International and helped that unit expand to a $2 billion business in more than 24 countries.
        Mr. Pingel is survived by his wife, Darya, and three children: Spencer, of New York; Heidi, of San Francisco, and Rob, of Dallas.
