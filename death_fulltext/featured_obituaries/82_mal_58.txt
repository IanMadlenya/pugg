        Sam Davidman, a retired Catskills hotelier, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 71 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Poland, Mr. Davidman arrived in the United States in 1927 and became a certified public accountant and real-estate broker, practicing in Queens. In the 1960's, he and his family operated Henry's restaurant in Queens, named after his father.
        In 1981 he bought The Homowack in Spring Glen, N.Y., and converted it to glatt kosher. It is now called Davidman's Homowack. Failing health made him leave its management to his son Paul in 1988.
        A co-founder of Young Israel of Forest Hills in 1951, he twice served as its president since then.
        Besides his son Paul, a resident of Wesley Hills, N.Y., Mr. Davidman is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; another son, Mark, of Woodmere, L.I.; a daughter, Lynn Davidman of Boston, and eight grandchildren.
