        Alfred Charles Buck, developer of the folding Buck Hunting Knife, died of cancer Sunday at his home. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Buck learned to make hunting knives from his father, Hoyt Heath Buck, and together they began a business behind their San Diego home in 1948.
        Buck Knives Inc. has since become one of the world's leading manufacturers of knives, employing about 400 people in El Cajon and doing about $40 million a year in business.
        The company's first knives were sold by mail order, but after 1961 marketing was done through dealers.
        Mr. Buck retired as chairman in 1979. His son, Charles T. Buck, now heads the company.
        Mr. Buck is also survived by his wife, Ida, a daughter, Janie Holt, two brothers and three sisters.
