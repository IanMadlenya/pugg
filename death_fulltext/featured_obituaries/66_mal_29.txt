        Stephen Elliot, who started making commercials when television was in its infancy, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        His family said he died after a long fight with cancer.
        Mr. Elliot, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from St. John's University. During World War II, he served as an Army instructor in aerial photography, and was demobilized with the rank of lieutenant. He then rejoined his brother, Michael, at the studio they had started just before the war as photographers for New York department stores and advertising agencies.
        Convinced of television's potential as an advertising medium, the brothers teamed up with William Unger in the late 1940's to form Elliot, Unger & Elliot. It was one of the earliest commercial-production companies for the television industry.
        It was bought by Columbia Pictures in 1959 and eventually merged into EUE/Screen Gems, a Columbia division. Mr. Elliot remained as a director-cameraman and head of the division. He retired as its president in 1987.
        Mr. Elliot is survived by his third wife, the former Hilary Weiner; four sons, Stephen B., David, Edward and Gideon, all of Manhattan; a daughter, Anne Elliot of Woodstock, N.Y.; his brother, Michael, of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
