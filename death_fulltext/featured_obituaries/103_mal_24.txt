        Carl B. Rubin, a Federal district judge in Cincinnati who helped to settle lawsuits over a fire that killed 165 people and an anti-nausea drug that was suspected of causing birth defects, died on Wednesday at the University of Cincinnati Hospital. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, hospital officials said.
        Judge Rubin, who was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon in 1971 to serve on the bench for the Southern District of Ohio, presided over suits from the 1977 fire at the Beverly Hills Supper Club in Southgate, Ky., and litigation involving accusations that the drug Bendectin caused birth defects in the fetuses of pregnant women who took it.
        In 1979, Judge Rubin and another judge approved a settlement in which a power company and an insurer agreed to pay nearly $6.7 million to about 250 plaintiffs in the suit over the supper club fire. In 1984, he helped to work out a settlement in which Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals agreed to set up a $120 million fund for plaintiffs in the Bendectin case, without conceding that the drug was unsafe.
        In 1993, he ruled that the City of Cincinnati could not prohibit the Ku Klux Klan from erecting a cross on a public square downtown.
        Surviving are his wife, Gloria; three sons, Robert and Marc, both of Cincinnati, and Barry, of Lafayette, Ind.; a daughter, Pam Rubin, of Chicago, and nine grandchildren.
