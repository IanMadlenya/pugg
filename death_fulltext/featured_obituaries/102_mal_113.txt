        Mihail Horia Botez, Romania's Ambassador to Washington, its representative at the United Nations and an internationally known mathematician and futurist, died on July 11 at a hospital in Bucharest, the embassy confirmed this week. He was 54.
        The cause was internal hemorrhaging, the embassy said.
        He came to this country in 1988 as a political exile from the Communist Government of Nicolae Ceausescu, and held academic positions at Stanford University, Indiana University and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.
        In 1993, three years after Mr. Ceausescu was overthrown and executed in a violent revolution, the new Government in Bucharest named Mr. Botez its envoy to the United States and the United Nations.
        A native of Bucharest, he held a doctorate in mathematics from the Romanian Academy of Science. Before his exile, Dr. Botez worked at institutes of the University of Bucharest and a local United Nations demographic center.
        His survivors include his wife, Magda, and a daughter.
