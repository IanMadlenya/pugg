        Eugene Vale, author of the best-selling 1959 novel ''The 13th Apostle,'' and of ''The Technique of Screen Play Writing,'' a 1944 textbook that remained in print for more than four decades, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 81.
        Born in Switzerland, Mr. Vale worked in Paris with the director Jean Renoir in the 30's. At the outbreak of World War II, he came to the United States and began to write professionally in English.
        He wrote numerous screenplays, including ''The Second Face'' (1950), ''Francis of Assisi'' (1961) and ''A Global Affair'' (1964). In 1956 ''The Dark Wave,'' a short documentary that he had written, was nominated for an Academy Award.
        His work with Renoir and in Hollywood led him to write his well-regarded textbook on screenwriting, and he was a frequent lecturer on film and television writing at the University of Southern California and other universities.
        ''Devils Galore,'' a play by Mr. Vale, was produced on Broadway in 1945. He was also a frequent contributor to early television, writing for the ''Four Star Playhouse,'' the ''20th Century Fox Hour,'' ''Schlitz Playhouse'' and other shows.
        He gained his greatest fame, however, with ''The 13th Apostle,'' his first novel. The allegorical work traces the adventures of a consular official in a Central American country who searches for an artist's missing masterpiece.
        A reviewer in The New York Times said Mr. Vale was ''the only contemporary novelist of recent years, to my knowledge, who has made so ambitious an attempt to encompass in a single fabric every clue to modern man's devious retreat from engagement.''
        His second novel, ''Chaos Below Heaven'' (1966), was also a best seller.
        Mr. Vale is survived by a son, Ronald, of San Francisco; a sister, Tony Weissman of Los Angeles; two brothers, Joe Weissman of Los Angeles and George Weissman of Berkeley, Calif., and two grandchildren.
