        William Dawes Miller, a retired metals company executive and past president of the Metropolitan Club in Manhattan, died on Friday at his winter home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 74 and also had homes in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        He graduated cum laude from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1942. He was later involved with the production of fissionable uranium in the Manhattan Project in World War II. A citation from Gen. Leslie R. Groves, head of the project, commended him for "outstanding service in connection with the development of the atomic bomb."
        After the war, he worked for a number of metals companies, retiring in 1979 as a senior vice president of Anaconda Company, a leading producer of nonferrous metals and uranium. Anaconda merged into the Atlantic Richfield Company.
        Mr. Miller was a direct descendant of William Dawes, a Revolutionary War leader who in 1775 went with Paul Revere on the midnight ride to alert the minutemen that the British were coming. He also was related to William Gates Dawes, United States Vice President under Calvin Coolidge and author of the 1924 "Dawes Plan," which scheduled German reparations after World War I.
        He was the 20th president of the Metropolitan Club, serving from 1985 to 1990.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife, the former Anne Johnson, whom he married in 1972. Also surviving are his daughter, Elizabeth Brint of Manhattan, and his brother, Arnold, of Spokane, Wash. His first wife, the former Celeste Fain, died in 1970.
