        Henry J. Knott Sr., a leading Maryland developer who shared his wealth with many medical, educational and cultural institutions, died on Sunday in Baltimore at Johns Hopkins Hospital, one of his beneficiaries. He was 89 and lived in Baltimore.
        Mr. Knott started working in his father's construction business in the 1920's. He became a brick contractor and made his fortune as a no-nonsense businessman whose various enterprises built thousands of homes, offices and shopping centers in the Baltimore area.
        He gave away an estimated $140 million over the years, much of it to Roman Catholic institutions. The long roster of recipients included Loyola College, his alma mater; the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra; the Baltimore diocesan hospitals, to which he donated money for treating the poor; the University of Notre Dame; parochial schools, and the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.
        Mr. Knott is survived by his wife of 67 years, Marion Burk Knott; 12 children, Lindsay K. Harris, Francis X., Henry J. Jr., James F., Martin G., Rose Marie K. Porter, Margaret K. Riehl, Mary Stuart K. Rodgers, Patricia K. Smyth, Alice K. Voelkel and Catherine K. Wies, all of Baltimore, and Marion K. McIntyre of Delray Beach, Fla.; three brothers, the Rev. Francis K. Knott, John L. Knott  and Joseph M. Knott, all of Baltimore; 51 grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren.
