        Msgr. Henry J. Lenahan, a former principal of Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, died on Wednesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 85 years old and lived in Point Lookout, L.I.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Monsignor Lenahan studied for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers and at the North American College in Rome. He was ordained a priest in Rome in 1931 and after a year of graduate studies, was named associate pastor at Holy Rosary Church in Manhattan.
        From 1934 to 1948, he was a professor at Cathedral College, the minor seminary of the Archdiocese of New York, and was then named procurator at Cardinal Hayes High School. He served as principal from 1952 to 1954 and returned to Cathedral College as rector for five years. From 1959 to 1966 he was pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Manhattan and then was pastor of Sacred Heart Church in the Highbridge section of the Bronx until he retired in 1981.
        He is survived by two sisters, Anna L. Gallagher and Rita E. Lenahan, both of Point Lookout, and a brother, Bernard, of Freeport, L.I.
