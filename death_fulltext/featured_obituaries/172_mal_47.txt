        Jonathan Bixby, a costume designer in theater and television, died on April 29 at the Cabrini Hospice in New York City. He was 41.
        The cause was colon cancer, said Steven Padla, a spokesman for the Drama Dept., a theater company of which Mr. Bixby was a founding member.
        A Pennsylvania native, Mr. Bixby came to New York to study costume design and soon found work in a variety of productions, including a job as the costume designer for the soap opera ''All My Children,'' for which he was awarded an Emmy in 1990 with Carol Lunken, his co-designer.
        His work was also seen at several major regional theaters, including the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles and McCarter Theater in Princeton.
        In New York, Mr. Bixby was probably best known for his association with the Drama Dept., an Off Broadway company that he helped establish and that had a series of critical and popular hits in the late 1990's. His credits there included productions of ''June Moon,'' ''The Torch Bearers'' and ''As Bees in Honey Drown.''
        His last design work was on ''Urinetown,'' a musical that opened May 6 at the American Theater of Actors in Manhattan.
        Mr. Bixby is survived by his companion, Bryan Bantry; his mother, Shirley Stilwell Bixby of Brooksville, Fla.; a sister, Deborah Bixby Hall of Clinton, Conn.; and a brother, Mark, of Philadelphia.
