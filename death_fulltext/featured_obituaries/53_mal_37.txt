        Thomas A. Hannan, an actor and singer who was a founder of Community Research Initiative and of the People With AIDS health group, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said his companion, Carl Goodman.
        Mr. Hannan was active in Community Research Initiative's sponsorship of research into drugs to treat AIDS and in the effort of People With AIDS to obtain drugs lacking Federal approval for victims of the disease.
        He was born in Weehawken, N.J., graduated from Harvard University and attended Fordham Law School. He acted in musical comedies and children's theater in New York and elsewhere and sang with opera companies in Germany and Austria.
        He is survived by his parents, Marian and Raymond, and a brother, Timothy, all of Brigantine, N.J.
        Correction:  June 7, 1991, Friday
        An obituary yesterday about a singer and actor who became a leader in organizations of patients with AIDS rendered his name incorrectly in some copies. He was Thomas A. Hannan.
