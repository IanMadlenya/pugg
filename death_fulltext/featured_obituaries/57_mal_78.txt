        Nestor J. MacDonald, a retired electrical industry executive, died Thursday at Sloop Memorial Hospital in Crossnore, N.C. He was 95 years old and lived in Linville, N.C., and Short Hills, N.J.
        The cause of death was not disclosed, but his family said he had had heart disease and other ailments.
        During World War II, Mr. MacDonald helped mobilize industry as president of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association and a member of the War Production Board.
        For 60 years he worked for the Thomas & Betts Corporation, an electrical and electronics company in Bridgewater, N.J. Eventually he served as its chief executive and board chairman. He retired in 1983.
        His start was a company legend. As a supplier salesman, he sold a large order to Betts but canceled it when he discovered that the parts were substandard. Impressed by his honesty, Betts hired him.
        Born in Scotland, Mr. MacDonald came to New York City with his parents. He interrupted his studies at Columbia to join Canada's Royal Flying Corps as a fighter pilot in World War I. He was shot down defending London.
        Mr. MacDonald served on the boards of many nonprofit civic, educational and Scottish groups. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire from Queen Elizabeth II. An avid golfer, he was a board member at several clubs and sponsored caddy scholarships.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Elizabeth Johnson, and two daughters, Glenna Ackerman of Short Hills and Sheila Bailey of Memphis.
