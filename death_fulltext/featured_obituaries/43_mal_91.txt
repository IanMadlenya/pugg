        Wendell G. Randolph, a chemical engineer who played an important role in developing gas masks for the United States Army in World War I and who later headed a family concern that produced industrial paints, died on Monday at his home in Saddle River, N.J. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Randolph also developed the putty used as a seal in rocket boosters for the space shuttle. He started his company, Randolph Products, in 1932 in an unheated hangar at Teterboro Airport, making aircraft varnishes. Three years later the company moved its laboratories and manufacturing centers to Carlstadt.
        He was born in Manhattan, enlisted in the Army while in college and was assigned to the chemical-warfare branch. A major chemical used in the canisters of gas masks is named for him. After the war he received bachelor's and master's degrees in chemical engineering from Columbia.
        Mr. Randolph was an avid airplane pilot. Randolph Products, of which he was chairman until his death, developed the finish used on the fabric skin of the Piper Cub airplane and several other aerospace paint products.
        He is survived by a son, John, of Saddle River; a daughter, Joanna, also of Saddle River, and three grandchlidren.
