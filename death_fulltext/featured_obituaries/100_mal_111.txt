        George William Cottrell Jr., the founding editor of the Harvard Library Bulletin who was a former research associate in ornithology at Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, died last Thursday at the Riverwoods retirement community in Exeter, N.H. He was 91 and formerly lived in Cambridge, Mass., and Hillsboro, N.H.
        From 1931 to 1941 he was the executive secretary of the Medieval Academy of America, a group of scholars who studied the Middle Ages, and edited its quarterly, Speculum. With America's entry into World War II the Office of Strategic Services recruited him as chief of biographical records in its Division of Research and Analysis.
        Mr. Cottrell returned to Cambridge in 1943 and was an assistant to William A. Jackson, the first librarian of the newly established Houghton Library for rare books and manuscripts. He also helped to create the Harvard Library Bulletin and was its first editor from 1945 to 1960.
        Having taken up the study of birds, he volunteered for the Museum of Comparative Zoology, where he continued to work until 1988. He was an editor of James Lee Peters's monumental "Checklist of Birds of the World," whose 16 volumes took from 1931 to 1987 to compile. He was also a director of the Massachusetts Audubon Society.
        A native of Detroit, he graduated from Harvard College in 1926.
        Mr. Cottrell is survived by his wife of 66 years, Annette Brinckerhoff Cottrell; a daughter, Annette Merle-Smith of Princeton, N.J., and a granddaughter.
