        Ozan Marsh, a pianist and teacher who specialized in the music of Liszt, died on Sunday morning at Phoenix General Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Tucson, Ariz.
        He died of pneumonia, said his son, Richard, of Tempe, Ariz.
        Mr. Marsh was born in Pasadena, Calif., and studied at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau, France, in the late 1930's. He later studied privately with Sergei Rachmaninoff, Vladimir Horowitz and Emil Sauer, who had been a student of Liszt. He made his New York debut in 1939.
        Mr. Marsh toured widely and made numerous recordings. He also taught at the Manhattan School of Music, Indiana University and the University of Arizona. In 1977 he established the Pianists Foundation of America, a Tucson-based organization that assists young pianists.
        He is survived by his son.
