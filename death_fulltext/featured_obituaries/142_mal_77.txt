        Albert Conde Bickford, a retired Manhattan antitrust lawyer who represented Paramount Pictures during the filmmaker's divestiture of its chain of movie houses, died last Wednesday at his home in Ardsley-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 96.
        Born on Staten Island, he graduated from Harvard College and, in 1927, from Harvard Law School. He then joined the international law firm of Simpson Thatcher & Bartlett, where he retired from active practice as a senior partner in 1976.
        Settlement of the Paramount case 50 years ago brought about significant changes in the ways Hollywood studios made and distributed their motion pictures. Besides Paramount, he represented such major concerns as General Electric and MCA, the Music Corporation of America, in antitrust cases brought by the Federal Government.
        In the 1930's he was counsel for Amtorg Trading Company, the Soviet agency that bought food and other supplies in the United States. He ended that legal representation when the Soviet-German nonaggression pact was signed in Moscow in 1939.
        Mr. Bickford is survived by two sons, Robert C., of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Nathaniel L., of Manhattan, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
