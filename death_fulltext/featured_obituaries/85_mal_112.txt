        Dr. Lewis Patton, a Coleridge scholar and retired professor of English at Duke University, died on Thursday at the Forest at Duke, a retirement center in Durham, N.C. He was 91 and lived in Durham.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Dr. Robert G. Patton.
        Dr. Patton devoted his entire teach ing career to Duke, serving as a faculty member from 1926 until 1972. He specialized in 18th- and 19th-century literature and edited several volumes devoted to writers of the period, particularly the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
        In addition to his son, who lives in San Francisco, he is survived by his wife, Frances, of Durham; two daughters, Susannah Patton of Bethesda, Md., and Mary Bogdonoff of Rye, N.Y., and a sister, Lenoir Almand of DeLand, Fla.
