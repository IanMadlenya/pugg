        Richard Lapidus, head of the physics department at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., died of a heart attack Sunday morning while running in a 2.5-mile road race in Ridgewood, N.J. He was 53 years old and lived in Teaneck, N.J.
        Dr. Lapidus, an active sportsman involved in skiing and scuba diving, was an experienced runner. His wife, Prof. Leah Blumberg Lapidus of Teachers College at Columbia University, said her husband had no history of heart problems and had been in apparently excellent health.
        Dr. Lapidus joined the Stevens faculty in 1963 as an assistant professor, became a full professor in 1980 and was named head of the physics department last year.
        A native of Brooklyn, he received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago and a doctorate from Columbia. He was a former president of the Forum on Physics and Society of the American Physical Society and was president of the Stevens chapter of the American Association of University Professors.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Dr. George and May Lapidus of Brooklyn; a sister, Ellen, of Israel; two daughters, Jessie, of Teaneck and Leonora, of Boston; a son, Kyle, of Teaneck, and a granddaughter.
