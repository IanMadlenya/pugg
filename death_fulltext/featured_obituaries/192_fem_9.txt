        Eleanore Pettersen, a New Jersey architect who helped lead the way for women in her profession, died on Wednesday at her home in Saddle River, N.J. She was 86.
        In 1950, Ms. Pettersen, who had worked as an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright, became one of the first women to be licensed as architects in New Jersey.
        What was probably her best-known work -- a 15-room house, swimming pool and illuminated tennis court on a four-acre plot in Saddle River -- became the post-White House home of Richard M. Nixon. She had designed it in 1971 for John Alford, a New Jersey businessman, who sold it to Nixon in 1981.
        Working from a converted barn in Saddle River, Ms. Pettersen designed buildings as varied as a luxury town house, a church, a convent school, offices and a nursing home.
        Ms. Pettersen was born in Passaic, N.J. She began attending Cooper Union during the Depression, working days and attending classes at night until she graduated in 1941. She worked as a draftsman, then became an apprentice to Wright in Arizona and Wisconsin. From 1946 to 1950 she worked for the Tennessee Valley Authority, designing power service buildings and visitors' facilities.
        In 1984 she became the president of the New Jersey Society of Architects.
        Her two firms, Eleanore Pettersen, A.I.A., an architectural firm, and Design Collaborative, an interior design concern, operated out of the barn.
