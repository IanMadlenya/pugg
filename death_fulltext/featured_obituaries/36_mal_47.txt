        Carmen Hill, a former National League pitcher who compiled a 49-33 record in 10 major league seasons over 16 years, died on Monday in Indianapolis. He was 94 years old.
        Hill, who published a 36-page booklet of reminiscences, ''The Battles of Bunker Hill,'' in 1983, broke in with Pittsburgh in 1915, played with the New York Giants in 1922, returned to the Pirates in 1926 and finished with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1930.
        His best season was in 1927 when he won 22 games for the Pirates and made his only World Series appearance, against the New York Yankees. Starting the fourth and final game, Hill pitched six innings and gave up nine hits, including one that was immortalized on a 1983 commemorative stamp. It depicts Babe Ruth in his most famous guise, at the end of the swing that sent Hill's slow curve over the right-field fence.
