        William Kochiyama, a founder of the Asian Community Center and an advocate of reparations for American citizens of Japanese descent who were interned in World War II, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center of heart failure. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kochiyama, who was born in Washington, was interned himself until he joined the all-Japanese 442d Regimental Combat Team, which fought with distinction in Europe and became the most decorated unit in United States military history.
        After earning a journalism degree at Long Island University, Mr. Kochiyama became a public relations officer at the Japan International Christian University Foundation, the advertising firm of Tamblyn & Brown and the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
        At the same time, he was heavily involved in civil rights activity and campaigns against racial discrimination.
        He is survived by his wife, Yuri; three sons, Eddie, of Manhattan, and Jimmy and Tommy, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Audee Holman, of Oakland, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
