        The family did not give the cause of death.
        Dr. Guerisse was an army physician when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940, and he fled to Gibraltar after the Belgian Army's surrender. He joined a British Navy special operations unit and, using the name Patrick O'Leary, participated in secret missions in the Mediterranean.
        Captured by the Germans, he escaped and returned to Belgium, where he led an underground network through which hundreds of Allied airmen, shot down over the continent, returned to England.
        In 1943, he was arrested for a second time by the Gestapo and was held in several Nazi camps, including Dachau, where he was tortured and sentenced to death. The end of the war prevented his execution.
        In 1946, King George VI presented him with Britain's highest civilian award, the George Cross, for his underground activities during the war.
        After the war, Dr. Guerisse joined the Belgian Army's medical corps. He volunteered for service in a Belgian battalion during the Korean War.
        Later, he was appointed to run the Belgian Army medical corps, retiring in 1970.
