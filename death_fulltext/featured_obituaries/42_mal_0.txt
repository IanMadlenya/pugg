        Edward A. Spitz, founder of Guest Informant, a directory of tourist information distributed in 1,400 hotels across the country, died June 23 at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 88 years old and lived in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
        His son, Harold, said Mr. Spitz had died after a heart attack.
        In 1937, working as a deliverer of laundry to Los Angeles hotels, Mr. Spitz noticed that guests had no guide to local services.
        He started Guest Informant as a four-page brochure, and it grew into a slick hard-cover volume of more than 300 pages, published annually.
        In addition to his son, who lives in San Francisco, Mr. Spitz is survived by a daughter, Elaine Oliver of Los Angeles; a sister, Rose Borowsky of Boston; a brother, Joe, of Los Angeles; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchilldren.
