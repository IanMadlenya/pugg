        Edward G. Greer, a retired theater director and drama professor, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Greer lived in Manhattan. He retired from Syracuse University in 1991 after 17 years there. Earlier, in New York City, he taught and directed at the New School for Social Research, Actors Studio, American Theater Wing and Equity Library Theater.
        For Equity Library he directed T. S. Eliot's "Murder in the Cathedral" with Rod Steiger and Lee Marvin in 1946 and Christopher Marlowe's "Dr. Faustus" with Barbara Barrie, Pernell Roberts and Michael Higgins in 1951.
        At the New School he directed Sam Jaffe in "The Tempest" and Maureen Stapleton in "Elektra." He also directed the New York premiere of J. B. Priestley's "Music at Night" and the American premiere of Samuel Beckett's "After the Fall."
        He was a devotee of English theater, starting as a Fulbright fellow in London in 1950. He worked with the Old Vic in London, at Stratford-on-Avon and with repertory companies in Liverpool and Birmingham, and also in Ireland and Europe.
        Mr. Greer was born in Cambridge, Mass. After graduating from Harvard, he studied drama at Yale. He was an assistant curator in the dance and theater department of the Museum of Modern Art and a leader in the National Theater Conference's Tryout Studio for aspiring young actors.
        He is survived by a sister, Marilyn Abrams of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
