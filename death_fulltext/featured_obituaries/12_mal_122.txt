        Mr. French, a reclusive man who shunned publicity, had his last one-man show in New York at the Banfer Gallery in 1968. His work, done in the medium of egg tempera, presents painstakingly rendered figures in dreamlike tableaux. It has been categorized - along with that of such artists as George Tooker and Paul Cadmus - by the terms magic realism and symbolic realism. His paintings are in the collections of several major American institutions, among them the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Baltimore Museum of Art and the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.
        Born in Ossining, N.Y., on Feb. 4, 1905, Mr. French graduated from Amherst College and studied painting at the Art Students League. During the Depression he worked on several Works Progress Administration projects, producing murals for the Parcel Post Building in Richmond, Va., and the post office in Plymouth, Pa., among other sites. In those years, too, he showed regularly at the Biennial exhibitions mounted by the Whitney Museum. Later, his work appeared in the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition ''Americans, 1943: Realists and Magic Realists.'' In 1967, he received a grant from the National Institute of Arts and Letters.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret Hoening French, and a sister, Mrs. Edward Bloete Sr., of Sea Girt, N.J.
