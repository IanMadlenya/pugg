        Alexander S. Gross, a retired makeup editor at The New York Times and a former assistant news editor at The New York Herald Tribune, died on Tuesday at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. He was 76 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        He died of respiratory failure, said his nephew, Michael Parsont.
        Aside from four years in the Army in World War II, in which he rose to captain commanding an antiaircraft company, Mr. Gross spent his entire working career in newspapers. He was at The Herald Tribune from 1931 to 1962, when he joined The Times. He retired in 1984.
        Mr. Gross was a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from the City College of New York and did graduate work in international relations at Columbia University.
        Besides his nephew, he is survived by a sister, Edna Parsont of Forest Hills.
