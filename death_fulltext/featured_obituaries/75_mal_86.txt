        Reuben Hecht, an Israeli industrialist and confidant of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, died Wednesday in Carmel Hospital in Haifa. He was 83.
        He died after a heart attack, said Benjamin Robert Payn, a friend in New York.
        Dr. Hecht, who lived in Haifa, held the title of ambassador at large. He was a principal aide to Prime Minister Begin at the Camp David peace talks and attended other meetings between the Prime Minister and Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Anwar el-Sadat and Margaret Thatcher.
        He founded the Hecht Museum at Haifa University, to which he donated his collections of Mideast archeological artifacts and 19th-century paintings. A Family in Shipping
        At the time of his death he was the chairman of Dagon Batey-Mamguroth Le-Israel Ltd., which ran grain-storage silos in Haifa and Ashdod. He started up the company after Israeli independence, drawing on a family background in shipping and storage and persuading the Government to grant him an exclusive concession to build the silos.
        Dr. Hecht was born in Antwerp, Belgium, into a family that developed the Rhenania Rhine shipping and storage group, based in Basel, Switzerland, into one of the world's largest privately owned river-navigation companies. He was educated at the universities of Munich, Berlin and Heidelberg, where he received a doctorate in economics.
        The writings of Theodor Herzl, founder of the Zionist movement, and the oratory of Vladimir Jabotinsky, the militant leader, drew him to Israel, where he lived from 1936 to 1939. He joined the paramilitary Irgun and established a lifetime relationship with its commander, Mr. Begin. He returned to Israel in 1948.
        Dr. Hecht is survived by his wife, the former Editz Zilzer, and a brother, Ariel Bin-Nun, of Jerusalem.
