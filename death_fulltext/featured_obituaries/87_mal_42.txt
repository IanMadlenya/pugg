        Roy Smeck, a leading guitarist, banjoist and ukulele player since the days of vaudeville, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 94 and lived in Manhattan.
        He died in his sleep, said Neal Hade, a friend.
        Mr. Smeck's career spanned 75 years, during which he performed for several American Presidents and at the coronation of King George VI of England in 1937. He collaborated with many well-known musicians, including Irving Berlin and W. C. Handy in live performances and on more than 500 recordings.
        Mr. Smeck went into vaudeville after appearing in the short film "Pastimes," which featured musicians performing and was the opening for "Don Juan," the first sound motion picture made by Warner Brothers, in 1926.
        He became more widely known when he began giving music lessons during his show on WOR radio in New York. An avid teacher, he wrote 50 books on how to play stringed instruments. Among his guitar students was Gene Autry.
        A 1982 documentary about his life, entitled "Wizard of the Strings," was nominated for an Academy Award.
        As a tribute to him, several instrument manufacturers, including the Gibson Guitar Corporation and the Bacon and Day Banjo Company, produced instruments bearing the Roy Smeck logo, and on April 1 Gibson reissued the 1934 Roy Smeck Radio Grande guitar as a limited edition.
        He is survived by his wife, Fay; his son John, of Smithsburg, Md., and two grandsons.
