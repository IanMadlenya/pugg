        William Malcolm Goodhart, whose first effort at play writing became a Broadway hit, died on Oct. 20 at his home on Shelter Island, N.Y. He was 74. The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. Goodhart achieved the dream of every aspiring playwright when his comedy, ''Generation,'' opened on Broadway in 1965 and quickly found an audience. The show, directed by Gene Saks, starred Henry Fonda as a parent coping with his determinedly unconventional daughter and son-in-law, who decide to deliver their own baby.
        Despite some lukewarm reviews, ''Generation'' settled in for a long run and was adapted for the screen by Mr. Goodhart in 1969. In the film, David Janssen played the role originated by Mr. Fonda.
        Born in New Haven in 1925, Mr. Goodhart was a physics major at Yale University before enlisting in the Army in 1943. After the war he returned to Yale to study at the drama school and began his career as a scenic artist and lighting designer. After the success of ''Generation,'' Mr. Goodhart became a writer and producer for Warner Brothers. His screen credits include ''The Heretic,'' which was a sequel to ''The Exorcist,'' and ''Cloud Dancer.''
        He is survived by his wife, Joanne; three daughters, Eliza Goodhart Denoeux, Amy Goodhart Redburn and Sarah Celeste Goodhart, and four grandchildren.
