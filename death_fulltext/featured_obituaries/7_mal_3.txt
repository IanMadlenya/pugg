        J. Francis Hayden, a Manhattan attorney who served as a special assistant to the Attorney General in the Truman Administration, died Saturday at White Plains Hospital after a brief illness. He was 80 years old and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        Mr. Hayden, a specialist in antitrust laws, retired 12 years ago as a senior partner in what then was the law firm of Stickles Hayden Kennedy Hort & Van Steenburgh. He was a native of Paterson, N.J., attended Fordham and Columbia Universities and received his law degree from Fordham Law School in 1928.
        He served as a lieutenant in the Coast Guard in World War II and became a special assistant to Attorney General Tom C. Clark in 1945, serving as chief litigator in the claims division of the Justice Department.
        From mid-1947 he headed the New York office of the Department's antitrust division, where he moved against price fixers in food, clothing, housing and other items subject to postwar shortages. He returned to private life at the beginning of 1950 to become a partner in the firm of McClaughlin, Stickles & Hayden and president of James King & Son Inc., general contractors, a post he held until 1955.
        Mr. Hayden is survived by his wife of 47 years, Katherine McCabe Hayden; a daughter, Dolores Hayden Marris of Los Angeles and Cornwall, Conn.; a son, Dr. Gregory Hayden, of Charlottesville, Va.; two sisters, Helen DenHerder of Salisbury, Md., and Sarah Finzer of Ocala, Fla., and two grandchildren.
