        Samuel G. Blackman, who in 1932 broke the news that Charles A. Lindbergh's baby had been kidnapped and then went on to hold the top news-editing post at The Associated Press, died of heart failure on Thursday at his home in the Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Md. He was 90.
        Mr. Blackman joined The Associated Press in Trenton in 1931 and moved to New  York in 1941. In 1958, he was named general news editor, then the agency's top news job. He retired in 1969.
        As a reporter, Mr. Blackman covered the Morro Castle steamship fire, the crashes of the dirigibles Akron and Hindenburg, and the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh baby.
        He is survived by two daughters, Carolyn B. Jacoby of Bound Brook, N.J., and  Ann Blackman Putzel, a former Associated Press reporter and now a correspondent  for Time magazine in Washington; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
