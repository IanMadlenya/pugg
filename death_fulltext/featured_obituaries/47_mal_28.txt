        Dr. Lewis M. Fraad, a well-known physician who helped promote teaching and training in pediatrics at medical schools, died on Tuesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 83 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        He died of cancer, said a spokesman for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where Dr. Fraad was a professor.
        Dr. Fraad joined Einstein, a part of Yeshiva University, at its inception in 1955 after having been an assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center since 1948. He became professor of pediatrics at Einstein in 1959 and served as acting chairman of the pediatrics department in the early 1970's. He was also assistant dean of the medical college.
        Dr. Fraad also served as medical director and acting director of ambulatory care at the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center.
        In his book "Baby and Child Care," Dr. Benjamin Spock cited Dr. Fraad as one of the pediatricians who had advised him.
        In late 1969, as chief of pediatrics at Einstein, Dr. Fraad helped recruit socially conscious medical students to work at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, which the college staffed. Eventually 32 interns, residents and junior physicians created the Pediatrics Collective, a group that pressed for community control of health care in the Bronx.
        Born in Harrison, N.Y., on Sept. 3, 1907, Dr. Fraad received his medical training at the University of Vienna, graduating in 1935. He served in the Army in World War II.
        Dr. Fraad is survived by his wife, Irma; three daughters, Rosalyn Baxandall and Julie Fraad, both of Manhattan, and Harriet Fraad of New Haven, and five grandchildren.
