        The Rev. Theodore Jones, a Unitarian Universalist minister who was a founder and co-chairman of WCRB, a classical-music radio station in the Boston area, died yesterday at his home in Lexington, Mass. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Jones died of cancer, a spokeswoman for his family said.
        He and his wife, the former Nathalie Hall, had owned and operated the commercial station since 1949. In March, Mr. Jones announced that his majority stock interest had been put in a trust with the intent of preserving WCBR's classical-music format for the next 100 years.
        Mr. Jones bought his first stock in WCRB, based in Waltham, Mass., in the late 1940's with $3,000 won in an arbitration case. As the station's fortunes improved, he entered Boston University at age 45 with the goal of becoming a minister, taking one course a semester while working at WCRB. Twenty years later, he received a master's degree from Harvard University Divinity School and became associate minister at the First Parish Church, Unitarian Universalist, in Waltham.
        He was also active in civil-rights work. In 1968, he won the National Editorial Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for an editorial on the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
        A conscientious objector in World War II, he worked on a farm and sold radio time in the evening for WKIP in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He then moved to Gardner, Mass., as manager of WHOB, a local radio station, which dismissed him for broadcasting a program about Planned Parenthood. The dismissal led to the arbitration that enabled him to buy his first stock in WCRB. He first worked at the station as a salesman and rose to become executive manager.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Christopher, of Raynham, Mass.; two daughters, Barbara Baker of Woodstock, Vt., and Ellie Asti-Hall of Spokane, Wash.; a brother, Starr West Jones of Santa Maria, Calif., and six grandchildren.
