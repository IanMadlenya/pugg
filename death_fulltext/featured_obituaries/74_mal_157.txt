        Stephen White, a writer who helped to start the nation's public television network in the 1960's, died Saturday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 77 and lived in Bethesda.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Mr. White, an author and former newspaper reporter, was assistant from 1965 to 1967 to James R. Killian, chairman of the Carnegie Commission on Educational Television. The panel was formed to chart a Government-financed expansion of existing noncommercial broadcast stations into a national network.
        The result was a report, written by Mr. White, "Public Television: A Program for Action." The report became the basis for the 1967 Public Broadcasting Act, which underwrote the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
        Also that year, Mr. White was a producer and principal writer for "A CBS News Inquiry: The Warren Report." The four-hour documentary examined rumors and accusations about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It concluded that the Warren Report, flawed as it may have been,was the likeliest explanation of the killing.
        Mr. White was born in Boston and attended Boston Latin School and Harvard University. He wrote for Boston newspapers before joining The New York Herald Tribune in 1943 as a reporter. He was later based in The Tribune's Paris bureau as a roving European correspondent and then moved to Look magazine.
        In 1967 he became director of special projects at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. Two years later he joined the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York, where he stayed until 1983, when he became an education consultant.
        Mr. White's wife, the former Miriam Wheeler, died in 1980. He is survived by two sons, Lawrence, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Geoffrey, of Arlington, Va., and two grandchildren.
