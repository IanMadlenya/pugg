        Maurice Braddell, an actor, author and art restorer, died July 28 in England. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Braddell, born in 1900 in the seacoast city of Folkestone, lived in New York City much of his life, said James Lardner, a staff writer for The New Yorker, who profiled Mr. Braddell for the magazine in 1986.
        He acted in British silent films and on the stage, where he was Noel Coward's understudy for the original production of ''Private Lives'' in the 1930's. He appeared in several movies during that period, including H. G. Wells's ''Things to Come.''
        Four decades later, as an art restorer living in the East Village, he was cast in the Andy Warhol-Paul Morrissey film ''Flesh,'' Mr. Lardner said.
        Mr. Braddell wrote several plays, including ''It's You I Want,'' a farce produced on Broadway in 1935. He was also the author of a children's book, ''Little Gorky of the Black Swans.''
        There are no immediate survivors, Mr. Lardner said.
