       Fitzhugh Green, an author and former government aide, died Wednesday at Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. He was 72 years old and lived in Washington.
        He died of cardiac arrhythmia, said his daughter, Penelope Green.
        Mr. Green, a retired officer of the United States Information Agency, served as assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for international activities from 1971 to 1977 and from 1983 to 1987.
        He was involved in negotiations for accords on ozone and acid rain with Mexico and for one on the environment with the Soviet Union. When he left the agency, he joined an environmental consulting firm headed by William D. Ruckelshaus, a former E.P.A. Administrator.
        Before serving with the environmental agency, Mr. Green was director of operations at a number of foreign posts for the U.S.I.A., including Laos, Israel, the Belgian Congo and as a representative to the United Nations.
        He worked in the agency from 1954 until 1966, when he left for a two-year stint as a special assistant on oceanography and foreign affairs to Senator Claiborne Pell. He returned to the U.S.I.A., then resigned in 1970 to make an unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for a Congressional seat from Rhode Island.
        Mr. Green was the author of several books, including ''A Change in the Weather,'' ''American Propaganda Abroad'' and ''George Bush: An Intimate Portrait.''
        In addition to his daughter, Penelope, of Manhattan, he is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Farnum Blua of Greenwich, Conn., and a brother, Richard Eliot Green of Ridgefield, Conn.
