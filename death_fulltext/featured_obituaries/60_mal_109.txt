        Billy Graham, a welterweight boxer noted for stylish and subtle moves that made him a difficult target in the ring, died Wednesday at his home in West Islip, L.I. He was 70 years old.
        His son, Billy Jr., said yesterday that the cause of death was cancer.
        In a professional career that lasted from 1941 to 1955, Mr. Graham had a record of 102 victories, 15 losses and 9 draws. Two of his victories were in nontitle bouts over Kid Gavilan and Carmen Basilio.
        In another bout with Gavilan, on Aug. 29, 1951, Graham lost a highly disputed split decision at Madison Square Garden that enabled Gavilan to retain the crown, but left Graham forever after referred to as the uncrowned welterweight champion.
        Mr. Graham, who was born on the East Side of Manhattan, also served as the model for Eddie Brown, a fictional fighter in W. C. Heinz's novel "The Professional."
        After his boxing career, Mr. Graham worked for 35 years as a representative for liquor companies, 25 years for Seagram's. He was also a boxing judge and referee.
        Mr. Graham is survived by his wife, Lorraine; three sons, Billy Jr., Gordon and Douglas; a daughter, Ellen, and a granddaughter, Samantha.
