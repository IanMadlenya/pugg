        Dr. Leon J. Warshaw, a former city health affairs official and founder of the New York Business Group on Health, an information exchange for employers that provide benefits for more than one million workers and family members, died at his home in Manhattan on Jan. 3. He was 83.
        The cause was a heart attack, his son David said.
        Dr. Warshaw was the executive director of the business group from 1980 until he retired in 1993. It sponsors seminars for employers on managed health care and other benefits issues. The group's 150 current members include large and medium-size employers, hospitals, health maintenance organizations, pharmaceutical manufacturers and consulting firms.
        As a deputy director in the Mayor's Office of Operations under Mayor Edward I. Koch, Dr. Warshaw oversaw the Health and Hospitals Corporation, health department, chief medical examiner's office, and health services for employees of the police, fire, sanitation and correction departments. He was a member of the Governor's Health Advisory Council, appointed by Gov. Mario Cuomo and Gov. George E. Pataki.
        Earlier, he was corporate medical director for several companies including the Equitable Life Assurance Society, the Paramount Pictures Corporation, the United Artists Corporation and the American Broadcasting System. He wrote four books, including ''Malaria: The Biography of a Killer'' in 1949, and several hundred articles for professional medical publications, David Warshaw said.
        Dr. Warshaw was born in New York in 1917. He graduated from Columbia University in 1938 and the university's College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1942.
        Survivors, in addition to his son David, of Ho Ho Kus, N.J., include his wife, Mona; a son Peter, of Toronto; a brother, Mal, of Westport, Conn.; and four grandchildren.
