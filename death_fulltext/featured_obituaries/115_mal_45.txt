        Richard M. Goodwin, an economist who developed a technique to model economic activity, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Siena, Italy, where he had been vacationing. He was 83 and lived in Ashdon, England.
        The cause was a heart ailment, his family said.
        Dr. Goodwin, was born and reared in Indiana, was a mathematician who developed a three-dimensional model that traced the interaction of business cycles and economic growth in more complex ways than in the past. His writings were concerned mostly with the new model.
        ''He taught us all about economic dynamics,'' said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate who studied with Dr. Goodwin at Harvard. ''And he made high-brow research seem like fun.''
        Dr. Goodwin, who insisted on devoting as much time to painting and music as to economics, received his bachelor of arts and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard and taught there from 1942 until 1950. He moved on to Cambridge University after Harvard denied him tenure. He taught at Cambridge until 1979 and then at the University of Siena, until 1984.
        Surviving is his wife, the former Jacqueline Wynmalen.
