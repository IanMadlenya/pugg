        Dr. John Eldridge Frost, librarian emeritus at New York University and an authority on Maine genealogy, died last Thursday at Eliot Hospital in Maine. He was 85 years old and had returned from Manhattan two years ago to live in York, Me.
        He died of cancer, said Frank Bradley, a friend in New York.
        Born in Eliot, Dr. Frost was the scion of one of Maine's most prominent families, with ancestral roots going back to the 1600's. He wrote many articles and books on the history of his and other Maine families. Robert Frost was a cousin.
        An ordained Episcopal priest, he served in parishes in and around New York City before he became a Navy chaplain in World War II. After the war, he earned a B.S. at Columbia University, an M.A. at the University of New Hampshire and a Ph.D. at New York University in 1953, three years after becoming assistant librarian there.
        From 1955 to 1972 he headed the Gould Memorial Library, then the main library on N.Y.U.'s old University Heights campus and now the site of Bronx Community College. He was then on the university's library faculty until reaching emeritus status in 1982.
        Dr. Frost is survived by a brother, Joseph W. P. of Eliot, and two sisters, Mara Marshall of Kittery, Me., and Mary Waterhouse of Mexico, Me.
