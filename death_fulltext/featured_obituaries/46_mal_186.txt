        Dr. Lawrence L. Jarvie, an educator who helped to lead the postwar expansion of New York State's community colleges and served as a president of the Fashion Institute of Technology, died on Thursday at the Largo Medical Center in Florida. He was 84 years old and lived in Belleair, Fla.
        He suffered a stroke on Oct. 7, his wife Wynn said.
        As executive dean of the State University of New York for two-year and community colleges, Dr. Jarvie was credited with a leading role in the expansion of the state's two-year colleges after World War II.
        When he moved to the position in 1949 from similar responsibilities as associate state commissioner of education, the State University had five community colleges, known then as institutes. By the time he left the post in 1961 to become president of the New York City College of Applied Arts and Sciences, the state system had grown to 16 community colleges.
        After a brief time as general superintendent for community education in Flint, Mich., he returned to New York in 1965 to serve as president of the Fashion Institute of Technology. During more than five years there, he oversaw the growth of the its plant, programs and enrollment.
        Dr. Jarvie, who was born in Scotland, came to the United States as a boy. He received his Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Ohio State University.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by his son, Charles L., of Dallas.
