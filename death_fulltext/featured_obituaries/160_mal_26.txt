        Isabel Johnson Hiss, Alger Hiss's widow, died Wednesday at her home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. She was 91.
        ''To Isabel'' was the dedication that Mr. Hiss, a former State Department official, put on his 1988 book,  ''Recollections of a Life.''
        That was long after he had served 44 months in prison after being convicted of perjury for denying to a grand jury that he passed secret State Department documents to Whittaker Chambers, an admitted former courier for a Soviet spy ring.
        Mr. Hiss emerged from prison in 1954 and spent the rest of his life trying to clear his name. A mutual friend introduced him to Isabel Johnson in the 1960's in New York City. They were longtime friends by the time they married after the death in 1984 of his first wife, Priscilla, from whom he had been separated since 1959, 30 years after they wed.
        Isabel Hiss was born Isabel Dowden in Montclair, N.J. She became a model in Paris, and when she returned to the United States, worked as a model, a freelance writer and an editor.
        An early marriage ended in divorce.
