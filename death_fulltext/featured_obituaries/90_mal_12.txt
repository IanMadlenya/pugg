        U Maung Maung, a Burmese lawyer who was briefly President of Burma, now called Myanmar, died yesterday in Yangon, the capital. He was 69.
        The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Maung Maung, a civilian with ties to Burma's longtime military rulers, was the country's attorney general before he became President, on Aug. 19, 1988. His predecessor, U Sein Lwin, a former army general, had resigned, shaken by violent student-led pro-democracy demonstrations,after only 17 days in office.
        The country's military leadership evidently felt that having a civilian President would help to abate the protests, but instead they grew. On Sept. 18, after only a month in office, Mr. Maung Maung was succeeded by the defense minister, and the military cracked down on the protesters.
        A native of Mandalay, Mr. Maung Maung earned law degrees from the University of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, and from Yale. He was a lecturer at Yale for two years.
        After the Burmese military came to power in a 1962 coup d'etat, he served as chief justice and justice minister and in the ruling bodies of the Government and ruling party.
        Mr. Maung Maung is survived by his wife and four children.
        Correction:  July 9, 1994, Saturday
        A picture on Sunday with an obituary of U Maung Maung, who was briefly President of Burma, was published in error. It showed U Maung Maung Kha, a former Prime Minister, not the former President.
