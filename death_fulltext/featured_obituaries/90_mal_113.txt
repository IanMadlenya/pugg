        Gordon M. Lipetz, a retired justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Suffolk County, died on July 17 in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 86 and lived in Southampton, L.I., for many years before moving to Pompano Beach in 1981.

        A native of Riverhead, L.I., Judge Lipetz graduated from Washington Square College of New York University and from N.Y.U.'s School of Law, where he was a member of the Law Review. He practiced in Riverhead as a trial and appellate attorney for nearly 35 years and served as a judge of the Suffolk County Court from 1969 to 1973. That year, he was elected to the State Supreme Court with the support of both the Democratic and Republican parties. He retired from the bench in 1979 at age 70.
        He was a founder and director of the Legal Aid Society of Suffolk County. Over the years, he served as a hearing officer for the United States Department of Justice in conscientious-objector cases and represented the Town of Southampton as special counsel. He also acted as lawyer for the Village of Southampton as a special Assistant District Attorney in Suffolk County and as attorney for the Eastport and East Quogue School Districts.
