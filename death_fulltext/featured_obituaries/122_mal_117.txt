        Dr. David C. Miller, who attended Albert Schweitzer late in the philosopher's life and who was a noted epidemiologist and leader of famine-relief and other humanitarian projects, died on Thursday at his home in Lavonia, Ga. He was 80.
        The cause was lymphoma, a family member said.
        In the 1960's, while helping to direct a heart-disease study at the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Gabon, Dr. Miller began working with Schweitzer. They formed a close friendship, and Dr. Miller cared for the philosopher as he died in 1965.
        In 1971, Dr. Miller married Schweitzer's daughter, Rhena. They did relief work for victims of war, drought, famine and plague in such places as Bangladesh, Egypt, Ethiopia, Haiti, Pakistan and South Vietnam.
        Dr. Miller was born in Elizabeth, N.J., on March 9, 1917. He graduated from Duke University School of Medicine in 1950 and received a master's degree in public health from Harvard in 1956. He then directed nutrition programs for the Public Health Service in Washington for a year, worked at the Public Health Service Indian Hospital in Tuba City, Ariz., from 1957 to 1959, and at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, from 1968 until he retired in 1980.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by four daughters, Dr. Madeline Harrington of Port Angeles, Wash., Deborah Admiral of Copake, N.Y., Susan Sheppard of Bletchley, England, and Pamela Miller of Atlanta; a son, John Miller of Minneapolis, and two sisters, Elizabeth Popov of New Market, N.H., and Jean Hogan of Bronxville, N.Y.
