        James Ford, a sculptor and print maker, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 45 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said his companion, Peter Reed.
        Mr. Ford was known for austere sculptures that made use of a wide range of materials: glass, water, steel and copper. Recently, he had produced monumental works that related to his struggle with AIDS, using images drawn from laboratory equipment. Over the last few years, he did a number of sculptures for public spaces, including a Veterans Memorial Fountain for Columbus, Ohio, and a Veterans Memorial Plaza for Winston-Salem, N.C.
        A master print maker, he was included in a large 1990 survey called "The Unique Print" at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. He also designed a number of sets for dance groups, including the Contemporary Ballet, headed by Mr. Reed, and the Nina Wiener Dance Company.
        Mr. Ford was born in Yuma, Ariz. He graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1960 and received a Master of Fine Arts degree there in 1972.
        He is survived by his parents, Clara and Payton Ford, and a brother, Ron, all of Bakersfield, Calif.
