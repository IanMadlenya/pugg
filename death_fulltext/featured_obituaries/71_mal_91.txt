        Max Greenberg, who led the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union for 20 years, died on Saturday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 85.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Greenberg, a former resident of West Orange, N.J., had been living in Boca Raton in retirement since 1977. He was the head of the union from 1954 to 1975.
        Mr. Greenberg, a native of New York City, attended Pace College. He was forced to withdraw during the Depression and had to go to work selling men's clothing. In 1937, he joined with co-workers in Newark to get a charter from the Congress of Industrial Organizations to form Local 108 Retail Store Employees Union, which he was elected to lead.
        At first, the union organized workers in haberdashery stores. It later grew to represent employees of national chains. Mr. Greenberg became a central figure in the merger of three separate unions: his own, by then called the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; the Distributing, Processing and Office Employees Union, and the Playthings, Novelty and Jewelry Workers Union.
        Mr. Greenberg served as a labor representative on New Jersey's Board of Mediation from 1949 to 1954.
        Upon the merger of the C.I.O. with the American Federation of Labor in 1955, Mr. Greenberg was elected to the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council. He also served as a vice president until his retirement in 1975.
        Mr. Greenberg's wife of 63 years, the former Billie Garfinkle, died in August. He is survived by a son, Martin, of South Orange, N.J.; a daughter, Marsha Rein of Wyckoff, N.J.; a sister, Yetta Shapiro of Delray Beach, Fla.; a brother, Charles, of Boca Raton; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
