        J. Allen Murphy, a dealer in antiques and a decorator who worked on estates in Palm Beach and Southampton and apartments in New York and Caracas, Venezuela, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 60 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He fell ill the night before and appeared to have suffered a heart attack, said Anne Hayes, his assistant.
        Mr. Murphy, a native New Yorker, was legendary for his taste and a client list that, over the years, featured names like Phipps, Vanderbilt, Guest, Niarchos, Tailer and Herrera. Often called a Duke of Windsor look-alike, he was a regular at decorators' show houses for many years.
        Mr. Murphy attended Princeton University and never had any formal training in his profession. He set out as what he called a "glorified curtain salesman" for the W. & J. Sloane department store in Beverly Hills, Calif., and, living in Hollywood, started taking private decorating commissions.
        For a time he also worked as a fashion reporter and as editor-in-chief of Men's Bazaar magazine. He was on best-dressed lists when he was still in his 20's.
        Mr. Murphy, in addition to decorating, arranged society parties, high teas and debutante balls.
        His latest venture, begun in 1988, was Eclectic, an appropriately named establishment selling fine antiques and accessories to private buyers and decorators.
        He worked out of a town house on East 70th Street, where he had his apartment and shop. Its onetime ballroom offered browsers an artfully arranged clutter of everything from period furniture to objets d'art to crystal and brass candlesticks.
        Mr. Murphy is survived by his sister, Patricia Heingartner of Bondville, Vt.
