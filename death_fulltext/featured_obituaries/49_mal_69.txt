        The commander in chief of the Portuguese Army, Gen. Mario Firmino Miguel, was killed in a car accident, the army said today. He was 52 years old.
        An army spokesman said the general, a hero of Portugal's colonial wars, died after a two-car crash Saturday night on the busy seaside road linking Lisbon to the resort of Cascais.
        Gen. Firmino Miguel, who was appointed to the army's top rank in January 1987, died in surgery at a hospital, the spokesman said.
        His father-in-law and one of his two children, who had been traveling with him, were seriously injured in the crash, news reports said.
