        C. Preston Stephens, a former senior vice president of the Coca-Cola Export Company, died on Wednesday at his home in Atlanta. He was 78.
        The cause of death was bone cancer, a company spokesman said.
        During his 30 years with the company, Mr. Stephens presided over the establishment of 16 bottling operations in South America. Under his leadership, the spokesman said, a quality index was established to insure the uniform quality of the soft drink throughout the world.
        Mr. Stephens graduated from the University of Georgia in 1936 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. He later served as a Navy test pilot, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander.
        Mr. Stephens is survived by his wife, Betty; two sons, William, of San German, P.R., and C. Preston Jr., of Shell, Wyo.; a daughter, Sally Westmoreland of Atlanta, and three grandchildren.
