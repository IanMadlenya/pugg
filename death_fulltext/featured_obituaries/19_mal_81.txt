        Mr. Pajetta began his political career in 1930, at age 15, when he was arrested for anti-Fascist activities. He fled Italy, first to the Soviet Union and then to Spain, where he fought for the Republicans in the civil war.
        In 1944, he became one of the organizers and leaders of the Italian partisan group called Volunteers for Liberty.
        After the war, Mr. Pajetta was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and later to the Senate, ending his legislative career in 1972. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party until his death.
