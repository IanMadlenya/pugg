        Sir Mark Pizey, a British admiral who led a famed Royal Navy pursuit of three Nazi warships in World War II and later became Commander in Chief of the Indian Navy, died on Monday in Burnham-on-Sea in southwestern England, British newspapers reported. He was 93.
        In 1942, Sir Mark commanded a flotilla of six aging destroyers that made a dogged but vain attempt to stop the battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen from completing a dash to safety from the French Atlantic port of Brest through the Straits of Dover to Germany's western coast.
        That Nazi success embarrassed Britain, but The Times of London said last week: "That this happened was not Pizey's fault. Indeed, the valiant attempt of his hopelessly antiquated and totally outgunned force to make amends for the failures" of other units of the British armed forces "is one of the bright spots in an otherwise sad episode."
        From 1951 to 1955 Sir Mark commanded the Indian Navy and oversaw its modernization. When he stepped down, he said in an interview, "It took me about 40 years to know what little I know about the sea." He retired from the Royal Navy in 1958.
        His wife of 65 years, the former Phyllis D'Angibau, died last month. He is survived by their two daughters.
