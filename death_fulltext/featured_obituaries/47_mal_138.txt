        Herman E. Roser, Assistant Secretary of Energy for defense programs from 1981 to 1984, died Sunday at his home in Albuquerque. He was 69 years old.
        His daughter, Babette Berkshire, said the cause of death had not been determined.
        Mr. Roser, a native of San Marcial, N.M., was head of the Energy Department's Albuquerque operations office from 1975 until 1981, when he was named assistant secretary by President Ronald Reagan. He was responsible for managing the nation's nuclear weapons programs and coordinating the nuclear safeguards and security program as well as international activities related to nuclear technology and materials.
        Mr. Roser, who never attended college, spent his career managing the work of scientists.
        He joined the Energy Department's forerunner, the Atomic Energy Commission, in 1961 and worked in Los Alamos and Washington. Previously he worked for the Zia Company, a contractor serving the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
        In addition to his daughter, survivors include his wife, Norma.
