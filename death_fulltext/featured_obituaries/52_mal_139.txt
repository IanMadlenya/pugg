        Martin B. Dickson, a professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University, died on May 14 at the Medical Center at Princeton. He was 67 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He died of coronary illness, said a university spokesman.
        Dr. Dickson, a 1958 Ph.D. graduate of Princeton, joined the faculty there in 1959 after a year of study at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard University. He was named an associate professor in 1964 and a full professor in 1978. He taught Persian language and literature and Islamic history.
        In 1982, in collaboration with Stuart Carey Welch of Harvard, he edited "The Houghton Shahnameh: a Limited Facsimile Edition of the Shahnameh (Book of Kings)" a two-volume work on Persian paintings published by Harvard University Press. In the 1960's he was part of a team of American scholars who went to Iran to compile a comprehensive history of the country.
        He is survived by a sister, Beatrice Schwartz of Brooklyn, and a brother, Leo, of Yonkers.
