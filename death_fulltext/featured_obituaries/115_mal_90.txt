        Herbert C. Cornuelle, a business and community leader in Hawaii and the youngest man to become president of the Dole Company, died at his home in Honolulu on Tuesday of abdominal cancer. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Cornuelle, who was born in Ohio, began his long association with Hawaii when he was stationed there in 1942 as an ensign in the United States Navy. In 1953, he became the vice president of the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, and he became its president five years later, at the age of 38. Mr. Cornuelle changed the company's name to the Dole Pineapple Company.
        In 1963, he joined the United Fruit Company in Boston as a vice president and became its president four years later. Then, two years later, he returned to Hawaii as executive vice president of the Dillingham Corporation, which was engaged in real estate and natural resources development and other activities. He became the company's president in 1970.
        In 1982, he joined the Campbell Estate, a private trust that manages land holdings in Hawaii and 12 other states. He retired as its chairman in 1990.
        Mr. Cornuelle also served as chairman of the University of Hawaii's regents and was a director or trustee of many community and charitable organizations. In 1979, he helped form the Council for a Competitive Economy, a business group that, among other things, opposed the Federal Government's bailout of the financially ailing Chrysler Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean; two brothers, Ralph, of Seattle, and Richard, of New York; three sons, John, of Atherton, Calif., Richard, of Honolulu, and Bruce, of San Diego; a daughter, Ann, of San Mateo, Calif., and five grandchildren.
