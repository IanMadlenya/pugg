        Philipp C. Jung, a set designer for dozens of theater, opera, dance and film productions, died on Thursday at a hospital in San Luis Obispo, Calif., where he lived. He was 43.
        He died of complications of AIDS, friends said.
        Among Mr. Jung's best known productions were Broadway's "Eastern Standard," "Mastergate" and "Closer Than Ever."
        His other work in New York included "The Madwoman of Central Park West," "Major Barbara," "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs," "The Banana Box," "Panama Hattie," "The Lisbon Traviata," "Molly Mademoiselle Colombe" and "It's a Man's World."
        He also designed productions in Boston, Santa Fe, N.M. and in California, where he moved two years ago to teach theater design at California Polytechnic Institute.
        Mr. Jung was born in Cleveland. He graduated from the Yale School of Drama and also studied theater design in London.
        He is survived by his mother, Wanda, and a sister, Barbara Imburgia, both of Parma, Ohio.
