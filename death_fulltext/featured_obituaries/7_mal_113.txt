        Judge Matthews, a Republican, was designated an acting Supreme Court justice when Governor Cuomo appointed him last December to the Court of Claims, which handles suits by citizens against the state.
        Judge Matthews, who was born in New York City, was a Marine Corps aircraft gunner in World War II. He began a private law practice after graduating from the St. John's University Law School in 1951 and was a special assistant state attorney general and a judicial law secretary before becoming a judge.
        He is survived by his wife, Eileen; three daughters, Barbara Post of Reston, Va., Jeanne-Marie Matthews of Glen Head, L.I., and Maureen Rothman of Clearwater, Fla.; a brother, Maurice; two sisters, Alice Meyerson and Mae Matthews, and four grandchildren.
