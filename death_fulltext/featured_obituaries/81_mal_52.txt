        Frederic B. Withington, who retired in 1988 after 22 years as headmaster of the Quaker-affiliated Friends Academy in Locust Valley, L.I., died on Sept. 29 at his home in Brunswick, Me. He was 71.
        The cause of death was a malignant melanoma, the school said.
        During Mr. Withington's years at the academy, he saw the campus and enrollment nearly double, and the school, founded in 1876, now has 85 teachers and 685 pupils. The academy also became religiously, racially and economically more diversified under his stewardship.
        Mr. Withington, a native of Winchester, Mass., spent a year after high school graduation at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, during which he set a New England preparatory-school record in the 440-yard dash in 1941. He attended Harvard College, then entered the Army Air Corps in 1943. Based in Italy as a B-24 bomber pilot, he flew 24 missions, was shot down twice and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with three clusters. Teacher and Coach
        Returning to Harvard, he again excelled in track. After graduating in 1947, he became a mathematics teacher and coach at Governor Drummer Academy in Massachusetts and earned a master's in English at Middlebury College in Vermont.
        He then served as principal of the Upper School at Sidwell Friends School in Washington and later as headmaster of Morgan Park Academy in Chicago before moving to Friends Academy.
        Mr. Withington, known as Ted, retired to Maine in 1988. His book, "Flight to Black Hammer" (Biddle Publishing, 1993), tells of his war experiences through his letters and diaries.
        He is survived by his wife, JoAnn Souter Witherington; three daughters, Susan Withington Meyn of Topsham, Me., Ann Withington of Gorham, Me., and Sarah Withington of Concord, Mass; two brothers, Dr. William A. of Lexington, Ky., and Arthur of Clinton, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
