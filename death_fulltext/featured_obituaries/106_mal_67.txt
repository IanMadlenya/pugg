        Dr. Harry John Robinson Sr., a former director of the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research in Rahway, N.J., died last Wednesday at his home in Short Hills, N.J. He was 82.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Robinson, a native of Elizabeth, N.J., was known for his work in pharmacology, toxicology and the therapeutic properties of drugs. His career in  medical research and education spanned 50 years, 43 of them with Merck & Co. He joined the Merck Institute after graduating from high school in 1933 as a laboratory assistant and, with the company's help, graduated from New York University in 1940 and received a Ph.D. in infectious diseases from Rutgers University in 1943 and an M.D. from Columbia University in 1948.
        In the early 1940's, he worked on a team under Dr. Selman A. Waksman, discoverer of streptomycin, the antimicrobial agent that proved effective against tuberculosis.
        After retiring from Merck in 1976, he spent seven more years as a vice president for medical affairs at Allied Chemical Corporation. He was also a member and four-time chairman of the Public Health Council of New Jersey from 1953 to 1978 and, from 1976 until three years ago, was a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, based in Newark.
        Dr. Robinson is survived by his wife, Marion Neunert Robinson; a daughter, Linda R. Miele of Madison, N.J.; two sons, Dr. Harry J. Jr., of Minneapolis and  Dr. Raymond P., of Seattle; a sister, Madeline Walsh of Whiting, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
