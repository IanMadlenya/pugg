        Theodore F. Shaker, a former chairman and chief executive of the Arbitron Ratings Company, died on Wednesday in New Canaan, Conn. He was 83 and lived in Darien, Conn.
        The cause was complications of a fractured hip, his family said; he also had Parkinson's disease.
        Mr. Shaker worked for two decades in network television before becoming chief executive of Arbitron, a television and radio ratings company, in 1971. The company was then called the American Research Bureau, but Mr. Shaker changed the name after hearing that it could alienate minorities, said Thom Mocarsky, a spokesman for Arbitron. Mr. Shaker made representing the opinions of blacks and Hispanics a priority at Arbitron, Mr. Mocarsky said.
        During Mr. Shaker's 17 years at Arbitron, the company grew from revenue of $10 million a year to $150 million a year, Mr. Mocarsky said. One of Mr. Shaker's projects in the 1980's, ScanAmerica, which sought to link consumers' purchases with the advertisements they saw, has resurfaced this year in a pilot program called Project Apollo at Arbitron, Mr. Mocarsky said.
        ''The technology wasn't up to the task, but the concept has come back here at Arbitron,'' he said.
        Mr. Shaker worked for CBS in the 1950's and for ABC in the 1960's, eventually overseeing the film, international, spot sales and television station divisions as group vice president. He is survived by his wife, Janice S. Shaker; his brother, E. Webster Shaker; a daughter, Susan Shaker Brownlee; two sons, Ted Shaker Jr. and John Mitchell Shaker; eight grandchildren and one great grandchild.
