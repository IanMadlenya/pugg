        Dr. Benjamin W. Zweifach, a pioneer in the study of microcirculation, which involves small blood vessels, and in the field of bioengineering, died on Oct. 23 at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego. He was 86 and lived in San Diego.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, family members said.
        At the University of California at San Diego, he was a professor of bioengineering, taught human physiology and established one of the first departments of bioengineering, which brought together faculty members from physiology, engineering and mathematics to study medical problems.
        He founded The Journal of Microvascular Research and worked on it for 30 years.
        Born in Manhattan, he received a bachelor's degree in biology at the College of the City of New York, in 1931, and master's and doctoral degrees in cellular physiology at New York University. He worked at Cornell Medical School from 1947 to 1952, and at N.Y.U. until 1966, when he joined the University of California.
        In 1982, the Microcirculation Society named its top award after him; the Zweifach Gold Medal recognizes career accomplishments in that field.
        He also contributed to the understanding of emergency medicine and shock in World War II, and carried out research on diabetes, hypertension and ischemia, a localized form of anemia produced by blockage of the arteries.
        Survivors include his wife of 59 years, Beatrice; three brothers, Louis, of Hackensack, N.J., Herman, of Laguna Hills, Calif., and Bernard, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Paula Weinberger, of San Rafael, Calif., and Marilyn Zweifach, of Los Angeles; a son, Mark, of Encinitas, Calif., and three grandchildren.
