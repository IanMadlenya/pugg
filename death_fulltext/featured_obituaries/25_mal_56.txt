        Frederick J. Close, a former chairman of the Aluminum Company of America, died Monday at Lake County East Hospital in Painesville, Ohio, after a fall at his home there. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Close joined Alcoa as an apprentice salesman shortly after graduating from Pennsylvania State University in 1929. He became a vice president in 1958, executive vice president in 1963 and chairman two years later. He retired in 1970.
        He played a key role in the development of the 31-story Alcoa Building in Pittsburgh, the first aluminum skyscraper. The building paved the way for the use of aluminum in high-rise structures around the world. He also led the development of aluminum beverage cans with snap openers.
        He is survived by a son, Frederick 3d, of London, two granddaughters and two great-grandsons.
