        Henry M. Storhoff, one of a few people who could play the psalmodicon, died Wednesday at the age of 81.
        The psalmodicon, a one-string instrument that looks like a hollow 2-by-4 with a guitar fret board, is played with a violin bow. It was once popular among Scandinavian immigrants. Mr. Storhoff, who worked as a farmer and carpenter, found a psalmodicon on his grandmother's farm in 1929 and taught himself to play it. His music was recorded by the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Minnesota.
