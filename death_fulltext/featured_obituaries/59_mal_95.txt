        Edward Suisman, a founder of the University of Hartford and retired chairman of Aerospace Metals Inc. in Hartford, died on Saturday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 89 years old and lived in West Hartford, Conn., and Palm Springs, Calif.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Suisman helped build a small scrap-metal processing business started by his father in 1899 into Aerospace Metals, formerly known as Suisman & Blumenthal, processors of nickel, cobalt, titanium and other metals used in the aerospace industry. He retired from the company six years ago.
        In 1943, Mr. Suisman and his brother Samuel founded the Suisman Foundation whose beneficiaries included schools, hospitals and social agencies.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Erra Weiner; three sons, Michael and John, of West Hartford and Richard, of Hartford; three sisters, Adeline Bishop and Fran Kaplan of West Hartford and Minerva Sudarsky of Hartford; 11 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
