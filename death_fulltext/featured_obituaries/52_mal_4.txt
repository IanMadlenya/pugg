        Jacob Rootenberg, a professor and former chairman of the department of computer sciences at Queens College, died on Friday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 55 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage, his wife said.
        Dr. Rootenberg, who was an authority on computer architecture and communications networks, came to the United States in June 1967 shortly after graduating from Technion, Israel's Institute of Technology in Haifa. He taught at Columbia University for seven years before joining the faculty at Queens College.
        He was chairman of the computer sciences department at Queens College from 1982 to 1989. He also founded a doctoral program in computer science at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.
        Dr. Rootenberg wrote more than 60 technical papers in professional journals. He was a senior member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
        Besides his wife, the former Ruth Biderman, he is survived by two daughters, Sharyn and Julie, both of Brooklyn; a son, Daniel, of Brooklyn; his mother, Naomi, and a sister, Ronit Kitai, both of Haifa.
