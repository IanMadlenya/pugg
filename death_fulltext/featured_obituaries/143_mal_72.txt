        Paul H. Smucker, the former chairman of the jelly company in Orrville, Ohio, that bears his family's name, died last Thursday at his home in Orrville. He was 81.
        Mr. Smucker is credited with helping transform the J. M. Smucker Company from a small, regional jam and jelly manufacturer to a company with global operations and a product line that includes preserves, jams, jellies and other fruit-spread products; health and natural foods;  beverages; ice cream toppings, and natural peanut butter.
        Mr. Smucker had worked for Smucker's, founded by his grandfather 101 years ago, since 1939, with a brief hiatus from the company when he served aboard a Navy destroyer in World War II.
        After serving in the war, Mr. Smucker became Smucker's general manager, a position he held until he became the company's president in 1961. In 1970, he assumed the additional titles of chairman and chief executive. Mr. Smucker turned over the company's presidency to his eldest son, Tim, in 1981. Tim Smucker succeeded his father as chairman in 1987, the same year Mr. Smucker's younger son, Richard, became the company's president. At that time, Mr. Smucker became chairman of Smucker's executive committee, a position he held until his death.
        Mr. Smucker graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, from which he also received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. He was a former board member of the Kellogg Company and the First National Bank of Orrville and was a trustee of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation.
        Mr. Smucker is survived by his wife of 58 years, the former Lorraine Smith; a sister, Marcella Smucker Clark of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a daughter, Susan Smucker Wagstaff of Carmel, Calif.; his two sons, Tim, of Orrville, and Richard, of Medina, Ohio; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
