        Edward Dorn, an author known for the mock-epic poem ''Gunslinger'' and other writings about the American West, died on Dec. 10 at his home in Denver. He was 70.
        He had pancreatic cancer, said Tom Clark, a poet and poetry critic.
        Mr. Dorn defined himself as ''a poet of the West -- not by nativity but by orientation.'' Reviewing his ''Collected Poems 1956-1974'' (1975) in The New York Times Book Review, Bill Zavatsky wrote, ''Dorn's poetic strength has rested not on the 'dazzle of learning' he admits to loving but on his capacity to feel with language the lives and the life of the land he knows best.''
        Mr. Dorn wrote ''Gunslinger'' over a period of years. It appeared first in a succession of small-press volumes beginning in 1968 and later in a single-volume, 200-page edition (1989), also titled ''Gunslinger.'' The poem earned Mr. Dorn a following in the 1970's.
        In his later years Mr. Dorn was much concerned, in his writing and teaching, with the culture and geography of the West. His writings on the subject are collected in ''Way West: Stories, Essays and Verse Accounts 1963-1993'' (1993).
        Mr. Dorn was born in Villa Grove, Ill., studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana as well as at Black Mountain College, and taught in the United States and Britain.
        His 1951 marriage to Helene Buck ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Jennifer; two sons, Paul Buck of Carver, Mass., and Kidd Dorn of Manhattan; a daughter, Maya Dorn of Boston; two stepchildren from his first marriage, Fred Buck of Gloucester, Mass., and Chansonette Buck, who lives in California; a sister, Nonna Lytle of Arcola, Ill.; a brother, David Abercrombie of Lebanon, Tenn.; and two grandsons.
