        Vada Pinson, a speedy former Cincinnati Reds center fielder whose 2,757 career hits are the most among eligible players not in the Baseball Hall of Fame, died on Saturday night at the Summit Medical Center in Oakland. He was 57.
        Pinson was admitted to the hospital on Oct. 5 after suffering a stroke, said  Nancy Happel, a hospital spokeswoman.
        Four times in an 11-year career with Cincinnati from 1958-68, Pinson surpassed 200 hits in a season and he batted over .300 each time, though he never won a batting title. Oddly, those feats were achieved in consecutive odd-numbered seasons: .316 with 205 hits in 1959, his first full season in the majors; .343 and 208 in 1961; .313 and 204 in 1963 and .305 and 204 in 1965.
        Though not a raw slugger like his outfield teammate Frank Robinson, Pinson averaged 21 home runs a season in their years as the heart of the Reds' lineup,  from 1959-65. In 1961, they teamed to lead the Reds to the World Series for the  first time in 21 years, but the powerful Yankees prevailed in five games.
        Pinson led the National League twice in hits, twice in triples, twice in doubles and once in runs scored.
        By the time he retired after the 1975 season, Pinson, who batted and threw left-handed, had also played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Cleveland Indians, California Angels and Kansas City Royals.
        His career batting average of .286 included 256 home runs, 485 doubles and 127 triples. He also totaled 305 stolen bases and is one of only six players to  hit 250 home runs and steal 300 bases. The others are Willie Mays, Bobby Bonds,  Joe Morgan, Andre Dawson and Barry Bonds.
        After his playing career, Pinson, who was born in Memphis and grew up in Oakland, served as a batting coach for Seattle, the Chicago White Sox and Detroit, and was a minor league hitting coordinator for the Mets. He was a first-base and outfielders' coach for the Florida Marlins in 1993 and 1994.
        Pinson is survived by three daughters, Valerie Pinson Strain, Kimberly Letherman and Renee Pinson; a son, Vada Pinson 3d, and four grandchildren.
