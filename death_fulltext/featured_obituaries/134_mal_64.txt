        Charlie Milhaupt, vice president of the Gilman Paper Company and a former film producer, died on March 13 at his home in Manhattan. He was 48.
        The cause was AIDS, said Mark McDonald, a friend.
        Mr. Milhaupt joined the company in 1990 and was also a member of the board of the Howard Gilman Foundation, where he helped to form the White Oak Project with Mikhail Baryshnikov that year. Mr. Milhaupt encouraged the foundation to give money to dance in general and to theater and medical research, particularly research on the causes of heart disease and AIDS.
        During the 1970's Mr. Milhaupt worked in the film industry in Los Angeles, where he served as a producer on ''Soldier's Story,'' ''Iceman'' and ''Agnes of God.'' He was the producer for two Disney films,  ''Foreign Exchange'' and ''Parent Trap 3.''
        Mr. Milhaupt was also a collector, mainly of art and furniture from the 1940's and 50's. His former home in Los Angeles, designed by Richard Neutra, and his home in Greenwich Village were the subject of a piece in Elle magazine in 1994. Speaking of his New York home, Mr. Milhaupt, a fan of films from the 1930's and 40's, told the interviewer: ''I didn't ask the realtor to find me an apartment like the one in 'The Awful Truth' with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, but there's definitely a link.''
        Mr. Milhaupt is survived by his mother, Mary Thomas of Portland, Ore.; three sisters, Gretchen Milhaupt of Manhattan, Merrimee Moffit of Albuquerque, N.M., and Ann Bottinelli of Portland, and a brother, Tony, also of Portland.
