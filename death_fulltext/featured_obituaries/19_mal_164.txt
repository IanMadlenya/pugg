        In 1967, Dr. Woolfson was the major figure in merging two organizations with parallel visions into the Bronx Museum of Art. He is credited with revising the Bronx Council on the Arts, of which he was president for several years. He is also credited with revitalizing the Bronx Society of Science and Letters, of which he was president for nine years.
        Earlier in his career, he was a member of Local 2 of the Teachers Union, and helped get its charter from the American Federation of Teachers. The Teachers Union became the United Federation of Teachers.
        At age 70, Dr. Woolfson, a genial and portly man who was once a financial writer for The Herald Tribune, earned a doctorate in philosophy from Sarasota University in Sarasota, Fla.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Edith Levine; a daughter, Susan Calkin of St. Helena, Calif., and two grandchildren.
