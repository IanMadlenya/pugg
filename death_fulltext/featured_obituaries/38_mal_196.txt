        Dr. Nasrollah S. Fatemi, director emeritus of the Graduate Institute of International Studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University and the author of books on subjects ranging from international economics to poetry, died of a heart attack on Friday at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Saddle River, N.J.
        Dr. Fatemi, who was born in Nain, Persia, was a mayor, governor and member of Parliament after the country became Iran. He came to the United States in 1946 and served as Iran's delegate to the United Nations in 1952 and 1953.
        He lectured at Princeton from 1950 to 1955 and then became a professor at Fairleigh Dickinson. He was appointed chairman of the social sciences department in 1960, dean of the graduate school in 1965 and director of the graduate institute, which he founded, in 1971. He retired in 1981.
        Among the books he wrote were ''While the United States Slept'' (Cornwall, 1981), ''Diplomatic History of Persia'' (Whittier, 1951), ''Oil Diplomacy'' (Whittier, 1954), ''The Dollar Crisis'' (Fairleigh Dickinson Univeristy Press, 1964) and ''Multinational Corporations: Problems and Prospects'' (A. S. Barnes, 1975). The first volume of his projected four-volume autobiography, ''Reflections on the Time of Disillusion,'' was published recently by Mellioun.
        Dr. Fatemi was Mayor of Shiraz from 1939 to 1941, Governor-General of the Fars province from 1941 to 1943 and a member of the Iranian Parliament from 1943 to 1947. He represented Iran at several international conferences after World War II.
        He was a graduate of Stuart Memorial College in Iran and received a master's degree from Columbia University and a doctorate from the New School for Social Research.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Shayesteh Ostovar; three sons, Faramarz, of Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.; Fairborz, of Washington, and Farivar, of Suffern, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
