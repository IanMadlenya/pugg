        Louis Menk, an architectural consultant and a former assistant dean of the New York University School of Architecture, died in his sleep Friday at his home in Southfield, Mich. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Menk, who specialized in the administration of construction contracts, was a vice president of Albert Kahn Associates, an architectural and engineering firm based in Detroit. He was associated with the firm from 1942 to 1977, also serving as its treasurer and a member of its board of directors. He retired in 1977, continuing as a consultant.
        In 1969 he was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects. Two years later, he received the Michigan Society of Architects' gold medal award for ''leadership and contribution to the profession and the community.''
        From 1938 to 1940, Mr. Menk was assistant dean of N.Y.U.'s School of Architecture and Allied Arts, which closed in 1941.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Olga Raskind; two sisters, Mary Weisstein, of Manhattan, and Jeanette Epstein, of Brooklyn; two daughters, Doris Lunsky, of Southfield, and France Menk, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
