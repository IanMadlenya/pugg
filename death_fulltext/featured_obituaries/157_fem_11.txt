        Olgita DeCastro, who performed and recorded with her famous singing cousins, the DeCastro Sisters, for more than 30 years, died on Monday at her home in Las Vegas. She was 65.
        The cause was an asthma attack, said her publicity agents, Alan Eichler Associates.
        Ms. DeCastro, who was born in Los Angeles, joined the DeCastro trio in the 1960's, filling in when needed for one or another of her cousins -- Peggy, Cherie and Babette -- and later becoming a permanent member of the ensemble when Babette DeCastro retired.
        The original trio had their breakthrough hit in 1954, with ''Teach Me Tonight,'' by Sammy Cahn and Gene de Paul. The sisters came to the United States from Cuba in 1947 and appeared that year in the film ''Copacabana'' with Carmen Miranda and Groucho Marx.
        Ms. DeCastro is survived by a brother, Robert, of Miami.
