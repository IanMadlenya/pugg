        Richard Rouilard, a prominent gay-rights advocate and a former editor in chief of The Advocate, a nationally distributed gay and lesbian news magazine, died yesterday at his home in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 43.
        The cause of death was complications from AIDS, said Mary McNamara, a family  friend.
        Torie Osborn, former executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said yesterday: "He was both a political leader and a cultural leader. He  put gay journalism on the mainstream map." He was a founder of the Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
        Mr. Rouilard attended Upsala College in New Jersey and South Texas College of Law in Houston. In 1979, he was a co-founder of the National Gay Rights Advocates, the first public interest law firm for gay people in the United States.
        Mr. Rouilard (pronounced rue-LARD) started his writing career in Los Angeles  in 1981, writing a society column called "Bunny Mars" for several local newspapers and magazines. He later worked as an editor, reporter or consultant for several West Coast publications, including LA Style magazine, The Los Angeles Herald Examiner, Buzz magazine and The Los Angeles Times Magazine.
        He made his journalistic mark, though, as editor in chief of The Advocate, a  post he held from 1990 to 1992. In that job, he got the attention of mainstream media with investigative articles about homosexual life and problems.
        He also designed a self-contained removable section to consolidate sexually explicit advertisements and switched the magazine to high-quality paper, steps that magazine-industry experts credited with improving The Advocate's circulation and advertising base.
        Mr. Rouilard was born to a French flight attendant who abandoned him as an infant. He was reared by an adoptive family in Linden, N.J.
        He is survived by his companion, Bob Cohen of West Hollywood, and a sister, Beth Olsmit of Coral Springs, Fla.
