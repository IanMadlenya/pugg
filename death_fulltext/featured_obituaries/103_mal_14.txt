        Howard Henry Peckham, a historian of colonial and revolutionary America and an authority on rare Americana, died on July 6 at the Carolina Village retirement center in Hendersonville, N.C. He was 84 and had retired to Hendersonville in 1977.
        His death was reported this week by the University of Michigan, where he was the second director of the Clements Library, an important center for the documentation and study of the country's early history.
        Mr. Peckham was curator of manuscripts for the library from 1935 to 1945 and director and a professor of history from 1953 until his retirement. As curator, he organized the wealth of papers left by British officials and army commanders that the library had been acquiring. As director, he greatly expanded the library's colonial and revolutionary collections.
        Building on the original gift of William Lawrence Clements, a Michigan industrialist and university alumnus and trustee, he acquired manuscripts for the early national, antebellum and Civil War periods. As director, he guided many writers' research in the archives at the library.
        He also published a number of books, many of which remain in print, including "Pontiac and the Indian Uprising" (Princeton University Press, 1948), which used previously unused documents to provide a new biography of the Ottawa war chief.
        Another project, "The Toll of Independence" (University of Chicago Press, 1974), counted American war casualties, putting the number a good deal higher than previously thought, with 25,000 military deaths out of a population of a mere three million people.
        Mr. Peckham was born in Lowell, Mich., and received his B.A. and M.A. degrees at the University of Michigan.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Dorothy Koth Peckham; a son, Stephen, of Lexington, Ky.; a daughter, Angela Hewett of Philadelphia; and three grandchildren.
