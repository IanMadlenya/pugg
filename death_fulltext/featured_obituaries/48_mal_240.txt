        Clifford E. Charlesworth, a physicist who was a flight director for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on several space missions, including the first moon landing, died Saturday at his home in Friendsworth, Tex. He was 59 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his daughter, Leslie Lousma of Kentwood, Mich.
        Mr. Charlesworth was flight director for the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston from 1962 to 1970 and directed several Gemini and Apollo missions, including the Apollo 11 space mission in 1969 that landed the first men on the moon. He was also flight director for Apollo 8, a mission that orbited the moon; for Gemini 11, a mission that docked with an Agena satellite, and for Gemini 12, in which Maj. Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. performed a two-hour spacewalk. All three were in 1966.
        From 1970 through 1972, Mr. Charlesworth was manager of the space agency's extended earth observations mission and its earth resources program. He then was deputy manager of the shuttle payload integration and development program, working with potential nonmilitary users of the shuttle, and as deputy director of the Johnson Space Center in Houston. He also served as director of space operations before he retired.
        Born Nov. 29, 1931, in Redwing, Minn., Mr. Charlesworth was reared in Jackson, Miss., and graduated from Mississippi College in 1958 with a degree in physics. He then worked as a civilian scientist for the Navy. He also worked briefly on the Army's Pershing Missile program before joining NASA in 1962.
        He was a member of the American Astronautical Society and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and was the recipient of numerous awards, including the distinguished service award from NASA in 1983.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, David, of Manvel, Tex.; his mother, Cecelia, and a sister, Nancy Watkins, both of Franklin, Tenn.
