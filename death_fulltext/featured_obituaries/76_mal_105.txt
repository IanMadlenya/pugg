        Lord Kenyon, the chairman of the National Portrait Gallery in London from 1966 to 1988, died last Monday in Gredington, his family seat in Shropshire in western England, the British press has reported. He was 75..
        Lloyd Tyrell-Kenyon, the fifth Baron Kenyon, was also the president of the National Museum of Wales from 1952 to 1957 and a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1953 to 1988.
        As the chairman of the National Gallery, Lord Kenyon was credited with guiding its growth in size and prestige, until, in the words of the English newspaper The Independent, it had "become one of the great national galleries, with a distinct identity of its own."
        In addition, as befitted a descendent of the peer who gave money for the founding of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, he was president of the University College of North Wales at Bangor from 1947 to 1982.
        He was born in 1917, inherited his title from his father in 1927 and was educated at Eton and, after army service in World War II, at Magdalene College, Cambridge.
        Lord Kenyon is survived by his wife of 47 years, the former Leila Mary Cookson, two sons and a daughter.
