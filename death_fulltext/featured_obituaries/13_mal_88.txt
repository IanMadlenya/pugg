        Thomas M. Peters, a former Arizona state legislator who succeeded in several businesses and then turned his attention to charities for children, died Tuesday at the Venice (Fla.) Hospital. He was 99 years old.
        Mr. Peters was a resident of Bernardsville, N.J., and was vacationing in Florida when he died.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Peters graduated from Yale University in 1912. In May 1919, he bought a ranch in Nogales, Ariz. He remained a resident of that state for 18 years, and was several times elected to the Arizona House of Representatives. He was later appointed to fill an unexpired term as a state senator.
        On returning to New York, Mr. Peters became involved in several companies, including the Mutual Chemical Company of America, which was sold to the Allied Chemical Corporation about 25 years ago.
        After selling his interest in several companies, Mr. Peters - who was already president of the Sheltering Arms Children's Service, a foster-care agency - helped found the Windham Children's Service.
        Mr. Peters is survived by his wife, Marion; a daughter, Marion Stine, and a grandson, Thomas, all of Bernardsville.
        A memorial service is scheduled for 2 P.M. Saturday at the Episcopal Church of St. John on the Mountain in Bernardsville.
