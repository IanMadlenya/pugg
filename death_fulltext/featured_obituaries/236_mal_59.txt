        Jack Banta, whose superb relief stint as a sidearming rookie right-hander helped propel the Brooklyn Dodgers to the 1949 National League pennant on the season's final day, died last Sunday in Hutchinson, Kan. He was 81.
        The cause was cardiovascular disease, said his son, Michael.
        On the final Sunday of the 1949 season, the Dodgers played the Phillies at Philadelphia and were one game ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals. Banta relieved in the sixth inning with two out and the Dodgers ahead by 7-6. He yielded a run-scoring single that tied the score but then held the Phillies scoreless on only one more hit as the Dodgers won, 9-7, in 10 innings.
        After the game, Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese said that Banta had a blister on the middle finger of his right hand, and that soon after he began pitching, his fingernail broke the blister.
        Banta was 10-6 that season, and Branch Rickey, the Dodgers' general manager, said the following February that he was ''close to becoming a great pitcher.'' But Banta hurt his shoulder, went 4-4 in 1950 and never pitched in the majors after that.
        In addition to his son, Michael, of Caledonia, Ill., Banta is survived by his wife, Jackie; his daughters, Kristie Empey, of Parker, Colo., and Lee Ann Tucker, of Greenwood, Ind.; four grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
