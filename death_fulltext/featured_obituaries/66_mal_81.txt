        Philip H. Cohen, a retired radio and television producer and advertising executive, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Cohen started producing radio shows for the United States Department of the Interior soon after he graduated from Harvard in 1932. His programs included a documentary series, "The World Is Yours," done with the Smithsonian Institution, that drew up to 14,000 letters a week in fan mail.
        In 1936, he helped to create New York University's Radio Workshop, which evolved into the School of Broadcasting. Wartime Radio Station
        During World War II, he worked for the Office of War Information as the director of the American radio station for Europe that broadcast Allied news and instructions to underground forces in occupied countries.
        After the war, Mr. Cohen served two years as the director of daytime radio programming for Ruthrauff & Ryan, a Manhattan advertising agency, where he supervised its soap operas, news and game shows. Advertising agencies often directly produced shows in those days.
        In 1946, he switched to the Sullivan, Stauffer, Colwell & Bayles agency as its director of programs for both radio and the new medium of television. He worked with leading entertainers, including Garry Moore, Jack Benny, Bert Parks and Dinah Shore. Born in Honolulu
        From 1964 until his retirement in 1976, he was the advertising director of the American Tobacco Company.
        Mr. Cohen was born in Honolulu, the son of a career Army officer, and grew up at several military posts, including in Panama and Sandy Hook, N.J.
        His marriage to Henriette Herz ended in divorce, and his second wife, the former Nina Vitale Elms, died last year.
        Surviving are his two sons, Philip, of Wakefield, Quebec, and William, of Ashland, Ore.; two stepsons, Jay Elms of Augusta, Ga., and Anthony Elms of Fairfield, Conn., and two grandsons.
