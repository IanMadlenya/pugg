        Arthur R. Weckel, who was a test engineer and a vice president at the former Sperry Gyroscope Company, died on Jan. 27 at Pennswood Village, a retirement community in Newtown, Pa. He was 87 and a former resident of Yardley, Pa.
        His death was announced by the Charles F. Swartz Funeral Home in Newtown.
        Mr. Weckel joined Sperry Gyroscope in 1934 as a technician and field-tested most of the company's innovations early in his career. In 1939, when he was 33 years old, he piloted an experimental passenger plane from Newark to Allentown, Pa., and back after only 40 hours of practice in a flight trainer on the ground. He was testing Sperry's new radio beacon, "Flight-ray," requiring him to fly with the windshield blacked out.
        Mr. Weckel became a vice president and general sales manager for Sperry's special missile systems division in 1954 and retired in 1966 as vice president of group operations. Sperry became part of the merger that created the Unisys Corporation in 1986.
        After he left Sperry, Mr. Weckel took a comparable position at DaLaval Turbine Inc. of Trenton, retiring for the second time in 1970.
        He was born in Grand Junction, Colo., and earned an electrical engineering degree at Kansas State University.
        Mr. Weckel is survived by his wife, Rachel; two sons, George, of Stockton, N.J., and Frederic, of Cincinnati, and four grandchildren.
