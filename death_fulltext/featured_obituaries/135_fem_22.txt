        Anna Kaskas, a contralto who had an association with the Metropolitan Opera from 1936 to 1950, died on March 19 at her home in Wellsboro, Pa. She was 91.
        At the Met, Ms. Kaskas was valued as a dependable house contralto for smaller roles like Maddalena in ''Rigoletto,'' and the nurse in ''Boris Godunov.'' There were some novelties along the way, including the role of Mercurius in Bach's secular cantata ''Phoebus and Pan,'' which the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham dressed up for the stage as part of a double bill when he made his company debut in 1942.
        Born in Richfield, Conn., in 1907 to Lithuanian parents, Ms. Kaskas  studied at the Hartford Conservatory, then finished her education in Lithuania and Italy. In 1936 she was a co-winner of the Met's Auditions of the Air, which led to her joining the company.
        When she left the Met in 1950, she toured as a recitalist for two years, then devoted herself to teaching, first at Indiana University, then Florida State University and, starting in 1959, the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she remained until 1974, when she retired.
        In 1942 she married Anthony J. Lokot Jr., who died in 1991. She is survived by a son, Anthony, of Pittsford, N.Y.; a granddaugther, and a sister.
