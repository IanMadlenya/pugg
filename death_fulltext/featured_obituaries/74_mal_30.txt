        Paul D. Zimmerman, a journalist and screenwriter, died on March 2 at the Medical Center at Princeton, N.J. He was 54.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his wife, Barbara.
        Mr. Zimmerman, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Scarsdale High School and Amherst College. He did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley, at Columbia University and at the Sorbonne.
        Mr. Zimmerman won a British Academy Award for his screenplay for "The King of Comedy," a 1983 film directed by Martin Scorsese. He contributed to several other films and television programs, including "Lovers and Liars," "Consuming Passions" and "Sesame Street."
        Early in his career, he was on the staff of Newsweek magazine.
        Mr. Zimmerman's books included two collaborations with Dick Schaap -- "The Year the Mets Lost Last Place" and "The Open Man," a diary kept by the New York Knicks player Dave DeBusschere -- and "The Marx Brothers at the Movies," which he wrote with Burt Goldblatt.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Zimmerman is survived by a son, Ian, and a daughter, Kirsten, both of New York City, and a foster son, Toan Van Tu of Silver Springs, Md.
