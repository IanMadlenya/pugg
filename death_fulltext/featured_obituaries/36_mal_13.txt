        Solomon Birnbaum, a Jewish scholar credited with establishing the authenticity and age of the Dead Sea Scrolls, died here on Thursday. He was 98 years old.
        Mr. Birnbaum, who was born in Vienna, was an expert in ancient Jewish languages and wrote two books on Hebrew and Yiddish and dozens of articles and research papers.
        The scrolls, discovered in caves near the Dead Sea beginning in 1947, include the oldest known manuscripts of the Bible. Mr. Birnbaum analyzed the grammar and script to date them from the third century B.C. to A.D. 68, the same period later established by carbon-dating techniques.
        The University of Hamburg created a teaching position for Mr. Birnbaum in the field of Jewish studies in 1922. He fled to England in 1933 when Hitler came to power and taught at the University of London until his retirement in 1957. He moved to Canada in 1970.
