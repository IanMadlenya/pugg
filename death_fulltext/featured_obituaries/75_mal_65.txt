        Don Clay, an interior designer in Manhattan, died on Monday at the Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 46.
        The cause of death was AIDS, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Clay specialized in architectural designs and furniture with an eclectic style. He taught interior design at the Parsons School of Design from 1981 to 1987.
        His clients included Diane Von Furstenberg, Tom Wolfe, Jamaica Kincaid, Raul Julia and the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.
        Mr. Clay lived in Greenwich Village, where he served as a member of Community Board 2 and as the director of the Christmas lighting of historic Renwick Row.
        The son of a career U.S. Army officer, Mr. Clay grew up in Europe and Asia and was influenced by the architecture of both continents. As an undergraduate at Franklin and Marshall College, he built bookcases for himself, which led to his later work in carpentry, cabinetmaking and design.
        Surviving are his parents, Lora and William, of Huntsville, Ala.; two sisters, Helen Magidson of Atlanta and Nancy Bosco of Huntsville, and a brother, Richard, of Huntsville.
