        After having served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army in the war, Mr. Breck was a member of the American financial staff at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In the mid-1920's he served with the Dawes Commission, dealing with reparations payments to the Allies by Germany.
        A California native and a 1914 graduate of the University of California, he joined the investment banking firm of J. W. Selgman & Company in 1926, eventually becoming a partner and also holding several posts in corporate finance.
        Mr. Breck is survived by his son, Henry Reynolds Breck of New York.
