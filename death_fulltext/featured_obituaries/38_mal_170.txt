        Herman Katz, a former New York City Clerk and a former Assemblyman from the Yorkville section of Manhattan, died on Wednesday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan and Katonah, N.Y.
        Mr. Katz was appointed city clerk in 1958. He resigned under pressure in 1974.  He was the first city clerk in memory to keep the office open at night, on Wednesdays, so that people who worked could obtain marriage licenses. His work included performing marriages and certifying City Council actions to the Mayor and vice versa. Not a man to stand on ceremony, Mr. Katz issued a marriage license to Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. in 1965 and said, ''You owe me 4 bucks, Mr. Mayor.''
        He resigned after the Investigation Department had found payroll irregularities in his office. A grand jury indicted Mr. Katz in 1975 on charges of official misconduct, but he was never prosecuted. The charges were dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired.
        David N. Dinkins succeeded Mr. Katz in 1975 on the recommendation of Mayor Abraham D. Beame.
        Mr. Katz was born on the Lower East Side, the son of immigrant parents. His father was a tailor. Mr. Katz attended the High School of Commerce and graduated from City College in 1922. He received a degree from Columbia Law School in 1925. Mr. Katz was active in Democratic politics and in 1948 was elected to the first of five terms as Assemblyman.
        Surviving is his wife, the former Selma Drellish.
