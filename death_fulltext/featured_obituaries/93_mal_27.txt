        Mason Wiley, 39, an author and freelance writer, died on Friday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of AIDS, said his companion, Gilbert Cole.
        Mr. Wiley was a co-author, with Damian Bona, of "Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards" (Ballantine) and one of four authors of "The Official Preppy Handbook" (Workman Publishing).
        In addition to Mr. Cole, he is survived by his parents, Robert and Margaret Wiley of Rocky Mount, N.C., and two sisters, Margo Wiley Bennett of Durham, N.C., and Helen Wiley of New York City.
