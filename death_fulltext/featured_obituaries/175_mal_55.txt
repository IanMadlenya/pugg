        Prince Albert Taylor Jr., a retired United Methodist bishop who was the first black president of the Council of Bishops of the Methodist Church, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Somers Point, N.J. He was 94 and lived in Ocean City, N.J.
        He was bishop of New Jersey when he was elected the council president, a post he held in 1965 and 1966, when the Methodist Church had about 10 million members worldwide.
        The United Methodist Church was formed in 1968 by the merger of the Methodist Church with the Evangelical United Brethren, a Protestant group.
        When he was assigned to be bishop of New Jersey, in 1964, he was the first black Methodist bishop of a predominantly white area. In 1967, with rioting in Newark, Gov. Richard J. Hughes named him to a commission on civil disorders. He retired as bishop of New Jersey in 1976.
        After being ordained an elder, serving as a pastor in North Carolina and New York City and holding teaching posts, he was elected a bishop in 1956. From then to 1964 he was the Methodist bishop of the region of Monrovia, Liberia. In those years, he trained members of the Liberian clergy to become leaders.
        He was born in Hennessey, Okla. The degrees he held included a master's degree from Union Theological Seminary and a doctorate in education from New York University.
        Bishop Taylor, whose wife, the former Annie Belle Thaxton, is dead, is survived by a daughter, Isabella Taylor Jenkins of Atlanta; two brothers, Wendell P., of Jackson, Miss., and Priestly L., of Queens, and three sisters, Virgia Bartee of Cannon, Miss., Juanita James of Manhattan and Susie B. Cameron of St. Louis.
