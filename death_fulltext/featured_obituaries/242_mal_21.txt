        John J. McCabe, who held top executive positions at five newspapers, including The New York Times, and also served in the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch, died on Wednesday at his home in Medford, Mass. He was 78.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his son John Jr. said.
        Mr. McCabe was The Times's senior vice president in charge of business operations, advertising, circulation, marketing and promotion from 1972 to 1978. He started as a clerk in the advertising department in 1949 and was later general accounting manager, controller and vice president for finance.
        After he left The Times, Mr. McCabe joined the Koch administration as deputy director of the Office of Operations, which measures the performance of city agencies.
        Mr. McCabe was later general manager of The Bulletin in Philadelphia; executive vice president and general manager of two Connecticut newspapers, Greenwich Time and The Advocate in Stamford, and, from 1983 to 1989, chief operating officer of The Los Angeles Herald-Examiner.
        John James McCabe was born in the Bronx and received a bachelor's degree in philosophy from St. Joseph's Seminary in Dunwoodie, N.Y., in 1949.
        Mr. McCabe's first marriage, to the former Margaret Grunenberg, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, the former Joanny Rodriguez, a former news assistant at The Times; his son John, of Washington; another son, James, of Manhattan; four daughters, Peggy McCabe of St. Petersburg, Fla.; Maryellen Mariani of Seminole, Fla.; Agnes McCabe of Oldsmar, Fla.; and Natalie Zwerger of the Bronx; and a granddaughter.
