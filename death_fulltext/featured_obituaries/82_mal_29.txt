        John M. van Heusen Jr., a member of the family that established the Van Heusen shirt company, died Oct. 19 at his home in Clearwater, Fla. He was 96.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said his daughter, Emily Halsey.
        After service in the United States Navy during World War I, Mr. van Heusen entered the family clothing business. His father was credited with developing the soft collar, an innovation that led to the founding of the shirt company.
        He is survived by his second wife, Sally Maria van Heusen of Clearwater; his daughter, Emily Halsey of Southampton, L.I.; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
