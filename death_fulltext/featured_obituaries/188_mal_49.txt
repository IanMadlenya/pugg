        Sidney Epstein, a Washington journalist who covered or supervised coverage of news events including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the 1968 riots that devastated large parts of Washington, died on Sunday in Rockville, Md. He was 81 and had Alzheimer's disease, said his nephew Jerry Ceppos.
        Mr. Epstein began work at The Washington Herald in 1937, served in World War II and then returned to the paper, rising to city editor. When the paper, then The Times-Herald, was sold to The Washington Post in 1954, he joined The Washington Star. When it closed in 1981, he was its editor and associate publisher.
        His first marriage, to Mary Allbritain, ended in divorce. His second wife, Eleni Sakes Epstein, died in 1991.
        He is survived by a daughter, Diane Morales, of Collierville, Tenn., and a granddaughter.
