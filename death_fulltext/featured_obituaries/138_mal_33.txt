        Bruce M. Galphin, executive director of the international wine competition in Atlanta and a former writer for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Washington Post, died on Monday at Brian Center in Canton, Ga. He was 65 and lived in Atlanta.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered last month, The Journal-Constitution reported.
        The Atlanta Wine Summit he directed was started in 1982, and has grown into the largest such international event this side of the Atlantic.
        Mr. Galphin was a reporter for The Washington Post and attended Harvard University in 1962 as a Nieman Fellow in journalism. He was also a former managing editor of Atlanta Magazine.
        He is survived by a half-brother, Gregory Galphin of Jacksonville, Ga.
