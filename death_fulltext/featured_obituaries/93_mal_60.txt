        Philip J. McCarthy, an expert in economic and social statistics who helped develop the more sophisticated polling and sampling techniques that came into use after World War II, died on Oct. 10 at Tompkins Community Hospital in Ithaca, N.Y., where he lived. He was 76 and also lived on Cushing's Island, Me.
        The cause was pneumonia, a family member said.
        A former chairman of the Statistics Department of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, he was among statisticians who de-emphasized the use of government reports of compiled data in favor of obtaining more representative information through polling and other methods.
        He was one of the experts who revised the consumer price index in the 1950's and acted as consultants on refining data at such organizations as the National Center for Health Statistics, the Department of Justice and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.
        Dr. McCarthy joined Cornell in 1948. He continued his research and writing as professor emeritus after his retirement in 1988.
        He received an undergraduate degree from Cornell in 1939 and a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University in 1947.
        His first wife, the former Mary Ann Aselin, died in 1967.
        Among survivors are his wife, Jane A. L. McCarthy; a son, Michael, of Baltimore; three daughters, Nancy Valk of Baltimore, Rita Graves of Ithaca and Kathryn, of Boston; a stepson, Stephen Lisberger of San Francisco; three stepdaughters, Lin Lisberger of Gordon, Me., Jody Lisberger of Boston and Emily Vitale of Manhattan, and 12 grandchildren.
