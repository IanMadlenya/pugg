        Jean Adrien Francois Lecanuet, a prominent centrist politician who ran against President Charles de Gaulle in 1965 and forced him into a runoff, died early today at his home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. He was 72.
        His colleagues said he had been fighting cancer for several years.
        Mr. Lecanuet was a little-known figure from Normandy when he ran for the presidency and, although winning only 15.6 percent of the vote, he infuriated Gaullists by helping to force the President into a runoff against the Socialist candidate, Francois Mitterrand.
        Mr. Lecanuet later emerged as an influential political moderate, first describing himself as a social democrat and later becoming a founder of the center-right Union for French Democracy, headed by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
        In Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's presidency, Mr. Lecanuet served as Justice Minister from 1974 to 1976 under Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and as Minister for Territorial Affairs in 1976 and 1977 under Prime Minister Raymond Barre. Mr. Lecanuet, a member of the French Senate at his death, had also been the Mayor of Rouen, in Normandy, since 1968.
        In recent years, Mr. Lecanuet was best known for his advocacy of European unity, campaigning as recently as last summer to promote France's ratification of a treaty on European union. Many tributes today focused on his commitment to the European cause.
        He is survived by his second wife, Jacqueline, and three children from his first marriage.
