        Bernard Lefkowitz, a journalist, author and teacher who used storytelling to illuminate complex social issues, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer of the thymus gland, said his wife, Rebecca Aikman.
        Mr. Lefkowitz wrote four books, including ''Our Guys: The Glen Ridge Rape and the Secret Life of the Perfect Suburb,'' which explored the impact of the gang rape of a mentally disabled girl by a group of popular high school students in the New Jersey community of Glen Ridge in 1989.
        Reviewing the book in The New York Times, the novelist Russell Banks called it ''an extraordinary chronicle'' that ''provides ample evidence that in Glen Ridge and elsewhere, affluent, white, suburban Americans (which nowadays means most Americans who vote) have not reckoned with the sexual violence that is inflicted regularly by their male children against their female children.''
        The book, which was made into a television movie, has had a particularly powerful influence in Glen Ridge, where it was made required reading for teachers at the high school.
        Mr. Lefkowitz, a New York native who graduated from City College, was a reporter and editor at The New York Post in the 1960's, and left to serve briefly in the Peace Corps before becoming an author.
        His first book was ''The Victims,'' co-written with Kenneth Gross, which was published in 1969. It examined the notorious so-called career-girl murders, of Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert on the Upper East Side in 1963, for which the wrong man -- a black youth -- was initially imprisoned. The book won an Edgar Award.
        Mr. Lefkowitz's other books were ''Breaktime: Living Without Work in a Nine-to-Five World,'' published in 1980, and ''Tough Change: Growing up on Your Own in America,'' published in 1987.
        He also taught nonfiction writing and journalism.
        He is survived by Ms. Aikman.
