        Brendan Corish, former leader of the Irish Labor Party and Deputy Prime Minister from 1973 to 1977, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Wexford, his family said. He was 71 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed. Mr. Corish was a Socialist who first went to Parliament in 1945 and succeeded William Norton as Labor Party leader in 1960.
        In the 1973 general election, Labor sided with the right-wing Fine Gael Party to form a coalition that narrowly defeated Fianna Fail, which had held power without a break since 1957. Liam Cosgrave, the Fine Gael leader, became Prime Minister and Mr. Corish was Minister of Health and Social Welfare.
        The coalition lasted four years, until 1977. Mr. Cosgrave and Mr. Corish both resigned their party leaderships after that.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, and two children.
