        Lord Delfont, a Russian immigrant who made his fortune in show business and produced numerous plays and musicals in London and New York, including "Funny Girl" on Broadway, died on Thursday at his home in Angmering, England. He was 84.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his nephew, Ian Freeman.
        Bernard Delfont became the Baron of Stepney in 1976. As Bernard Winogradsky, he had come to Britain with his parents and his older brother, who would become  the impresario Lew Grade and also a peer, when he was 3. The family lived in one room over a shop in London's East End.
        He left school at 12, becoming a professional dancer using the stage name Delfont. He later became a theatrical agent. His first big break came when he brought the Folies-Bergere revue from Paris to London in the late 1940's. He was subsequently involved in such productions as "The Roar of the Greasepaint, the Smell of the Crowd," "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off," "Funny Girl" and "Sizwe Bansi Is Dead."
        In 1979, Lord Delfont branched into films and became the chief executive of EMI Ltd. In 1983, he founded the First Leisure Corporation, a company with interests in bowling alleys, discos and theaters.
        He is survived by his wife, Lady Delfont, and their children Susan, Jennifer  and David.
