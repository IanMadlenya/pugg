        The Rev. Robert Banome, a Roman Catholic priest who fought drug addiction and urban decay in blighted neighborhoods of the South Bronx, died on Monday. He was 62.
        He died in the rectory at St. Anthony's Church, where he was pastor. The cause of death was cancer, said Sandra Ruiz Butter, who took over Father Banome's duties as acting director of the Tremont Commonwealth Council in June when his illness worsened.
        For decades, Father Banome worked to reverse neighborhood deterioration and secure social welfare services for the poor in his area. He was bilingual and became a trusted spokesman for his parishioners' needs.
        He was pastor of St. Joseph's Church in the East Tremont section for 19 years before he became pastor of St. Anthony's in 1982.
        His efforts led to the founding of the Fordham-Tremont Community Mental Health Program, and he was the founder and first director of the Tremont Community Council, which offered a health program, a center for the elderly and recreation and tutoring programs for youth.
        He also created the Vocational Instruction Project, developing it from a counseling program for 165 individuals into a drug treatment and rehabilitation service for 1,000 recovering addicts.
        He is survived by his sister, Rose Boccia, of Brooklyn, and two brothers, Anthony, of Brooklyn, and Joseph, of Queens.
