        Mr. O'Farrell, who played for the Chicago Cubs, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Cincinnati Reds and the New York Giants, also served as manager in St. Louis (1927) and Cincinnati (1934). He had a career batting average of .273, but was most renowned for throwing out Babe Ruth attempting to steal second base in the ninth inning of the seventh game of the 1926 World Series. The play ended the Series, with the Cardinals beating the Yankees.
