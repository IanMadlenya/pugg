        Egmont Sonderling, the founder and chief executive of a radio and television company bearing his name, died on July 22 at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center in Miami. Mr. Sonderling, a resident of Bal Harbour, Fla., was 91.
        Mr. Sonderling emigrated to the United States from Germany in 1923. After working in various fields, he began his career in the broadcasting industry as a radio announcer. He started the Sonderling Broadcasting Corporation in 1950 with the radio station WOPA in Oak Park, Ill. At its peak, Sonderling Broadcasting owned 11 radio stations in major markets, including New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Memphis; the television station WAST-TV, which is the CBS affiliate in Albany, and an independent chain of theaters in New York and New England with a total of 55 movie screens.
        In 1980, Sonderling Broadcasting was acquired by Viacom Inc. with the exception of two radio stations in Chicago and the movie theaters, which were retained by Mr. Sonderling. In 1987, he sold the stations and the theaters and retired.
        He is survived by his wife, Marjorie Serralles Sonderling of Bal Harbour; a son, Roy Sonderling of Miami; a stepson, Juan E. Serralles of Miami; three stepdaughters, Annik Serralles Wolf of New York, Marjorie E. Serralles Russell of Mishawaka, Ind., and Mary Ann F. Serralles Alonso of New York, and two grandchildren.
