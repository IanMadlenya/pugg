        Harry Goodridge, whose friendship with Andre the seal captivated a wide audience for 25 years, died Wednesday at a hospital here. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Goodridge, a tree surgeon and professional scuba diver, found Andre in 1961 as a pup, apparently abandoned by its mother.
        In summers, Andre was kept in a floating pen and entertained summer visitors by performing tricks with Mr. Goodridge.
        When Andre was allowed to be free in the winter, his habit of clambering aboard and sinking anchored dinghies annoyed fishermen, prompting Mr. Goodridge to ship the seal to aquariums in Boston or Mystic, Conn.
        With the end of winter, the seal was released for a swim back up the coast to Rockport that became an annual event.
        Andre died in 1986, after he was sighted with bruises apparently suffered in a fight with another male seal. The 5-foot, 250-pound seal was buried in a pasture behind Mr. Goodridge's home.
        Mr. Goodridge is survived by his wife, Thalice, a son and four daughters.
