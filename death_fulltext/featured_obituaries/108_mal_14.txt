        Dr. Frederick H. King, a cardiologist who established the first cardiac catheterization unit at Mount Sinai Hospital, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.
        Dr. King, who was named a distinguished service professor at Mount Sinai in 1987, first achieved widespread recognition in 1937 as the co-author of a landmark paper identifying the substances that cause elevated blood pressure in  patients with a particular type of vascular tumor. He established Mount Sinai's  catheterization unit in 1948.
        Dr. King was the author of more than 30 professional books and papers, mostly on cardiology. He was also a fellow of the American College of Physicians, a member of the American Academy of Internal Medicine and the New York Academy of Medicine.
        His talents as a physician, researcher and teacher were recognized with the establishment of the Frederick H. King Merit Scholarship at Mount Sinai in 1972; the Samuel C. and Minna L. Dretzin Fellowships in Life Sciences at Brandeis University in 1977 and the Frederick H. King Professorship in Internal Medicine  at New York University Medical center in 1978. Other scholarships in Dr. King's  honor were established at Mount Sinai and at the Columbia University College of  Physicians and Surgeons.
        Dr. King was born in Leeds, England. He attended Columbia College and received his medical degree in 1929 from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He joined the Mount Sinai staff in 1931 and remained with the hospital until he retired from active practice in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Lucile Menz; a daughter, Barbara King Litt of Queens, and two grandchildren.
