        His most recent job title was assistant director of construction code elements for New Jersey's Community Affairs Department.
        Mr. Decker was born in Glen Ridge, N.J. A 1965 graduate of the Syracuse University School of Architecture, he was a private architect before joining the state in the mid-1970's.
