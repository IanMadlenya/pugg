        George Keane, an actor who made his Broadway debut in Maurice Evans's 1940 production of "Hamlet" and went on to win praise in such contemporary works as "Brigadoon" and "The Seven Year Itch," died on Oct. 10 at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 78.
        Mr. Keane was born in Springfield, Mass. He graduated from the City College of New York and then joined the Laboratory Players at Columbia University. He polished his craft by making Talking Book Records for the blind and by acting with a stock company in Brooklyn.
        His big break came when he was cast as Lord Ross in the Evans "Hamlet," in which he did well enough to be cast in two subsequent Evans vehicles, "Henry IV" and "Richard II." He also appeared as Cassio in a production of "Othello" that starred Paul Robeson.
        After serving in the Army in World War II, Mr. Keane returned to Broadway in  1947 in the Lerner and Loewe musical "Brigadoon," playing one of two Americans who stumble upon a mysterious village while visiting Scotland. His role in the Broadway comedy "The Seven Year Itch" followed in 1952. His television credits include a number of appearances on "CBS Playhouse."
        Mr. Keane left acting for the business world in the 1970's, becoming a successful pension adviser and financial planner.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; a son, Jonathan, of Miami Beach, and a grandson.
