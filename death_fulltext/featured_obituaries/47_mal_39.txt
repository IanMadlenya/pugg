        Fred V. Grau, an agronomist who developed a legume that is used widely to prevent soil erosion and beautify highway slopes, died Saturday at Prince George's Community Hospital in Cheverly, Md. He was 88 years old and lived in College Park, Md.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his daughter, Ellen Mentzer of Silver Spring, Md., said.
        Dr. Grau received his doctorate in 1935 at the University of Maryland. He was the founder of Grasslyn Inc. and adapted crownvetch, a perennial that is widely cultivated for its pink flowers and tenacious roots, for commercial use. He also helped develop zoysia varieties that require small amounts of water and fertilizer and are used on athletic fields.
        He was a specialist in turf grasses and from 1945 to 1953 was director of the United States Golf Association Green Section. Dr. Grau was an agricultural extension agent at Pennsylvania State University and was later with the Department of Agriculture's Beltsville Agricultural Research Station of the Department of Agriculture.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, Fred Jr. of State College, Pa.; a sister, Edith Reynolds of Pensacola, Fla., and six grandchildren.
