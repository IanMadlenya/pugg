        Glenn Dobbs, whose passing, running and punting led the University of Tulsa to an unbeaten regular season in 1942 and who later starred for the Brooklyn Dodgers of the fledgling All-America Football Conference, died Tuesday at his home in Tulsa, Okla. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Playing tailback, Dobbs became Tulsa's first all-American, propelling the 1942 team to a 10-0 regular-season record, a No. 4 national ranking and a berth in the Sugar Bowl, in which he threw a touchdown pass in a 14-7 loss to Tennessee.
        Joining the Army Air Forces in 1943, Dobbs starred for the Randolph Field Ramblers of San Antonio, leading them to a 9-1 record. The Ramblers then went to the 1944 Cotton Bowl and held Texas to a 7-7 tie. While serving as a lieutenant, Dobbs was named the College All-Stars' most valuable player in their 24-21 loss to the Chicago Bears, the defending National Football League champions, in the summer of 1944.
        Dobbs was drafted by the Chicago Cardinals of the N.F.L., but spurned them for a better deal with the Dodgers of the newly formed All-America Football Conference in 1946.
        ''My dad told me I could take all my newspaper clippings to the grocery store and they wouldn't buy me a thing,'' Dobbs told The Sunday Oklahoman in 1999. ''He said if I was going to be a professional football player, I better get the best money I could.''
        Dobbs was almost a one-man team for the 1946 football Dodgers, who shared Ebbets Field with their baseball cousins. The Dodgers had a 3-10-1 record, but Dobbs was the league's most valuable player and leader in total offense, with 2,094 yards, and punting, with a 47.8-yard average.
        He was traded to the Los Angeles Dons early in the 1947 season and became one of Southern California's first pro football stars on a team that competed for fans with the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams.
        ''We gave Brooklyn several players and $100,000 cash for Dobbs,'' Marje Everett, daughter of the Dons' owner, Benjamin Lindheimer, and a Dons executive, told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ''He had the first $20,000 salary in pro ball at a time when many N.F.L. players weren't getting $5,000. The first night with Dobbs in the lineup, we drew 83,000 at the Coliseum, and he won it with a 55-yard pass. Some days he earned his salary with the field position he gave us as a punter.''
        Dobbs ran a spread formation invented specifically for him by the Dons' coach, Jimmy Phelan. The backs were on the wings with Dobbs alone behind the center, prepared to run or pass. He again led the league in total offense and punting in 1948.
        Dobbs joined Canada's pro football Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1951 and was named most valuable player in the Canadian western league that season. He became their player-coach in 1952, but was hampered by a knee injury.
        He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.
        Dobbs served as athletic director at Tulsa from 1955 to 1970 and as head football coach from 1961 to 1968, succeeding his brother, Bobby, in that post. His teams of the mid-1960's were known for a passing attack that featured quarterback Jerry Rhome and receiver Howard Twilley.
        Dobbs is survived by his wife, June; two sons, Glenn III, of Owasso, Okla., and Johnny, of Tulsa; three grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
