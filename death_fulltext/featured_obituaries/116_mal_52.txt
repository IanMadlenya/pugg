        David Beretta Jr., former chief executive of Uniroyal, the rubber and chemical products company, died on Monday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was 68 and lived in Jamestown, R.I., near Newport.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Serena.
        Mr. Beretta started at Uniroyal as an engineer in the research division in 1953. After serving in various domestic and Canadian divisions, he was appointed vice president for marketing in 1968, and group vice president in charge of consumer, chemical, industrial and textile operations in 1972. He was named president and chief operating officer in 1974, and chairman and chief executive the following year.
        While he was chief executive, the company weathered a 141-day strike by the United Rubber Workers union. It also began divesting itself of several operations, including its Keds footwear division, its Royal golf equipment company and some latex divisions, to concentrate on chemicals, plastics and rubber products.
        After leaving Uniroyal in 1982, Mr. Beretta took a teaching position as executive in residence at the School of Business Administration of the University of Rhode Island. In 1987, he was hired as president and vice chairman of Amtrol, a manufacturer of fluid-storage tanks and flow equipment. He retired this June.
        Mr. Beretta graduated from the University of Rhode Island in 1949 with a degree in chemical engineering. He served in the Army during the Korean War, then joined Uni royal.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, David 3d, of East Greenwich, R.I., and Norman, of Westport, Conn.; a daughter, Dr. Martha Mainiero of North Kingstown, R.I., and five grandchildren.
