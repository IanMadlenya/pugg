        As a staff writer and financial editor of The Nation from 1938 to 1953, Mr. Hutchinson covered a wide range of political and economic issues and wrote a weekly column, ''Everybody's Business,'' that dealt with developments on Wall Street.
        While at The Nation, Mr. Hutchison also wrote two well-received books, ''Rival Partners: America and Britain in the Postwar World,'' which was published in 1946, and ''The Decline and Fall of British Capitalism,'' which was published in 1950.
        Mr. Hutchison, was born in London on March 3, 1901, and attended the London School of Economics.
        He began his journalistic career as a writer for a Labour Party newspaper, then became a member of the London staff of The New York Herald Tribune. He moved to New York in 1937 and joined the The Nation a year later.
        After his retirement from The Nation in 1953, Mr. Hutchison moved to Durham, Conn., and in the late 1950's became a naturalized American citizen. In 1960, he started a rare-book company, the Durham Book Service, which he ran until 1975.

He is survived by his second wife, the former Helena Ehlers; a son, David of Reno, Nev.; a daughter, Katherine O'Neill of East Lansing, Mich.; a stepdaughter, Diana Anthony of Stamford, Conn.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
