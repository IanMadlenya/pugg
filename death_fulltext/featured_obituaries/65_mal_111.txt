        Fred Robbins, a popular radio personality who went on to become a television host and celebrity interviewer, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 73 years old.
        He died of lymphoma, said his wife, Ingrid.
        Mr. Robbins was born in Baltimore and was a graduate of the University of Baltimore Law School. But he began a career in broadcasting, at a local radio station. In 1942, he joined WHN radio in New York City. He first won wide attention for his snappy patter on the "1280 Club" jazz show on radio station WOV in New York City. He would begin by intoning such slangy verbal riffs as: "Hiya cat, wipe your feet on the mat. Let's slap on the fat and dish out some scat."
        Mr. Robbins became the disk jockey of the "Robbins Nest" radio show on WINS, WABC and WNEW, and the host of television variety and quiz shows. He did interview programs for many radio networks and filmed nearly 100 behind-the-scenes features on movie making, which were broadcast for nearly a decade on "CBS Movie Nights." He was also a feature interviewer for CNN and wrote profiles of celebrities for many magazines.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sisters, Joyce Tannenbaum of Potomac, Md., Floryne Myers and Gail Levy of Baltimore; two daughters, Lorelei Robbins of Atlanta, and Cathy Robbins of New Orleans, and two grandchildren.
