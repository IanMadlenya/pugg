        Jack Mann, a former British hostage in Beirut, died on Sunday. He was 81.
        He had suffered from heart and lung problems for years.
        Mr. Mann was captured on May 12, 1989, by Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim militants and held until Sept. 24, 1991. A veteran of the Battle of Britain, he  was the oldest of the Western hostages held at that time.
        A Royal Air Force fighter pilot in World War II, Mr. Mann was shot down six times.
        In 1946, Mr. Mann and his wife, Sunnie, moved to Lebanon, where he joined Lebanon's Middle East Airlines, later becoming chief pilot. After he retired in  1960, he ran an English-style pub.
        Mrs. Mann recalled their experiences in her book, "Yours to the End."
