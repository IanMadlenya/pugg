        Arthur D. Leidesdorf, a former managing partner in the accounting firm of S. D. Leidesdorf & Company, died on Saturday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 72 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        He died in his sleep, his family said.
        He graduated from Blair Academy and received his accounting degree from the New York University School of Commerce. In World War II, he served as a first lieutenant in the Army.
        Mr. Leidesdorf, a native New Yorker, spent his working career with the firm that had been founded by his father, who died in 1968. The Leidesdorf firm, through a series of mergers, is now part of Ernst & Young. Mr. Leidesdorf retired in 1976.
        Associated with many philanthropic causes, he was a former president of the 92d Steet Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Tova Drieman; a daughter, Nicole, and three sons, Edmond, Samuel 2d and Willliam.
