        Thomas J. Paolino, who for 21 years served on the Rhode Island Supreme Court, died Saturday at his home here. He was 81 years old.  Mr. Paolino, who retired as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in 1977, was the leader of the Republican Party in Rhode Island before he was named to the high court in January 1956.
        In 1952, he was chosen as a Republican national committeeman from Rhode Island and was an assistant floor manager and strategist for Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        On the Supreme Court, Mr. Paolino's specialty was zoning law. In 1960 and 1977, he published two volumes on the history of the court's zoning decisions since its first land-use case in 1926.
