        Abraham J. Isserman, a longtime labor lawyer and a member of the defense team during the cold war conspiracy trial of the top leadership of the American Communist Party, died Friday in a Manhattan nursing home after a series of strokes. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Isserman was one of five lawyers representing 11 members of the Communist Party's national board. The party leaders were convicted in New York City in 1949 of Federal charges of conspiring to teach and advocate the violent overthrow of the Government.
        In appealing the conviction, Mr. Isserman and his colleagues accused the trial judge, Harold R. Medina, of ''judicial misconduct'' and ''favoritism to the prosecution.'' The appeal was denied, and the party leaders went to prison.
        Mr. Isserman and the other defense attorneys, were found in contempt of court after the nine-month trial. As a result, Mr. Isserman spent four months in jail in 1952 and was disbarred from practicing law in New Jersey.
        In 1961 the New Jersey Supreme Court voided his disbarment and ordered his license restored.
        Mr. Isserman is survived by a son, Harold, and three grandchildren.
