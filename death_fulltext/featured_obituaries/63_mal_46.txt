        Dr. W. Paul Havens Jr., a medical professor and researcher of viral hepatitis and cirrhosis, died Monday at his home in Haverford, Pa.
        He was 80 years old and died of heart disease, his family said.
        While serving with the United States Army Medical Corps in World War II, Dr. Havens surveyed hepatitis among Allied troops stationed in the Sahara. He was among the first scientists to detect different types of hepatitis caused by different viruses.
        The Army sent him to Yale University for two years to continue his work. He left the Army in 1946 with the rank of major to join the faculty of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, where he continued his research and taught for 30 years.  Advisory Roles
        Dr. Havens served many years on advisory medical panels to the military and as a consultant to the Surgeon General, the Army and the Veterans Administration. He was a longtime member of the World Health Organization's expert committees on viral diseases and viral hepatitis and also advised several European and Asian countries on hepatitis control.
        He wrote 150 articles for journals and textbooks and was the editor of the three-volume "History of Internal Medicine in World War II." He won the Army's commendation ribbon and outstanding civilian service award.
        Dr. Havens was born in Farmingdale, N.J. He graduated from Harvard University in 1932 and its medical school in 1936. He was an intern at Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia and a resident at Jefferson Medical College's hospital. He studied neurotropic viral infections at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in Manhattan for two years.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 50 years, the former Ida M. Hessenbruch; a daughter, Florence D. Graburn of Albany; four sons, John P. of Locust Valley, L.I., and Timothy M., Michael C. and Peter H. Havens, all of Haverford, and seven grandchildren.
