        James David Atwater, an editor at Time and other magazines and who later became dean at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, died on March 1  at his home in Columbia, Mo. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, the university reported.
        Professor Atwater, a former senior writer and editor of Time magazine and The Saturday Evening Post, joined the journalism school, which at 86 years is the country's oldest, in 1983. He served as dean until 1989, when he returned to teaching editorial writing and magazine writing.
        He wrote "Time Bomb" (Viking, 1977), a novel based on his coverage of the British Army bomb squads in Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was the author of a book on physical fitness and co-author of a book on Mexican history.
        A native of Westfield, Mass., Mr. Atwater graduated from Yale College in 1950. Three years later he began his career at Time magazine as an editorial trainee. Over the years he worked as a writer and editor for the news weekly as  well as for The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest.
        He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Patricia; three daughters, Mary Elizabeth Rankin of Asheboro, N.C., Katherine Thankful Butcher of Newport, R.I., and Jennifer Snow Atwater of Manhattan; three sons, Stephen G., of Pedro Bay, Alaska, Christopher P., of Irvington, N.Y., and Andrew D., of Columbia, and three grandchildren.
