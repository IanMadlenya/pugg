        Hamer Harold Budge, a conservative Republican who was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1969 to 1971 and represented Idaho's Second Congressional District from 1951 to 1961, died on July 22 at his retirement home in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 92.
        Mr. Budge was nominated to the S.E.C. for a five-year term by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. The choice was controversial, with critics saying Mr. Budge's distaste for government regulation of business made him unsuitable for the post.
        He often supported the efforts of the chairman, Manuel F. Cohen, to tighten controls over the mutual fund industry. Reflecting his roots, Mr. Budge also fought to ensure that small regional brokers were treated fairly in S.E.C. disciplinary cases.
        In 1969, after dismissing Mr. Cohen, President Richard M. Nixon appointed Mr. Budge as S.E.C. chairman. According to Joel Seligman, a historian of the S.E.C., Mr. Budge sought to rein in what he saw as the ''activism'' of Mr. Cohen's era, but he won praise for supporting staff efforts to address the Wall Street paperwork crisis of the late 1960's, when the volume of trading outstripped the ability of brokerage firms to process orders.
        Mr. Budge was born in Pocatello, Idaho, on Nov. 21, 1910. He attended Stanford University and worked as a drummer in a dance band to defray the costs. After graduating, he studied at the University of Idaho law school and received a law degree in 1936.
        He was elected to the Idaho Legislature in 1939 and served in the Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. After being elected to the State Legislature again in 1949, Mr. Budge was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1950 and served for 10 years.
        His voting record was highly conservative; he voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Defeated in 1960 by a Democrat, he was appointed a judge in Idaho's Third Judicial District.
        After resigning as chairman of the S.E.C. in 1971, Mr. Budge joined Investors Diversified Services, a large mutual fund company in Minneapolis. He stepped down in 1978 but remained on the board until 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jeanne Keithly, and their daughter Kathleen.
