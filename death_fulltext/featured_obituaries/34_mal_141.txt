        When he moved to New York, he worked with Little Willie John at Small's Paradise in Harlem. Later he was an original member of the New York Jazz Sextet and a member of M'Boom, the percussion choir.
        Mr. Waits performed with numerous artists, including Ella Fitzgerald, Donald Byrd, Sonny Rollins, Freddie Hubbard, Johnny Hodges, Richard Davis, Jackie McLean and Reggie Workman.
