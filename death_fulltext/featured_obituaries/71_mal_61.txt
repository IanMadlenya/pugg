        Harry A. Fagan, an advocate for social change and parish programs in the Roman Catholic Church in America, died yesterday at his Manhattan home at the age of 52.
        He died of lung cancer, said an announcement from the National Pastoral Life Center. He was a co-founder and the managing director of the center, which fosters pastoral and social ministries in the church.
        Among the issues Mr. Fagan focused on were racial integration, redlining by banks, neighborhood preservation and community education and organizing.
        He began his church work as a volunteer at St. Henry's parish in his native Cleveland in the late 1960's. He became active in social causes as the director of the Commission for Catholic Community Action, a diocesan organization in Cleveland.
        He started the Pastoral Life Center in 1983 and in 1984 helped found the Roundtable, a nationwide association of diocesan social action directors.
        He also wrote a book, "Empowerment: Skills for Parish Social Ministry" (Paulist Press, 1980).
        Mr. Fagan graduated from John Carroll University and was an advertising salesman for The Cleveland Plain Dealer before entering church work. He was divorced.
        He is survived by his companion, Nora Cooper; two daughters, Allison Soler of Greenwich, Conn., and Jocelyn Fagan, a student at the University of Massachusetts, and a sister, Janet Giaimo of Chagrin Falls, Ohio.
