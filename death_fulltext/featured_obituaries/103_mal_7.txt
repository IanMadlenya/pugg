        The singer and violinist Canray Fontenot, a leading exponent of the Creole music of southwestern Louisiana, died on Saturday at his home in Welsh, La. He was 72.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter Joyce Windoskey.
        Mr. Fontenot played music that took many of its cues from the French settlers of the area. In his hands, an early French folk song was made bluesy, with bent notes and embellishments, riffs and copious amounts of improvisations. He could be a striking improviser, with the ability to change profoundly the material he scrutinized. He was a synthesizer of cultural identities.
        Mr. Fontenot was born into a musical family in Louisiana. Early on he was playing in string bands, and in the 1940's became associated with the Ardoins, another black French musical family. He recorded and performed regularly with the accordionist and singer Alphonse Boisec Ardoin for most of his adult life.
        In 1966, Mr. Fontenot and Mr. Ardoin appeared at the Newport Folk Festival, which was the springboard for more frequent tours and performances outside of Louisiana.
        Though he was extraordinarily respected as a musician -- he taught generations of local players, including Michael Doucet of the band Beausoleil -- Mr. Fontenot worked steadily as a manual laborer.
        In 1986, he received a National Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, and managed to make a living performing regularly, in part because of a growing interest in the culture of southwestern Louisiana. He maintained a busy performing schedule until only a few weeks ago.
        In addition to his daughter Joyce, he is survived by his wife, Artile; two sons, Edward and John, of Houston; three other daughters, Linda Williams and Joanne, of Houston, and Geneva, of Huntsville, Ala., and a sister, Addie Belton of Lake Charles, La.
