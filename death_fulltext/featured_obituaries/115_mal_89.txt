        Dr. Harold Diner, an expert in dental care for children with disabilities, died on Monday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 77 and lived in Astoria, Queens.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said a spokesman for the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, where Dr. Diner was a professor emeritus and founder of a center now bearing his name.
        Dr. Diner was the founding director of the Clinic for Special Care Dentistry at Albert Einstein's Rose F. Kennedy Center in the Bronx. The clinic is part of the medical school's Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center.
        Dr. Diner graduated from New York University in 1939. He received his D.D.S. degree in 1944 from the School of Dental and Oral Surgery at Columbia University. He joined the Albert Einstein faculty in 1964.
        He established comprehensive dental training programs in the children's unit for the opening of the Rose Kennedy Center in 1970. He also developed special equipment needed for providing disabled children with dental care, and trained young dentists in his unusual specialty.
        Dr. Diner is survived by his wife, the former Sydelle Eisenberg; two sons, Bruce, of Chadds Ford, Pa., and David, of Sierra Madre, Calif.; a daughter, Naomi Leszkiewicz of East Williston, L.I.; a sister, Eva Stern of Astoria, and four grandchildren.
