        Lilian Bond, an English actress who appeared in more than two dozen Hollywood films in the 1930's, died on Friday at Convalescent Hospital in Reseda, Calif., where she lived. She was 83 years old.
        She died of a heart attack, a family spokesman said.
        Miss Bond's most celebrated role was in James Whale's 1932 horror comedy "The Old Dark House." She played a naive stranger in a sinister house presided over by a lecherous butler (Boris Karloff).
        Her other films included "Just a Gigolo," "Fireman, Save My Child," "Beauty and the Boss," "Hot Saturday," "Pick Up," "When Strangers Marry," "Her Splendid Folly" and "The Bishop Misbehaves." She portrayed Lily Langtry in "The Westerner," starring Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan (as Judge Roy Bean) in 1940. She retired in 1955.
        Miss Bond, a native of London, was a graduate of the Brompton Oratory School. As a teen-ager she appeared in pantomimes and revues in London. On Broadway, she starred in several 1920's editions of the "Ziegfeld Follies" and "Earl Carroll's Vanities."
        Her third husband, Michael Fessier, a writer, died in 1988. She is survived by a niece, Pam Huffman of Reseda; a stepson, Michael Fessier Jr. of Santa Barbara, Calif., and a stepdaughter, Jo Kelly of Port Angeles, Wash.
