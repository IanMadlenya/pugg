        Thomas Wirth, a New York City man who had urged doctors not to take extraordinary measures to prevent his death from AIDS, died Thursday at Bellevue Hospital from an AIDS-related brain infection. He was 47 years old.
        Mr. Wirth became the focus of a court battle last month when a legal guardian whom he had appointed filed suit to force doctors at Bellevue to discontinue drug treatments and allow Mr. Wirth to die.
        The guardian, John Evans, who was Mr. Wirth's neighbor in the East Village, based his case on a ''living will'' that Mr. Wirth drafted with a lawyer in April. The document stated that Mr. Wirth wished to be allowed to die without extraordinary medical measures if he could not be restored to a ''meaningful quality of life.''
        On July 27, however, Judge Jawn A. Sandifer of State Supreme Court in Manattan ruled that Bellevue doctors could continue Mr. Wirth's treatment. Although Mr. Wirth's instructions were clear and binding as far as a terminal illness was concerned, Judge Sandifer wrote it had not been proven that Mr. Wirth's brain infection, which was treatable, was itself ''without hope.''
