He worked for the designer Mollie Parnis in the late 1970's.
        Mr. Waeckerle (pronounced WACK-er-lee) was born in Salina, Kan. He graduated from high school there and received a B.A. in business administration from the University of Kansas in 1970.
        He began his career in retailing in Kansas City, Mo., with Macy's and with Stix, Baer & Fuller, a fine-apparel store.
