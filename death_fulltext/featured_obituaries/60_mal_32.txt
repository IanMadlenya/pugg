        Arthur Eugene Milford, a film editor who won Academy Awards for editing Frank Capra's "Lost Horizon" (1937) and Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront" (1954), died on Dec. 23 at Santa Monica Hospital in California. He was 89 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said his wife, Dorothy.
        Mr. Milford was born in Lamar, Colo., and entered silent films as a stuntman and title writer. He began editing films in 1926 when he worked on "Two Can Play," starring Clara Bow. Later, he edited films for Columbia, RKO, Republic and other studios.
        During World War II, he was chief of the film editorial department of the Office of War Information. He later headed a similar department of the Atomic Energy Commission at Lookout Mountain, Calif.
        After the war, Mr. Milford edited four films directed by Mr. Kazan: "On the Waterfront," "Baby Doll," "A Face in the Crowd" and "Splendor in the Grass." Among the other feature films he edited were Arthur Penn's "Chase," Robert Altman's "Countdown," and Terence Young's "Wait Until Dark" and "Inchon." Work on Television
        He also worked on a number of television shows, including "The Faye Emerson Show," "Omnibus" and "See It Now."
        From 1955 to 1961, Mr. Milford was the president of M-K-R Productions, making educational, scientific and documentary films.
        Mr. Milford was modest about his accomplishments. "Scissors are no magic wands," he once said when asked if a skillful editor could transform a poor rough cut into a powerful film. "The cutter does not make the picture. That is done by the director, and if he doesn't provide interesting film, there's only so much the cutter can do with it."
        In 1987, Mr. Milford and Barbara McLean, another film editor, became the first recipients of the American Cinema Editors Career Achievement Award.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Robert, of Coos Bay, Ore., and two grandchildren.
