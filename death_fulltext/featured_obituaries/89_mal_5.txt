        Carl Thomas Johnson, a retired psychotherapist and educator, died last Friday at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx. He was 79 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        At his retirement 10 years ago, Mr. Johnson was an associate professor of education at Hunter College, City University of New York; a consultant to educational and mental-health orgranizations, and a sensitivity trainer for professional and industrial groups.
        He was a native of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and graduated from Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro, N.C., before earning a master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. He received further professional training at New York University's Center for Human Relations, the Institute for Group Psychotherapy, the Postgraduate Center for Psychotherapy and the Alfred Adler Institute for Individual Psychotherapy, all in New York.
        In 1964 he became one of the first black professors at Hunter.
        It was the time of President Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty," and Mr. Johnson worked closely with Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and other leaders to develop community programs and services. He had strong working relationships with schools and other public institutions in Harlem.
        Mr. Johnson was named associate director of ACT (Associated Community Teams), an early version of the Domestic Peace Corps, in which he served as New York City director.
        Over the years he also worked with drug addicts and troubled adolescents. He was the founding director of Camp Derry Downs for severely emotionally disturbed children near Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
        Mr. Johnson's survivors include a son, Marc of Manhattan, and a daughter, Heidi, of Cambridge, Mass.
