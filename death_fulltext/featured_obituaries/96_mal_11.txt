        Claude (Red) Phillips, a former New York City high school basketball star who gained wider fame when he teamed with Red Holzman to form an indomitable backcourt combination at City College in the early 1940's, died in New York last Wednesday. He was 74.
        Robert Williams, the president of the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame, said the cause was a heart attack.
        Mr. Phillips, who was inducted into the hall in September, was a native of Harlem who combined with another noted teammate, William (Pop) Gates, to lead Benjamin Franklin High School to the Public Schools Athletic League championship in 1938.
        But it was under Nat Holman at City College that Phillips, playing alongside Holzman, emerged as a dazzling guard.
        During the two Phillips-Holzman seasons, 1940-41 and 1941-42, City College had records of 17-5 and 16-3, plus at least one other distinction, according to Holzman: The Beavers never lost to another New York City college.
        "I was the passer, and he was the shooter," said Holzman, the former Knick coach, who ranked Phillips among the game's great guards, alongside two Basketball Hall of Fame members, Bob Davies and Bobby Wanzer of the Rochester Royals, with whom Holzman played professionally.
        Phillips's chance for a professional career was dashed by the economic realities of the day: marriage and the need for a steady job. With the newly created National Basketball Association offering an uncertain financial future, Mr. Phillips became a New York City policeman, rising to the rank of sergeant before spending 11 years as the chief senior inspector of the New York State Drug Abuse Control Program.
        He is survived by three sons, Claude Jr., Sidney and Alvin, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
