        Earl Sarkis Dulgarian, the owner of an off-campus bookstore and a movie theater, both catering to students and faculty of Brown University, died Thursday at his home in Cranston, R.I. He was 70 years old.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        A native of Providence and a Brown alumnus, Mr. Dulgarian graduated from Harvard Divinity School and was a Navy chaplain in World War II. In the late 1940's he served as a Congregationalist minister before starting a career in business.
        He owned Dulgarian Real Estate and in 1966 founded the College Hill Book Store. He also owned the adjoining Avon Repertory Cinema, which featured first-run foreign art films for the Brown campus community. He was active in civic and religious groups.
        Mr. Dulgarian is survived by his wife, the former Beatrice Nargizian; three sons, Robert E., of Cumberland, R.I., Richard K., of Cranston, and Kenneth R., of Providence; a daughter, Joyce Swedberg of Danvers, Mass.; a brother, Grant S., also of Cranston, and one grandson.
