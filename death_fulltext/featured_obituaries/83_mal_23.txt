        Gen. Cortlandt Van Rensselaer Schuyler, who was a senior officer in the military arm of NATO and New York State's first Commissioner of General Services, died on Saturday at his home in San Antonio. He was 92.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        General Schuyler was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to be chief of staff of Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers in Europe, the military arm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 1953 to 1959. There, he received one of two Distinguished Service medals.
        After leaving the Army in 1959, he was chosen by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to organize and head the first Office of General Services, the state's purchase-and-supply operation.
        General Schuyler retired in 1971 to care for his ailing wife, Wyona Coykendall, who died in 1981. Distinguished Service Medals
        A native of Arlington, N.J., General Schuyler graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in June 1922. From there, he served in a succession of posts, first as an artillery officer in the Philippines, then in Panama and in several United States military installations, including West Point, where he taught mathematics. Later, he was commissioned a brigadier general and commanded the Anti-Aircraft Training Center at Camp Davis, N.C.
        Late in 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him United States representative to the Allied Control Commission for Romania, which was established under during the Allied troops' occupation. For his service, he was awarded his first Distinguished Service medal.
        The general is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, Shirley Saxby of Pinehurst, N.C.; a son, Philip V. R. Schuyler of Bound Brook, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Betty Honnen Wear of Glenwood Springs, Colo., and Jesse Honnen McCarty of Melbourne, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
