        Mr. Fielding had business dealings with the Soviet Union for 30 years. In 1958, the Russian-speaking entepreneur provided Moscow with its first self-service laundry.
        Mr. Fielding made headlines in 1985 when the Soviet Union allowed his Russian bride, Nina F. Dobrova, to resettle in the United States. Her emigration was a good-will gesture by Soviet officials shortly before the Reagan-Gorbachev summit conference in Geneva.
