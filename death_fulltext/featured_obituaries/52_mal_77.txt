        David Sohappy, a Yakima Indian who helped win a ruling that affirmed Indian fishing rights and later served 18 months in prison for poaching on the Columbia River, died Monday at a nursing home in Hood River, Ore. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Sohappy had been in failing health since 1987, when he suffered a stroke, said Philip Olney, general council chairman of the Yakima Indian Nation.
        It was after he was laid off from a sawmill in the 1960's that Mr. Sohappy returned to the traditional Indian way of life, settling in a wooden house on the Columbia.
        From there he undertook a campaign that led to a ruling in 1973 by a Federal district judge, George Boldt, who held that 19th-century treaties gave tribes the right to catch half the harvestable salmon in Washington waters.
        In 1983 Mr. Sohappy was convicted of selling 317 fish out of season to undercover officers taking part in a Federal sting operation. He was sent to prison.
        He is survived by his wife, Myra; 4 sons, 3 daughters, 2 sisters and 18 grandchildren.
