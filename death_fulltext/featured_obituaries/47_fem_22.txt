        Marta Linden, an actress who frequently appeared in drawing room comedies, died Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pneumonia, her daughter, Barbara Harbach, said.
        Miss Linden began her Broadway career in 1946 opposite Clifton Webb in Noel Coward's "Present Laughter." She later toured in the comedy with Edward Everett Horton. Her stage credits also included "The Men We Marry," with Shirley Booth; "The Curious Savage," with Lillian Gish; "The Starcross Story," with Christopher Plummer and Eva Le Gallienne; and "Cry of the Peacock."
        In 1940's films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Miss Linden acted in "A Yank at Eton," with Mickey Rooney; "Stand By for Action," a naval war film with Charles Laughton, Robert Taylor and Brian Donlevy; and "Maisie Goes to Reno" with Ann Sothern, Ava Gardner and John Hodiak.
        Miss Linden is survived by her daughter, Mrs. William Harbach, of New York, and three granddaughters and one great-granddaughter.
