        Leo Kuper, a retired professor of sociology at the University of California at Los Angeles who wrote extensively on race relations and genocide, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 85.
        The cause was heart disease, said a daughter, Mary Kuper.
        His most important book, "Genocide: Its Political Use in the 20th Century" (Yale University Press, 1981), was a detailed study of atrocities committed by Asians and Africans as well as by Nazis, Russians and Turks. The study also included an analysis of theories seeking to explain the phenomenon of genocide.
        In a later book, "The Prevention of Genocide" (Yale University Press, 1985), Professor Kuper said the refusal of the United Nations and the major powers to enforce the organization's Genocide Convention was responsible for the many genocidal massacres of recent years.
        Professor Kuper's earlier works, written when he taught at the University of Birmingham, in England, and the University of Natal, in South Africa, dealt with race relations in those two countries. Among them were "Passive Resistance in South Africa" (1957) and "An African Bourgeoisie (1965), both of which were banned in South Africa.
        Born in South Africa, Professor Kuper was a lawyer by training and served in British intelligence during World War II. He later moved to England and then, in 1961, to the United States. He was the director of the African Studies Center at U.C.L.A., as well as being a professor at the university.
        His wife, Dr. Hilda Kuper, a professor of anthropology at U.C.L.A., died two years ago.
        He is survived by two daughters, Mary and Jenny Kuper, both of London.
