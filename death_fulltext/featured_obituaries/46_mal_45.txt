        Alvin Z. Halpern, a retired textile company executive, died on Sunday at his home in Bay Harbor Island, Fla. He was 65 years old.
        He died in a fire that might have been caused by smoking in bed, his son, David, of Miami, said.
        Mr. Halpern was a former executive vice president and chief executive of Glenoit Mills Inc., a fabrics manufacturer that had operations in Manhattan, Tarboro, N.C., and several other cities. He went into the industry after serving with the Army in Europe during World War II. He retired about five years ago.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Susan, of San Jose, Calif., and a brother, Howard, of Rio Rancho, N.M.
