        Gale Gordon, a character actor known for his comic fussiness and his television sitcom roles opposite Lucille Ball, died on Friday at the Redwood Terrace Health Center in Escondido, Calif. He was 89.
        The cause was cancer, the Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Gordon was praised by critics for "his nifty slow-burn turns" and for being "always amusing in a state of high dudgeon." One of his later roles was the husband's boss in the series "Hi, Honey, I'm Home" in 1991.
        But his heyday was an earlier, classic era when, as Frank Rich once suggested in a review in The New York Times, "the cartoon world of Lucille Ball and Gale Gordon" exemplified "the formulas of the old-time television sitcom."
        Mr. Gordon played Miss Ball's masculine foil on television, in some ways the onscreen successor to Desi Arnaz, after the couple divorced in 1960. From 1962 to 1968, Mr. Gordon was a principal performer on "The Lucy Show," weekly on CBS, playing Mr. Mooney, a pompous bank executive, opposite Miss Ball's businesswoman and mother of grown children.
        From 1968 to 1974, Mr. Gordon was her blustery boss and brother-in-law on the successor sitcom "Here's Lucy." And in 1986 he performed with Miss Ball in the ABC series "Life With Lucy."
        His other television work included a co-starring role in "The Brothers" from 1956 to 1958 and roles in the series "My Favorite Husband" and "Our Miss Brooks" in the 1950's and "Dennis the Menace" in the 1960's.
        Early in the 1950's, he had regular parts in seven weekly radio programs, including "Our Miss Brooks," "The Alice Faye-Phil Harris Show," "The Dennis Day Show" and the long-running "Fibber McGee and Molly." In that show he played Mayor LaTrivia, whose wrath always ended in a sputtered "McGee!"
        Among the films in which Mr. Gordon appeared are "Here We Go Again" (1942), "A Woman of Distinction" (1950), "Don't Give Up the Ship" (1959), "Visit to a Small Planet" (1960), "Sergeant Deadhead" (1965) and "Speedway 85" (1968).
        Mr. Gordon, a native New Yorker, was named Charles T. Aldrich Jr. at birth. His mother was an actress, his father a vaudevillian. He attended schools in New York and England.
        His wife, the former Virginia Curley, an actress, died a few weeks ago. He is survived by a sister, Judy Wormser.
