        Frank Caplan, an educator and a pioneer in the development of educational toys for children, died of pneumonia Wednesday at the Medical Center at Princeton. He was 77 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        Mr. Caplan, a graduate of City College and Columbia University, was a nursery school teacher and youth worker in Manhattan in the early 1930's. He helped create the concept of traffic-free play streets.
        He was a co-founder in 1949 of Creative Playthings, a concern that designed and manufactured toys to tap the imagination and intelligence of toddlers and youngsters. The durable wooden toys, such as blocks in a variety of shapes - animals, cars, trucks and play people - were a success. The company was sold to the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1966. Collected 50,000 Toys
        Mr. Caplan and his wife, Theresa, had a strong interest in the powerful learning potential of play and toys. They were co-authors of several books on child rearing, including ''The Power of Play,'' 1973, Anchor Press, and ''The First 12 Months of Life'' and ''The Second 12 Months of Life,'' published in 1977 and 1978, respectively, by Grosset & Dunlap.
        They also collected more than 50,000 folk art toys from around the world for a planned Museum of Fantasy and Play. But in 1984 they donated their collection to the Children's Museum of Indianapolis.
        Mr. Caplan was also an innovator of playground equipment, creating sculptured concrete slides or five-foot concrete mountains with caves and slides.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Judith Inglese, of Amherst, Mass.; a son, Richard, of Gap, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
