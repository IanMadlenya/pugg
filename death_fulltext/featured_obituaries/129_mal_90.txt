        Dr. Philip D. Marsden, a specialist in tropical medicine who trained doctors in Uganda and Brazil and became a world expert on parasites, died on Oct. 4 in his home in Brasilia, where he had lived since 1974. He was 64.
        The cause was a stroke, family members said.
        Dr. Marsden, who was born in London, received his M.D. degree at University College Hospital in London and did his thesis on children's health in Gambia. He taught at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, at Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, and at Mulago Hospital, a part of Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda.
        He began fieldwork in Brazil in 1967, was named a professor of tropical medicine at the University of Brasilia and became a leading authority on leishmaniasis, an often-fatal disease borne by sand flies.
        He set up clinics in the Amazon, published widely -- including chapters in medical textbooks used in Britain and the United States -- and trained numerous Latin American doctors in parasitology.
        He received the Order of the British Empire and the Chalmers Medal of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria; a sister, Christina Redding of Southampton, N.Y.; a son, Andrew Philip Marsden, and a daughter, Vanessa Giorgio, both of London, and three grandchildren. His marriage to Susan Marsden ended in divorce.
