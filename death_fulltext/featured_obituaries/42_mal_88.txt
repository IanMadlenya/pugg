        Dr. Jurji joined the faculty at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1939 as an instructor in Islamic and comparative religion. He retired in 1977 as a professor of history of religions and was given emeritus status.
        Born in Latakia, Syria, he was educated in Beirut and came to the United States in 1933. He received a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1936 and a degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1942. He wrote many books, including ''The Christian Interpretation of Religion'' and ''The Middle East: Its Religion and Culture.'' He also edited ''The Great Religions of the Modern World.''
        From the mid-1940's until 1981, he was associated with the Fourth Avenue Presbyterian Church in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, known originally as the Syrian Protestant Church.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, David, of Seattle; a brother, Anis Nasri of Homs, Syria; a sister, Amy Bashir of Tripoli, Lebanon, and two grandchildren.
