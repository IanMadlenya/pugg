        Renny B. Saltzman, an interior designer and patron of modern architecture, died on Sunday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.
        The cause was complications associated with leukemia, said his wife, Ellin.
        In 1956 Mr. Saltzman established a  design firm and quickly became known for a refined eclecticism. His clients included Charles Revson, the founder of Revlon, for whom Mr. Saltzman designed an apartment and a yacht, the Ultima 2; Herbert Siegel of Chris-Craft Industries; and the publisher Richard Snyder of Simon & Schuster.
        Mr. Saltzman was born on Aug. 9, 1930, in Brooklyn. His parents' dreams of having their first son become a dentist were thwarted when Mr. Saltzman, who received his undergraduate degree from New York University, went on to enroll in the New York School of Interior Design. (His younger brother, Kenneth, who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., did become a dentist.)
        In 1960 Mr. Saltzman married Ellin Jane Sadowsky, then an editor at Glamour magazine. He is survived by her; by their children, David and Elizabeth Saltzman, both of Manhattan; and by his brother.
        Architecture was a keen interest and in 1968 Mr. Saltzman gave the architect Richard Meier one of his first house commissions; the Saltzman home has since become a landmark of white modernism in East Hampton. Unlike the commissions that Mr. Saltzman carried out for his clients, which often tended toward the traditional, the architecture of the house was starkly modern.
        Mr. Saltzman was listed as one of  100 notable contemporary interior designers and architects in the January issue of Architectural Digest; he also frequently participated in leading show houses like the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House.
