        In Rome, the Vatican announced that Pope John Paul II had sent a message of condolences over the death to the Cardinal's successor, Patriarch Stephanos Ghattas II.
        The Vatican announcement said Cardinal Sidarouss's death reduced the number in the Roman Catholic College of Cardinals to 138, including 36 who are over the age of 80 and thus barred from taking part in any papal election.
        There are about 200,000 Coptic Catholics in Egypt. Unlike Orthodox Copts, they recognize the Roman Catholic Pope.
