        Edward Tinsley Chase, a retired book editor and writer who bought and shepherded hundreds of manuscripts, primarily on politics and public policy, into print at various New York publishing houses, died on June 9 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 86 and also had a home in East Hampton, N.Y.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        In a career of more than 40 years, Mr. Chase edited the work of authors including Harry S. Truman, Gordon Craig, Edward Rice and Mark Mathabane. He retired in 1995.
        Ned Chase, as he was widely known, was a 1941 graduate of Princeton. He briefly taught English at Stanford University before serving as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II. He started his editing career at the Hyperion Press. He was on the editorial staff of The New Yorker for three years and eventually held senior editorial positions at the New American Library, G.P. Putnam's Sons, Times Books (now an imprint in partnership with Henry Holt), and Macmillan Publishing and Charles Scribner's Sons.
        Mr. Chase is survived by his wife of 56 years, Ethelyn Atha Chase, a past chairwoman of the Academy of American Poets; two sons, Edward Thornton Chase of Mount Vernon, N.Y., and Cornelius Crane Chase of Bedford, N.Y., the comic actor known as Chevy Chase; two daughters, Prof. Cynthia Chase-Culler of Ithaca, N.Y., and Daphne C. Rowe of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; and nine grandchildren.
