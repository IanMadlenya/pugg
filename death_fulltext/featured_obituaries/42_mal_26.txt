        Dr. Farahe Maloof, a former chief of the thyroid unit of Massachusetts General Hospital, died Monday. Dr. Maloof, a resident of Milton, Mass., was 69 years old.
        He died of a heart attack at a nursing home in Milton, a hospital spokesman said.
        Dr. Maloof joined the hospital as chief of the thyroid unit in 1966, a post he retained until he retired because of ill health in 1980. He was also professor emeritus at the Harvard Medical School.
        Dr. Maloof was best known for his work on thyroid peroxidase, the enzyme that controls the production of thyroid hormone, and on the regulation of T.S.H., the hormone that controls the thyroid gland itself. He was a member of the American Thyroid Association, serving as its director in 1966 and as its president in 1978.
        Born in Boston, he graduated from Harvard in 1942 and from Tufts College Medical School in 1945.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Emily Puchy; a son, F. Paul of McLean, Va.; a daughter, Suzanne M. Knipe of Newton, Mass., and three grandchildren.
