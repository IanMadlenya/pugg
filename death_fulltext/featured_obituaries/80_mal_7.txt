        Vincent F. Ostrom, president of the Putnam Trust Company in Greenwich, Conn., from 1959 to 1978, died on Monday in Greenwich Hospital. He was 80.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his son, Mitchell.
        Mr. Ostrom was born in Brooklyn and began his banking career in 1930 at the Kingsboro National Bank near his home, rising to become a vice president and the manager of the bank's main office.
        He joined the Putnam Trust Company in 1941 and, with the exception of the period from 1942 to 1945 when he served as a financial adviser to the War Department, he remained with the company for the remainder of his career.
        Mr. Ostrom served at various times as the president of the Connecticut Bankers Association, of Greenwich Academy and of the Greenwich Library.
        He is survived by his third wife, Dorothy Ostrom; a son, Mitchell, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Janet Bowmer, of Madison, Conn., and two grandsons.
