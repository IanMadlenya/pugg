        Walter T. Ridder, a retired news executive who helped create Knight-Ridder Inc., died after a long illness Saturday at his home in McLean, Va. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Ridder retired from the board of Knight-Ridder in 1989 after a career that spanned 50 years. He began as a reporter in the newspaper chain founded by his grandfather, Hermann Ridder, and was a correspondent in Europe during World War II. Later he was publisher of The Post-Tribune in Gary, Ind., for five years and head of the Washington bureau of the Ridder papers for many years.
        His grandfather had emigrated from Germany to the United States in the 19th century and bought an interest in a German-language paper, The Staats-Zeitung. It became the basis of Ridder Publications Inc., which included 19 newspapers and radio and television stations when it merged with Knight Newspapers in 1974.
        Mr. Ridder attended Columbia University and received a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie; three daughters, Cary Alberswerth of Washington, Stephanie Beardsley of Bethesda, Md., and Pamela Ridder of New York; a son, Victor F. (Rick) Ridder of Denver, and seven grandchildren. He is also survived by three sisters, Joan Challinor of Washington and Gretchen Nicholas and Esther Ridder, both of New York, and a brother, Robert, of St. Paul.
