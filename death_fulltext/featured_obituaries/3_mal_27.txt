        Jean-Baptiste Doumeng, a businessman who has been called France's wealthiest Communist, died last night at his home in Noe near Toulouse, his company reported today. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Doumeng joined the Communist Party as a farmboy and remained a staunch supporter while building an agricultural business empire. The party's Central Committee observed a moment of silence in his honor.
        An official at Interagra, Mr. Doumeng's holding company that specializes in trading with the Soviet Union and other East-bloc countries, said he had been ill for months. The cause of death was not immediately known.
        Mr. Doumeng founded Interagra when he was 20 and amassed a fortune, but he never considered his money at odds with his political beliefs. ''Communism will make everyone as rich as me,'' he once said.
        While serving as the Communist Mayor of Noe, the ''Red Millionaire,'' as Mr. Doumeng was known, established a stable of thoroughbred horses.
        A book published in 1977 said Mr. Doumeng helped finance the French Communist Party out of Interagra funds and in return was given preferential business treatment by the Soviet Union. He denied that, but acknowledged having personal ties with many top Soviet leaders.
