        Stanley D. Salvigsen, a Wall Street analyst and investor who co-founded the money management firm Comstock Partners, died on Aug. 30 in Kinnelon, N.J. He was 53.
        He died after a heart attack, according to his partner, Charles L. Minter.
        Mr. Salvigsen began his investment career in 1964 as an analyst with the Value Line Investment Survey, having been lured to Wall Street two credits short of graduation from Brooklyn College. He was an equity analyst at a succession of firms, including Dreyfus, Oppenheimer and C. J. Lawrence.
        In 1983, Mr. Salvigsen joined Merrill Lynch as chief investment strategist, and was given responsibility for forming the firm's overall view of the financial markets. Three years later, he was named the industry's top strategist by Institutional Investor magazine.
        The same year, Mr. Salvigsen and two colleagues at Merrill Lynch decided to give up their roles as advisers in favor of investing money themselves. The three founded Comstock Partners, which currently manages more than $700 million for institutional and private investors.
        Mr. Salvigsen is survived by his wife, Frida, and four sons, Steve, Scott, Stanley and Stuart, all of Kinnelon.
