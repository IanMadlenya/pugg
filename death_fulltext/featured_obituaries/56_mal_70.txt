        Alexander Calder Jr., former chairman of the Union Camp Corporation, died on Wednesday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. He was 75 years old and lived in Upper Montclair.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said a Union Camp spokesman, Timothy McKenna.
        In 1940, Mr. Calder joined what was then the Union Bag and Paper Company, which his father had built into one of the country's largest manufacturers of paper and bags. After wartime service with the Board of Economic Warfare and the Navy, he returned to Union Bag in 1946. He was named president, succeeding his father, in 1956, the year the company merged with the Camp Manufacturing Company.
        Mr. Calder was named chief executive in 1960 and chairman in 1972. He retired as chairman of the executive committee in 1986. He was an early advocate of conservation and environmental concerns in the paper industry. During his tenure, Union Camp donated 78,000 acres of its woodlands for preservation.
        He is survived by his wife, Rebecca Holmes Calder; a son, Alexander 3d, of Montclair; a daughter, Christie Salomon of Greenwich, Conn., two brothers, Stanley, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Frederick, of Montclair, and five grandchildren.
