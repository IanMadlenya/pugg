        Born in Chicago, Mr. Lasser attended the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He began his career in Chicago, came to New York City in the late 1970's and directed, arranged and wrote material for a wide variety of cabaret acts and Off Broadway musicals, including "Bundle of Nerves," "The No-Frills Revue" and his own musical, "The Black Tulip."

        He is survived by his parents, Isador and Helen Lasser, and two sisters, Margo and Helen, all of Chicago.
