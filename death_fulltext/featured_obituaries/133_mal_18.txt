        John Taylor Ellis, a pathologist and educator who was pathologist in chief at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and chairman of the Pathology Department at Cornell University Medical College from 1968 to 1994, died on Jan. 10 at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was 77 and lived in West Kingston, R.I., where he moved from Manhattan four years ago.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        After his retirement, Dr. Ellis remained a consultant to New York-Cornell and to the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, formerly Booth Memorial Medical Center, commuting to New York every week. At his death he was also on the advisory board of the Office of Chief Medical Examiner of New York City.
        During his tenure at New York-Cornell, he centralized the hospital's clinical laboratories and established a residency training program in clinical pathology.
        Born in Lufkin, Tex., Dr. Ellis graduated from the University of Texas in 1942 and earned his M.D. at Northwestern University in 1945.
        Working with the National Institutes of Health and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, he studied changes in the blood and marrow of animals sent on early space flights.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Dr. Marian Caldwell Ellis; their daughter, Dr. Evelyn Floy of Mason, N.H.; two sons, Dr. George C., of Manhattan, and John T. 4th, of West Kingston, and five grandchildren.
