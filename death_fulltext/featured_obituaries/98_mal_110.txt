        David Martin, a former foreign policy analyst for Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut, died on March 16 at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. He was 80 and lived in Arlington.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his son, Joe Martin, said.
        Born in Wiarton, Ontario, Mr. Martin first worked as a freelance journalist in London in the early years of World War II. His articles for the British weekly Tribune on the civil war in Yugoslavia and his support of Draza Mihailovic, the leader of the Chetnik forces fighting Tito's Partisans and the Germans, caught the attention of two writers who were championing Mihailovic's cause, George Orwell and Rebecca West. He joined their group and continued to support Mihailovic, who was eventually captured and executed by Tito.
        Mr. Martin wrote three books on Yugoslavia: "Ally Betrayed" (Prentice Hall, 1946); "Patriot or Traitor: The Case of General Mihailovich," and "The Web of Disinformation: Churchill's Yugoslav Blunder" (Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, 1990).
        After the war Mr. Martin opposed the forced repatriation of refugees to lands that had come under Communist control. He was secretary of the Refugees Defense Committee in 1946 and executive director of the International Rescue Committee from 1947 to 1952.
        In 1959 Mr. Martin became the foreign policy and national security assistant to Senator Dodd. From 1969 to 1979, he was the senior analyst for the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Internal Security.
        Mr. Martin's first wife, Judy Asti, died in 1971. He is survived by his second wife, Virginia Martin; his son, Joe, and his daughter, Rebecca, both of Washington; a brother, Maurice Manson, of Canoga Park, Calif., and two stepsons, Ian H. Levy of Tokyo and Raoul N. Levy of Arlington, Va.
