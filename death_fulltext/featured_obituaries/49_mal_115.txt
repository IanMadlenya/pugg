        Herbert L. Deane, a professor emeritus of political philosophy and a former vice provost at Columbia University, died on Thursday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of liver and pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Professor Deane began teaching at Columbia in 1948 and became a full professor in 1961. He was vice dean of Columbia's graduate faculties from 1963 to 1967 and became vice provost of the university in 1968. He retired in 1984.
        He was noted for his writings on St. Augustine and on the British political scientist Harold J. Laski. Last November he received the Award for Excellence of Columbia's Graduate Faculties Alumni Association, its highest honor.
        Professor Deane, a Brooklyn native, received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees from Columbia. He was valedictorian of the class of 1942 at Columbia College and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He served for four years in the Navy in World War II.
        He is survived by a sister, Eleanor Hellmann of Madeira Beach, Fla., and a nephew, Lawrence Murphy of Dover, N.H.
