        Thomas Mark Fortuin, a senior vice president of Paramount Pictures, died on Monday at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 48 and lived in Laguna Beach, Calif.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, said his companion, Michael Mickiewicz.
        Mr. Fortuin was a former assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan. He started his career as a corporate lawyer in Manhattan for Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander after graduating from Columbia University School of Law in 1971.
        In 1978, he worked as special counsel to the House of Representatives' Committee on Standards of Official Conduct in its inquiry into charges that Korean officials had bribed members of Congress and the executive branch to sustain support for continuing large-scale military aid to South Korea. The inquiry led to the conviction of former Rep.  Richard T. Hannah of California on charges of conspiring to defraud the Government.
        After several years in private practice, Mr. Fortuin moved to California to work for the film processing company Technicolor Inc. after its purchase by Ronald O. Perelman, the New York investor. He briefly returned to Washington and then accepted a job at Paramount in 1988.
        After being named senior vice president and deputy general counsel in 1991, Mr. Fortuin worked with television programs like "Entertainment Tonight," "Hard Copy" and "The Arsenio Hall Show."
        In addition to his companion, survivors include his mother, Astrid Fortuin of San Francisco; two brothers, Nicholas, of Baltimore, and Floyd, of San Francisco, and a sister, Katherine Reiss of Manhattan.
