        Al Bernknopf, a retired senior vice president of District 65 of the United Auto Workers, died on Friday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Atlanta. He was 82 years old and lived in Atlanta.
        He died of a stroke, said Robert Kirkman, a spokesman for District 65.
        Mr. Bernknopf was a founding member of Local 65 in the mid-1930's, when it was directly affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations. He was an employee at B.I.B., the second largest wholesale dry-goods concern in Manhattan at the time, and helped to organize the union there in the spring of 1935. He became a leader of the wholesale dry-goods local and went on to hold a variety of posts in the union, which affiliated with the U.A.W. in 1981. He was named senior vice president in 1963 and retired in June of 1990.
        He came to the United States from Frankfurt as a teen-ager with his family, which was fleeing from the growing Nazi influence, and settled in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Bernknopf is survived by his wife, the former Rose Nysko; two sons, Gary, of Ashdod, Israel, and Stanley, of Atlanta; two sisters, Nelly Wallenstein of Manhattan, and Rachel Goldsmith of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.
