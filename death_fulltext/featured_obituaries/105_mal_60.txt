        George Osterman, an actor and playwright best known for his work with the Ridiculous Theatrical Company, died on Tuesday in Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. He was 42 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his mother, Laura.
        Mr. Osterman was born and reared in Great Falls, Mont. In 1971 he moved to New York, where he made his acting debut in 1972 in "Eunuchs of the Forbidden City." A gifted mimic and actor, he created 12 character roles with the company before writing and producing his own plays, beginning with "Sherri's Birthday" (1983). He also wrote "The Anniversary Party" (1984); a radio drama, "There Goes the Groom" (1985), and seven other shows, including "On the Lam" (1985), "No Damn Good" (1987), "Don't Remind Me" (1988) and "Brother Truckers" (1992).
        He recently finished "Gertrude and Virgil," about Gertrude Stein and Virgil Thomson, which he wrote with Lola Pashalinski and Linda Chapman.
        In addition to his mother and his father, Donald, of Great Falls, he is survived by his companion, Adam Weitz of Manhattan; seven sisters, Cheryl Hedges of Park City, Mont., Christine Crawford of Corpus Christi, Tex., Elise Wolff of North Ridge, Calif., Donna Carlson of Bozeman, Mont., and Susan Messerli, Tracy Buck, and Catherine Osterman of Great Falls, and four brothers, Charles, Tony, Tim and Steven, all of Great Falls.
