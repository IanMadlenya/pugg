        George S. Squibb, a retired drug company executive who sometimes criticized the pharmaceutical industry, died on Sunday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. He was 78 and lived in Jamestown, R.I.
        The cause of death was heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Squibb worked for 30 years for E. R. Squibb & Sons, which was founded by his great-grandfather, Edward.
        Early in his career, Mr. Squibb worked in the company's distribution and sales divisions. In 1949 he was promoted to secretary of the company and in 1953 became the director of domestic administrative operations. Later he was the vice president in charge of sales and marketing.
        In 1967, after he retired, he gave testimony critical of the pharmaceutical industry before the Senate Subcommittee on Monopoly.
        He accused some in the industry of "exploitation of medicines used in life-preserving situations by setting prices far above the cost." He said this was wrong "no matter what justification or economic temptation is felt by the manufacturer."
        Because of the public need for medicine, he said, the industry has a special obligation and should lower prices even if it means lower profits. He also said the industry sometimes did poor research and wasted money.
        Mr. Squibb was born in Brookline, Mass., and grew up in Providence. He graduated from Harvard in 1936 and earned a law degree at New York University in 1953.
        He was the former commodore of the Larchmont and Saunderstown Yacht Clubs and past president of the National Club Association of Washington and the Dunes Club in Narragansett, R.I.
        His first two wives, the former Ida Ellerson and Beatrice Read, are dead.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Thayer Keeler; two sons, George S. 3d of Pomfret, Vt., and John E. of North Branford, Conn.; two daughters, Colin Reeves of Little Rock, Ark., and Mary Patterson Squibb of Denver, and three grandchildren.
