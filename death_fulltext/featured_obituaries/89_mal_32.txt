        Henri Lesieur, who introduced trans-Atlantic passenger service for Air France in 1946, died last Saturday in Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach. The retired aviation executive was 93 and lived in Miami Beach.
        The cause was heart failure, Air France said, quoting friends of the family.
        Mr. Lesieur's career spanned the history of commercial air transportation, from its birth to the advent of the supersonic Concorde.
        His first aeronautics experience came in 1919 when he joined the French Air Forces as a teen-ager. In 1928, he was working for the French carrier Air Union when it sent off its first passenger plane to London, a twin-engine biplane. The company was one of several merged into Air France in 1933, and Mr. Lesieur was put in charge of branches worldwide.
        After his wartime service, Air France appointed him general manager of its New York office. He greeted the airline's inaugural flight from Paris via Ireland and Newfoundland at La Guardia Field in June 1946, a Douglas DC-4 carrying 14 passengers and a sheaf of Picardy roses for the First Lady, Bess Truman. The next year he initiated sleeper service for 18 aboard a Lockheed Constellation.
        In 1948 he broke ranks with the other foreign carriers and moved Air France into the fledgling New York International Airport at Idlewild. He was there to see off the carrier's first jetliner, a Boeing 707 Intercontinental bound for Paris, in 1960. As he expanded service to other cities and countries, his title grew to general manager of the North, Central American and Caribbean Division.
        In 1963 he became the New York-based consultant for Air France's general management in Paris. At the time, designers in France and Britain were working to get the Concorde on the runway. For his services, he was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor in 1947.
        Mr. Lesieur is survived by his wife, Flore.
