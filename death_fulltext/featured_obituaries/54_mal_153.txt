        Robert L. West, professor of international economic relations at the Fletcher School of Economics at Tufts University, died Wednesday at his home in Wayland, Mass. He was 65 years old.
        Professor West died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the family.
        A faculty member at Fletcher for 26 years, Professor West worked for the security and development of third world countries, particularly the African nations.
        A Navy veteran of World War II, he received bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees at Yale University.
        In 1951 he worked for the C.A.R.E., Inc., Universities Reconstruction Program.
        After three years of teaching at Yale and one year as an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he became a research assistant for the African Economic and Political Development Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for International Studies.
        He worked with the Rockefeller Foundation's Social Sciences Program before joining the Fletcher School in 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eleanora de Antonio; two sons, Roy E. of Berkeley, Calif., and David M. of Boston; a brother, William F. of Concord, Calif., and a sister, Dorothea Marden of Mendocino, Calif.
