        Dr. Joseph Dolgin, a pediatrician who led a successful trial of one of the first measles vaccines, died on Thursday at his home in Livingston, S.I. He was 83.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said his wife, Barbara.
        Dr. Dolgin practiced medicine on Staten Island from 1947 to 1986, first as the chief of service at Sea View Hospital. Later he was the pediatrics director at what is now Staten Island University Hosital and was on staff at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island.
        While at Sea View Hospital in 1960, Dr. Dolgin led a team of physicians who successfully conducted trials of a new measles vaccine on 30 Staten Island children. He also was a founder of the Staten Island Mental Health Society.
        Dr. Dolgin graduated from City College and the medical school of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He served in Europe as a captain in the Army Medical Corps during World War II.
        In addition to his wife of 52 years, he is survived by two sons, Stephen of New Rochelle, and Daniel of Manhattan; a daughter, Janet Streiter of New Rochelle, and a sister, Sara Dolgin of Brooklyn.
