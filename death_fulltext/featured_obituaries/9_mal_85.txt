        Archbishop Thomas Andrew Donnellan, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta for 19 years, died Thursday. The prelate, who was 73 years old, had suffered a stroke May 1.
        Archbishop Donnellan served as a member of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and helped draft the 1986 pastoral letter ''Economic Justice for All: Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy.''
        The Archbishop's stroke in May prevented him from participating in activities surrounding Pope John Paul II's recent trip through the Southeast. The Pope telephoned Archbishop Donnellan during a stop in Columbia, S.C.
        Archbishop Donnellan was born Jan. 24, 1914, in New York. After his ordination in June 1939, he served at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and on the staff of Francis Cardinal Spellman.
        He was named in 1962 to head his alma mater, St. Joseph's Seminary, and in 1962 became bishop of Ogdensburg, N.Y. He took over the Atlanta Archdiocese in 1968.
