        Dr. Paul C. Agnew, a psychiatrist who headed the Dannemora and Matteawan correctional centers in upstate New York in the 1970's, died of pneumonia yesterday at the University of Vermont Hospital in Burlington. He was 66 years old and lived in Plattsburg, N.Y.
        Dr. Agnew, who was born in Plattsburg, was a graduate of Williams College and received his medical degree from McGill University in Montreal before training in psychiatry at the Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He served in the United States Army as a Signal Corps lieutenant in World War II.
        After private psychiatric practice in Highland Park, Ill., he joined the New York State Department of Correctional Services, serving first at Dannemora, now the Clinton Correctional Facility, and later at Matteawan, now the Fishkill Correctional Facility. In 1974 he resigned after a patient died while being restrained in a manner contrary to departmental regulations.
        Dr. Agnew returned to private practice and served on the faculty of the University of Vermont Medical School.
        He is survived by a son, Paul, of Canaan, N.H.; two daughters, Eleanor de Chacon of Savannah, Ga., and Diana Blais of Burlington, Vt.; a brother, the Rev. John C. Agnew of Milford, Mass., and seven grandchildren.
