        Milton Charles Nahm, professor emeritus of philosophy at Bryn Mawr College, died Monday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Pennsylvania. He was 87 years old and lived in Rosemont, Pa.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        Dr. Nahm joined the philosophy faculty at Bryn Mawr in 1930. He was named a professor in 1945 and in 1970 became the Leslie Clark Professor in the humanities.
        He was chairman of the philosophy department from 1946 until he retired in 1972, when he was named professor emeritus.
        Dr. Nahm received undergraduate and graduate degrees at the University of Pennsylvania and two additional undergraduate degrees at Oxford University, England, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar. In 1933, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania.
        He wrote five books, including "Selections from Early Greek Philosophy," first published in 1934 by Crofts and which went through four editions. He was an officer in the American Philosophical Association.
        There are no immediate survivors.
