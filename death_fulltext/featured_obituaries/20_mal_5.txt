        Hans Lewy, a professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley, died of leukemia Aug. 23 in Berkeley, where he lived. He was 83 years old.
        Dr. Lewy, a native of Breslau, Germany, received a doctorate in mathematics at the age of 22 from the University of Gottingen. He came to the United States when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and joined the faculty at Berkeley in 1935.
        In 1950, Dr. Lewy, along with several other tenured professors at Berkeley, refused to sign a loyalty oath required by the university's board of trustees, and he was discharged. He was reinstated when the courts ruled that the oath violated the professors' civil rights.
        Dr. Lewy retired in 1972 but continued to lecture at Berkeley until 10 weeks before his death. His work in differential equations contributed to the development of high-speed computers. He was also prominent in the fields of geometry, analysis and hydrodynamics.
        He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1964 was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He received the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize in 1979 and the Wolf Foundation Award in Mathematics, an international prize established in Israel, in 1985.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Crosby; a son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a brother, Rudolph, of Haifa, Israel.
