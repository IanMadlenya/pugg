        Brian C. Campbell, an artist and former gallery director, died on Sunday at his home in Provincetown, Mass. He was 43.
        The cause was complications of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Campbell was the former husband of Mary D. Fisher, who addressed the Republican National Convention last year on AIDS, speaking as a woman infected with the virus. President George Bush appointed her to the National Commission on AIDS.
        Mr. Campbell specialized in cubist oil and water color painting and for several years was a gallery director in Boca Raton, Fla.
        Survivors include his parents, Stewart and Margaret; two sons, Max and Zachary; three sisters, Helen Magliozzi, Christine Campbell and Maureen Kauppinen, and two brothers, Bruce and Stewart.
