        Dr. Alfred Thompson Eade, an artist and the author of five religious books, died April 7 in Grants Pass, Ore. He was 96 years old. Next month his publisher will re-issue Dr. Eade's first book, published in 1941, for which Dr. Eade recently rendered the original black-and-white illustrations in full color.
        That book is ''The New Panorama Bible Study Course,'' a pictorial Bible study aid that has sold more than 200,000 copies and has been printed in 14 languages and 10 dialects. Dr. Eade wrote three other books in what became known as the Panorama Bible Series published by the Fleming H. Revell Company, and all of them remain in print. He also wrote and illustrated ''The Expanded Panorama Bible Study Course,'' published in 1961, which is also still in print.
        Norma F. Chimento, the director of public relations for Revell, said that Dr. Eade continued to write and illustrate almost until the day of his death.
        Dr. Eade, born in London on Nov. 17, 1891, became a commercial artist before moving to Canada, where he enlisted in the army during World War I. He was an infantryman, and was wounded in Belgium in 1917.
        After the war, Dr. Eade moved to California, where during his recuperation he painted, gave art lessons and became an avid student of the Bible. The Panorama Bible Series grew out of his teaching the Bible by illustrating the sequence of biblical events on the blackboard.
        Dr. Eade is survived by two daughters, Joyce Coats and Vivian Ruth Coltz, both of Oregon.
