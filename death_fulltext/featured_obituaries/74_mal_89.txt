        James Joseph Dickman, retired president of the New York Shipping Association, died on Saturday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital. He was 66 and lived in Tenafly, N.J.
        The association said the cause of death was heart and lung failure.
        Mr. Dickman, who started working on the docks as a teen-ager, played a key role in ushering in a new era of labor relations on East Coast waterfronts. He was the chief management representative in contract talks leading to the longshore settlement of 1974, the first in decades that was reached without a strike.
        His union counterpart in the bargaining was the head of the International Longshoremen's Association, A.F.L.-C.I.O., Thomas W. Gleason. Mr. Gleason died last December at the age of 92. Containerized Cargo
        Together, they witnessed the arrival of containerized cargo handling in the maritime industry. The new technology raised productivity greatly and cut the need for manual labor on the docks. Mr. Dickman and Mr. Gleason were given credit for the compromise that let technology take hold in exchange for substantial benefits for the smaller work force that remained.
        Mr. Dickman was born in Brooklyn. He served in the Marine Corps in World War II and then returned to work at the Port of New York. In the mid-1950's, he joined Universal Terminal and Stevedoring Corporation, one of the largest terminal operators, and served as its president, chairman and chief executive officer until 1972.
        That year he became the full-time president of the New York Shipping Association. He retired from this position eight years ago.
        Mr. Dickman is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Karen Karach; a daughter, Andrea Kamargo of Chevy Chase, Md.; a son, Jeffrey, also of Tenafly; two brothers, Fred of Highland Park, Ill., and Richard of Sarasota, Fla.; a sister, Laurel Hart of Pompano Beach, Fla., and two grandsons.
