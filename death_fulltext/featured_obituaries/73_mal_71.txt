        Msgr. Marion J. Reinhardt, an expert on Roman Catholic canon law who helped to formulate new standards for marriage annulment, died on Wednesday at the North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 77 and lived in Hicksville, L.I.
        Heart failure was the cause of death, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Diocese said.
        From 1961 to 1981 Monsignor Reinhardt served as the administrative judge of the Brooklyn Diocese's Tribunal, which rules on annulments. He helped to develop a code that was adopted in the United States in 1970 and helped to form the basis of a new international code issued by Pope John Paul II in 1983.
        Monsignor Reinhardt was also a lawyer and law professor who taught at St. John's University from 1963 to 1990.
        He was born in Hicksville, and was educated at Cathedral College in Brooklyn, Immaculate Conception Seminary in Huntington, L.I., Catholic University of America in Washington, Almo Collegio in Rome and St. John's Law School. He was ordained in 1941.
        There are no immediate survivors.
