        Mr, Bell spent more than two decades and $300,000 creating the giant creatures on an otherwise desolate stretch of Interstate 10 near Palm Springs. The dinosaurs, a 150-ton, concrete brontosaurus named Dinney and a 100-ton tyrannosaurus named Rex, can be seen for miles by travelers on the desert route between Phoenix and Los Angeles.
        Mr. Bell, a retired sculptor for Knott's Berry Farm amusement park in Orange County, was in his mid-60's when he first began building the steel-framed brontosaurus on 60 acres of desert land he owned at Cabazon.
        It was meant to be the first of several figures in his Dinosaur Garden theme park. Plans to add a giant mastodon and a saber-toothed tiger are on the drawing board.
        Mr. Bell is survived by his wife, Anna Marie, a son, 5 daughters, 14 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.
