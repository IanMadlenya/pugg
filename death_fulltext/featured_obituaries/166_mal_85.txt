        Joseph Hirsh, an authority on alcoholism who taught at medical schools, died last Tuesday at his home in Norwalk, Conn. He was 85.
        Dr. Hirsh, whose doctorate was in education, was executive secretary of the National Research Council's Committee on Problems of Alcohol from 1949 to 1952.
        His 1949 book, ''The Problem Drinker,'' was praised in a New York Times review as ''a forthright, concise and helpful examination of an insidious scourge.''
        In the book, Dr. Hirsh wrote that more legislation for the rehabilitation of the problem drinker was essential.
        His other books include ''Alcohol Education: A Guide Book for Teachers'' (1952) and ''Public Health and Social Aspects of Alcoholism'' (1953).
        He was assistant dean for student affairs and a professor of preventive medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the 1950's and 1960's and taught at Temple University's medical school in the 1960's and 1970's.
        A native of the Bronx, he received a bachelor's degree from City College, a master's degree from Columbia and his doctorate from New York University.
        His 1938 marriage to Selma L. Goldstone ended in divorce in 1960.
        Surviving are his wife of 38 years, Eva Hauptmann Hirsh; two daughters, Lisa Hirsh of Boston and Donna Hirsh Geller of London; two brothers, Gene Martel of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Howard, of Great Neck, N.Y.; a sister, Ruth Emanuel of White Plains; and two granddaughters.
