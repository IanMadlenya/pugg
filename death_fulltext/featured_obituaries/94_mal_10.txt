        Richard Charles Bollig, a dance accompanist and choral singer, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Manhattan. He was 51.
        The cause was AIDS, said Susan Paul, a friend.
        Mr. Bollig was born in Sleepy Eye, Minn., and graduated from the University of Minnesota. In New York City, he accompanied the ballet classes of such notable teachers as Margaret Craske and Finus Jhung. He also played at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center.
        Mr. Bollig was also a voice teacher, and he sang with the New York Philharmonic and the David Jones Opera Ensemble of New York.
        He is survived by his mother and five brothers and sisters, all of Sleepy Eye.
