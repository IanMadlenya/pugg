        Henry Lee Munson, retired president of H. L. Munson & Company, a Manhattan fund-raising and public relations concern, died on Sunday at his son's home in Orono, Me. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Munson died of emphysema, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Munson's company raised $10.5 million for the Manhattan School of Music, enabling it to buy the old Juilliard building at 120 Claremont Avenue.
        From 1958 to 1961, he was co-founder, vice president and secretary of the public relations concern of G. A. Brakely & Company, now Brakely, John Price Jones. Earlier he had been director of publicity for the Wool Bureau. He retired in 1986.
        He was the campaign manager of four successful political campaigns for Representative Joseph Clark Baldwin, a New York Republican. In 1948, he was national coordinator of the Draft Eisenhower League.
        In World War II, he served as an aide to Maj. Gen. Leven C. Allen, chief of staff for Gen. Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group.
        He is survived by three sons, Henry Jr., of Orono, Nicholas, of Columbus, Md., and Stefan, of Newport, Ore.; a daughter, Anne Troemmer of Strathsmere, N.J.; a brother, Lawrence S., of Manhattan; a sister, Marian Pasquet of Winchester, Va., and nine grandchildren.

        An obituary headline yesterday about Henry Lee Munson, a retired fund-raising executive, misstated his age. He was 79.
