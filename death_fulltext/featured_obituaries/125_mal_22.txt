        Alexander P. Kazhdan, an authority on Byzantium who edited a three-volume dictionary on that subject, died on May 29 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. He was 74 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press said.
        Dr. Kazhdan had been a senior research associate for 18 years at the Center for Byzantine Studies at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington. He was the chief editor of the 2,232-page Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (Oxford University Press, 1991). When it was published, it was called ''a major breakthrough'' in Byzantine studies by John Julius Norwich, the British historian of Byzantium.  In an interview then, Dr. Kazhdan, who moved from the Soviet Union in 1979, said that by studying the Byzantine Empire, which had a long line of rulers before its capital fell to the Turks in 1453, ''we can study how the totalitarian organism works.''
        He was born in Moscow and received his doctorate there from the Academy of Sciences' Institute for History. But for years he held only  provincial teaching posts ''because of anti-Semitic discrimination in the U.S.S.R.,'' according to a biographical sketch made public at Dumbarton Oaks after his death.
        When Stalinist repression eased, he returned to Moscow, where he did research from 1956 to 1978 at the Academy of Sciences' Institute for Universal History. His many writings include the book ''People and Power in Byzantium'' (Dumbarton Oaks, 1982), of which Giles Constable was a co-author.
        He is survived by his wife, Rimma; a son, David, of Boston, and four grandchildren.
