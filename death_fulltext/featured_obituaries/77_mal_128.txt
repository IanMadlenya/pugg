        James Robinson Pierce, a publishing consultant to Sports Afield magazine and brother of Barbara Bush, the former First Lady, died on Tuesday at his home in Katonah, N.Y. He was 71.
        He died after a long illness, said his son Scott Pierce 3d.
        The son of Marvin Pierce, chairman of McCall's Corporation, Mr. Pierce spent his entire career in the publishing business. For the last seven years he was a consultant to Sports Afield, a Hearst publication.

        He was born in New York City and grew up in Rye, N.Y., graduating from the Taft School in 1942 and Bowdoin College in 1946. He was a strong athlete, lettering at each school in four varsity sports: hockey, baseball, football and track.
        During World War II, he served in both the Army and the Navy.
        Besides his sister, Barbara Bush, and son, Scott, both of Houston, he is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Margaret Belle Dyer; a daughter, Margaret Peters of Rye; two other sons, Marvin Pierce 2d of Pensacola Beach, Fla., and James R. Pierce Jr. of Houston; another sister, Martha Rafferty of Bloomfield, Conn.; a brother, Scott Pierce of Rye, and seven grandchildren.
