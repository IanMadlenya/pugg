        Alain Poire, a legendary figure in the French movie industry who produced more than 250 films during a 55-year career, died on Jan. 14 at his home in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine. He was 82.
        Mr. Poire, who spent most of his life working for Gaumont and was director of Gaumont International for the last 40 years, always had an eye for movies with box office appeal. Most recently, he produced Francis Veber's ''Diner de Cons,'' released in the United States as ''The Dinner Game,'' which was France's most popular movie in 1999.
        Born in Paris on Feb. 13, 1917, Mr. Poire studied law and worked in publicity and theater direction before entering the movie industry when France was liberated in 1944. In the 1950's, he produced movies by Sacha Guitry, Robert Bresson and Roberto Rossellini, although Mr. Poire pointedly steered clear of the young directors who brought the French New Wave in the late 1950's and 60's.
        His taste for the commercial, though, did not dissuade him from backing four screen versions of Marcel Pagnol's stories of his childhood in Provence. And Mr. Poire's instinct proved right. All four films -- Claude Berri's ''Jean de Florette'' and ''Manon des Sources'' in 1986 and Yves Robert's ''Gloire de Mon Pere'' and ''Le Chateau de Ma Mere'' in 1990 -- were box office successes in France and widely seen abroad.
        Mr. Poire is survived by his wife, Yvette, and two sons, Jean-Marie and Philippe. Jean-Marie Poire directed ''Les Visiteurs,'' Philippe Poire is president of Expand, a French television production company.
        Mr. Poire continued to work until close to his death. His final film, ''La Vache et le President,'' or ''The Cow and the President,'' will be released shortly. And he was preparing a new film starring Gerard Depardieu and Daniel Auteuil.
