        Kenneth L. Kendrick, a former art director of The New York Times Magazine, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 43 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Kendrick died of complications of AIDS, said Owen Hartley, his companion.
        Mr. Kendrick was born in Hemingway, S.C. He attended high school in Metter, Ga., the University of Georgia in Athens and Pratt Institute in New York City. In 1971, he graduated from the Atlanta College of Art.

        In 1982, he was named assistant art director of The New York Times Magazine, and two years later he was promoted to art director.
        In late 1986, Mr. Kendrick resigned to freelance. He supervised the redesign of Self magazine and designed a poster for Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign against drugs.
        Mr. Kendrick received awards including gold medals from the New York Art Directors Club, the Society of Publication Design, the American Institute of Graphic Arts and the Society of Newspaper Design.
        Besides Mr. Hartley, Mr. Kendrick is survived by his parents, K. L. and Carrie Kendrick of Eldridge, Ala., and two sisters, Agatha K. Key of Douglasville, Ga., and Jimmie Carol Tucker of Brandon, Fla.
