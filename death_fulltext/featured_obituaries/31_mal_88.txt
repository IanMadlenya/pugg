        Tim Richmond, a former Indianapolis 500 rookie-of-the-year driver whose subsequent stock-car racing career was cut short by controversy and illness, died Sunday. He was 34 years old.
        Dr. David Dodson, Mr. Richmond's physician, said today that Mr. Richmond died at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. Citing the wishes of the family, Dr. Dodson declined to give the cause of death.
        Mr. Richmond led the Nascar Winston Cup circuit with seven victories in 1986. A year later, he said he had contracted pneumonia.
        His career ended when Nascar suspended him before the 1988 season-opening Daytona 500 after a drug test showed excessive amounts of two nonprescription drugs found in over-the-counter remedies for allergies and respiratory conditions. He passed a subsequent drug test and was reinstated, but was not able to get a car. Recently in Motorcycle Accident
        Mr. Richmond, who lived in southern Florida, had been hospitalized recently for injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, according to Dr. Jerry Punch, a friend of the driver.
        Mr. Richmond drove Indy cars and was the Indy 500 rookie of the year in 1980 before switching to stock cars. He had 13 career victories, including two immediately after returning from a layoff due to illness in 1987.
        He sued the stock-car sanctioning body in April 1988 for suspending him after a drug test. An out-of-court settlement was reached later that year.
        In his last public appearance, at a news conference at Daytona Beach, Fla., in February 1988, Mr. Richmond denied having abused drugs and said a mistake had been made in the test he failed. Mr. Richmond's last race was the Champion Spark Plug 400 at Michigan International Raceway in August 1987.
