        William Glover, a longtime drama critic for The Associated Press, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
        Beginning in 1960, Mr. Glover reviewed theater for the Associated Press for 18 years, covering Broadway, Off Broadway and theater in 28 states and 20 countries. When he retired in 1978, Variety reported that his reviews had appeared in 1,700 American newspapers.
        For many years he waited until opening night to write his review instead of attending a preview. He became known for making a quick dash to the exit after the final curtain, rushing to his office to write his often pithy reviews in an hour.
        Mr. Glover was born in New York City and graduated from Rutgers University. He began his career in 1933 at The Asbury Park Press and was city editor there for four years before joining The Associated Press. In World War II he served in the Maritime Service. After the war, he returned to The Associated Press, where he held various positions before becoming a critic, occasionally also reviewing movies. He was a former president of the New York Drama Critics Circle and was on the Tony Award nominating committee.
        Writing about the art of criticism, he said, ''No one is immune to the urge to judge, censure, improve and even occasionally admire the deeds of others.''
        After his retirement, he worked as a volunteer on archival science projects at the American Museum of Natural History.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia, and by a sister, Grace Nye, of Pensacola, Fla.
