        Sir David Piper, an internationally known art historian and museum director, died on Saturday at his home in Wytham, near Oxford. He was 72 years old and had emphysema.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Between 1964 and 1985, Sir David directed three of Britain's finest museums, the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. He had spent an 18-year apprenticeship at the National Portrait Gallery before becoming its director.
        His most widely praised books and art catalogues included "The English Face" in 1957, a study of portraits and the relationship between artist and model. He was also editor of "The Random House Library of Painting and Sculpture," a four-volume reference work published in 1981.
        Sir David's "Companion Guide to London," published in 1964, captured the atmosphere of the British capital and was ranked among the best guides to the city.
        He also wrote novels under the pseudonym Peter Towry.  He was in the Indian army during World War II and was a prisoner of the Japanese for three years, an experience he put into his 1959 novel, "Trial by Battle."
        He is survived by his wife, Anne, a son and three daughters.
