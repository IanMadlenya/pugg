        Dr. James Hugh Kidder, a retired surgeon, Army medical officer and dean emeritus of the Fordham University School of Pharmacy, died Friday at the Kingsbridge Veterans Hospital in the Bronx. He was 85 years old and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, having returned there from Washington last July.
        Dr. Kidder rose to brigadier general in 1959, when he held mobilization status as special assistant to the Army Surgeon General for Reserve affairs. Called to service as a captain in World War II, he was executive and commanding officer at evacuation hospitals in the Pacific and in Europe.
        He was a native of New York City, graduated from Fordham in 1924 and earned his medical degree at the Cornell Medical School in 1928. He returned to Fordham to head its School of Pharmacy in 1932 but resigned in 1956 because of his Army duties.
        Dr. Kidder is survived by two sisters, Marianne Kidder of the Bronx and Rebecca Kidder Land of Huntington, W. Va., and a brother, Jerome, of Scarsdale, N.Y.
