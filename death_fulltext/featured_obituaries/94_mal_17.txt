        Richard Krautheimer, the author of influential works on early Christian, medieval and Renaissance art and architecture, died on Tuesday in Rome, where he lived. He was 97.
        The cause was heart failure, said Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a colleague.
        Mr. Krautheimer was born in Furth, Bavaria, and entered the University of Munich at the age of 15, intending to study law. Inspired by the teaching of Heinrich Wolfflin and Paul Frankl, he switched to art history, and he later studied under Adolf Goldschmidt in Berlin. He received a doctorate from the University of Halle in Wittenberg in 1923 and, after doing research at the Inventory of Monuments in Efurt, was a lecturer at the University of Marburg, a position he lost in 1933 when the Nazis came into power.
        Leaving Germany, he took up residence in Rome, where he began work on "The Corpus of Early Christian Basilicas of Rome," a five-volume work that was 50 years in the making. In 1935 he immigrated to the United States, where he was invited to teach at the University of Louisville. In 1937, he accepted a teaching post at Vassar College, where he taught until 1952, and in 1938 he began lecturing at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts. He became an adjunct professor of art history at the institute in 1948 and a full professor in 1952. From 1942 to 1944, he was a senior research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services.
        In addition to hundreds of scholarly articles and reviews, he wrote many books, beginning with two works in German on the churches of the mendicant orders in Germany and on medieval synagogue architecture. His works in English include "Lorenzo Ghiberti" (written with his wife, Trude Krautheimer-Hess, and published in 1956), "Studies in Early Christian, Medieval and Renaissance Art" (1969), "Ghiberti's Bronze Doors" (1971) and three works on urban history: "Rome: Portrait of a City" (1980), "Three Christian Capitals" (1983) and "The Rome of Alexander VII" (1985). His "Early Christian and Byzantine Architecture" (1965) won the Alice David Hitchcock Award of the Society of Architectural Historians. In 1989, he published his memoirs, "Gladly Did He Learn and Gladly Teach."
        In April 1994, he was made an honorary citizen of Rome.
        He is survived by a sister, Lotte Friedman of Solna, Sweden, and a half-brother, Paul Erlich of London.
