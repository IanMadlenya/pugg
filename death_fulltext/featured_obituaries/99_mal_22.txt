        Harald Raudsepp, the longtime editor of the newspaper Free Estonian Word, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 91 and lived in the Inwood section of Manhattan.
        The cause was a stroke, a family friend, Juhan Jaakson, said.
        Mr. Raudsepp, who was born in Puiatu, Estonia, in 1903, studied at Tartu University and wrote for newspapers in the Estonian cities of Valca and Tallinn in the 1930's. When Soviet troops invaded the country in World War II, he went into hiding.
        In 1944, Mr. Raudsepp and his wife fled to a refugee camp in Wiesbaden, Germany. Five years later, they immigrated to the United States. He worked for four months as a janitor at a hospital in Manhattan before he was hired by Free Estonian Word, a weekly Estonian-language newspaper that was then just a year old.
        Mr. Raudsepp spent the next 45 years writing more than 2,000 articles and editorials for the newspaper. During the cold war era, he arranged for dispatches to be smuggled out of Estonia and sent to him through Helsinki. For years, Communist newspapers condemned his editorials, which railed against the Soviet occupation and the Russification of Estonia.
        In recent years, Mr. Raudsepp's newspaper has faced an aging readership and declining circulation -- about 3,000 households subscribe now compared to 4,000 in 1985. To increase readership, he added two pages of articles in English in 1991 and began to cover events in New York's Estonian community.
        Mr. Raudsepp was a well-known figure among Estonian immigrants, organizing cultural events and speaking out on Estonian politics. In the 1950's, he helped found the Estonian National Committee, an organization that keeps politicians informed about issues in Estonia. He remained active on the committee until his death, and attended numerous receptions at the White House.
        Mr. Raudsepp's wife, Eugenia, died in 1988.
