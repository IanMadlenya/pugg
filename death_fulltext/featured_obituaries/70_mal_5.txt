        Daniel L. Klayman, the longtime head of the organic chemistry section of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, died on Thursday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 63 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        He died of a heart attack that he suffered at home, said a cousin, Arnold Nachmanoff.
        Dr. Klayman was an authority on drugs to combat malaria and a wide variety of other diseases and on drugs to combat radiation sickness. He held 15 United States patents on drugs he developed. A native of the Inwood section of Manhattan, he earned a doctorate in organic chemistry from Rutgers University in 1956, taught at Hofstra University and joined the institute in 1959. He is survived by his wife, the former Dora Basch; a daughter, Wanda, and a son, Elliott, both of Washington, and his father, Harry, of Silver Spring.
