        Jeanne F. Bernkopf, who edited "Scarlett" and many other best-selling books, died on Monday in Manhattan.  She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She was stricken and died while riding in a taxi, her family said. No exact cause of death has been determined.
        Mrs. Bernkopf edited Kitty Kelley's unauthorized biographies on Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra as well as Alexandra Ripley's "Scarlett," the sequel to "Gone with the Wind."
        Several prominent writers sought her to edit their work. Joseph A. Wambaugh, for example, used her on a score of his books. Ms. Kelley and the novelist James Clavell specified in their publishing contracts that Mrs. Bernkopf be their editor. Other popular authors she edited included Michael Korda, Erich Segal, Wayne Dyer, Joshua Logan, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Bach and Robert Ludlum.
        "She was really an author's editor -- strict but loving," said Lawrence Hughes, the former president of William Morrow & Company, one of the publishers for whom she worked. The others included Delacorte, Dell, Dutton, MacMillan and Bantam. She also worked as a freelance editor.
        Mrs. Bernkopf was born in Manhattan and grew up there and in Woodmere, L.I. After graduating from Smith College, she went directly into publishing.
        Surviving are her husband, Michael, a mathematics professor at Pace University; three stepchildren, David of Manhattan, Daniel of Highland Park, Ill., and Donald of Brooklyn, and three brothers, Charles Frank of Ardsley, N.Y., and Howard and Edward Frank, both of Boston.
