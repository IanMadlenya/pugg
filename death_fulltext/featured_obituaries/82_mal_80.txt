        Frederick R. Wierdsma, a former general manager of the Holland-America Line whose family was associated with the steamship company since the 1800's, died on Sunday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 88.
        He had been ill for some time, his family said.
        Mr. Wierdsma, who retired in 1965, was general manager for 42 years, except during World War II, when he served in the Army. He entered the Army as a private and rose to major, earning a Bronze Star.
        Mr. Wierdsma's wife, the former Frances Lowden, daughter of an Illinois governor, Frank O. Lowden, died before him.
        He is survived by three sons, John, of Locust Valley, L.I., and Frederick and David, both of Greenwich, Conn.; three stepchildren and nine grandchildren.
