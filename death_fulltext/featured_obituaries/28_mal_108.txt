        From 1965 to 1979 Mr. Wilder's Los Angeles gallery was a lively and discriminating showcase for new art in the United States. He exhibited the work of major figures from New York, among them Barnett Newman, Jules Olitski, Helen Frankenthaler, Kenneth Noland and Cy Twombly. He also championed California artists, including Joe Goode, David Hockney, Don Bachardy, Alexis Smith, William Brice, Ed Moses and Kenneth Price.
        Mr. Wilder helped form several major California collections and, as a visiting lecturer at Stanford University, he also taught art to law students. But in 1979, he closed the gallery and came to New York, where he sold art on a private basis and began a new career as a painter. He had his first one-man show in 1986, at the James Corcoran Gallery in Los Angeles. In New York he was represented by the Max Protech Gallery. His last show was at the Compassrose Gallery in Chicago in October 1988.
        Nicholas Walter George Wilder was born in Rochester. He graduated from Amherst College in 1960 and studied toward a law degree at Stanford University, before deciding to enter the art field.
        He is survived by his mother, Gladys, of Rochester; a sister, Anne Zimmer, of Arlington, Va., and a brother, Michael.
