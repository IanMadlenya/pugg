        Dr. E. Stanley Crawford, who helped develop new techniques in cardiovascular surgery, died Tuesday at the Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 70 years old and lived in Houston.
        Dr. Crawford died of respiratory failure from the effects of a stroke suffered in 1990, a son, Bruce G. Crawford of Houston, said yesterday.
        As a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine since 1956, Dr. Crawford was part of a group of specialists at that institution who individually and together made new advances in heart surgery and the treatment of heart disease. His longtime colleagues included Dr. Michael E. De Bakey, Dr. William S. Fields, Dr. Denton A. Cooley and Dr. George C. Morris Jr. Expert on Aorta Ailment
        Dr. Crawford developed new techniques for the treatment of extensive aneurysm disease of the aorta, the main artery of the body. He was a co-inventor of the Baylor Rapid Autologus Transfusion System, a machine that recycles a patient's red blood cells during surgery, which reduces the number of transfusions needed during chest and aneurysm surgery.
        Dr. Crawford was born and reared in Evergreen, Ala., and was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Alabama in 1943. He received his medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1946, served in the Navy from 1947 to 1949 and completed his post-graduate surgical training at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1954. He joined the faculty at Baylor that year and became a full professor in 1956.
        Dr. Crawford's textbook, "Diseases of the Aorta," is a widely used reference source in the field.
        Besides his son Bruce, Dr. Crawford is survived by his wife, Carolyn; a daughter, Carolyn, of San Antonio; two other sons, Clay E. Crawford of Dallas and Dr. John L. Crawford of Fort Worth, and nine grandchildren.
