        Mr. Trivers, who was born in New York, retired from the State Department in 1969. He had been a visiting or adjunct political science professor at Ball State University here since 1972.

        He joined the State Department's Central European division in 1941, and during the postwar occupation of Germany he dealt with economic, information, administrative and political problems in that divided country.
        He also took part in international negotiations and conferences, including Potsdam, the Moscow Conference in 1947 and the Paris meeting of foreign ministers that ended the Berlin blockade in 1949.
        Mr. Trivers helped develop policy relating to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 as director of the State Department's Office of Research and Analysis for Sino-Soviet Bloc.
