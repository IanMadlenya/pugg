        Lawrence Jay Taylor, a music librarian, producer and singer, died on March 18 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 44 years old.
        He died of lymphomic cancer, his companion, Billy Matthews, said.
        Mr. Taylor was the printing coordinator of the Chelsea Music Service, which handled the music for "Les Miserables," "Phantom of the Opera" and other Broadway shows. He also was music librarian for Liza Minnelli, Chita Rivera, Roberta Peters and other artists.
        As a producer, he handled many benefits for the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York and on Fire Island, and produced an evening of the music of Fred Astaire, which played in New York and on cruise ships.
        There are no immediate survivors.
