        Paul Dwight Doolen, a retired insurance executive and a former foundation chairman, died Friday at a nursing center in Eustis, Fla. He was 85 years old and lived in Mount Dora, Fla.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his daughter, Deborah Ittel of Greenwich, Conn., said.
        Mr. Doolen was chairman of the Chicago-based John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, one of the country's largest private foundations, from its inception in 1978 until his retirement in 1984. He had also been president of the Retirement Research Foundation in Oak Park, Ill.
        A 1931 graduate of Harvard Law School, Mr. Doolen practiced law in Chicago and Waukegan, Ill. In 1952 at the insistence of John MacArthur, who was a client of the Waukegan law firm, he joined the Bankers Life and Casualty Company as vice chairman of the board and chairman of the executive committee. He became president and chief executive in 1958 and retired from those positions in 1978 to head the newly formed MacArthur Foundation.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Estine ; a son, Mark of Chicago, and two granddaughters.
