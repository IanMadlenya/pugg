        Thomas R. Ricketts, the longtime chairman and chief executive of the Standard Federal Bancorporation Inc. of Troy, Mich., the nation's 10th-largest savings and loan association, died on Tuesday. He was 66.
        Mr. Ricketts, who lived in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., died of abdominal cancer, the company said.
        Mr. Ricketts had been active in Detroit-area civic affairs for decades. He was the chairman of the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce and served on the board of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra.
        The banker began his career at Standard Federal after graduating from the University of Michigan School of Law, and worked his way up to the top post in 1974. During Mr. Ricketts's years with the savings and loan, which is based in the Detroit suburb of Troy, Mich., it grew from $96 million in assets to $15.18 billion in assets.
        Mr. Ricketts negotiated the savings and loan's pending purchase by ABN-Amro Holding N.V. of the Netherlands. The $1.9 billion deal is scheduled to close on May 1, when Mr. Ricketts was due to retire as chief executive; he was to have stayed as chairman.
        Mr. Ricketts's wife of 40 years, Priscilla, died on March 27, three days after she was run over by a hit-and-run driver. She was loading groceries into her car at a suburban grocery store when she was struck.  The police are investigating her death, and say she may have been a robbery victim because her purse was missing.
        Mr. Ricketts is survived by a son, Robert Ricketts of Plano, Tex.; a daughter, Karen Struck of Irvine, Calif.; a brother, Richard F. Ricketts, and a grandchild.
