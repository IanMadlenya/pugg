        Herman Starobin, a former research director of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and a critic of free-trade policies, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 75 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was heart disease, his wife, Carol Fijan Starobin, said.
        After a career as a corporate economist and a manufacturing executive, Mr. Starobin became research director of the union in 1984. He became an expert on international trade and advised Congress and the United States trade representative.
        Speaking out against free-trade policies, which he contended had led to the loss of many jobs in the garment industry, Mr. Starobin wrote in an article on imports and the garment industry in 1985: "We have a third world in this country. We are sacrificing that third world for some esoteric ideology of free  trade that bears no relationship to reality."
        He worked for the I.L.G.W.U., which recently merged with the Amalgamated Textile Workers Union to form the Union of Needle Trades Industrial and Textile  Employees, or Unite, until a month ago.
        Mr. Starobin grew up in New York and became involved in left-wing politics when he was a student at City College. After graduating, he spent several years  as a freelance correspondent in Europe in World War II. When Mr. Starobin returned in 1946, he took over his father's business, manufacturing steel doors. He also studied economics at New York University, from which he received  a doctorate.
        He joined Harman Industries, a maker of high-fidelity equipment, in 1969 as corporate economist and became its president. He left in 1984 after Beatrice Industries bought the company.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Christina Starobin of  Manhattan.
