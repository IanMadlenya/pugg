        Robert A. Wands, who received worldwide recognition for his photo coverage of events near the end of World War II, died on Friday at his home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 84.
        Mr. Wands took the famous photograph of Truman, Churchill and Stalin sitting together at the Potsdam conference in Germany. Two days later he was aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay, recording the scene as Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted the Japanese surrender.
        He moved to Sarasota in 1980 and spent much of his time making a photographic catalogue at Selby Gardens, the city's arboretum.
        Mr. Wands, who was born in Liverpool in 1909, settled in the United States in 1928. He became a photographer for The New York Times in 1931 and was working for Wide World Photos, which was owned by The Times, when it was sold to the Associated Press in 1941. He was a photo editor with The Associated Press from 1941 to 1969, with the exception of a three-year period in the United States Army Signal Corps.
        After his retirement he lived in St. Thomas, V.I., where he worked as a freelance photographer before moving to Sarasota.
        He is survived by his wife, Gene.
