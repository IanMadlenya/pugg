        Glenn C. Fowler, who was the real estate editor of The New York Times from 1956 to 1972 and worked at the paper for 36 years, died on Sept. 10 at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 77 and lived in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Jessica.
        Mr. Fowler joined The Times in 1955 and retired in 1991. He first covered retailing, women's apparel and textiles for its financial-business news department. He was also a rewriteman, a general assignment reporter and a political reporter at The Times's City Hall bureau and in Albany. Later assignments included writing obituaries.
        He wrote two books, ''How to Buy/ Sell a Home'' (1970) and ''The International Guide to Condominiums'' (1972).
        Glenn Crew Fowler was born in Manhattan and grew up there and in the Bronx. He graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, received a bachelor's degree from Columbia University in 1943 and then joined the wartime Navy, commanding a landing craft at the Normandy invasion and taking over another landing craft after its commander was killed and his own boat disabled.
        Before being hired by The Times, he worked for what is now United Press International and for Women's Wear Daily as a reporter and market news editor.
        In addition to his wife, Jessica, he is survived by a daughter, Kathryn, from his marriage to the former Joan Idestrom, who died before him.
