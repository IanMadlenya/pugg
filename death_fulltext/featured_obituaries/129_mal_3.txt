        Munir Bashir, a virtuoso oud player who was considered one of the greatest living masters of Arabic classical music, died on Sunday in Budapest. He was 67 and lived in Jordan.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to Helene Browning of the World Music Institute, which had been scheduled to present a New York concert by Mr. Bashir on Oct. 11.
        As both a performer on the oud, or Arab lute, and a scholar, Mr. Bashir was dedicated to maintaining the traditions of Arabic music. ''The moment I hold my oud,'' he wrote in liner notes to an album, ''I start a dialogue with life and its noblest aspects.''
        Mr. Bashir was born in Mosul, Iraq, into a family of musicians. His father taught him to play the oud, and he went on to study at the Institute of Arabian Music in Baghdad. He completed a doctorate in musicology in Budapest.
        Through four decades of touring, performing, recording and teaching, Mr. Bashir restored and upheld traditional Arabic compositions and performance, bringing a highly individualistic sense of improvisation to traditional structures. But he was also willing to collaborate with jazz and reggae musicians and, on one album, to explore connections between Arabic music and the roots of flamenco.
        Mr. Bashir founded the Arab Music Academy in Baghdad, and for many years was an artistic adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture. He also served as vice chairman of the International Music Council of Unesco and Secretary General of the Arab League's Arab Music Academy.
        He was named a Commander of the Order of Culture in France and received similar awards in Spain, Italy, Poland, Cuba and Jordan. In 1989 he was given the biennial Unesco-International Music Prize, which cited him for being ''in great part responsible for having reinstated pride in Arabic music during the postcolonial era.''
        He is survived by his wife and two sons.
