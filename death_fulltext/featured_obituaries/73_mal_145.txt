        Toy Talmadge Caldwell Jr., a founding member of the Marshall Tucker Band, died in his sleep on Wednesday at his home in Moore, S.C. He was 45.
        The Marshall Tucker Band, named after the piano tuner who owned the band's rehearsal hall, made 14 albums of easygoing Southern rock from 1973 to 1984; two sold more than a million copies each, and seven sold more than 500,000. Mr. Caldwell was the group's guitarist and main songwriter. Among the group's best-known songs were "Heard It in a Love Song," "Can't You See," "Take the Highway" and "This Ol' Cowboy."
        The members of the Marshall Tucker Band first came together in 1964, when Mr. Caldwell and two friends, Franklin Wilkie and George McCorkle, played in a band called the Rants. Mr. Caldwell served in Vietnam with the Marine Corps and was wounded in 1967. When he returned to Spartanburg, he formed the Toy Factory band with Mr. Wilkie, Doug Gray and Jerry Eubanks. Tommy Caldwell, his brother, joined in 1973 when Mr. Wilkie left and the band became the Marshall Tucker Band. After Two Deaths
        The band played at the inauguration of President Jimmy Carter in 1977. Its success waned after Tommy Caldwell died in an automobile accident in 1980, a month after another brother, Tim, died in an automobile accident.
        Mr. Caldwell left the band in 1984 after 15 years and resumed a solo career in 1989. Other band members continued to perform together under the Marshall Tucker name and in 1990 put out an album called "Southern Spirit." Mr. Caldwell put out an album, "Toy Caldwell," last year and performed around Spartanburg.
        He is survived by his wife, Abbie; two daughters, Cassady and Toy Geneal, and his father, Toy T. Caldwell Sr., all of Spartanburg.
