        The Rev. Henri J. M. Nouwen, a Dutch theologian who wrote more than 30 books on spiritual themes and taught at American universities before turning to live and work with the mentally disabled, died on Saturday in the Netherlands. He was 64.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Carl MacMillan, the director of development for L'Arche Daybreak Community in Toronto, where Father Nouwen had served as pastor.
        Father Nouwen was born in the Dutch town of Nijkerk. He was visiting professor at Notre Dame University in 1966, an associate professor at the Yale Divinity School from 1971 to 1978, and a professor at the Harvard Divinity School from 1983 to 1985.
        In 1986 he became pastor at L'Arche Daybreak Community in Toronto, the local branch of a nondenominational organization that operates residences for people with mental disabilities.
        He is survived by his father, Laurent Nouwen, two brothers and a sister, all of the Netherlands.
