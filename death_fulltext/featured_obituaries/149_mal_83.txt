        Neil Jacobson, a psychology professor at the University of Washington who was known for his research on domestic violence, marital therapy and depression, died on June 2 in his hotel room in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 50 and lived in Seattle.
        Dr. Jacobson died after a heart attack, said his wife, Virginia Rutter. He was in Las Vegas to deliver a lecture on domestic violence, she said.
        Dr. Jacobson spoke frequently about domestic violence and was an advocate of court-ordered treatment for men convicted of physically abusing women.
        He and a colleague at the University of Washington, John Gottman, conducted an eight-year study in which they observed couples fighting and gauged their emotional states and responses.
        They also wrote a book, ''When Men Batter Women: New Insights Into Ending Abusive Relationships'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998).
        Dr. Jacobson had two large clinical trials under way for depression treatments and for marital therapy.
        A book he wrote with Andrew Christensen of the University of California at Los Angeles, ''Reconcilable Differences,'' is scheduled to be published by Guilford in February.
        Dr. Jacobson was born on Feb. 23, 1949, in Milwaukee. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in psychology from the University of North Carolina in 1977. He taught for two years at the University of Iowa before joining the University of Washington psychology department in 1979.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Matthew Hempleman of Spokane, Wash.; two daughters, Emily and Jesse, both of Seattle; his parents, Lloyd and Marjorie Jacobson of Milwaukee, and two brothers, Tom, of Brooklyn, and John, of Milwaukee.
