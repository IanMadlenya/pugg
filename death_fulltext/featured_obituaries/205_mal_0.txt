        Merwin Bayer, a former president and chief executive of the Arnold Constable Corporation, the operator of what was long one of New York's finest luxury department stores, died Jan. 22 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88.
        Mr. Bayer, who lived in Manhattan, spent almost all of his career in retailing. He was hired as a clerk in the receiving department at Arnold Constable in 1933 and rose steadily through the ranks, becoming president and chief executive in 1965.
        Established in 1825, Arnold Constable had its headquarters and flagship store at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue. In the 1930's and 1940's, it became known as Eleanor Roosevelt's favorite store.
        Arnold Constable ran into hard times in the 1970's because of rising expenses, and it would have had to spend large sums to modernize its stores. Initially, the company responded by closing its suburban stores. But the pressures mounted, and in 1976 Arnold Constable closed its flagship store.
        Though the department stores ceased to exist, the company retained ownership of its much smaller No-Name Stores, which sold separates to women and men.
        Mr. Bayer led an expansion of the chain, which sprouted in shopping centers up and down the East Coast. Mr. Bayer was still running the chain when it was sold in the 1990's to YM Inc., a Canadian retail chain.
        Mr. Bayer is survived by his wife, Molly; a daughter, Virginia Bayer Hirt; and three grandchildren, all of Manhattan. A son, Hank, died before him.
