        Robert Randolph, a designer of sets and lighting for Broadway productions for three decades, died on March 2 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 76.
        The cause was heart failure, said Charles Guthrie, his companion.
        Mr. Randolph, who also did some costume designs, designed the lighting and scenery for the hit 1961 musical comedy ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.'' He did set and lighting designing for more than 80 productions and was nominated for eight Tony Awards.
        A native of Centerville, Iowa, Robert Steven Randolph received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa, where he specialized in art and art history.
        He moved to New York City in the early 1950's and won praise for work he did on his first big assignment, the set designs for Gian-Carlo Menotti's opera ''The Saint of Bleecker Street,'' which opened in 1954. The sets resembled the backgrounds of old religious paintings and made the actors seem like sculptures.
        Mr. Randolph also designed the scenery for the 1960 musical ''Bye Bye Birdie'' and the 1976 production of George Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess,'' among many others. He also did stage and lighting designs for 17 televised Tony Awards presentation ceremonies in Manhattan.
        Besides his companion, Mr. Guthrie, his survivors include a niece, Susan Luke of Urbandale, Iowa.
