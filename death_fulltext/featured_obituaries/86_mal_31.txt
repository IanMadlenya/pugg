        Edward Goodell, a New York lawyer and former Civil Court judge, died on Sunday at Montefiore Hospital. He was 91 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Goodell graduated from Columbia University and Columbia Law School and was in private practice from 1926 to 1968. For many of those years he served as counsel to the United Jewish Appeals and the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York.
        He was long associated with reform politics in New York City. In 1958, he was the Liberal Party candidate for state attorney general and drew nearly 280,000 votes with his campaign against machine politics. The race was won that fall by Louis J. Lefkowitz, the Republican candidate.
        Mr. Goodell was elected to the Civil Court of New York City as a Liberal-Independent in 1968 and served as an acting Supreme Court justice in the fall of 1971. He left the bench in 1973 and became executive director of the Hunter College Institute for Trial Judges, a forum for the discussion of the court system and social change. He filled that post for about seven years.
        He was a past trustee and treasurer of the City Club.
        Mr. Goodell is survived by his wife of 67 years, Miriam Herman Goodell; a daughter, Rozanne Weiss of Westport, Conn.; a sister, Nina Alper of Minneapolis; 10 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 10, 1994, Thursday
