        Edwyn Silberling, a New York prosecutor in the 1950's who became a top organized-crime fighter in the Kennedy Administration, died on Tuesday at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. A Huntington resident, he was 71.
        His family said the cause was complications from multiple sclerosis.
        Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller picked Mr. Silberling, a Democrat, in 1957 as a special assistant attorney general in charge of an investigation of governmental corruption in Suffolk County. He was credited by friends and critics alike for bringing down the county's Republican administration in the 1959 election.
        Mr. Silberling's work caught the attention of Robert F. Kennedy, the United States Attorney General, who enlisted him as chief of the organized crime section in the Department of Justice, where he headed a staff of 50 lawyers.
        After leaving public service in 1963, Mr. Silberling practiced law in Manhattan and on Long Island. He retired in 1990.
        He was born in Jersey City. Having graduated from Harvard College in 1947, Mr. Silbering received his law degree at Harvard in 1949.
        Mr. Silberling is survived by his wife of 47 years, Margaret Pargellis Silberling; two sons, Stephen P., of Huntington Bay, L.I., and Peter W., of Huntington; three daughters, Amy A., of Solana Beach, Fla., Elizabeth D. Sherman of Yarmouth, Me., and Louise S., of Ithaca, N.Y.; his mother, Rose Silberling of Manhattan; a brother, Sheldon, also of Manhattan, and three granddaughters.
