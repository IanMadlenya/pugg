        Bishop Vincent M. Leonard, who served from 1969 to 1983 as the ninth Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, died on Sunday at the Little Sisters of the Poor Home in Pittsburgh. He was 85 and a lifelong resident of the city.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, a spokesman for the diocese said.
        During his tenure, Bishop Leonard was on the Pro-Life Committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and on the Health Affairs Committee of the United States Catholic Conference. He also was a member of the board of Duquesne University and the boards of many other educational and medical institutions.
        Bishop Leonard graduated from Duquesne and attended seminary at St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pa. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1935 and became assistant chaplain at Mercy Hospital.
        He filled various posts in the diocese and was chancellor from 1951 to 1967. Pope Pius XII appointed him domestic prelate with the title of right reverend monsignor in 1952. He was consecrated a bishop in April 1964 after Pope Paul VI had named him Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh.
        Pope Paul VI appointed him Bishop of Pittsburgh in June 1969 after the death of John Cardinal Wright. Bishop Leonard retired in June 1983, and he was succeeded later that year by Bishop Anthony J. Bevilacqua.
        Pittsburgh's current Bishop, Donald W. Wuerl, said Bishop Leonard had to face the "many turbulent moments" that followed the Second Vatican Council, particularly in the 1970's.
        Bishop Leonard is survived by a sister, Regina Leonard of Pittsburgh.
