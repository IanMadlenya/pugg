        James R. Harvey, a former chairman, president and chief executive of the Transamerica Corporation, died yesterday at a hospital in San Francisco. He was  61 and lived in San Francisco and in Moraga, Calif.
        The cause was pneumonia, a company spokesman said. Mr. Harvey had been hospitalized since undergoing heart transplant surgery in April.
        He joined Transamerica in 1965 as assistant to the president and held various management positions before becoming president in 1979. Mr. Harvey was chief executive from 1981 to 1991 and also became chairman in 1983. He retired in 1995.
        In the 1980's, he oversaw a major restructuring of the diversified San Francisco-based company. As part of his strategy to pare the company down to its insurance and financial services businesses, the company sold assets like Budget Rent a Car, Transamerica Airlines, the Transamerica Delaval manufacturing unit and United Artists.
        Mr. Harvey, a native of Los Angeles, received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Princeton University and an M.B.A. from the University of California at Berkeley.
        He is survived by his wife, Charlene; four daughters, Kristina Dumke of Boston, Kjersten Darling of Montrose, Colo., Brita Dorst Gemmo of Vicenza, Italy, and Fiona Dorst of New York; a sister, Jane Curran of Pasadena, Calif., and four grandchildren.
