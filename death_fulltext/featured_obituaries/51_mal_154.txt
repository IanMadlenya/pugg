        Thomas A. Connolly, a retired Archbishop of Seattle who was the oldest Roman Catholic bishop in the United States, died Thursday at his home here. He was 91 years old and had been in poor health for several years.
        Archbishop Connolly headed the Seattle Archdiocese from 1948 to 1975, when he retired. He celebrated his 50th anniversary as a bishop in August 1989.
        He was known as an outspoken advocate of civil rights and as a builder who oversaw construction of more than 350 churches, schools, rectories, convents, parish halls and religious education centers. During his administration as Archbishop, 43 new Catholic parishes were established in the Northwest.
        A native of San Francisco, he was auxiliary bishop and chancellor of the Archdiocese of San Francisco before being appointed to the Seattle Archdiocese.
        His survivors include two sisters, one of whom is a nun.
