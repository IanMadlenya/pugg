        Richard Versalle, a tenor with the Metropolitan Opera whose silvery voice was known mostly in Europe, died in New York on Friday night after an accident on stage during the premiere of "The Makropulos Case," by Leos Janacek. He was 63.
        The cause of death has not been determined, said Mr. Versalle's manager, Tony George.
        Mr. Versalle, who, in the opening scene, was singing the role of Vitek, an elderly clerk in a law firm, fell 10 feet from a sliding ladder he had mounted to place a file for a century-old legal case back into its drawer. As he sang the words "Too bad you can only live so long," his voice faltered and he fell to the floor, landing on his back. Opera officials initially reported that he died  of a heart attack.
        Mr. Versalle, a member of the Metropolitan Opera since 1978, sang oratoria and the Italian and German repertory with opera companies and orchestras in Pompeii and Perugia, Italy, Jerusalem, Prague, Vienna and elsewhere. He has performed under conductors including Klaus Tennstedt, Zubin Mehta, Lorin Maazel  and Hans Vonk.
        In November, he played Jacob Schmidt in the Met's production of "The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny," by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. In 1992, he replaced Reiner Goldberg in the title role of "Tannhauser" at the Met, sang with the Brooklyn Philharmonic under Lukas Foss in 1991, sang Tristan in "Tristan und Isolde" with Madrid's Teatro de la Zarzuela at the Madrid Opera Festival in 1989.
        Mr. Versalle began his studies in the United States and performed primarily as a concert singer at the beginning of his career. His break came in 1985, Mr.  George said, when he debuted as "Tannhauser" at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, and earned international status.
        He is survived by his wife, Alexis, and a daughter, Tess, 11, both of Hendersonville, N.C., and three children from a previous marriage.
