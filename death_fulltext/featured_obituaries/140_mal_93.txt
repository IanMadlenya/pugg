        Minoru Niizuma, a sculptor and educator who taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School and Columbia University, died on Sept. 5 at the University Hospital and Medical Center of Stony Brook on Long Island. He was 67 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.
        The cause was a stroke, a family member said.
        Mr. Niizuma was born in Tokyo in 1930 and graduated from the National Tokyo University of Fine Arts in 1955. He moved to New York in 1959 and had his first solo show in New York City at the Howard Wise Gallery in 1966. He had retrospectives at the Seibu Museum of Art in Tokyo in 1976 and at the Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon in 1986.
        Mr. Niizuma taught at the Brooklyn Museum Art School from 1964 to 1970, then at Columbia University for 12 years.
        He worked predominantly in stone, especially marble, and was known for his sensitive use of its textures and veins. His designs ranged from the geometric to the organic and sometimes used patterns reminiscent of folk art, fabrics and ritual vessels.
        His work is in public collections in the United States, Europe and Japan, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the National Museum of Modern Art in Japan.
        Mr. Niizuma's two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by three sons: Ta Andre of Tokyo, and Ko Christopher and Arata Peter, both of New York City, and one grandchild.
