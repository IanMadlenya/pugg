        L. Welch Pogue, a Washington lawyer who helped write the original rules for commercial air travel at the Civil Aeronautics Board, which he headed in the 1940's, died on Saturday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 103.
        Mr. Pogue was one of the central figures in international civil aviation when it was developing into an orderly system. The basic framework he helped construct endured from its creation in 1938 until the deregulation of the airline industry in 1978.
        He represented the United States at the historic International Civil Aviation Conference in Chicago in 1944, when 55 countries entered into an agreement on how the world's commercial aviation should be governed after World War II.
        In 1994, Aviation Week magazine established the L. Welch Pogue Award for Aviation Achievement, naming Mr. Pogue its first recipient.
        Born in Grant, Iowa, he graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1924. He received a law degree at the University of Michigan in 1926 and his J.D. at Harvard Law School in 1927. He practiced law with firms in Boston, Paris and New York, where he developed a corporate financial practice working with clients in the aircraft industry.
        In 1938 he applied for a job with the fledgling Civil Aeronautics Board, now the Federal Aviation Administration, and was hired. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him board chairman in January 1942.
        After leaving the agency in 1946, he worked as a law partner in Washington until 1981. Most recently he practiced in semiretirement in Chevy Chase, Md.
        Mr. Pogue is survived by three sons, Richard W., of Cleveland, Dr. William L., of La Mesa, Calif., and Dr. John M., of Chevy Chase, Md.; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. His wife of 75 years, Mary Ellen Edgerton Pogue, died in 2001.
