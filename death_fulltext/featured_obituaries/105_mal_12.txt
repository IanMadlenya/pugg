        Victor Samrock, a theatrical business manager who in a half century in show business was involved in 150 Broadway productions, died on Saturday at New York Hospital.
        He was 88 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        While others busied themselves with the creative side of theater, Mr. Samrock booked theaters, arranged agreements with agents and actors, decided out-of-town routes for shows headed for Broadway, established touring companies and engaged company managers.
        He was associated with many of the theater's eminent names, including producers like H. C. Potter and George Haight, Frederick Brisson, Alexander H. Cohen, Herman Levin, Elliot Martin, Gilbert Miller, Harold Fielding and Roger L. Stevens.
        When the Playwrights' Company was established in 1938 by five major American dramatists -- Robert E. Sherwood, Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard and Elmer Rice -- Mr. Samrock functioned, in essence, as its producer.
        He worked on all 72 plays the company presented, beginning with Sherwood's "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," which starred Raymond Massey. The company's other memorable productions included the Maxwell Anderson-Kurt Weill musical "Knickerbocker Holiday," "Key Largo," "There Shall Be No Night," "Anne of the Thousand Days," "Lost in the Stars" and "Cry the Beloved Country."
        In 1960, the Playwrights' Company disbanded after producing the political drama "Best Man," written by Gore Vidal and starring Melvyn Douglas, Lee Tracy and Frank Lovejoy. Mr. Samrock went on to work into the late 1970's on 65 other productions.
        Mr. Samrock was born in Brooklyn in 1907 and graduated from City College in 1929.
        He is survived by his wife, Hyla; a son, Carl Samrock of Encino, Calif.; a daughter, Ellen Samrock of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
