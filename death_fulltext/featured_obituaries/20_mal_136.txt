        Kay Sugahara, a Japanese-American who was interned on the West Coast after the Pearl Harbor attack and who later built a worldwide ship-owning business and worked for better relations between the United States and East Asian nations, died of liver cancer Sunday at his home in Pelham Manor, N.Y. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Sugahara was chairman of Fairfield-Maxwell Ltd., which through subsidiaries owns or manages oil tankers and refrigerator vessels and engages in oil-exploration in Texas.
        From 1982 until last year, he was chairman of the U.S.-Asia Institute, in Washington, which honored him earlier this month as its Man of the Year.
        Mr. Sugahara, who was born in Seattle to parents who had emigrated from Japan in the early 1900's, was a 1932 graduate of the University of California at Los Angeles. He, his wife and three sons were evacuated to a desert camp in Colorado in 1942. Several months later he was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, for propaganda work. His family remained in the camp until 1945. At the war's end, he worked with other Japanese specialists on American policy toward Japan.
        Mr. Sugahara is survived by his wife, Yone; three sons, Kaytaro, of Manhattan, Bryan, of San Francisco, and Byron, of Mountain Lakes N.J.; three sisters, Masa Caliari of Manhattan, Yuri Kurio of Wahiawa, Hawaii, and Fuji Nakaoka, of Denver, and five grandchildren.
