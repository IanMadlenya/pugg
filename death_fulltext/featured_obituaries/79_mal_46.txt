        Joseph Salvaggio, a cable television executive, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor.
        The cause was a pulmonary embolism as a complication of lung cancer, his family said.
        For the last six years Mr. Salvaggio was HBO's director of broadcast, advertising and on-air operations and was responsible for marketing and advertising promotion spots for HBO and Cinemax.
        He started at HBO 11 years ago as producer of network previews. Before that he worked as production manager for the NBC television network.
        Mr. Salvaggio was born in Queens and studied at St. John's and Fordham Universities. He served in the National Guard.
        Surviving are his wife of 24 years, the former Clare Moran; a son, Neil, of Manhattan, and a sister, Rosemary Sharkey of Queens.
