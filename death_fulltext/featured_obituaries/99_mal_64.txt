        Paul W. H. Trevor, a founder and former chairman of the investment management firm of Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen, died on April 2 at his home in St. James, L.I. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for the firm said.
        Mr. Trevor retired on Dec. 31 from Trevor Stewart, which manages almost $1 billion in assets, mostly for institutions. From 1974 to 1990, he was chief executive of the firm, which is known for developing economic forecasts that shape its investment choices.
        Before starting his own firm, Mr. Trevor was a partner of Lord Abbett & Company, another investment management concern, where he ran the Affiliated Fund, one of the oldest mutual funds still in business.
        Mr. Trevor, who was born in London, graduated from the University of Virginia and the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University. He was a captain in the British Army in World War II, and became an American citizen in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, of St. James and Manhattan; two sons, Henry R., of New York, and Thomas W., of Hinesburg, Vt., four grandsons and a brother, Col. T. H. Trevor of London.
