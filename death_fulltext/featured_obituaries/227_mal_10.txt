        Col. Reginald R. Myers, a retired Marine Corps officer who was awarded the Medal of Honor for leading an assault up an icy Korean hill in late 1950, died Oct. 23 in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 85 and had lived in Jupiter, Fla.
        His death was confirmed on the Web site of the corps' History and Museums Division.
        President Harry S. Truman presented the Medal of Honor to Colonel Myers, then a major, for the assault, which was against a position held by a far larger force in the snowy, ragged mountains of northern Korea.
        The action, in the face of what the award citation called ''apparently insurmountable odds,'' was ordered to break a trap set by the Chinese Communist army and save thousands of fellow marines from capture or death.
        A native of Boise, Idaho, Reginald Rodney Myers graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Idaho in 1941 and was commissioned that year.
        As a captain he saw action in the Pacific, including the assault on Okinawa in 1945.
        He later fought in the landing at Inchon, Korea, and was awarded a Bronze Star with Combat V, followed by a Gold Star awarded for the rescue of two fellow marines four days later.
        Colonel Myers emerged unscathed from the engagement in November 1950 for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor, but he was wounded in action several months later.
        He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December 1951 and to colonel in July 1960. His later assignments included three years as assistant naval attach√© at the United States Embassy in London. He retired from active duty in 1967.
        Colonel Myers is survived by his wife, Margaret; two children; five grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.
