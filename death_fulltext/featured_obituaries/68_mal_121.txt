        Michael J. Floersheim, an international commodities trader, investor and philanthropist, died on Sunday at his home in Zurich. He was 54 years old.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, his family said
        Mr. Floersheim was born into a prominent banking family in the Netherlands. As a child he was sent to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by the Nazis with his mother, Ilse. Both survived.
        He attended school in Amsterdam after the war and worked at a Dutch bank before joining Philipp Brothers, a New York-based commodities trading firm to which he had family ties.
        He started in the Amsterdam branch of the firm and moved on to senior managerial positions in Johannesburg and Tokyo. In 1975 he took over as general manager of Philipp's European operations, with headquarters in the Swiss town of Zug, near Zurich.
        Mr. Floersheim left Philipp in 1984. In recent years he was active in real estate and oil refining as well as in the commodities trading business and charitable activities. Many of the beneficiaries are in Israel, including Bar-Ilan University in suburban Tel Aviv, Tel Hashomer Hospital and Shaare Zedek Hospital.

        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Yonat Floersheim-Sachar; a son, Carl Alexander, ; and his mother, Ilse Floersheim-Moeller of Zurich.
