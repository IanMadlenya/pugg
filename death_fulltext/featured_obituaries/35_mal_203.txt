        Herman Short, a former Houston Police Chief, died of a heart attack in Houston on Thursday. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Short, who lived in Houston, was a member of the city's Police Department for nearly 30 years and became chief in 1964. In the 10 years he served in that post, Chief Short won support for his tough law-and-order stance but was occasionally denounced by civil rights groups.
        While they brought charges of brutality after demonstrations in the late 1960's, no charges of misconduct were ever brought against Mr. Short.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Maxine Fehr; a son, Robert, of Houston; two stepdaughters, Leslie Adams of Bastrop,. Tex., and Charlotte Bivins of Greenbrier, W.Va., and five grandchildren.
