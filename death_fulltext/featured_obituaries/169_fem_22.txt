        Mfon Essien, a Nigerian-born American photographer, died on Feb. 13 in New York. She was 34.
        The cause was breast cancer, according to her publicist and friend, Tonya Miller.
        Ms. Essien, whose full name is Mmekutmfon, was born in the village of Ikot Ekpene in Nigeria and came with her family to the United States when she was 2. She studied literature and art at Morgan State University in Baltimore, then moved to New York, where she worked as a fashion photographer.
        Her first New York gallery appearance was at Rush Arts in Chelsea in 1996. Her last work, produced after she underwent a radical mastectomy, was a series of nude self-portraits titled ''The Amazon's New Clothes,'' two of which are in the exhibition ''Committed to the Image: Contemporary Black Photographers,'' now at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
        She is survived by her mother, Adiaha Essien, and two brothers, Ebakuwa and Sema Essien, all of Baltimore.
