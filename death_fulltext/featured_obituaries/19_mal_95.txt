        Lino S. Lipinsky de Orlov, an artist, a designer of historic museum exhibits and a curator of history at the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site in Katonah, N.Y., died at his home in Katonah last Thursday. He was 80 years old.
        Trained as a painter in his native city of Rome, Mr. Lipinsky de Orlov came to the United States in 1940. In this country he followed two careers, one as a painter and etcher, and one as a designer and curator of museum exhibits.
        From 1959 to 1967, he was head of exhibit design at the Museum of the City of New York. One of his works - a circular landscape mural of New Amsterdam in 1660 - is still on view.
        In 1956, he founded and designed the Garibaldi and Meucci Museum on Staten Island. He later designed the permanent exhibits of the Courthouse of the Bedford Historical Society Museum in Bedford, N.Y., and the Pound Ridge Museum in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He had worked at the John Jay Homestead State Historic Site since 1967.
        As an artist, Mr. Lipinsky de Orlov was best known for his etchings, most of which were landscape views of Rome. His paintings and illustrations have also been shown in numerous galleries and museums.
        He is survived by his wife, Leah, of Katonah, and by two sons, Lino Jr., of Denver, and Lucian, of Golden's Bridge, N.Y.
