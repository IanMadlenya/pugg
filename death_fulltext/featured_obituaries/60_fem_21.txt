        Evelyn Tennyson Openhym, a book collector and benefactor of Alfred University in western New York, died on Jan. 13 at her home in Wellsville, N.Y. She was 89 years old.
        She died of cancer, said Edward G. Coll Jr., president of the university, where she was a trustee.
        Mrs. Openhym, who had a lifelong interest in Britain, started her collection while on her honeymoon in London in 1924. Over 60 years, she amassed some 7,000 books by and about British authors, about British literature and British social history. She compiled and wrote a 566-page bibliography for her collection, which she donated to the university in 1981.
        Included in the book collection are signed first editions by D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, John Galsworthy and others. The books are available to visitors but may not be removed from the library.
        Mrs. Openhym had a family connection to Alfred University dating to the mid-1840's. She graduated in 1924 from Alfred, where she met her husband, George J. Openhym, a fellow student. He died in 1954.
        She is survived by a son, Alexander, of New Rochelle, N.Y.
