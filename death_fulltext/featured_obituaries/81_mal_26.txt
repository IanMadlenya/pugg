        Louis Grossman, a former Civil Court judge in Manhattan who served for many years as an acting State Supreme Court justice, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.
        The cause was heart failure, said his family.
        Elected in 1969 as a Democrat to a judgeship on the Civil Court, Justice Grossman was an acting Supreme Court justice from 1977 until he retired in 1988. In 1987, he was one of six judges who unsuccessfully sued to challenge rules on mandatory retirement for judges in some New York courts.
        Before serving on the bench, Justice Grossman was an assistant United States Attorney in both the civil and criminal divisions of the Southern District of New York for a year, beginning in 1951. He resigned to return to private practice with his brother, Harry Grossman, with whom he had worked before the appointment.
        In the mid-1960's, he served for three years as the chairman of the New York County Democratic Law Committee.
        Justice Grossman was born in Manhattan and graduated from New York University in 1937 and from New York University School of Law in 1939.
        He is survived by his wife, Jeanne; two sons, Richard of Manhattan and Kenneth of Great Neck, L.I., and three grandchildren.
