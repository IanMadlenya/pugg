        William E. Reid, a longtime textile executive and occasional adviser to the United States Government on international trade agreements, died on Jan. 29 at his home in Tubac, Ariz. He was 86.
        The cause was a combination of aphasia and Lou Gehrig's disease, his son-in-law, Rodman B. Funston, said. Aphasia is a neurological disorder that can be caused by disease or injury.
        From 1955 to 1975, Mr. Reid was chairman and president of the Riegel Textile Corporation, a manufacturer of denim and other fabrics. The company was acquired in 1985 by a unit of the R. B. Pamplin Corporation for $87 million.
        Mr. Reid served as president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute from 1964 to 1965 and the National Cotton Council in 1974.
        In 1962, Mr. Reid led an industry group that advised the Commerce Department during negotiations in Geneva on an international textile trade pact. He continued to advise the Government on the textile trade through the early 1970's.
        Mr. Reid attended Georgia Military College in Milledgeville, Ga. In 1927, he withdrew from the college before graduation to help support his family as a sweeper at Pacific Mills in Lyman, S.C. Shortly after Mr. Reid retired in 1975, the college awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award.
        Mr. Reid is survived by his wife, Jean M. Reid; a daughter, Sidney Reid Funston, of New Preston, Conn.; two sons, William Jr., of Spartanburg, S.C., and Richard S., of Litchfield, Conn.; two stepchildren, Roger Haller, of Oxford, Ga., and Barbara H. Watkins, of Murray, Utah; a sister, Geraldine R. Overstreet, of Milledgeville, Ga., and nine grandchildren.
