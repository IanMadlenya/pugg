        Walter E. Miller, professor emeritus of chemistry at City College and a consultant on chemical warfare, died on Monday at the Fallston General Hospital in Bel Air, Md. He was 81 and had lived in Haworth, N.J., before he retired to Bel Air in 1983.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, a son, Michael Miller, said.
        He began teaching at City College in 1941. During World War II, he served in the Army Chemical Corps where he organized and directed chemical warfare schools set up to teach soldiers smokescreen tactics and how to defend themselves against chemical weapons. He also advised the Army on how to destroy chemical weapons.
        He resumed his teaching career in 1946, becoming a professor in 1966. He also taught at the graduate levels of New York University from 1946 to 1949, and at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1953.
        He held a number of consulting positions, including one with the U.S. Army Chemical Corps in its investigation and research on chemical and biological weapons.
        He was born in the Bronx and graduated from City College in 1936 with a degree in chemical engineering. He received a Ph. D. in physical chemistry from New York University in 1941.
        His first marriage ended in divorce in 1967. Besides his son Michael, of Iowa City, Iowa, he is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; another son, Larry, of Holland, Pa.; a daughter, Diane, of Ramsey, N.J., and four grandchildren.
