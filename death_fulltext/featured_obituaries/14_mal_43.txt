        Emil A. Schmidlin, an architect, died of heart failure Friday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Schmidlin, who supervised an architecture firm in East Orange, N.J., for more than 50 years, designed many of the first garden apartments and split-level homes in New Jersey, as well as schools and public and commercial buildings throughout the United States. The Swiss-born architect also designed several futuristic model homes, including a 1949 Pacesetter house in Orange, N.J., with a climate-control system and underground wiring to melt snow, and the Formica house for the 1964 New York World's Fair.
        Mr. Schmidlin is survived by his wife, Veronica, of Orange, N.J.; two brothers, Walter, of Clark, N.J., and Karl, of New York City; a daughter, Annette DeBona of Manchester, Vt.; a son, Emil Jr., of New York City, and two grandchildren.
