        Ariel Allen, a senior advertising executive for the Colgate-Palmolive Company, died on April 7 in New York. She was 58.
        The cause of death was cancer, the company said.
        Miss Allen joined the Ted Bates advertising agency in 1960 to work on the Colgate account.
        She then moved to the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency, still working on the Colgate account. In 1971, she joined Colgate as vice president for creative services, developing television commercials with various advertising agencies.
        In 1992, she assumed major responsibilities for the company's television advertising around the world as vice president for creative services in global advertising.
        In 1988, the trade publication Advertising Age named her to its "100 of the Best and Brightest Women in Advertising" list and in 1989, Business Week included her in its list of "Women in Corporate America to Watch."
        She had served as a chairman of the American Advertising Federation National  Convention.
        Miss Allen is survived by her mother, Shirley Adsit, and her sister, Louisa Brownell.
