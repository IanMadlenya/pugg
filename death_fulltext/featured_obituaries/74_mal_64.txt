        Kevin Oldham, a pianist and composer who left his hospital bed to perform his own piano concerto with the Kansas City Symphony in January, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City, Mo. He was 32 and lived in Manhattan.
        Karen Kushner, a friend, said the cause was AIDS.
        Mr. Oldham was born in Kansas City on Aug. 30, 1960. He began his formal studies at Northwestern University and won several piano competitions during his three years there, but decided in 1981 to move to New York to study at the Juilliard School. He made his recital debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1985.
        Mr. Oldham did not study composition formally, but in 1988, around the time he learned that he had AIDS, he became concerned with leaving an artistic legacy and began to devote himself increasingly to composition. Several of his songs and piano pieces were performed in New York before he received his first major commission, for the piano concerto.  Was Determined to Perform
        He gave the premiere of the work at the Festival of the Atlantic, in Point Pleasant, N.J., in 1991, and he was invited to play it with the Kansas City Symphony in January in a program of works by composers with local roots. A few days before the performance, Mr. Oldham was hospitalized in New York City. But he was determined to give the performance, and traveled to Kansas City for the rehearsals and the concert.
        Mr. Oldham was among those interviewed for an article in The New York Times in December about artists with AIDS or H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. "It seems to me that whether you stay alive or not seems to be the trivial part," he said. "It's your work itself that must have a life of its own. If I can make sure that my music will continue to have life, that seems to be the more important consideration."
        He is survived by his parents and a sister, Leslie, all of Kansas City, and his companion, Stephen Rotondaro, of Manhattan.
