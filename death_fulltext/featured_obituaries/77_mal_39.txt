        John Thies, a Westchester civic leader, died on Saturday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 95.
        His family said he died of natural causes.
        He was a founding director of the Scarsdale Historical Society, dating to 1974, and served as its treasurer and a vice president until 1985. His efforts helped to rekindle interest in former village notables like the author James Fenimore Cooper and Daniel D. Tompkins, who served as Governor of New York and Vice President to President James Monroe.
        Mr. Thies, a native of Brooklyn, studied accounting and the law at what is now Pace University. In the 1920's he worked for the accounting firm of Price, Waterhouse & Company in Mexico but then spent most of his career as director of accounting services for Quality Bakers of America Cooperative, retiring in 1963.
        Over the years he served as treasurer of the Friends of the Scarsdale Library, the local Audubon Society, Scarsdale Neighbors, the Scarsdale-Hartsdale chapter of the United Nations Association and the Westchester Crime Victims Assistance Agency.
        His wife of 60 years, the former Lillian Drake, died in 1985.
        He is survived by two daughters, Sandy Wyatt of Garland, Tex., and Rachel Hare-Mustin of Haverford, Pa.; two sons, Winthrop D., of Maplewood, N.J., and Roger E., of Norman, Okla.; 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-granddaughters.
