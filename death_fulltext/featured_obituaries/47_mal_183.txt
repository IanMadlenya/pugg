        Dr. Abner I. Weisman, an internationally known fertility specialist and clinical professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Medical College, died on Thursday at St. Luke's Medical Center. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He was diagnosed with colon cancer in September and had heart problems, family members said.
        Dr. Weisman was the author of several books, including "You Too Can Have a Baby" (Liverlight, 1941) and the academic work "Spermatozoa and Sterility."
        He founded the International Fertility Association and helped introduce in the United States a test for pregnancy using frog hormones.
        He once estimated that he had delivered 20,000 babies. He was the gynecologist for several well-known celebrities, including Marilyn Monroe.
        Dr. Weisman amassed a rare collection of pre-Colombian "medical sculptures" now at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Md. The collection includes figures from coastal Peru and western Mexico that purported to show the medical histories of ancient people.
        During World War II he was a Public Health Service physician in North and South Dakota, where he worked with Sioux Indians. The experience generated a lifelong interest in the plight of Indians and in native and tribal art.
        Dr. Weisman's wife, the former Martha B. Behrman of Brooklyn, died in 1975. He lived for the last 14 years with his companion, Kitty Kittner.
        Survivors include two sons, Dr. Henry W., and Raymond J. B., both of Manhattan; two daughters, Bonita Weisman of Glastonbury, Conn., and Celia Y. Weisman-Chance of Salt Lake City, and a grandchild.
