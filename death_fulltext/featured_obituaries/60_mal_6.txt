        Edward John Willi, a New York lawyer, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. Mr. Willi, a lifelong resident of Manhattan, was 88 years old.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Willi, a graduate of Dartmouth College and Harvard Law School, practiced corporate and probate law as senior partner in the firm of Chamberlain, Willi, Ouchterloney & Watson, which he and Thomas G. Chamberlain founded in the financial district in 1928. He served as a trustee of the Mark Twain Foundation and a director and outside counsel to Gibbs & Cox, marine architects in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, the former Helen Gertrude Schiller; a son, Edward Jr., of West Redding, Conn.; a daughter, Marion Whittemore of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
