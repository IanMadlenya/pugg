        Jimmy Hamilton, one of jazz's great clarinetists, who was a member of Duke Ellington's orchestra from 1943 to 1968, died on Tuesday in St. Croix Hospital in the United States Virgin Islands. He was 77 and lived on St. Croix.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his granddaughter, Vivian Greenaway.
        Mr. Hamilton played with a gorgeous, pure tone that helped define the sound of the Ellington orchestra. Ellington regularly relied on him for his improvisational abilities as well, and Mr. Hamilton quickly became one of the most important improvisers in the orchestra.
        In the late 1950's, when Ellington and Billy Strayhorn changed their compositional palettes, Mr. Hamilton became more prominent in the orchestra, and his playing helped give the rich harmonies their distinctive texture. Mr. Hamilton also played tenor saxophone with the orchestra. Whereas his improvisations on clarinet are restrained, cool and glassy, his solos on tenor saxophone are brutal and coarse.
        Mr. Hamilton began his career with the band leaders Lucky Millinder, Jimmy Mundy, Teddy Wilson and Eddie Heywood. After leaving Ellington in 1968, he moved to the Virgin Islands, where he stayed in virtual retirement, restricting his musical activity to playing local dates, a longstanding hotel job and giving lessons. In the 1980's, he occasionally worked with Mercer Ellington and in a brilliant band, Ellington's Spacemen, which performed at Carlos 1, a club in Manhattan. He also played with the clarinetist John Carter's clarinet quartet, Clarinet Summit, at the Public Theater in Manhattan, recording two albums on the India Navigation record label. Earlier in his career, he occasionally recorded as a band leader as well.
        In addition to his granddaughter, of St. Croix, he is survived by a son, Artie Jones of Atcheson, Kan.; three other grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
