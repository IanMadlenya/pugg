        Roy A. Foulke, a Wall Street executive and analyst who created a system of rating the quality of companies, died on Thursday in Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. Mr. Foulke, who lived in Bronxville, was 97.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Roy A. Jr.
        Mr. Foulke worked for Dun and Bradstreet for 40 years, retiring in 1961 as a vice president and a director.
        Mr. Foulke developed a method for comparing the strengths and weaknesses of companies in the same line of business. Named norms and ratios, the method remains in wide use today. He also wrote five books about business and finance, and was a trustee of the American Institute of Economic Research. He graduated from Bowdoin College in 1919.
        He was married to Mathilde Larsen in 1924; she died in 1976.
        Besides his son, from his first marriage, who lives in Larchmont, N.Y., he is survived by his second wife, the former Joan Firestone; two grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
