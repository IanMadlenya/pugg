He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Barnum founded the Manhattan agency in 1975 after a 10-year career at the J. Walter Thompson Company, where he rose to group executive vice president and president of J. W. T. Affiliated Companies. Thompson sued Dr. Barnum amid assertions of client-luring, but the dispute was settled out of court.
        Dr. Barnum, a collateral descendant of the showman P. T. Barnum, was born in Indianapolis and grew up in Lakeland, Fla. He was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy, commanded a task group in the Pacific in World War II and rose to rear admiral in the Naval Reserve. In 1964, he received a medical degree from Columbia University.
        Surviving are his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Elizabeth, of Manhattan, and Shauna, of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, David, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
