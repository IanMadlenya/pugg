        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his son-in-law, Dr. Howard H. Hiatt.
        Mr. Bieringer was executive vice president of the Plymouth Rubber Company of Canton, Mass., when he retired in 1985 after more than 50 years with the company.
        In the aftermath of World War II Mr. Bieringer, in addition to working with European refugees, directed a relocation program for Japanese-Americans who had been confined to detention camps during the war.
        Mr. Bieringer, who was born in Boston and was a graduate of Harvard College, was an adviser to President Harry S. Truman on refugee affairs and a consultant to the State Department under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        He leaves his wife, the former Annabelle Kaplan; a daughter, Doris Hiatt of Cambridge, Mass., three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
