        Gabor Carelli, a Hungarian tenor who sang at the Metropolitan Opera between 1951 and 1974, and was on the vocal faculty of the Manhattan School of Music for 35 years, died on Friday. He was 83 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Carelli was born in Budapest in 1915 and began his vocal studies at the Franz Liszt Academy, but it was not until he completed a law degree at the University of Budapest that he decided to become a professional singer. He continued his studies in Rome with Beniamino Gigli and made his debut as Rodolfo in a production of Puccini's ''Boheme'' in Florence.
        In 1939 Mr. Carelli moved to New York and traveled across the United States as a recitalist and as a principal singer with operatic touring companies. He sang in the American premiere of Puccini's Messa di Gloria and performed with many orchestras as a soloist in the Verdi Requiem, Rossini's Stabat Mater, Kodaly's ''Psalmus Hungaricus'' and the Beethoven Ninth Symphony. He also sang the role of Dr. Caius in a 1951 NBC Symphony broadcast performance of Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' conducted by Arturo Toscanini. That performance has been reissued on compact disk by RCA.
        Mr. Carelli made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Don Curzio in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' in 1951, and over the next 23 years, he sang 1,079 performances of 56 roles in 39 operas. Most of them were brief character roles that demand the good comic instincts for which Mr. Carelli was known. But he occasionally sang larger roles as well. Reviewing Mr. Carelli's 1957 performance as Tamino in Mozart's ''Zauberflote'' in The New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg praised his ''sweet-voiced, dependable style'' and his ''smooth legato, sure breath and niceties of phrasing.''
        Mr. Carelli joined the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music in 1964. He was a voice teacher and also an ensemble coach until his death.
