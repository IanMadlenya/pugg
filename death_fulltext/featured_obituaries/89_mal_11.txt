        Eric Gale, a guitarist best known for his work as a side musician with numerous pop and jazz luminaries, died on May 25 in a hospital in Baja California, Mexico. Mr. Gale, who lived in Los Angeles, was 55.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his daughter Gretchen, of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Gale played guitar on over 100 pop, jazz, and blues recordings, including those of the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin, Carla Bley, Mose Allison, Marvin Gaye, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Hodges and Grover Washington Jr. Over the course of his 30-year career, he released many solo albums and remained a regular fixture in New York clubs and recording studios.
        Mr. Gale, who was born in Brooklyn, started to teach himself to play guitar when he was 12. During the 1960's, he performed on the rhythm-and-blues circuit, with King Curtis, Maxine Brown, and Little Anthony and the Imperials. In 1976, he was a founding member of the group Stuff, with Cornell Dupree, Gordon Edwards, Steve Gadd, Chris Parker and Richard Tee. After performing in the Paul Simon film "One Trick Pony," Stuff toured with Mr. Simon. In 1982, Mr. Gale formed his own ensemble.
        In addition to his daughter Gretchen, he is survived by his mother, Jacqueline, of Brooklyn; his wife, Masako; three other daughters, Eriko, Mariko and Noriko, all of Los Angeles; two brothers, Leslie and Michael, both of Brooklyn, and a granddaughter.
