        Evelyn Lord Smithson, a professor of classics and a noted archeologist who studied Greece in the Homeric age, died on Monday at her home in Amherst, N.Y. She was 68 years old.
        She died of cancer, according to the State University of New York at Buffalo, where she was on the faculty.
        For more than 40 years Dr. Smithson traveled each summer to work on the excavations of the ancient agora, or marketplace, in Athens that were supervised by the American School of Classical Studies there.
        The Greek period that she studied, from 1200 to 900 B.C., is challenging because of its lack of a literary record. She focused on pottery and its decorations for insights into the culture.
        Dr. Smithson was born in Indiana.  She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Washington in 1944, a master's degree from Bryn Mawr College in 1946 and a doctorate in classical archeology and Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956. She studied at the American School in Athens from 1948 to 1950.
        From 1951 to 1962 she was a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and then worked at the University at Buffalo. She served two terms as chairwoman of the classics department.
        Dr. Smithson was divorced. There are no immediate survivors.
