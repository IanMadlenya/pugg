        Judge Ferrara was also active in numerous professional and community organizations, serving as past president of the New York State Association of Family Court Judges, board member of Catholic Big Brothers, past chairman of the East Harlem Civic Association's Youth Committee and past president of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Holy Name Society.
        He is survived by his wife, Clara, and a daughter, Patricia Ferrara Braun, both of Upper Montclair; four sisters, Margaret Berlingier of Manhattan, Carmela Cavalino, Jean Santesanio and Antoinette Porto, of the Bronx; a brother, Anthony Russo of Staten Island, and two granddaughters.
