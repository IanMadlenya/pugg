        Philip Semark, an arts administrator and a founder of Dance U.S.A., a service organization, died on Thursday at Sayville Hospital on Long Island. He was 49 and lived in Occidental, Calif.
        The cause was AIDS, said Richard LeBlond, a friend and colleague.
        Mr. Semark was born in India, where his father served in the British Army, and was educated in England at Queens College and the University of Birmingham. He settled in New York in 1971 and worked for the British Consulate for two years. Always interested in dance and opera, he joined Hi Enterprises, which provided booking and management services for modern-dance companies, in 1973. Two years later he moved to San Francisco, where he worked with Mr. LeBlond on restructuring the San Francisco Ballet, then became company manager and general manager.
        Mr. Semark served as president and general manager of the Joffrey Ballet (1980-83) and general manager of the Spoleto U.S.A. festival in Charleston, S.C. (1983-86). He was executive director of the Dallas Ballet (1986-88) and of the Santa Fe Opera (1988-91), when he became ill. He was also a member of the executive committee of the American Arts Alliance and at the time of his death was a board member of the Joe Goode modern-dance company and of Face to Face, an AIDS service organization in Sonoma County, Calif.
        He is survived by his parents, a sister and a brother, all of England.
