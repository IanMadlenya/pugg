        King C. Chen, a political science professor and author who specialized in Asian politics and international relations, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Newark. He was 67.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Chen was a resident of Livingston, N.J. He was a professor at Rutgers for the last 24 years and earlier taught at Brown University, Brooklyn College and the State University of New York at Oswego.
        He wrote five books, including "Vietnam and China, 1938-54" (Princeton, 1969), "China's War Against Vietnam, 1979" (Hoover Institution, 1987) and "China's Policy Toward Taiwan" (Wu Nan, 1990).
        Dr. Chen had served as president of the Chinese-American Academic and Professional Society, vice president of the North American Chinese Social Science Society, chairman of the editorial board of the Central Daily News in Taipei, research member of the Taiwan Government's National Unification Council, adviser to the United States State Department and member of the editorial board of Asian Affairs.
        Born in Fujian, China, Dr. Chen graduated from National Chengchi University in Nanjing. He fled to Taiwan amid the Communist revolution then went to the United States on a scholarship.
        He earned a master's degree in international affairs from the University of Virginia and a doctorate in political science from Pennsylvania State University.
        Surviving are his wife of 30 years, the former Grace Ho, and two sons, David, of San Francisco, and Donald, of Carbondale, Colo.
