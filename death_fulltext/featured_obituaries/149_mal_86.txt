        Gaynor Jacobson, a former world director of the Hebrew Immigrant  Aid Society, or Hias, who helped thousands of Jews leave Eastern Europe for Israel and other countries in the West in the World War II period, died on June 6 at a hospital in Sun City West, Ariz.
        He was 87 and lived in Sun City West and also in Manhattan.
        As a young man, Mr. Jacobson worked for numerous Jewish organizations in Rochester, N.Y., before joining the American Joint Distribution Committee in 1944 as a country director in Italy, Greece and Czechoslovakia.
        Over the next six years, he used his diplomatic skills to persuade various governments to take in survivors of the Holocaust. He was especially active in helping hundreds of thousands of refugees move from Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union through Czechoslovakia to Israel and the West.
        Mr. Jacobson was arrested and jailed for two weeks in 1949 in Hungary for helping Jews leave the country. His work opening borders was detailed in the book ''The Secret Alliance: The Extraordinary Story of the Rescue of the Jews Since World War II,'' by Tad Szulc, a former reporter for The New York Times (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1992).
        From 1953 until 1981, Mr. Jacobson directed programs for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, becoming world director in 1966. He retired in 1981.
        Mr. Jacobson was born on May 17, 1912, in Buffalo. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Buffalo in 1937 and a master's degree in social work in 1941 from the same university.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, two daughters, Margot Gotoff of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Helen Jacobson of Boston, and six grandchildren.
