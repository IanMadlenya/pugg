        Irving Kaplan, a professor emeritus and founding member of the department of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on April 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was 84 and lived in Belmont, Mass.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, M.I.T. reported.
        Dr. Kaplan was among the young physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II, researching isotope separation and working on nuclear reactor design. He then became a senior physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
        He was a founding member of the Federation of American Scientists and joined with others in campaigning to place atomic energy under civilian control. The group backed the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1947 as an alternative to military control.
        Born in New York City, Dr. Kaplan graduated from Columbia College in 1934 and received a doctorate in chemistry at Columbia University three years later. He joined the permanent faculty of M.I.T. in 1958.
        Dr. Kaplan is survived by his wife, Ruth Evelyn Stern Kaplan; two sons, Paul, of Lexington, Mass., and Dan, of Santa Cruz, Calif.; a daughter, Judith, of Seattle, and four grandchildren.
