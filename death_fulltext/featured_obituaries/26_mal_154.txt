        Born in Denmark and educated in England, Mr. Michaelsen came to the United States in 1939 and a year later joined the Phelps Dodge Corporation. He eventually became chairman of the board of the Phelps Dodge Copper Products Company, of the Phelps Dodge International Corporation and of Phelps Dodge Industries Inc.
        He retired in 1982 and was named chief executive officer at Carnegie Hall. A year later he resigned that post and opened an office in Manhattan to handle his philanthropic endeavors.
        He is survived by his wife, Fritze; a son, John, of San Diego; two daughters, Carol Owens of Easton, Conn., and Linda Sugzda of Darien, Conn.; two sisters, Lillia Lundgren and Helen Castienskiold-Benzen, both of Copenhagen, and seven grandchildren.
