        Mr. Osborn received the Tony for best Broadway revival in 1980 for his play about four elderly sisters, ''Morning's at Seven,'' which originally opened on Broadway in 1939. He also wrote ''The World of Suzie Wong,'' which opened in 1958.
        ''It was nice to get the Tony, because I had really never even seen one,'' the playwright said. ''I've had plays produced since 1929, and I finally have a Tony.''
        In reviewing the revivial, Walter Kerr of The New York Times, said: ''This seems to me a perfect production of a uniquely shaped play, merry and mellow and just possibly a bit mad. It's enchanting.'' The revival, which also won Tonys for featured actor and director, sparked new curiosity in the rest of Mr. Osborn's work. The result was that he suddenly, if belately, became the most-produced playwright in the 1985-1986 threatrical season. His First Success
        Mr. Osborn was born on Sept. 4, 1901, in Evansville, Ind. A graduate of the University of Michigan, he also studied playwriting at Yale.
        When he first arrived in New York, he worked for the Long Island Rail Road while he gave writing a try. Mr. Osborn's Broadway baptism came actually in 1928, with ''Hotbed,'' a play inspired by a frustrating period spent toiling as an instructor in rhetoric at the University of Michigan. The play's antagonists were a rigidly self-righteous college administrator, based on Mr. Osborn's father, a Baptist minister, and an impassioned young campus firebrand. ''Guess who that was,'' Mr. Osbron onced said.
        Two years later he had his first success, a high comedy, ''The Vinegar Tree.''
        His strongest characters were ordinary people roughly based on his own family and neighbors back in Kalamazoo, Mich., where he grew up. The gossip and squabbling he overheard as a child in the backyards of his relatives' homes provded the idea for his play, ''Morning's at Seven.'' His father was again the inspiration of a character, David, an intellectual who is suffocated by the small talk of his in-laws. Stage and Movie Credits
        Many of Mr. Osborn's plays, several of them dramatizations of novels, were produced on Broadway, and also included ''A Ledge'' (1929), ''Oliver Oliver'' (1934), ''Tomorrow's Monday'' (1936), ''On Borrowed Time'' (1938), ''The Innocent Voyage'' (1943), ''A Bell for Adano'' (1944) and ''Point of No Return'' (1951). Some of his plays were later adpted to film, including '' Should Ladies Behave?'' in 1933, ''On Borrowed Time'' in 1939 and ''The World of Suzie Wong'' in 1960.
        Just this January ''The Vinegar Tree'' was revived for a limited run by the York Theater on the Upper East Side.
        His screenwriting credits included ''The Young in Heart'' (1938), ''Cry Havoc'' (1943), ''Madame Curie'' (1943), ''The Yearling'' (1947), ''Portrait of Jennie'' (1949), ''East of Eden'' (1955), ''Sayonara'' (1957), ''South Pacafic'' (1958) and ''Wild River'' (1960).
        His is survived by his wife, Millicent; a daughter, Judith McGillivray, of Putnam, N.Y., a grandaughter and two great-grandaughters.
