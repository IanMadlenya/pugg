        Dr. Paul F. de Gara, an allergist who treated President John F. Kennedy for extreme allergy to dogs, died Saturday at the New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center. He was 88 years old and lived in the Westchester County town of Pelham.
        Dr. de Gara was a former president of the American College of Allergists and was affiliated with New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for 50 years, serving as the director of its pediatric allergy clinic.
        His colleagues said he had a strong sense of humor and enjoyed telling about having "to sneak into the White House in disguise." Mr. Kennedy's aides had asked him to empty his doctor's bag into a briefcase so the public would not know about the President's hypersensitivity to dogs.
        Dr. de Gara, who was born in Meran, Austria, graduated summa cum laude from the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 1926, and was assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Milan, Italy, before coming to the United States in 1939.
        His wife of 61 years, Ruth, died last year. He is survived by two daughters, Beatrice Glanz of Los Angeles and Renata Cafiero of Tenafly, N.J., and a grandson, Peter Cafiero of Brooklyn.
