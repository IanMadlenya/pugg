        Chester B. deGavre, a retired brigadier general and woodcarver of miniature birds, died on Sunday at his home, Deep Creek Plantation, in Onancock on the eastern shore of Virginia. He was 85.
        His wife, Teresa Cameron deGavre, said the cause of death was cardiovascular collapse.
        General deGavre was one of the first Army officers to take parachute training at the outset of World War II, joining the Airborne Command at Fort Bragg, N.C. As parachute-training officer and chief of test and development, he improved techniques and standardized equipment for the rapidly growing airborne forces. He was chief of staff for the airborne invasion of southern France in 1944.
        In 1957 he was named an assistant division commander of the 82d Airborne, and from 1959 to 1961 he was chief of the Military Assistance and Advisory Group in Ethiopia. His decorations include the Silver Star for bravery as a regimental commander in the Korean War and the Legion of Merit with three oak-leaf clusters.
        After retiring in 1963 he pursued his hobby of carving waterfowl. General deGavre's birds were in shows sponsored by the National Audubon Society in New York City; the Ward Foundation in Salisbury, Md.; the Waterfowl Festival in Easton, Md., and the Wetlands Institute in Stone Harbor, N.J.
        He was born in Newark. He served three years in the 102d Cavalry of the New Jersey National Guard and then went to the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1933.
        Also surviving are two stepsons, Robert Thompson deGavre of Seattle and Col. Timothy Thompson deGavre of Antigua, and six grandchildren.
