        Thomas George Gradnauer, an advocate for and teacher of the deaf, died on Sunday at his home in Ewing, N.J. He was 54.
        The cause was complications from brain cancer and a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Gradnauer, who was deaf from birth, taught for more than 20 years at the Marie H. Katzenbach School for the Deaf in West Trenton, N.J., a 112-year-old state-financed institution; for much of that time few of the school's teachers were deaf.
        A founder of the New Jersey Association of the Deaf, he was an early advocate of teaching American Sign Language and of not treating deaf people as a disabled group.
        At Katzenbach, he taught social studies and was a drama coach and librarian. He produced theater pieces for the deaf and helped to get students involved with drama and arts education. He retired last fall.
        Born in Temuco, Chile, he came to the United States when he was 6. He attended Katzenbach, graduated from the New York State School for the Deaf in White Plains and from Gallaudet University. He received a master's degree in art history from Washington University in St. Louis.
        Mr. Gradnauer is survived by his longtime companion, Oville S. Gonya 3d of Ewing, and two sisters, Annette Taplin of Nanuet, N.Y., and Ruth G. Trainor of Pearl River, N.Y.
