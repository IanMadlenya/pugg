        Dr. Reinhold Benesch, a biochemist best known for his study of red blood cells, died of complications arising from lymphatic cancer, at Columbia-Presyterian Medical Center Tuesday. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Benesch and his wife, Dr. Ruth Erica Benesch, were professors of biochemistry and shared a research laboratory at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. Their collaboration focused on the mechanisms by which hemoglobin transports oxygen to living tissues.
        In 1966 he and his wife discovered that an organic phosphorous compound, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, plays a key role in loosening the bonds between hemoglobin and oxygen, thereby improving the flow of oxygen from blood to the tissues.
        Dr. Benesch was born in Poland on Aug. 13, 1919, and immigrated to England, where he received a bachelor's degree from Leeds University in 1941. Later, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States and received a doctorate in biochemistry at Northwestern University. Dr. Benesch was affiliated with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and since 1966 held the concurrent position of professor of biochemistry at Columbia.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Susan, and a son, Andrew, both of New York City.
