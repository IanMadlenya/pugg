        David Heaps, whose work contributed to a decision by the the Ford Foundation to start a large-scale international human rights program, died on June 10 in Montclair, N.J. He was 84 and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        Mr. Heaps was the foundation's representative in Nigeria and then in Tunisia during the 1960's and was an important figure in its presence in Africa during that period. For much of the early 1970's, he was a program officer dealing with international affairs in the foundation's headquarters in Manhattan.
        He contributed to a paper, titled ''Human Rights and Intellectual Freedom,'' that was presented in 1975 to the foundation's trustees.
        The report came after a series of military coups in Latin America. Based on its findings, the foundation framed an ambitious human rights program, now one of its largest in terms of budget and personnel.
        Mr. Heaps retired from the foundation in 1976, but was a consultant to it on human rights matters from then until 1982. He was also active in Amnesty International and other organizations concerned with human rights.
        Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, he attended the Universities of Southern California and Manitoba and won the Military Cross for bravery while serving in the Canadian Army in Europe in World War II. He worked for Unesco and other organizations before joining the foundation in 1959.
        He is survived by his wife, Mabel, and three sons, Jonathan and Daniel, both of Manhattan, and Alan, of Montclair.
