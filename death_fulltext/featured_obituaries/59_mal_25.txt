        Thomas Nelson Porter, a Broadway stage manager, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 59 years old.
        He died of cancer, said his brother David, of Clearwater, Fla.
        Mr. Porter was the stage manager for the musical "A Chorus Line" for 12 years. In his 29 years in the theater, he was the stage manager for many of Neil Simon's plays, including "The Sunshine Boys," "The Prisoner of Second Avenue" and "Last of the Red-Hot Lovers." Among other productions he managed were "Golden Boy," "God's Favorite" and, most recently, "Cats."
        Mr. Porter was born in Westport, Ind., and held a master's degree in theater from Indiana University. In 1953 he founded the Westport Community Players, which he directed for five years before moving to New York City. Among the directors with whom he worked over the years were Alan Arkin, Michael Bennett, Mike Nichols, Arthur Penn and Jerome Robbins.
        In addition to his brother David, he is survived by two other brothers, Don, of Columbus, Ind., and Robert, of Greensburg, Ind., and two sisters, Marigail Bentzen of Virginia and Gene Faulkner of Westport.
