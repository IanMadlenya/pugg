        Hyman I. Biegeleisen, founder of the Phlebology Society of America, the country's first society for doctors and surgeons devoted to the treatment of varicose veins and other vascular diseases, died on Friday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 86 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his son Ken said.
        Dr. Biegeleisen was one of the first doctors to use injection as a method of treating varicose veins. He coined the word "sclerotherapy" to describe the treatment. In 1953 he published an article in the New York State Journal of Medicine in which he proposed that varicose disease could be put in remission but not cured, a view that is now accepted.
        In 1964 he founded the Phlebology Society of America. He retired from private practice in 1971.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Beigeleisen graduated from Stuyvesant High School and Columbia University and received a medical degree from Long Island College Hospital.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothy Rich; two sons, Dr. Ken Biegeleisen of Manhattan and Dr. Robert Biegeleisen-Knight of Boca Raton; two daughters, Joyce Korotkin of Upper Montclair, N.J., and Wanda Dobrich of Montclair, N.J., and 11 grandchildren.

        An obituary on May 8 about Dr. Hyman I. Biegeleisen, a New York physician who specialized in vascular diseases, omitted the name of a survivor. She is Sherry Braude of North Andover, Mass., a daughter by a marriage that ended in divorce.
