        Dr. Veronica M. Driscoll, a retired executive director of the New York State Nurses Association, died on Sunday at her home in Loudonville, N.Y. She was 67.
        The cause was cancer, the association said.
        In 1966, Dr. Driscoll was head of the group's negotiations for Registered Professional Nurses employed by the Department of Hospitals of New York City. Barred by law from striking, the nurses at one point threatened to quit by the thousands. The contract they won brought parity to nursing salaries in the public and private sectors.
        Dr. Driscoll was also the chief strategist for the association in the revisions of the state law defining and governing nursing practices enacted in 1972.
        A native of Brooklyn, she graduated from St. Catherine's Hospital School of Nursing in Brooklyn and earned degrees at St. John's University, New York University and Columbia University Teachers College, where she received a doctorate in education.
        She held positions in nursing education and administration before she joined the nurses association, which has headquarters in Guilderland, N.Y., as deputy executive director 1960. She served as executive director from 1969 to 1979.
        Dr. Driscoll filled the same position at the Foundation of the New York State Nurses Association in Loudonville and was a consultant to many other nursing organizations.
        She is survived by a brother, John Driscoll of Melbourne, Fla., and two sisters, Catherine Ryan of Lake George, N.Y., and Dorothy Driscoll of Loudonville.
