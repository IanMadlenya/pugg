        George Theiner, editor of the Index on Censorship issued by Writers and Scholars International, died of cancer Sunday in London, where he lived. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Theiner, who was born in Prague, went to England with his parents in March 1939, shortly after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He returned to his homeland at the end of World War II to join the English-language service of C.T.K., the official Czechoslovak news agency.
        When he refused to join the Communist Party after the takeover in 1948, he was ousted as a journalist and eventually was sent to labor camps in the Silesian coal fields. Released in 1953, he obtained work as a technical editor in an educational publishing house and later translated Czechoslovak literature into English.
        When Soviet troops invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 he left for England, and for three years worked for publishers before joining the newly founded Writers and Scholars International and becoming assistant director of the Index, which draws attention to the work of writers whose work is suppressed for political reasons in their own countries. He became director of Writers and Scholars and editor of the Index in 1982.
        Mr. Theiner is survived by his wife, the former Shirley Harris, and by a son, Pavel, from his previous marriage to Anna Helisova, who died in 1971.
