        Dr. Alfred Lilienfeld, a Manhattan psychiatrist and expert on psychosomatic illness, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 88 and lived on the Upper West Side.
        The cause was an infection after a long period of failing health, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, Dr. Lilienfeld graduated Phi Beta Kappa from New York University and from Cornell University Medical College. His interest in psychosomatic illness was stirred in World War II while he served as a lieutenant commander at a naval station in New York. He then trained in psychiatry at New York Medical College.
        Until his health began to deteriorate several years ago, he was an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at New York University Medical Center. He also maintained a private practice on the Upper East Side, focusing on psychosomatic disorders.
        Dr. Lilienfeld is survived by his wife of 61 years, Sylvia Gettinger Lilienfeld; a sister, Beatrice Tanney, and two grandsons.
