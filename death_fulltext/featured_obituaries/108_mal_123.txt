        Hamed Abulnasr, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest and most powerful Islamic fundamentalist group, died in a Cairo hospital on Saturday, the group said. He was 82.
        After Mr. Abulnasr assumed leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood in 1986, it became increasingly influential by financing social services, working through professional unions and taking part in elections in concert with the political opposition.
        He was considered a moderate Islamic activist, who supported the imposition  of Islamic law but suggested that it could be carried out gradually. He insisted on a policy of nonviolence and worked to avoid confrontations with the state.
        "Moderation is basic for me," Mr. Abulnasr said in a recent interview with an Egyptian magazine. "We will not raise weapons against the Government under any circumstances."
        The Muslim Brotherhood, which is technically outlawed, had been largely tolerated by the Government since the 1970's. But since last year, the Government has jailed its most dynamic leaders and closed its headquarters, seeking to link it to the militants who have fought a four-year insurgency in southern Egypt. Mustafa Mashoor, 74, the Muslim Brotherhood's deputy leader, is  expected to take over.
        Mr. Abulnasr was born in 1913 in Manfalut in the southern province of Asyut.  His grandfather, Ali Abulnasr, was a scholar at Al Azhar, a leading center of Islamic learning in Cairo.
        Mr. Abulnasr is said to have met Hassan al-Banna, the Muslim Brotherhood's founder, in 1934 and then to have become one of his first followers. He was jailed from 1954 to 1973 with thousands of others when the Government tried to wipe out the organization.
        He is survived by two sons and a daughter.
