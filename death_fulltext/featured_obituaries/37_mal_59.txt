        Mr. Walsh joined A.&P. in 1942. After service in the Army during World War II he advanced at A.&P. through store management and regional supervisory posts to president of the Eastern division before being named executive vice president in 1971.
        After he left A.&P. Mr. Walsh fought the company's management over a shift of $200 million in surplus pension funds to cover write-offs resulting from a major cutback in the number of stores in the chain.
        He later wrote a book, ''The Rise and Decline of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company,'' published by Lyle Stuart in 1985.
        Mr. Walsh is survived by his wife, the former Charlotte Jerabek; a daughter, Mary, of Alpine; two sons, William, of Chatham Township, N.J., and Robert, of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.; a brother, Gerard, of El Paso; four sisters, Marilyn Krausch of Tucson, Ariz., Kathleen Owens of Nanuet, N.Y., Charlotte Buda of Wyckoff, N.J., and Claire Pappe of Hamburg, N.J., and eight grandsons.
