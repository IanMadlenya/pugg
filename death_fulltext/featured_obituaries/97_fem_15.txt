        Margaret Wade, who coached Delta State to three national championships in six seasons in the 1970's and in 1986 became the first woman named to the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday at the Bolivar County Hospital in Cleveland, Miss. She was 82.
        Her family said the cause was cancer.
        A native of Cleveland, Miss Wade was a star on the Delta State team there in the late 1920's before barnstorming with a semipro team known as the Tupelo Red Wings.
        Long before her college triumphs, Miss Wade had earned a reputation as a formidable coach on the high school level. In 21 years at Cleveland High School, she led the team to a 453-89-6 record. It was achieved, one of her former players said yesterday, by a combination of inspiring her players' devotion and working them to distraction.
        "She all but killed us doing calisthenics," said Sue King.
        After her high school career, Miss Wade joined Delta State, initially as a physical education instructor. The school had dropped women's basketball in 1932 as unsuitably rough for proper young ladies, but when college officials decided to revive it in 1973, Miss Wade was the obvious choice to coach.
        Over the next six seasons her teams compiled a 157-23 record, won three national championships and set a record of 51 consecutive victories, from 1974 to 1976.
        During her final season, 1978-79, the annual Wade Trophy was established to honor the outstanding college player.
        She is survived by a brother, Broughton Wade.
