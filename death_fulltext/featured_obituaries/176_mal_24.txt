        Robert Half, the founder and president of Robert Half International, an employment agency, died on Aug. 31 in Lantana, Fla. Mr. Half, a resident of Palm Beach, was 82.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered in July, said Marc Silbert, a son-in-law. Mr. Half died at the skilled nursing center at Donnelly Place at Lakeside Village in Lantana.
        Mr. Half was a pioneer in the employment field. His company -- an employment agency for accountants that he and his wife, Maxine, started in 1947 as the Robert Half Personnel Agency -- was one of the first agencies to offer specialized services.
        They also started Accountemps, a division that provided accountants for temporary work.
        By the time Mr. Half retired in 1986, the company had 150 offices around the United States.
        Mr. Half graduated from New York University in 1940 with a degree in accounting.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Nancy Carter of Palm Beach and Peggy Silbert of Sands Point, N.Y., and six grandchildren.
