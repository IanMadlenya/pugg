        Glenn Walter Johnson Jr., an inventor who devised a pneumatic ankle brace that is now widely used in the treatment of ankle sprains, died on Thursday at Overlook Hospital in Summit, N.J. He was 75 and lived in Summit.
        The cause was cancer, a step-daughter, Juliet McVicker, said.
        Mr. Johnson founded Aircast Inc. in 1972 after he invented the ankle brace system. He patented the orthopedic device in May 1976.
        The brace was one of more than 30 patents issued to Mr. Johnson. Among his other inventions were a highway pavement marker with a glass reflector that made it more visible and a device known as the venaflow system, which helps prevent coagulation of the blood in veins in and around the heart and lungs.
        Before founding Aircast, Mr. Johnson served as executive vice president of the Amerace Corporation, an industrial products company.
        Mr. Johnson was born in Albuquerque, N.M., on May 24, 1921. As a lieutenant in the United States Army Air Corps, Mr. Johnson was both a test pilot and a B-17 combat pilot. He was shot down on April 11, 1944, in the European theater. In 1948 he graduated summa cum laude from Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif.
        In 1948, he married Maxine Borgman of Jackson Hole, Wyo. She died later, and in October 1970 he married Harriet McVicker of Wellesley, Mass.
        In addition to his wife, who lives in Summit, and his step-daughter, Ms. McVicker, of Bristol, Vt., he is survived by a sister, Betsey Davis of Albuquerque; two daughters, Kristina Flanagan of Petaluma, Calif., and Mitzi Johnson of San Francisco; a son, Jim Johnson of Mendham, N.J.; a second step-daughter, Mary Noyes of Freeport, Me.; two step-sons, Jack McVicker of Madison, N.J., and Joe McVicker of Glendale, Ariz., and 11 grandchildren.
