        Gordon K. Lewis, a leading expert on Caribbean politics, died today. He was 72.
        The University of Puerto Rico, which reported his death, said he died after a lengthy illness.
        A native of Wales, he first came to Puerto Rico to help write its first constitution, adopted in 1952. He earned his doctorate in 1954 at Harvard University and then returned to Puerto Rico.
        He joined the political science department at the University of Puerto Rico in the 1950's and served as director of the university's Institute of Caribbean Studies from 1983 to 1987.
        He had been a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, the University of California, Brandeis University, Oxford University and Michigan State University. He served as a consultant to the governments of Trinidad and Tobago and the United States Virgin Islands.
        The university said he had just completed a book on the Caribbean, to be published by Johns Hopkins University Press. His other books included "Grenada: The Jewel Despoiled," published in 1987, on the 1983 invasion of Grenada by forces led by the United States; "The Main Currents of Caribbean Thought," published in 1983; "With the Saints at the River: The Jonestown Guyana Holocaust," 1978, and "Puerto Rico: Freedom and Power in the Caribbean," 1962.
        He is survived by his wife, Sybil Farrell de Lewis, and five children.
