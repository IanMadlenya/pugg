        James A. D. Geier, a former chairman and chief executive of Milacron Inc. of Cincinnati, a producer of plastics and metal-working technology, died on Wednesday in a hospital in Portland, Me. He was 75.
        Mr. Geier suffered a ruptured aneurysm in his heart while racing his sailboat in the Volvo Leukemia Regatta on July 21 near his summer home in Boothbay Harbor, Me., said Steven Oney, his son-in-law.
        A strong advocate of research and development, Mr. Geier was known for spurring Milacron into plastics-processing machinery from traditional machine tools. Plastics processing eventually became the company's largest business.
        He is also credited with focusing on markets overseas, including Europe and Asia.
        Mr. Geier tried to preserve Milacron's close-knit atmosphere. At one point, he said he knew half of the company's 5,000 employees in Cincinnati.
        Mr. Geier joined Milacron, which was then the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company, in 1951, as a machinist. Moving up through the ranks, he became vice president in 1964, and president and chief executive in 1970.
        Mr. Geier was Milacron's chairman from 1981 to 1990. He continued on the company's board as chairman of the executive committee until 1996, when he became director emeritus.
        Mr. Geier's grandfather, Frederick V. Geier, started the company in the 1850's. He and two partners opened a small workshop, which made screws and taps for manufacturers, in downtown Cincinnati. The company was incorporated in 1884.
        Mr. Geier is survived by his wife, Christine Paske Geier of Cincinnati; three children, Deborah Anne Oney of West Barnstable, Mass., James Develin Geier of Miami Beach, and Aylward Whittier Geier of Cincinnati; two sisters, Mary Alice Turner of Cincinnati and Amey Acheson Garber of Melbourne Beach, Fla.; a brother, Frederick V. Geier Jr. of Santa Ana, Calif.; and four grandchildren.
