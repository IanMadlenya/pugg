        Johnny Adams, the Hall of Fame trainer who as a jockey won horse racing's Preakness Stakes, died on Saturday at his home in Arcadia, Calif., after a lengthy illness. He was 79.
        Mr. Adams's riding career began in the early 1930's. He rode 3,270 winners, which earned more than $9.7 million. His biggest victory came aboard Hasty Road in the 1954 Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown. He also won the Santa Anita Handicap twice and the Kentucky Oaks twice.
        Mr. Adams became a trainer after retiring from riding in 1958. He was inducted in the Racing Hall of Fame in 1965.
        One of the horses he trained, J. O. Tobin, beat the previously undefeated Seattle Slew, a Triple Crown winner, in the 1977 Swaps Stakes.
        Mr. Adams is survived by his wife, Pat, and three grandchildren.
