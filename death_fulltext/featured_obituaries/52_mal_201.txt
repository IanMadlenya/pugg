        David H. Frisch, a professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 40 years, died Thursday at his home in Cambridge. He was 73 years old.
        He died of cancer, said a spokesman for M.I.T.
        Dr. Frisch graduated from Princeton University in 1940 and received a Ph.D. at M.I.T. in 1947. He conducted basic research from 1943 to 1945 for the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, but later became a strong proponent of nuclear disarmament.
        He joined the faculty at M.I.T. in 1946 and became an assistant professor in 1948, an associate professor in 1952 and a full professor in 1958. He retired in 1988.
        He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and once headed an American Academy of Arts and Sciences committee on the technical problems of arms limitation.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose, a professor at the Harvard University School of Public Health; a son, Henry, a physics professor at the University of Chicago; a daughter, Ruth Dealy, an artist in Providence, R.I., and four granddaughters.
