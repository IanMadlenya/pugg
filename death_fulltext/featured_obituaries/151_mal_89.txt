        Dr. George T. Harrell Jr., founding dean of the medical colleges at both the University of Florida and Pennsylvania State University, died on Thursday at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C. He was 91.
        Dr. Harrell came to the University of Florida in 1954 to design and develop the College of Medicine within the J. Hillis Miller Health Center, now the Health Science Center.
        Dr. Harrell began the medical school with a $5 million state appropriation. The colleges of Medicine and Nursing opened in 1956.
        In Dr. Harrell's 10 years at the university here, he emphasized the importance of training doctors to understand and care for the whole patient and advocated the concept of training students in small groups.
        Dr. Harrell resigned in 1964 and became founding dean and a vice president for medical sciences at Milton S. Hershey's Medical Center at Pennsylvania State University, retiring in 1973.
        Dr. Harrell wrote several articles and books, including ''Planning Medical Center Facilities,'' and became an international consultant on developing medical schools and hospitals. He also received international recognition for his research on Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the 1940's.
        His survivors include two sons, George Thomas Harrell 3d of Jacksonville, Fla., and Robert Griffin Harrell of Gainesville, and four grandchildren.
