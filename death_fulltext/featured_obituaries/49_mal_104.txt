        Marcel Tolkowsky, a Belgian-born gemologist and mathematician who developed the symmetry for cutting diamonds for maximum brilliancy, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, his son-in-law, Donald J. Berets of Stamford, Conn., said.
        In 1919, as part of his doctoral thesis at the University of London, Mr. Tolkowsky developed a mathematical formula for cutting and angling facets on diamonds to provide maximum reflected light and optimum brilliance. The process, which called for cutting 58 facets on a diamond, came to be known as the "ideal cut."
        After immigrating to the United States in 1940, he continued as an active designer and dealer in diamonds until his retirement in 1975. He was a member of the Diamond Dealers Club for almost 50 years and chairman of its arbitration board. He was also a longtime member of the Diamond Trading and Precious Stones Association.
        He is survived by two daughters, Eileen Berets of Stamford and Nicole Kopf of East Hampton, L.I.; a brother, Edmund of Antwerp, Belgium, and two grandchildren.
