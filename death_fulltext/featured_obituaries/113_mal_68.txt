        Judge Nicholas S. Nunzio of the District of Columbia Superior Court, who presided over the trial of a dozen militants who seized three buildings in Washington and held more than a hundred people hostage in 1977, died on June 6 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 66 and lived in North Potomac, Md.
        The cause was complications after surgery, according to the hospital.
        Judge Nunzio was appointed to the Superior Court, in Washington, in 1970 by  President Richard M. Nixon, serving as an associate judge until 1985 when he became a senior judge who maintained a limited work schedule until last month.
        He gained prominence by presiding over a case that began in March 1977 with the armed seizure of the national headquarters of B'nai B'rith, the Washington Islamic Center, which is a religious shrine, and the District Building, the capital's City Hall. Twelve men held 134 people hostage at gunpoint for three days in an outcrop of a "holy war" among rival sects.
        A local radio reporter, Maurice Williams, was killed with a shotgun blast in  the takeover. Marion S. Barry Jr., then a City Councilman and now the Mayor, and two others were wounded, all in the District Building.
        After an eight-week trial, 12 black-separatist Hanafi Muslims were found guilty of an array of charges, including murder, conspiracy and armed kidnapping. Judge Nunzio imposed prison terms of 41 to 123 years.
        Judge Nunzio, a native of Bethlehem, Pa., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from George Washington University and from its law school. He worked for the Interstate Commerce Commission and the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel's Office in the 1960's before joining the Office of the United States Attorney as head of its grand-jury division.
        Judge Nunzio's survivors include his wife, Clara, and six children.
