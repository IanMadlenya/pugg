        In 1971, Mr. Margulis, who was a teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, began the Alpha School in a converted milk processing plant in the East New York section. Drug addicts from 13 to 18 years old, most of them dropouts from Jefferson, were brought into the rehabilitation program at the school. The Alpha School, which is financed by the state, is still in operation with about 117 students.
        Mr. Margulis is survived by his father, David of Brooklyn, and a brother.
