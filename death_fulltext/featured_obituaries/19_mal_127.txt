        Jack Sher, who wrote, directed or produced 32 feature films, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 75 years old.
        A family friend said the cause of death was a combination of influenza and cardiac problems.
        Mr. Sher wrote ''Paris Blues'' (1961), which starred Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, Joanne Woodward and Diahann Carroll. He also contributed much of the dialogue for the classic Western ''Shane'' (1953).
        He is survived by his wife, Moira; a son, Stephen, of Pasadena, Calif., and a daughter, Deborah, of Pikesville, Ky.
