        John A. Bellairs, an author of children's books, died on Friday at his home in Haverhill, Mass. He was 53 years old.
        He died of cardiovascular disease, his son, Frank J. Bellairs, said.
        Mr. Bellairs wrote 16 children's books, starting in 1973 with "The House With the Clock in Its Walls," a whimsical horror tale involving a wizard couples' scheme to end the world. The book, illustrated by Edward Gorey, and "The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn" (1978), about a rumored fortune buried in the walls of a town library, were made into television movies for children.
        His "Figure in the Shadows" (1975) features a fat young hero helped by a witch with a doctorate. "The Curse of the Blue Figurine" (1983) pits a boy against the malign spirit of a mad clergyman.
        Earlier, Mr. Bellairs wrote three books for adults, including "St. Fidgeta and Other Parodies" (1966).
        He was born in Marshall, Mich., and received a B.A. in English from the University of Notre Dame in 1959 and attended graduate school at the University of Chicago.
        In addition to his son, of Haverhill, he is survived by a brother, Frank V., and a sister, Sue K., both of Marshall, Mich.
