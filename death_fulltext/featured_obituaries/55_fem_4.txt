        Miss Southern's recordings include "You Better Go Now," "When I Fall in Love," "An Occasional Man" and "Fire Down Below," which she sang in the Rita Hayworth film of the same name in 1957. That song made it to the top-10 spot on the pop-music charts.
        Miss Southern, whose name was originally Genevieve Hering, was born in Royal, Neb. She began playing the piano as a child, and she trained as a classical pianist. She moved to Chicago in the mid-1940's. To support herself, she worked as a cocktail pianist, and built a reputation as a pop singer. She was signed by Decca Records, which released her first single in 1951.
        In the late 1960's, Miss Southern stopped performing publicly and began teaching vocal and piano technique to others in the profession. She continued to write and arrange songs, and published a book, "Interpreting Popular Music at the Keyboard."
        Miss Southern had been divorced for more than 10 years from the jazz musician Bill Holman, but she continued to use that last name privately. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by two grandchildren.
