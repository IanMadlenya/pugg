        Giulio Gari, a tenor who sang at both the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Gloria.
        Mr. Gari was born in Medias, Romania, in 1909. After singing operetta roles in Romania and Hungary, he studied at the Verdi Conservatory in Milan, Italy. In 1937 he made his formal debut at the Teatro Reale in Rome, stepping in at the last minute for Tito Schipa. Two years later, he came to the United States to work as a soloist for NBC radio. He made his American opera debut in Gian Carlo Menotti's "Amelia Goes to the Ball," at the St. Louis Grand Opera.
        In 1945, he made his New York City Opera debut in Wagner's "Flying Dutchman" and quickly took on more of the company's leading roles. Mr. Gari moved to the Met in 1953, making his debut as Pinkerton in "Madama Butterfly" and eventually singing 22 roles with the company before retiring in 1961. He also made recordings of "Aida" and "Carmen" and appeared in a film of "La Traviata" in the mid-1950's.
        Mr. Gari taught at the Curtis Institute and Temple University. He had a private teaching studio in New York.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Glen Gary, and a daughter, Gayle Gari Cohen, both of New York City.
