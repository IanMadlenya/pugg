        Joseph Marie Cardinal Trinh Van Can, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Hanoi, died of a heart attack on Friday, the official Vietnam News Agency reported today. He was 69 years old.
        The Cardinal died at his office in the Vietnamese capital, said the report, monitored here. A funeral will be held in Hanoi on Wednesday. The report said he was the founding president of the Vietnam Episcopal Council and the apostolic administrator of Hue Province, in central Vietnam, and of the dioceses of Hung Hoa, Thai Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces, in the north.
        The Vatican said Pope John Paul II sent a telegram of sympathy to Vietnam's Auxiliary Bishop, Francois Xavier Nguyen Van Sang. Cardinal Can was born on March 13, 1921, in Ha Nam Ninh Province, southeast of Hanoi. He entered the priesthood in 1949, was made co-adjutor to the Archbishop of Hanoi in February 1963 and elevated to Cardinal in June 1979.
        The authorities have eased restrictions on Catholics and other believers since Nguyen Van Linh became Communist Party chief in late 1986.
