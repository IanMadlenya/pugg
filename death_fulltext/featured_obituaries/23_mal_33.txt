        John H. Geisse, a World War I aviator and aeronautical inventor, died of heart failure Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianaoplis. He was 96 years old and lived in Indianapolis.
        Mr. Geisse, a 1917 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, was an early and ardent proponent of private aviation in the 1930's.
        In 1934 he was named director of development for the Bureau of Air Commerce, a forerunner of the Federal Aviation Administration, and pressed for the development of safe, low-cost airplanes for private owners. He invented a crosswind landing gear, enabling planes to land in difficult wind conditions at airports with single or parallel runways.
        He also designed the first electrical system for de-icing the wings of airplanes.
        He was with the Government for 17 years before retiring in 1949. In 1950 he received the Department of Commerce's Gold Medal Award for his contributions to civil aviation.
        After his retirement from government, he continued work on his inventions and obtained numerous patents.
        He is survived by a son, John F., of Indianapolis, and a daughter, Nancy C. Falls, of Red Wing, Minn.; 13 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.
