        Paul Laurent, a senior official of the French Communist Party, died of cancer on Sunday. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Laurent joined the Communist Party at the age of 20. He led the party's youth movement from 1954 to 1962.
        He was secretary of the party's Central Committee, a member of its Politburo and a close ally of Georges Marchais, the leader of the party. He was also one of three Communists on the Paris City Council.
        Last year he led the Communists in negotiations with France's governing Socialists to coordinate leftist candidacies in municipal elections.
