        George C. Scott Jr., a former vice chairman of Citibank who served as its top credit policy executive in the late 1960's and early 1970's, died Monday at his home in Locust, N.J., according to Nancy Crabbe, his niece. He was 95.
        Mr. Scott went to work at Citibank in 1929 as a messenger after attending Principia College for two years. Except for a period in World War II, when he served as an officer at a seaplane training base in Pensacola, Fla., and then as a loan officer in the Navy's Office of Procurement and Material, he spent his entire career at Citibank.
        George S. Moore, Citibank's chairman and chief executive in 1967 when Mr. Scott was named chairman of the bank's credit policy committee, said that Mr. Scott earned the post by demonstrating a willingness to speak out when he thought Mr. Moore was making a mistake.
        Former colleagues often described Mr. Scott as an old-fashioned banker, weighing the personal integrity of clients as well as their balance sheets.
        Mr. Scott became vice chairman in 1971 and retired in 1973.
        Years later, when asked how Citibank could have accumulated so many bad debts in the 1980's, Mr. Wriston said, ''There was no George Scott.''
        Mr. Scott, who was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 27, 1908, was the son of George C. Scott, president of the United States Steel Corporation, and the former Ruth Spencer. His wife of 64 years, the former Jean Chadbourne, died in 1999.
        In addition to Ms. Crabbe, of Beechwood, N.J., he is survived by another niece, Nancy S. Cameron, of Dataw Island, S.C.
