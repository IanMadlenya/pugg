        Dr. Ralph Decker Bennett, a physicist who retired as research director of the Martin Marietta Corporation in 1966, died in Concord Hospital on Feb. 15 while visiting friends in Concord, N.H. He was 93 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Bennett had been a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a naval officer overseeing ordnance laboratories in World War II and a director of an atomic laboratory for General Electric. After retiring he was a consultant for the Coast Guard, the Naval Oceanographic Office and the San Francisco Museum of Art, where he worked on textile conservation.
        Dr. Bennett was born in Williamson, N.Y. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. He also received a master's there in electrical engineering and earned his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Chicago in 1925.
        After postdoctoral studies at Princeton University and the California Institute of Technology, he taught at M.I.T. He was commissioned into the Navy in 1938 and became a captain. He was technical director of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, overseeing its relocation to White Oak, Md., and establishing the plant now known as the Naval Surface Warfare Center.
        Dr. Bennett joined G.E. in 1954 as director of its Vallecitos Atomic Laboratory near Livermore, Calif., when it was the largest private laboratory of its kind. He became a vice president and research director at Martin Marietta in 1961.
        Surviving are his wife, Anna Gray Bennett; Sarah Reichart of Princeton, N.J., a daughter from his first marriage, to Louise Northrop, who died in 1933; Ralph Jr., of Silver Spring, a son from his second marriage, to Mary Johnson Bennett, from whom he was divorced in 1966, and four grandchildren.
