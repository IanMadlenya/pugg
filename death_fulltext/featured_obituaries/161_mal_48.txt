        Earl T. Shinhoster, a senior official of the N.A.A.C.P. who served as its interim leader in the mid-1990's, died on Sunday in a auto accident near Montgomery, Ala. He was 49 and lived in Decatur, Ga.
        The Alabama State Police said Mr. Shinhoster was the passenger in a car that blew a tire and then hit a tree. The driver was listed in good condition yesterday.
        Mr. Shinhoster was the acting executive director and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for a year in 1995-96, helping it overcome years of turmoil and debts after the forced resignation of his predecessor, the Rev. Benjamin F. Chavis Jr.
        He was succeeded by the present chief executive, Kweisi Mfume, a former United States representative from Maryland.
        At his death, Mr. Shinhoster was director of its People's Voter Empowerment program, a national educational and voter-registration project.
        A native of Savannah, Ga., he graduated with a degree in political science from Morehouse College. He started working for the N.A.A.C.P. as a teenager, stuffing envelopes and taking part in the sit-ins of the 1960's. Among the senior positions he held were southeastern regional director and national field secretary. This year he was working to ensure that African-Americans were properly counted in the 2000 Census.
        Mr. Shinhoster's survivors include his wife, Ruby, and a son, Michael, both of Decatur.
