        Viscount Paul de Rosiere, an international businessman who was an executive for the Cartier and Harry Winston jewelry companies, died on Jan. 19 at the Hospice of Palm Beach, in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 87 and had lived in Palm Beach since his retirement in 1988.
        The cause was endomyocarditis, said his wife of 38 years, Viscountess Harriette de Rosiere, the former Harriette d'Arbonson Moeller of Columbus, Ohio, and New York.
        Born in Nancy, France, he attended high school in Paris and attended St. John's College in Annapolis, Md.
        After the war, he became general manager of Fonderies de Creil and led a group of French businessmen on a tour of American plants to determine how to speed France's industrial recovery.
        In 1950, he moved to New York, where he joined Cartier. Seven years later he joined Harry Winston and continued his association with the company when he returned to Paris in 1962.
        By 1979, he had resumed work with Cartier, this time in Houston.  Upon his retirement, he moved to Palm Beach.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Roland, of Paris.
