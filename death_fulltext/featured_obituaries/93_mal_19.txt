        Richard M. Livingston, who founded and ran an electronics manufacturing company for three decades and was an official of the United States Golf Association, died on Wednesday while vacationing in Turkey.
        He was 74 and lived in Larchmont, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.
        The cause of death was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Livingston was the founder and president of Rye Industries, an electronics manufacturer in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He later sold the business. He was a member of the rules committee of the United States Golf Association, as well as a director of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        He was a benefactor of the Anti-Defamation League, which was founded by his father, Sigmund Livingston, in 1913.
        Mr. Livingston is survived by his wife, Mimi; a daughter, Laurie Livingston of San Carlos, Calif.; two sons, Randall, of Woodside, Calif., and Richard S., of Baltimore, and eight grandchildren.
