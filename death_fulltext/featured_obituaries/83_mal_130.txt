        Maj. Gen. George W. Hickman Jr., a former Judge Advocate General of the Army, died last Tuesday at his home in Maryville, Tenn. He was 89.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        General Hickman was a native of Calhoun, Ky., and a 1926 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He received a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1948.
        He served as Staff Judge Advocate of the Far East Command under Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and held the same post with the United Nations forces in the Korean War. As senior legal adviser to the United Nations delegation, he helped negotiate the terms of an armistice between Communist forces and the United Nations that ended the war on July 27, 1953.
        He served as Judge Advocate General, the Army's top legal officer, from 1957 through 1961. His decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal, the Bronze Star and the Legion of Honor with two oak-leaf clusters.
        After he retired from the Army in 1961, he was a professor of law and acting dean of the University of San Diego Law School. He retired from the law school in 1968.
        General Hickman's wife of 54 years, Margaret Morrison Hickman, died last July. He is survived by three daughters, Peggy Wirtz of Knoxville, Tenn., Patricia Livingston of South Bend, Ind., and Mary Lee Fefer of Auburn, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
