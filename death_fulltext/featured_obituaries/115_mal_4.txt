        Howard Reed Gill Jr., a founder of Golf Digest magazine who helped build it from a schoolmates' enterprise into an international monthly selling more than a million copies, died on Tuesday at his home in Fairfield, Conn. He was 73 and also had a residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Golf Digest got its start in the early 1950's, when three friends from Northwestern University -- William H. Davis, John F. Barrett and Mr. Gill -- distributed its initial version at golf courses in the Chicago area. Mr. Gill subsidized the undertaking by working as a chicken farmer.
        After a shaky start, the publication moved to newsstands and then to national distribution in 1957. It was acquired by The New York Times Company in 1969 and passed the 1 million circulation mark in 1980.
        Mr. Gill retired in 1988 after 35 years as its publisher, having also been the publisher of a sister publication, Tennis, from 1976 to 1985. He was director of the National Golf Foundation in the late 1970's.
        He is survived by his wife, Marianne; two sons, Howard R. 3d, of Riverview, Fla., and Scott A., of Bozeman, Mont.; a daughter, Deborah V. Gill of San Francisco; three stepchildren, and seven grandchildren.
