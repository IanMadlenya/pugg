        Julian Pretto, an art dealer known for his devotion to young artists, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village. He was 50 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Rene Pierre Allain, an artist whom Mr. Pretto represented.
        Mr. Pretto was born in Chicago, grew up in Ogelsvey, Ill., and was a graduate of the University of Illinois. After working at the Richard Gray Gallery in Chicago, in 1968 he moved to New York, where he worked for Richard L. Feigen & Company and Sperone Westwater. Starting in the early 1970's, and into the early 1990's, Mr. Pretto opened a number of small galleries in SoHo, TriBeCa and the West Village.
        Long before anyone used the term micro-gallery, Mr. Pretto specialized in showcasing works by unknown artists, and sometimes saved money by living in his galleries. He gave many emerging artists their first solo shows, among them Allan McCollum, Maureen Gallace, Julian Lethbridge, John Zinsser, Cary Smith and Mr. Allain. He also exhibited more established artists, including Sol LeWitt, Marcia Hafif, Eve Sonneman, Mary Obering, Merrill Wagner and Carl Andre.
        Over the years, Mr. Pretto accumulated a collection of mostly small works that he recently gave to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.
        He is survived by his mother, Ursula Lawrence of Deltona, Fla.; two sisters, Donna, of Spring Valley, Ill., and Rose, of St. Augustine, Fla.; and a brother, John, of Pensacola, Fla.
