        She was born in Minneapolis and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. When she moved to Manhattan in 1959, Mrs. Reith became interested in the difficulties of foreign students communicating in colloquial English.
        She began tutoring a few students, recruited her friends and founded English in Action. There are now 31 branches nationally, under the auspices of the English-Speaking Union.
        Mrs. Reith moved to Claremont in the late 1970's.
        She is survived by a son, John, of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a daughter, Marianne Hatfield of Porterville, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
