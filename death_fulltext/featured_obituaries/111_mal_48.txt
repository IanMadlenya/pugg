        Lee A. Ault, an art collector and former art dealer and publisher, died on Sunday at his home in Locust Valley, N.Y. He was 80.
        Mr. Ault was born in Cincinnati in 1915, a grandson of a founder of the Ault  & Wiborg Company, at one time the largest producer of printing inks in the world. He attended St. Paul's School, in Concord, N.H., and earned a bachelor's  degree from Princeton University in 1937.
        He worked as a reporter for Newsweek and as a founding director of Vision Incorporated, a news magazine focusing on Latin America. During World War II, he served in the American Field Service, attached to the British Eighth Army in North Africa, and later as a Marine Corps officer in the South Pacific.
        After the war, Mr. Ault founded Quadrangle Press in New York, publishing lavishly illustrated monographs on such artists as Miro and Tamayo, and books by artists, including an edition of Aesop's Fables illustrated by Alexander Calder.
        In 1957, he purchased a controlling interest in the magazine Art in America,  serving as its publisher until 1969, when it was sold to Whitney Communications. In 1970, he opened Lee Ault & Company, a gallery on Madison Avenue, where he exhibited works by such contemporary artists as Armando Morales, Elizabeth de Cuevas, Judith Rothschild and Bernard Langlais, as well as West African and Pre-Columbian art. He retired in 1978 and closed the gallery.
        Mr. Ault's first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife,  Laura Leonard Ault; a daughter, Dorothy A. Nobel of Mill Valley, Calif.; a son,  Lee Ault 3d of Los Angeles; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
