        George H. Wiedeman, a psychiatrist and educator, died Dec. 27 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Born in Moscow, he studied in Berlin and Frankfurt, and earned his medical degree at the University of Prague in 1937. He came to the United States just before World War II.
        Dr. Wiedeman interned for two years in Springfield, Mass., practiced as a physician three years in Leominster, Mass., and served two years as a captain in the United States Army Medical Corps.
        After graduating in the first class of the Menninger School of Psychiatry in Topeka, Kan., he became a staff psychiatrist for the Veterans Administration in Newark. In 1949 he began training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and the next year he started his own practice, continuing until he retired last July.
        He was a lecturer and professor at the Columbia School of Social Work for 30 years, worked 20 years as a lecturer and supervising analyst at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center and taught at New York University and the Psychoanalytic Institute.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rachel Henkins, and a son, Michael, of Charleston, W.Va.
