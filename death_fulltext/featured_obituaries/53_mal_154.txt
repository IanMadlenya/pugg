        Valentine George Nicholas Lawford, a former member of the British diplomatic service, died Tuesday at North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 80 years old and lived in Oyster Bay Cove, L.I.
        Mr. Lawford, who was in the hospital for a series of tests, died suddenly and the cause has not yet been determined, a spokesman for the family said.
        From 1939 to 1946, Mr. Lawford was private secretary to three successive Foreign Secretaries: Lord Halifax, Anthony Eden and Ernest Bevin. During World War II he was the official interpreter for the British at a number of conferences and war councils with the French and regularly served as interpreter for Churchill in his conversations with de Gaulle.
        As a member of Britain's delegation, Mr. Lawford attended the conferences in Moscow, Quebec and Yalta, and from 1946 to 1949 was the alternate British delegate to the United Nations Security Council. From 1949 to 1950, when he resigned from the diplomatic service, he was political counselor and charge d'affaires at the British Embassy in Teheran, Iran.
        After his resignation, Mr. Lawford settled in Oyster Bay with his companion, the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst, and devoted himself to writing and painting. His books include "Bound for Diplomacy," an autobiography (Atlantic-Little, Brown; 1963) and "Horst, His Work & His World" (Alfred Knopf; 1984). His watercolors have been widely exhibited.
        He is survived by two brothers and a sister who live in England.
