        S. Maurice Plotnick, an educator who headed the Westchester Day School in Mamaroneck, N.Y., died Dec. 28 at White Plains Hospital. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Plotnick died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        A scholarship student at Cambridge University , he graduated with an honors degree in mathematics in 1938, and spent the next two years preparing Jewish youths in Berlin and Baghdad who wanted to take British university entrance exams as a way of fleeing the rapidly advancing war.
        He came to the United States in 1940 as a dorm master for Yeshiva University and later headed the Maimonides School in Boston. He was lured away in 1948 to help start a Jewish day school in Mamaroneck on a 26-acre wooded lot overlooking the Long Island Sound that had formerly belonged to an heiress to the Arnold Constable fortune.
        Though the school was not the area's first to combine secular learning and Jewish studies, "it was the first to take hold," said Martin Horowitz, a cantor and longtime instructor at the school. The school ultimately became the magnet for an entire Jewish community in Westchester.  Algebra and Poetry
        Besides calling himself "headmaster" in the British mold, Mr. Plotnick's mission, said Ivan Marcus, the provost of the Jewish Theological Seminary and a parent of four children who attended the school, "was to combine the best of the British public school with the best of the enlightened yeshiva world."
        Mr. Plotnick also took personal delight in teaching his eighth graders algebra and in reading poetry to younger children. When he retired in 1982, he became an adjunct professor of math at Pace University.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Jessica and Jennifer, and a son, Jonah, all at home; a sister, Jenny Celner of London, and a brother, Harry Masters of Boston.
