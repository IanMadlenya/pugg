        Francisca Kallir, a co-owner of the Galerie St. Etienne, a New York art gallery specializing in paintings by Grandma Moses and by Austrian and German Expressionists, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.
        Mrs. Kallir (pronounced kah-LEER) was born in Oberau in what is now southern Germany. A countess by birth, she was named Francisca zu Lowenstein. She attended schools in England and Germany and in 1922 married Otto Kallir, who owned an art gallery and a publishing house in Vienna.
        The Kallirs and their two children fled Nazism in 1938, settled in Manhattan in 1939, and founded the gallery at 46 West 57th Street. It was moved to 24 West 57th Street in 1960.
        The gallery at first dealt mainly in works by Austrian and German Expressionists, among them Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, but soon became a showcase for the work of Grandma Moses. The artist had her first one-woman show there in 1940.
        Mr. Kallir died in 1978.
        Mrs. Kallir is survived by a daughter, Evamarie, of Vienna; a son, John, of Scarsdale, N.Y., and two granddaughters.
