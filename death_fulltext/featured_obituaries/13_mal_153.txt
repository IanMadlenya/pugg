        Alfred Y. Morgan Jr., chairman of the White Rock Products Corporation, died of cancer Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Morgan's grandfather, John Morgan, emigrated from Ireland in the 1850's and opened a carbonated-beverage plant on West 40th Street, selling soft drinks from a wagon he drove to Irish taverns and restaurants. His son, Alfred, took over the business in 1912. After Alfred died, Alfred Jr. left Fordham University to become head of the company.
        In 1948, White Rock, then part of the National Distillers and Chemical Corporation, bought the Morgan Beverage Company and retained Mr. Morgan to manage the operation. By 1950 he had become president of White Rock and two years later he bought it - including the 88-year-old White Rock Girl trademark - from National Distillers. White Rock Products is now based in Whitestone, Queens.
        Two of Mr. Morgan's uncles, Patrick Morgan and Frank Morgan, both now deceased, founded the Morgan & Brother Moving Van Company, now the Morgan Manhattan Storage Company.
        Mr. Morgan was the grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade in 1952. He was a former president of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick and a member of the Knights of Malta.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Muriel Stafford; a son, Alfred Y. 3d, of Manhattan, the president of White Rock Products; two daughters, Muriel Bodkin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Martha Kenny of Locust Valley, L.I.; five sisters, Annette Hughes of Delray Beach, Fla., Charlotte Murphy and Angela Stein, both of New Canaan, Conn., Martha Buckhout of Easton, Md., and Dorothy Loughman of Vero Beach, Fla., and 12 grandchildren.
