        Larry A. Grenier Jr., a dancer who performed with the Joffrey Ballet, Eliot Feld and Twyla Tharp, died on Wednesday at the Maitri AIDS Hospice in San Francisco. He was 46 and lived in San Francisco.
        Mr. Grenier performed a wide range of dramatic and pure dance roles during his years on stage, which ended in the mid-1970's. But he is probably best remembered for the solo he performed as a Joffrey dancer at the end of Twyla Tharp's "As Time Goes By," dancing that captured his quiet, self-contained eloquence and musicality.
        I was dumbfounded," Ms. Tharp told Elinor Rogosin in an interview at the time, describing her reaction to Mr. Grenier's gifts in a rehearsal for the ballet. "I just sat there and said: 'Can I believe my eyes? Is this as exceptional as I feel it is? Is this really such a fine male lyric dancer?' "
        Mr. Grenier trained at the Juilliard School and was a charter member of Mr. Feld's American Ballet Company, where he danced through 1971. He appeared that year on Broadway in "Two Gentlemen of Verona."
        He joined the Joffrey in 1972, dancing roles that included Bottom in Sir Frederick Ashton's "Dream" and Iago in Jose Limon's "Moor's Pavane," as well as  in Jerome Robbins's "N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz" and Ms. Tharp's "Deuce Coupe."
        Mr. Grenier also danced with Lar Lubovitch, Kazuko Hirabayashi and Ms. Tharp  before joining the staff of the San Francisco Ballet School, where he taught from 1973 to 1983. He also taught at the University of Calgary in Canada.
        He is survived by his companion, Ben Janken; his mother, Ruth Grenier, of Waterville, Me.; his father, Larry Grenier Sr., of Oakland, Me.; three sisters,  Betty Mead of Rochester, N.H., Pamela Lapera of Mahopac, N.Y., and Kathy Baron of Waterville; and two brothers, Paul and James John, also of Waterville.
