        Joseph Kestin, a professor of engineering at Brown University for 41 years, died on Tuesday at Miriam Hospital in Providence, R.I. Professor Kestin, who lived in Providence, was 79.
        The cause of death was acute leukemia, said his daughter, Dr. Anita Kestin.
        Professor Kestin was born in Warsaw and graduated from Technical University there in 1937. He reached England during World War II and earned his doctorate at the Imperial College in London.
        He joined Brown in 1952 as an engineering professor and director of Brown's Center for Energy Studies. He headed the center until 1984 when the university named him a research professor. He also lectured widely at other universities in this country and overseas.
        He was the author of five books on thermodynamics and of 250 research papers in that field, and the translator of another five books from German and Russian.
        Besides his daughter, also a resident of Providence, Professor Kestin is survived by his wife, the former Alicj Drabienko.
