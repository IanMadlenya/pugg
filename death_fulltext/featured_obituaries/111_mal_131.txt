        Kenneth M. Stark, a Manhattan real estate lawyer who was active in community  services on the Lower East Side, particularly those for the homeless and mentally disturbed, died on Wednesday at his second home, in Glen Cove, L.I. He  was 68 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Stark graduated from Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., and received his law degree from New York University.
        He was a founding member of the firm of Stark, Amron, Liner & Narotsky, which will continue to bear his name.
        He spent much of his free time serving as a trustee and senior vice president of the Educational Alliance, a 107-year-old Lower East Side settlement house, community center and social service agency.
        He contributed his legal and real estate expertise to the Alliance, supported its educational programs and played a key role in bolstering its Community Center on East 14th Street.
        Mr. Stark is survived by his wife, Celia; three daughters, Tina Weisenfeld and Betsy and Jane Stark, all of Manhattan; two sisters, Lila Hershey of Paramus, N.J., and Marjorie Leshaw of Manhattan.
