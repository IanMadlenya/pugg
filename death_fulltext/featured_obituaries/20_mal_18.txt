        Gert Frobe, the German actor who starred as Goldfinger in the James Bond film of that name, died of a heart attack today in a Munich hospital. He was 75 years old.
        Mr. Frobe appeared in nearly 100 movies, but was best known for his role as the greedy villain in the 1964 Bond film. He also appeared in the 1965 Hollywood movie ''Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines'' and in Rene Clement's ''Is Paris Burning?'' in 1966. In Nazi Party, but Hid 2 Jews
        Mr. Frobe's agent, Pal Berkovicsa, said the actor had suffered a heart attack about a week ago at a spa at Starnberger Lake near Munich.
        In 1965, Mr. Frobe made headlines when he was quoted by the British newspaper The Daily Mail as saying: ''Naturally I was a Nazi.''
        Mr. Frobe denied making the comment. ''What I told an English reporter during an interview,'' he said, ''was that during the Third Reich I had the luck to be able to help two Jewish people, although I was a member of the Nazi party.''
        Israel banned Mr. Frobe's films for several months until a Jew, Mario Blumenau, informed the Israeli Embassy in Vienna that his life and his mother's had probably been saved when Mr. Frobe hid them from the Nazis.
        Mr. Frobe, whose given name was Karl-Gerhard, was born on Feb. 25, 1913, in the town of Planitz in what is now East Germany. He studied theater during the early years of the Third Reich. After theaters were closed by the Nazis in 1944, he was drafted into the German Army, in which he served until the end of World War II.
        Mr. Frobe is survived by his fifth wife, Karin, and by two sons from previous marriages, Utz and Andreas.
