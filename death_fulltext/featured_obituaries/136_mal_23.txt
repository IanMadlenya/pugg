        Charles W. V. Meares, a former chairman and chief executive of the New York Life Insurance Company, died on April 29 at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 91.
        Mr. Meares, who was known as Vic, emigrated with his family from England in 1923, when he was 16. He went to work for New York Life that year as a $75-a-month clerk in the actuarial department.
        During his 48 years with the company, he worked in the personnel and insurance-operations departments, eventually rising to vice president and heading the those offices.
        In 1967, Mr. Meares was elected to the company's board, and he became one of three executive vice presidents reporting to the chief executive. He was named chairman and chief executive in 1969, posts he held until he retired in 1971.
        Mr. Meares served on the boards of several charitable organizations, including the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, where he was a senior vice president; the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, and United Student Aid Funds.
        He is survived by his daughter, Jennifer Meinert of New Rochelle, and four grandchildren. His first wife, Ivy R. Hutton, died in 1981, and his second wife, Maria Luisa Cisneros, died in 1994.
