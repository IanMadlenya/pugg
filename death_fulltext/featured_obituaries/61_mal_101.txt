        Donald P. Ruddy, a designer of furniture and accessories and the publisher of a portfolio of art by people with AIDS, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 38 years old.
        Mr. Ruddy died of complications from AIDS, including Kaposi's sarcoma, said his companion, Edgardo Heydra.
        He graduated from the University of Virginia in 1975 with a B.S. in architecture. Mr. Ruddy later founded Ruddy Design and Ruddy Products, two companies that specialized in innovative furniture and graphics. Included in his products were tables, lamps and chairs made of pastel-colored concrete and diaries and calendars of aluminum and natural ash.
        In 1989, Mr. Ruddy organized and published "A Hundred Legends," a boxed portfolio of artwork made by people living with AIDS. Shown in art galleries across the country, the portfolio presented a continuing fund-raising campaign that benefited Northern Lights Alternative and the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS.
        Mr. Ruddy is survived by his parents, Julie and Walter Ruddy of Rock, N.J.; a brother, Dr. Richard, of Cincinnati, and a sister, Barbara Barant of Wheat Ridge, Colo.
