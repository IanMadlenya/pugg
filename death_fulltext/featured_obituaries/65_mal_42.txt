        Lawrence S. Eagleburger, the Deputy Secretary of State, entered a ringing defense of the American diplomatic corps today at a memorial service for his colleague, Philip C. Habib.
        Mr. Habib, who played a leading role in framing and carrying out American policy in the Middle East and Asia during a 30-year Government career, died last month at the age of 72 while on vacation in France.
        Widely regarded as the outstanding professional diplomat of his generation in the United States, Mr. Habib was a fierce defender of the much-criticized Foreign Service. Blunt Yet Eloquent
        However "maligned" and "scorned," Mr. Eagleburger said at the memorial service at the National Cathedral, the Foreign Service produced something extraordinary in Mr. Habib, an unconventional figure born in Brooklyn and educated in Idaho whose bluntness and "top-of-the-lungs eloquence" bore little resemblance to the salon manners of the pin-striped caricature diplomat.
        Mr. Habib "held aloft not the image of a spoiled Foreign Service the critics love to ridicule, but of an honest and courageous Foreign Service," said Mr. Eagleburger, himself a career Foreign Service officer.
        Conservative lawmakers, especially Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, have often derided career Foreign Service officers and held up their nominations to top-ranking positions. Mr. Habib served under Republican and Democratic administrations, including that of Ronald Reagan.
        In addition to Mr. Eagleburger, former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and Cyrus R. Vance spoke at the service.
