        Charles Wrede Petersmeyer, who saw the financial potential in television when the medium was commercially introduced in the 1940's and was part of what became one of the nation's largest publishing and marketing concerns, died on Thursday  at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 77, and had been a longtime resident of Bronxville, N.Y.
        Mr. Petersmeyer, who won scholarships to the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard Business School, went to work in 1947 for the country's first venture capital firm, J. H. Whitney & Company.
        He soon became a partner in the firm, and seeing the great potential in the  new technology of television, convinced the firm to invest. With its help, Mr. Petersmeyer founded and became the chairman of the Corinthian Broadcasting Corporation, which owned five television stations and two radio stations in different parts of the country.
        Corinthian merged in 1971 with the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, with Mr. Petersmeyer as a director. Dun & Bradstreet grew to become a $5-billion-a-year publisher and marketer of business information.
        An active Republican, Mr. Petersmeyer was chairman of the Citizens Workshop Committee, which in the 1960's tried to stimulate interest in Republican ideals, policies and candidates, while working independently of the party.
        He was a trustee of Sarah Lawrence College, helped found the Tulsa Opera in Oklahoma, and was an advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera Association.
        Mr. Petersmeyer is survived by his wife, Frances Gregg of Vero Beach; two daughters, Susan Henneke of Bethesda, Md., and Dr. Nancy Petersmeyer of Philadelphia; a son, C. Gregg Petersmeyer of Bethesda; a sister, Joy Wolff of Healdsburg, Calif., and eight grandchildren.
