        Hugh Algernon Percy, the 10th Duke of Northumberland, died today, a family spokeswoman said. He was 74 years old.
        The Duke died at his London residence and the cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said the spokeswoman at his ancestral home, Alnwick Castle, in the northern England county of Northumberland.
        He was descended from the first Earl of Northumberland, Sir Henry Percy, who won fame for his zeal in border warfare against the Scottish in the late 14th century. Hugh Algernon Percy is succeeded by his eldest son, Henry Alan Walter Richard Percy, 35.
