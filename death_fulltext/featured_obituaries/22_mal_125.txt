        Mr. Stone, who was born in Haddonfield, N.J., and attended the University of North Carolina, ran a public-relations firm that specialized in the pharmaceutical field. He also handled publicity for works published by Quadrangle Books and Times Books.
        In the years immediately before and after World War II he was Eastern bureau manager of Federated Press, a nationwide wire service for labor union publications.
        In 1953, when I. F. Stone's Weekly began publication, he served as its business manager during its first several months. He later publicized articles appearing in Ramparts, the radical magazine, and served briefly as its associate publisher. He retired from his public-relations work in 1977 and moved to Palo Alto.
        Survivors, in addition to I. F. Stone, who lives in Washington, D.C., include another brother, Louis, of Philadelphia; a sister, Judith, of San Francisco; a son, Peter, of Collinsville, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Susan, of Berkeley, Calif., and Margie Levin of Sudbury, Mass., and two grandchildren.
