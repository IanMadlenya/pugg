        Vincent J. Dermody, a retired prosecutor who won the murder convictions of Malcolm X's assassins and was the chief of the homicide bureau in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, died on May 22 at the Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 77 years old and lived in Bronxville.
        His family said that the cause of death was not known but that his health had been declining for the last year.
        District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey hired Mr. Dermody as a law assistant in 1941, fresh from Fordham Law School. He became an assistant district attorney and in 1948 transferred to the homicide bureau. District Attorney Frank Hogan named him chief of the bureau in 1966. He retired in 1969.
        The best-known of his many cases was the 1966 trial of three Black Muslims indicted in the killing of Malcolm X, who had broken with the Black Muslims.
        In his summation, Mr. Dermody suggested to the jury that the slaying "was an object lesson to Malcolm's followers, telling them that this is what can happen and will happen." The defendants, Talmadge Hayer, Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.
        In another publicized case, Mr. Dermody won a conviction in 1964 of Mark A. Fein, a Park Avenue manufacturing executive, for killing a bookmaker to avoid paying off a lost World Series wager. In 1963, under a new capital crimes procedure in which a jury decided between life imprisonment and execution, he won the first decisions for execution, against two men convicted of a double slaying in a liquor-store robbery.
        Mr. Dermody was born in the Bronx, the son of a New York City police inspector who was in charge of the mounted patrol.
        His wife, the former Alice Paskins, died in 1966. He is survived by two daughters, Ann LaCroix of Rye Brook, N.Y., and Mary Ellen Case of Manassas, Va.; a son, Vincent Jr., of Portland, Me., and six grandchildren.
