        Charles Raffa, Governor Cuomo's father-in-law, died yesterday at the Jewish Institute for Geriatric Care in New Hyde Park, L.I., after a long illness. He was 84 years old and lived in Queens.
        Mr. Raffa was confined to a wheelchair after never fully recovering from a severe beating he suffered four years ago in a vacant Brooklyn supermarket he owned. His assailants were never caught.
        Mr. Raffa was born in Messina, Italy, and immigrated to the United States, where he worked in the supermarket equipment business.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Raffa, of Queens; two daughters, Matilda Cuomo, the wife of the Governor, and Nancy Mazzola; three sons, Frank, Samuel and Joseph; 15 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
