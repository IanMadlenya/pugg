        Eric Crull Baade, a scholar of the classics, teacher and co-author of a widely used Latin textbook series, died on Dec. 15 at his home in Rockport, Mass. He was 70.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Brooks School in North Andover, Mass. Dr. Baade taught and headed the classics and theater departments at the college preparatory school until his retirement eight years ago.
        A native of Fort Wayne, Ind., he graduated in 1949 from Yale University, where he also earned his Ph.D. in 1956. In the intervening years he served as an Army Intelligence analyst and operations chief in the Korean War from 1951 to 1953.
        He first taught at the Brooks School from 1949 to 1951, and he returned in 1964. Over the years he also taught the classics at Yale, Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., Columbia University and St. Stephen's School in Rome.
        Dr. Baade is survived by his wife, Isobel Milne Baade; a daughter, Anne C. Baade of Larchmont, N.Y.; and two grandchildren.
