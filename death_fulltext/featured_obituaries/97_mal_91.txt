        Martin Lang, a former supervisor of the Town of Southampton, L.I., and the former president of a drainage contracting company, died last Wednesday at his home in Palm City, Fla. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Nancy.
        Beginning in 1979, Mr. Lang served five terms as supervisor, running at different times as a Republican, Democrat and Conservative. He supported low taxes, farmland preservation and the restoration of critical watershed areas.
        During World War II, Mr. Lang served in the Navy. In the 1950's, he was a trustee of Lindenhurst, L.I.
        For 29 years, he headed his own company, which he sold in 1977 to devote his time to politics. After his last term as supervisor and before retiring to Florida, he served as a vice president of the Norstar Bank.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Lang is survived by a son, Martin, of Lindenhurst; five daughters, Linda Killi and Diana Christ of Hummelstown, Pa., Barbara Radulski of West Chester, Pa., Susan Wiesley of Portage, Mich., and Elizabeth Mark of Babylon, L.I.; a stepson, Robert Paris of Norfolk, Va.; a stepdaughter, Joyce Paris of East Quogue, L.I., and six grandchildren.
