        Erol Beker, a Turkish-born industrialist and benefactor of the St. Peter's Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan, died on Sunday at his home in Cannes, France. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Istanbul, Mr. Beker came to the United States in 1950. He received a master's degree in economics from the New School for Social Research and made his fortune in the phosphate industry with fertilizer plants near the Midwest farmlands.
        In the 1970's, he was chairman of Beker Industries, based in Greenwich, Conn.
        Mr. Beker, a congregant of St. Peter's, donated a chapel to the church in 1977. Done all in white with a gold cross, it was designed by Louise Nevelson and was the first such structure the artist did in its entirety. Mr. Beker established the trust that maintains the chapel.
        Mr. Beker is survived by his wife, April; their 13-year-old daughter, Carson, and three sons, Erol and Gary of Manhattan, and Brian of Los Angeles.
