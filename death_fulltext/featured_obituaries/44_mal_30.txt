        He died of pneumonia, his son Rob said.  Mr. Haeseler embarked on a career in motion pictures after graduating from Oxford University in 1924. He helped start the University Film Foundation, which in 1928 established a close link with Harvard University to produce educational and cultural films and to train film crews for scientists and explorers. Over 60 years he produced more than 100 films, including ''Busy Little Bears,'' which was issued by Paramount and won an Academy Award in 1939 for best live-action short subject. He was a graduate of Harvard and was a member of the Harvard Club of New York and the Explorers Club.
        He is survived by his wife, Azedah; two sons, Rob, of Lafayette, Calif., and John, of Washington, and three grandchildren.
