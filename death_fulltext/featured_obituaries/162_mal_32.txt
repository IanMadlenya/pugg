        Harold Aks, a conductor and music teacher at Sarah Lawrence College and the Dalton School for nearly half a century whose amateur vocal group became a respected part of New York's musical life in the 1950's and 60's, died on June 30 while on vacation in the Canadian Rockies. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, David.
        In the late 1940's Mr. Aks was hired to conduct the Interracial Fellowship Chorus, a group of 150 amateur singers that reflected the diversity of New York. He led the group until the late 1960's. He also founded the Dorian Chorale, a 22-member professional group specializing in contemporary vocal music.
        Mr. Aks was born in Yonkers and grew up in Brooklyn. He studied music at Brooklyn College. During World War II he served as a weatherman for the Army Air Corps, stationed in India.
        After the war Mr. Aks studied at the Juilliard School of Music, graduating in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in choral conducting. His teachers included Robert Shaw and Pierre Monteux. Mr. Aks taught music and conducted the chorus at the Dalton School from 1949 to 1997 and at Sarah Lawrence from 1954 to 1992.
        Mr. Aks's third wife, Patricia, died in 1994.
        In addition to his son, of Northridge, Calif., he is survived by his companion, Lorie Hartman of Manhattan; a daughter, Catherine Aks of Brooklyn; a stepson, Michael Untermeyer of Philadelphia; a stepdaughter, Kathryn Untermeyer Atwood of Concord, Mass.; a sister, Esther Ray of Freehold, N.J.; and four grandchildren.
