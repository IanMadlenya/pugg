At Indiana University he staged and sang a number of operas. He also organized and conducted master classes in Beijing and Shanghai at the behest of the Government of China.
        Along with his wife, the soprano Virginia Zeani, who also teaches at Indiana, Mr. Rossi-Lemeni was one of the surviving members of a postwar generation of Italian singers that included Mario Del Monaco and Renata Tebaldi.
