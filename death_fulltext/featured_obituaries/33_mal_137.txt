        Dahn Ben-Amotz, a novelist, playwright and journalist who was a leading figure in Israeli culture for several decades, died of liver cancer on Friday at his home in the Jaffa section of Tel Aviv. He was 65 years old.
        Mr. Ben-Amotz, who changed his name from Moishe Tehilimzuger after he emigrated from his native Poland to Palestine in 1938, lost his parents in the Holocaust. After World War II, he was active in the Jewish underground in Palestine.
        Mr. Ben-Amotz, who wrote a daily column for several Israeli newspapers, is credited with pushing modern Hebrew into the cultural mainstream and creating the image of the Sabra - a tough yet compassionate Israeli native. He was the author of several books and plays, including a novel about the Holocaust, ''To Remember and to Forget,'' published in 1968.
        He is survived by two sons, Pico, of Manhattan, and Dor, of Indianapolis, and two daughters, Noah, of Nashville, and Naomi, of Tel Aviv.
