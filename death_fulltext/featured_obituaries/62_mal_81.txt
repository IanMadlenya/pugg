        Adolfo Odnoposoff, a cellist and professor emeritus at the University of North Texas in Denton, died on Friday at the Denton Regional Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Denton.
        He died of heart failure, said his brother-in-law, Ben Huberman.
        A native of Buenos Aires, Mr. Odnoposoff performed frequently in Latin America and held the position of first cellist with orchestras in Puerto Rico, Peru, Mexico and other countries.
        He began playing the cello when he was 5 and studied in Berlin with Emanuel Feuermann and in Paris with Diran Alexanian, a colleague of Pablo Casals.
        He is survived by his wife, Berthe; a daughter, Alina Heller of Port Washington, N.Y.; a brother, Ricardo, of Vienna, and three grandchildren.
