        Jean Langlais, a composer and organist who had an international career despite being blind from birth, has died, his family said Monday. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Langlais died on Wednesday at the Necker Hospital, where he had been admitted two days before with breathing problems, his family said. Other details were not disclosed.
        Jean-Francois Langlais was born at La Fontenelle in 1907 and studied music under another blind organist, Andre Marchal. He earned a diploma at the National Superior Conservatory of Music in Paris. From 1945 to 1987, he was the chief organist on the Cavaille-Coll organ at the Basilique St.-Clothilde.
        Mr. Langlais had a son and daughter by his first wife, Jeanne Sartre. After her death, he married Marie-Louise Jaquet.
