        Frank M. Lemay, a State Department economist who warned in a 1989 memorandum that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was diverting American farm loan money to buy weapons, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 36.
        His companion, Keith Krueger, said the cause was AIDS.
        Mr. Lemay first warned of the diversion privately in 1989. His name did not become public until March 30, 1992, when Representative Henry B. Gonzales, Democrat of Texas, disclosed the memo's contents.
        In a bluntness rare for State Department messages, Mr. Lemay warned his superiors in the office of the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs that the Iraqi President had apparently misused money from a $5 billion United States farm loan-guarantee program to buy nuclear-related equipment. Mr. Lemay said a Federal investigation "could blow the roof off."
        "If smoke indicates fire, we may be facing a four-alarm blaze in the near future," Mr. Lemay said, adding that the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, an Italian bank with a branch office in Atlanta, appeared to be involved. Denial and Praise
        Despite Mr. Lemay's message, President George Bush denied that the White House or the State Department knew anything about the farm loan diversion. While Mr. Bush's dismissal of the memo reflected his Administration's displeasure with Mr. Lemay, Democrats in Congress praised the Foreign Service officer for his courage.
        Mr. Lemay worked for 12 years in the State Department, serving in the Dominican Republic and Colombia before holding posts dealing with economic and agricultural affairs. He had been assigned to the Bureau of Legislative Affairs since 1989.
        He graduated from Georgetown University and completed postgraduate programs at Johns Hopkins and George Washington Universities.
        Besides his companion, Mr. Krueger, Mr. Lemay is survived by his parents, Alphee and Elvira Lemay of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Diane Lemay of Portland, Me.
