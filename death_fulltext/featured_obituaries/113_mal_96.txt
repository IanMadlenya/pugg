        Edvin Wide, who won medals at three Olympic Games and set three world track records in the 1920's, died on Wednesday. He was 100.
        Wide was also the United States indoor champion in the two-mile event in 1929.
        The Finnish-born Wide, who turned 100 on Feb. 22, moved to Sweden in 1918 and became a citizen two years later. That year, he won his first Olympic bronze, in the 3,000-meter team event in Antwerp, Belgium.
        At the 1924 Games in Paris, Wide won a silver at 10,000 meters and a bronze at 5,000 meters. In his final Olympic competition, in Amsterdam in 1928, Wide won the bronze in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
        During the 1920's, Wide dominated Sweden's national championships and won 12  individual gold medals.
        He became United States indoor champion in the two mile in 1929, two years after he raced in his first United States indoor championship.
        Wide, who became a schoolteacher and later a school principal, quit competing in 1930, but was still jogging in the Stockholm suburb of Abrahamsberg well into his 90's.
        Wide married his wife, Axelina, 99, in 1929. He is also survived by two sons.
