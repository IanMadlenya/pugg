        Jack Hand, a wire service sports reporter, died Saturday at his home in New Milford, Pa. He was 82.
        For a quarter of a century, Mr. Hand was The Associate Press man of the moment at ringside of so many championship fights that he lost count, at the World Series and football championship games.
        "He had a formidable reputation everywhere for accuracy, detail and speed," said Harold Rosenthal, who wrote for The New York Herald Tribune.
        After his retirement in 1971 from The Associated Press in New York, he worked for the National Football League as an information and editorial coordinator and later as a consultant and contributor to "Game Day," an N.F.L. weekly program.
        A graduate of Hamilton College, Mr. Hand began his journalism career for The Binghamton Sun in New York and moved to the A.P. in New York in 1943.
        His wife, Margaret, died in 1974. He is survived by a son, John Michael of Corde Madera, Calif., three daughters, Patricia Hand of Hartsdale, N.Y., Mary Cosemllo of Binghamton, N.Y., Kathleen Mylott of Washington, Pa., and eight grandchildren.
