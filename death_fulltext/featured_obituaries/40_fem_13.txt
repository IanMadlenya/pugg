        In 1946 Miss Weber joined Sidney and Taina Waisman Katz and their associates to create their own firm. Her architectural projects over the next 30 years included Bellevue Hospital, Coney Island Hospital, Kingsborough Community College, the Brooklyn Developmental Center, Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn and the McLean Home in Simsbury, Conn.
        Miss Weber, a native of Chicago, attended the University of Illinois and the Art Institute of Chicago before apprenticing to Charles Morgan, a noted Chicago architect, in the early 1920's. There she met Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright and worked on Wright's National Life Insurance Company Building project in Morgan's office.
        During the Depression, Miss Weber joined Wright on the construction of the Taliesin Fellowship at Spring Green, Wis., and was a member of the first fellowship there in 1932.
        In 1981 she was honored with a fellowship from the American Institute of Architects for her contribution to the advancement of women in the field.
        She and her companion, Louise Dees-Porche, were working on the design and construction of her residence in Cerillos at the time of her death.
