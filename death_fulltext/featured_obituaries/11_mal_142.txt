        Jacques Sigurd, a French screenwriter whose films helped start the career of Simone Signoret, died of lung cancer Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in Paris and Manhattan.
        Mr. Sigurd wrote the screenplay, adaptation and dialogue for more than 25 films. Two of his films, ''Dedee d'Anvers'' (1949) and ''Maneges'' (1950), have been credited with first making Miss Signoret a popular film star in France. His screenplay ''Une Si Jolie Petite Plage'' is considered a classic.
        Stephen Harvey, an assistant curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art, said when he helped plan a French film series in 1983 that he was impressed by the ''psychological pungence and attention to mood and atmosphere, and particularly the sharp wit and insight'' of Mr. Sigurd's writing.
        When Andre Malraux was France's Minister of Culture, he named Mr. Sigurd a Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters.
        Other major Sigurd films are ''Riptide,'' ''The Cheaters,'' ''All Roads Lead to Rome,'' ''Miracles Only Happen Once,'' and ''Tomorrow's Lovers.''
        Mr. Sigurd also adapted American plays for the French stage, including John Guare's ''House of Blue Leaves'' and Dale Wasserman's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Recently he and Geoffrey Holder, the choreographer, were working on a film, set in Haiti, that was tentatively titled ''Voodoo Tragedy.''
        Mr. Sigurd is survived by his daughter, Pascale Halima Sigurd; a granddaughter and a grandson.
