        David Ben Raphael, an American-born lawyer who represented Israel in a number of diplomatic posts, died on Tuesday in the bomb blast at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, where he was the deputy chief of mission. He was 43 years old.
        Mr. Ben Raphael was listed as missing until his body was discovered by rescue workers on Thursday.
        Like many Jewish students of foreign nationalities, Mr. Ben Raphael, who was born David Goldman, visited Israel to study and later settled there, electing Israeli citizenship under that country's Law of Return, which automatically extends citizenship to any Jew who wants it.
        He served in diplomatic posts in London and Chicago and at the Foreign Ministry headquarters in Jerusalem.
        Mr. Ben Raphael was born in East Orange, N.J., and finished high school in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He studied international relations at George Washington University, graduating in 1971, and studied law at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
        Mr. Ben Raphael's father, Ralph Goldman of Manhattan, is a retired executive vice president of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee.
        He is survived by his wife, Issa; a daughter, Noa, and a son, Yonatan; his father; his mother, Helen Goldman of Manhattan, and two sisters.
