        Roger DeKoven, an actor who appeared in roles as diverse as Edmund, in Erwin Piscator's modern staging of ''King Lear,'' and Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., in the Broadway musical ''Funny Girl,'' died of cancer yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. DeKoven, who also had a long career in radio and television, last appeared on stage in the 1986 Jewish Repertory Theater revival of Arnold Wesker's ''Roots.'' In 1926 he made his New York stage debut in a walk-on role in ''Juarez and Maximillian'' at the Guild Theater, now the Virginia. He was graduated from the University of Chicago in 1930.
        That same year, Mr. DeKoven appeared in ''Once in a Lifetime'' at the Music Box Theater. In 1940 he played Edmund to Sam Jaffe's Lear in ''King Lear'' at the New School for Social Research in the first American production staged by Erwin Piscator, the German theater innovator. Other notable productions included ''Joan of Lorraine'' in 1946, ''The Fighting Cock'' in 1959, ''Arturo Ui'' in 1963 and ''Funny Girl'' in 1964.
        In 1949, after reading a poem at a peace conference, Mr. DeKoven was blacklisted in the magazine Red Channels. His career came to a halt until he signed a statement drafted by Red Channels denying that he was a Communist and condemning the Communist Party. He later denounced his accusers in a newspaper interview, calling them peddlers of the ''most vicious un-American kind of slander.''
        Mr. DeKoven is survived by his wife, Mona, and a daughter, Lenore, both of Manhattan; a son, Roger, of Long Boat Key, Fla., and two grandsons.
