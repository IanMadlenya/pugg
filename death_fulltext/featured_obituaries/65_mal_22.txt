        Reginald Malcolmson, professor emeritus of architecture and former dean of the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Urban Planning, died on Monday at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. He was 79 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.
        An announcement from the university said he died after a long illness.
        A native of Dublin, Professor Malcolmson practiced architecture in Ireland before moving to Chicago in 1947 to study under Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he earned his master's degree two years later.
        He was Mr. van der Rohe's administrative assistant for several years and then taught at the institute before joining the University of Michigan faculty in 1964.
        Professor Malcolmson was named dean of the architecture school that year and filled the post for a decade. He retired from teaching in 1983 but continued to lecture at institutions in both North and South America.
        He is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Margaret Lindsay; a son, Niall, of Chicago; a daughter, Eithne, of Ann Arbor and Guernavaca, Mexico, and a grandson.
