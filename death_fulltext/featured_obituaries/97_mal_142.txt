        Alexander Woroniak, an expert on East European economic systems who was professor emeritus and former chairman of the Department of Economics and Business at The Catholic University of America, died on Tuesday in Georgetown University Hospital. He was 76 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was complications from a fall on Feb, 14, said his wife, Alyce Ann Bergkamp-Woroniak.
        A native of Lviv, in present day Ukraine, he received a law degree from the Yoanni Casimiri Universitatis in Lviv in 1939 and taught there until 1942. After World War II, he worked in Germany for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the International Refugee Organization.
        As an expert on German and Polish law and fluent in five languages, he was able to provide counsel on the resettlement of thousands of refugees, many of whom did not wish to return to lands under Communist control.
        In 1950, he came to New York City and worked as an accountant while earning a master's degree in business and accounting from Columbia University. He joined Catholic University in Washington in 1958 and served as chairman of the business department from 1974 until his retirement in 1988.
        The author of scores of journal articles, he wrote, with Daniel L. Spencer, "Transfer of Technology to Developing Countries" (Praeger, 1967). He served as a consultant for both Government and private organizations on the economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe countries.
        His wife is the only survivor.
