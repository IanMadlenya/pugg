        Sister Agnes was fatally wounded by bandits as she was praying in the mission chapel, said a spokesman for the Franciscan Sisters of Mary in St. Louis. Another sister was wounded by the gunmen, who had demanded money.
        A 1966 graduate of the University of California at Berkeley with a Ph.D. in nursing education, Sister Agnes joined the Franciscan Sisters of Mary in 1942. She was dean of nursing at Seton Hall from 1968 to 1977 and served as Vicar General of the congregation until 1982.
        She is survived by three brothers, Alex of Sedalia, Mo., Dr. Joseph of Reno, and the Rev. John of Kingman, Kan.
