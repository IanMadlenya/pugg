        Clio Edwin Straight, a retired Army brigadier general who prosecuted hundreds of war crimes cases in Germany after World War II, died Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Del. He was 96 years old and lived in Greenville, Del.
        He died of pneumonia, a spokesman for a funeral home said.
        General Straight, a 1930 graduate of the University of Iowa Law School, practiced law in Iowa before joining the Judge Advocate General Corps at the outbreak of the war.
        In 1945 he was sent to Germany to direct arrangements to prosecute thousands of German officers accused of atrocities.
        He prosecuted about 1,000 cases and also reviewed death sentences. In 1948 he was named chief of the litigation division of the office of Judge Advocate General and was later promoted to assistant Judge Advocate General for civil law.
        He retired from the Army in 1961 and joined Champion International Corporation. In 1972 he joined the firm of Frost & Jacobs in Cincinnati and retired in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a daughter, Mary Straight of Wilmington; a son, William of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.; three brothers, a sister; and two grandchildren.
