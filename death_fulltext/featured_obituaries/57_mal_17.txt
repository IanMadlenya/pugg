        A longtime contributor to conservative Republicans, he was major supporter of Mr. Reagan for Governor of California and President. Mr. Hume founded Citizens for America to promote Mr. Reagan's views and was on the board of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation.
        Born in Harbor Point, Mich., Mr. Hume grew up in Indianapolis. He received a is bachelor's degree from Princeton and master's degree from the Harvard Business School.
        He is survived by his wife, Caroline; four children, Patricia Highberg of Woodstock, Vt., Carol Tolan of New York City, and William J. and George H. Hume of San Francisco, and seven grandchildren.
