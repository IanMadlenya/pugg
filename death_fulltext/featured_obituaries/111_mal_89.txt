        Jose Luis Lopez Aranguren, a philosopher of ethics whose opposition to the Franco dictatorship cost him a university teaching position, died at a hospital  here on Wednesday at the age of 86.
        Mr. Lopez Aranguren was one of four Madrid college professors who led several thousand students in a 1965 demonstration against the dictator Francisco Franco.
        The regime then revoked his professorship at the University of Madrid.
        He went into exile in 1966 and began a decade of teaching in the United States, principally at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
        There, he taught Spanish literature for about six months each year, returning to Spain to be with his family the rest of the time, said Victor Fuentes, a professor at Santa Barbara.
        "I always tried to bring ethics into life," Mr. Lopez Aranguren once told Spanish National Radio.
        "The method was through literature," he added.
        Mr. Lopez Aranguren was a visiting professor at the University of Texas and the University of Indiana.
        He returned to Spain in 1976, the year after the dictator's death, and resumed the teaching of philosophy at the University of Madrid.
        He retired in 1980.
        He was born in Avila, Spain, on June 9, 1909, and earned a law degree and a doctorate in philosophy and literature at the University of Madrid.
        He wrote extensively on ethics and also on religion, especially the relationship between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism.
        Mr. Lopez Aranguren won the Spanish Government's National Literature Prize in 1989 for the work "The Ethics of Happiness and Other Languages."
        Last year, the heir to the Spanish throne, the Prince of Asturias, presented  him with the Prince of Asturias Prize for Communication and Humanities.
        He is survived by six children, said Trinidad de Leon-Sotelo, a reporter for  the Madrid daily newspaper ABC.
