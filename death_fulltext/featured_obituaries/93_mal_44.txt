        The Very Rev. Rudolf Kiviranna, pastor of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church in Manhattan for the last 46 years, died on Sunday at Hackensack Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Fort Lee, N.J.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        A native of Estonia, he received a master's degree in theology at Tartu University and held his first pastorate in Tallinn, the Estonian capital. He and his family fled from Soviet occupation in 1944 and settled in Sweden, where he worked with the Young Men's Christian Association assisting fellow refugees.
        He continued to work with refugees after reaching the United States in 1948 and led the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran congregation on the Upper East Side of New York, the largest outside Estonia. Founded in 1897, it now has about 700 members and shares the premises of Immanuel Lutheran Church, a German congregation on Lexington Avenue at 88th Street.
        He traveled and delivered sermons throughout northern Europe and was the author of four theological books, written in Estonian and published in Scandinavia.
        Mr. Kiviranna's first wife, Erna, died in 1969. He is survived by his second wife, Silva Loite Kiviranna; a son, John of Flushing, Queens; a daughter, Anne Liis Dmuchowski of Farmingville, L.I.; a stepdaughter, Tiina Loite of Manhattan; a sister, Karin Kunst, also of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.
