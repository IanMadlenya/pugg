        Phillip Alampi, who served three Democratic and two Republican Governors of New Jersey as Secretary of Agriculture, died on Wednesday at the Mercer Medical Center in Trenton. He was 80 years old and lived in Titusville, N.J.
        His family said he died of heart failure.
        His service, from 1956 to 1982, spanned the administrations from Gov. Robert B. Meyner, a Democrat, to Gov. Thomas H. Kean, a Republican. Twenty-six years in office made him the longest-serving cabinet officer in the state's history. His admirers called him "Mr. Garden State."
        During his tenure, New Jersey passed legislation to shield productive farmland : the Farmland Assessment Act of 1963 and the Farmland Retention Bond Issue of 1981.
        "New Jersey farmers never had a better friend than Phil Alampi," Gov. Jim Florio said yesterday. Born in Philadelphia
        Mr. Alampi was born in Philadelphia. He and his parents moved to South Jersey, worked as vegetable pickers and then bought a small farm in Williamstown.
        He worked his way through Cook College, the former New Jersey School of Agriculture, now a branch of Rutgers University.
        From 1946 until he took office 10 years later, he broadcast an agricultural morning program from New York City, first over WJZ -- now WABC -- and then over WNBC and WNBC-TV. The programs made him a spokesman for the farming industry.
        In recent years, Mr. Alampi worked as a consultant on agriculture to corporations and public agencies. The State Senate passed a resolution in 1985 to name a beneficial-insect research center in Trenton the Phillip Alampi Laboratory.
        He is survived by his wife of 49 years, Ruth; three sons, James, of Seattle, David, of Hopewell Township, N.J., and Richard, of Washington, N.J.; two brothers, Alex, of Clayton, N.J., and Joseph of Franklinville, N.J., and five grandchildren.
