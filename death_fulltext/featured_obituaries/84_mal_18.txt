        Harold Mayer Weston, a lawyer who was an expert in labor-relations management and government, died on Sunday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 82.
        The cause was complications from cancer, his family said.
        In 1960 Mr. Weston was appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve on an Emergency Fact Finding Board to handle national railroad-labor disputes. He also served on the board in 1978 and 1987.
        Mr. Weston graduated from Harvard Law School and Washington and Lee University.
        He was a partner in Forsyth, Decker, Hubbard & Broderick. He later served as counsel to that firm and its successor, Decker, Hubbard & Weldon in Manhattan.
        During World War II he served in the Army in North Africa and Europe.
        He is survived by his wife, Michaela; his daugher, Elizabeth Anne, of New York City; a son, David Jeffrey, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a brother, Robert Carl, of Crestwood, N.Y., and two grandsons.
