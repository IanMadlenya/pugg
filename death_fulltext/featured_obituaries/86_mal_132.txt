        Harry S. Strygler, a pearl importer and philanthropist, died on Sunday at the Hilton Hotel in Rye, N.Y., where his family was celebrating Passover. He was 75.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Rosa.
        Mr. Strygler was president of H. S. Strygler & Company, one of the country's largest importers and wholesalers of pearls and colored stones. His wife is secretary-treasurer of the company, which they founded in 1949, the year they married.
        He served on the board of Yeshiva University's Sy Syms School of Business. He was also secretary of the Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, co-chairman of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces and a board member of the New York Society for the Deaf.
        With his wife, a Holocaust survivor and member of the New York City Holocaust Commission, Mr. Strygler was a leading supporter of a Living Memorial to the Holocaust Museum of Jewish Heritage in Manhattan and of the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.
        He and his wife are Yeshiva University Benefactors, the highest philanthropic designation at the university.
        In memory of their son, Steven, who died in 1983, the Stryglers donated a classroom and established a scholarship fund at the Park East Synagogue, created an endowment at the New York Holocaust Memorial Museum and endowed a prenatal unit at Shaare Zedak Hospital in Israel.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Strygler is survived by a daughter, Olivia, who is vice president of H. S. Strygler & Company.
