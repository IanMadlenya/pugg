Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse. They were married in Barcelona and their daughter, Eugenia, the model and television personality known as Jinx, was born there.
        The family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she won the state tennis championship in 1927. Her sons Tom and Bob each won the United States Junior Championship twice and Bob was the Wimbledon champion in 1948.
