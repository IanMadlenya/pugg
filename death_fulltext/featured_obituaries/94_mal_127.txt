        James Whitney Cook, who was with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and its subsidiaries for 40 years and was active in civic and business affairs in Illinois, died on Sunday at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 90, and lived in Naples and Osterville, Mass.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Cook spent his entire 40-year business career with the telephone company, now called the AT&T Corporation, and its subsidiaries, retiring in 1969 from Illinois Bell as chief executive. He started with New Jersey Bell in 1929.
        Mr. Cook was born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England, and came to the United States when he was 5. He received a bachelor's degree from Yale University in 1929.
        During his career with the telephone company, he worked for Pacific Bell, Northwestern Bell in Omaha and, in the 1950's and 1960's, for AT&T in New York City. In 1962, as vice president for public relations in New York, he was the moderator who introduced Lyndon B. Johnson, then Vice President, when he talked over an experimental Telstar satellite with Frederick Kappel, who was chairman of the telephone company at the time. Their conversation ushered in the era of satellite communications.
        Mr. Cook was the founding president of the Chicago Metropolitan Open Housing Committee in 1966. He also was a former public relations counsel to the National Business Council, fuel administrator for Illinois during the 1973 energy shortage, which was exacerbated by the Arab oil embargo, and chairman of the Illinois State Board of Vocational Education.
        His wife of more than 50 years, Frances Holmes Cook, died in 1991. He is survived by a daughter, Cory Loucks of Naples and Omaha; three sons, Langdon P., of Greenwich, Conn., William D., of Newport Beach, Calif., and Donald L., of Storrs, Conn., and 10 grandchildren.
