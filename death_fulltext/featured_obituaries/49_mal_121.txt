        Burton Taylor, a former leading dancer with the Joffrey Ballet, died on Wednesday at his home in White Plains. He was 47 years old.
        Mr. Taylor had AIDS for three years, his sister, Elizabeth Ghirin, said.
        A dancer of natural elegance an style, Mr. Taylor had an aristocratic quality that made him particularly compelling in roles such as Captain Belaye in John Cranko's "Pineapple Poll," Arthur Saint-Leon in Robert Joffrey's "Pas des Deesses," the dancing master in August Bournonville's "Konservatoriet" and Oberon in "The Dream," by Sir Frederick Ashton. But he also starred in ballets by Gerald Arpino, Leonide Massine and Kurt Jooss that called for speed, lightness and strong acting ability.
        Born in White Plains, Mr. Taylor made his professional debut with the Eglevsky Ballet in 1959. He joined the American Ballet Theater in 1962, becoming a soloist in 1967. He joined the Joffrey in 1969 but was forced to withdraw the following year when he suffered a knee injury and was not expected to walk again. Mr. Taylor rejoined the Joffrey in 1973, dancing with the company through 1978. He was a contributing editor of Dance magazine from 1979 to 1983, and wrote several dance articles for The New York Times.
        Mr. Taylor is survived by his mother, Phyllis, and by his sisters, Elizabeth Ghirin and Laura Taylor, all of White Plains.
