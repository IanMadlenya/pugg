        Arthur Henry Goldberg, a retired judge in New York City Criminal Court and an expert on the city's government, died of respiratory failure on Monday at the Pine Rest Nursing Home in Paramus, N.J. He was 84 years old and had lived in Stony Brook, L.I., and Manhattan before moving to the nursing home a year ago.
        Judge Goldberg, in eight years on the bench, decided several noteworthy cases, including the dismissal of charges against hundreds of students who participated in the disturbances at Columbia University in 1968. Two years later, he was on a three-judge panel that convicted the playwright, cast and producer of the play ''Che!'' of obscenity for presenting what the judges said was ''the nadir of smut on the stage.'' Intercourse, masturbation and defecation were depicted on stage. Judge Goldberg retired in 1975.  Shortly after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1928, Judge Goldberg joined the law firm of Engelhard, Pollak, Pitcher, Stern & Clark and alternated private practice with government work. He participated in the Moreland Act Commission investigating the collapse of a bank in Harlem and was a special counsel to Robert Moses for the creation of the Long Island State Park Commission.
        From 1937 to 1945, he was an assistant corporation counsel and chief of the tax division in the administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Later he was chief counsel to a state commission that studied reorganizing government operations in New York City and was chief counsel to a legislative committee on court reorganization.
        Surviving are his wife, Rosalie, and a sister, Ann Resnik, also of Paramus.
