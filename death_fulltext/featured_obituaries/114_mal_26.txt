        Bishop Ernest T. Dixon, a retired leader of the United Methodist Church in San Antonio and past president of the church's Council of Bishops, died on June  29 at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio. He was 73 and had lived there since his retirement.
        The cause was an aneurysm, the church's news service reported from Nashville.
        Bishop Dixon was installed in 1972 by the eight-state South Central Jurisdiction, the first black ever elected bishop by that regional unit of the church. He served 8 years as bishop in Kansas and 12 years in the San Antonio area before retiring in 1992.
        He was president of the Council of Bishops from 1988 to 1989, when he visited Poland and preached in Warsaw on Christmas Day.
        Born in San Antonio, he graduated from what is now Huston-Tillotson College in Austin, Tex., and from Drew Theological Seminary in Madison, N.J. Before becoming a bishop, he served as a pastor in several states, including Texas, New York and New Jersey, president of Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Ark.,  and in various church administrative positions.
        Bishop Dixon's survivors include his wife, Ernestine Gray Clark Dixon; a son, the Rev. Freddie B. Dixon Sr. of Austin; three daughters, Leona L. Thomas and Muriel J. Dixon of San Antonio, and Sherryl D. Blue of Washington; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. His first wife, Lois, died in 1977.
