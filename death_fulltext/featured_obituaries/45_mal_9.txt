        Hours before the accident, Mr. Moroso had finished 21st in a Nascar Winsotn Cup race.
        Mr. Moroso was driving on state highway 150, apparently at a high rate of speed, when he lost control of his auto as he started into a curve and an auto coming from the opposite direction collided with it, State Trooper Roger Smith said.
        Tammy Williams, 27, of China Grove, N.C., the driver of the other car, was also killed, Trooper Smith said.
