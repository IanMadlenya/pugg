        Bela A. Balassa, an economist and a retired professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins University who specialized in trade and development, died yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 63 years old.
        He died of complications of throat cancer, said his wife, the former Carol Levy.
        Dr. Balassa was born in Hungary and educated at the University of Budapest, where he earned a law degree. He taught economics and statistics in Hungary before emigrating to the United States in 1957 after taking part in the anti-Communist revolt.
        He was named a Rockefeller Foundation fellow in 1957 and went on to earn a Ph.D. at Yale University. After graduation, he served as an assistant professor at Yale until 1966 and also taught at the University of California at Berkeley and at Columbia University. In 1967 he joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins and was a professor there at his retirement on May 1.
        He was a consultant to the World Bank and to public and private international organizations and the author of more than 23 books on trade and development, including "The Hungarian Experience in Economic Planning," "Trade Prospects for Developing Countries," "Toward Renewed Economic Growth in Latin America" and "Adjusting to Success: Balance of Payments Policy in East Asia."
        His awards included the Bernhard Harms prize from the Kiel Institute of World Economies in 1984. He was also awarded honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Paris in 1990 and from the University of Budapest in 1991. He was recently elected a fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mara Balassa of Washington; a son, Gabor, also of Washington; and two sisters, Judith Nagy of San Rafael, Calif., and Charlotte Garvey of Mountain View, Calif.
