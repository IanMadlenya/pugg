        George Edward Steinhardt, who for 40 years, under the name George Edwards, was the host of the ''Bright and Early'' program on WQXR, the classical radio station owned by The New York Times Company, died on Aug. 21 at his home in Tenafly, N.J. He was 87.
        His death was announced by his wife, Doris. The family delayed had the public announcement until Sunday.
        Mr. Edwards worked for nine radio stations before joining WQXR in 1948. His personal style was characterized by precise diction, knowledge of classical music and jazz, and commentary on a raft of side interests including cooking, antique cars and energy conservation.
        Mr. Edwards was born and raised in Brooklyn and was a graduate of Brooklyn Poly Prep. He also studied electrical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. His early work in radio included news, interviews and commercials. He knew how to repair radios, and was equally comfortable selling advertising time or managing a control room. He served in the Marine Corps during World War II, overseeing the operating standards of technical equipment being sent to troops overseas.
        He filed federal age-discrimination charges against the station in 1988 when his program, which ran from 10 a.m. to noon, was terminated. Then 69, he charged that WQXR's management had expressed to him the desire for a younger staff. The station denied that age was a factor, citing lessening listener appeal. Mr. Edwards left the station at the end of the year. The matter was later resolved by settlement.
        After leaving WQXR, Mr. Edwards worked for the cause of energy conservation. He also led four classical music tours to Europe to raise money for the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra.
        Mr. Steinhardt's first wife, Helen Beagle, died in 1979. He is survived by his wife and three stepsons: William Koedding of Windham, N.Y., Warren Koedding of Glen Cove, N.Y., and Lloyd Koedding of Tenafly.
