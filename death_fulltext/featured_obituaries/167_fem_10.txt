        Gisela Kahn Gresser, a pioneer in women's chess and a nine-time national champion, died Dec. 4 in her Manhattan home. She was 94.
        Mrs. Gresser, who was born in 1906 in Detroit, taught herself to play chess using a book a fellow passenger gave her on a cruise in 1939.
        She was at the forefront of women's chess in the United States for more than three decades. She and a handful of other women, including Sonja Graf Stevenson, Mary Bain and Mona May Karff, dominated tournament competition from the 1940's to the 1970's.
        Mrs. Gresser entered her first chess competition in 1940. In 1944, she won her first United States Women's Chess Championship.
        She went on to win the championship eight more times, and became the first woman in the United States to earn a master's rating. In 1950, she was also awarded an international woman master title.
        Throughout her career, Mrs. Gresser represented the United States in several international events. She played in five Women's Candidates tournaments and three Women's Chess Olympiads. She was also Women's World Chess Championship challenger in 1949 and 1950.
        She retired from professional chess at 82. In 1992 she became the first woman inducted into the United States Chess Hall of Fame.
        Mrs. Gresser studied classics as an undergraduate at Radcliffe College and won a fellowship for classical studies at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. In 1927 she married William Gresser, a New York City lawyer and musicologist. He died in 1992.
        She is survived by two sons, Ion and Julian, and a brother, Julius Kahn Jr.
