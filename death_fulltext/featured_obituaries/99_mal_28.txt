        Milton Horn, a figurative sculptor known for his public commissions, died on March 29 at the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago. He was 88 years old and lived in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago.
        He died after a long illness, said Paula Garrett-Ellis, a friend of the artist.
        Mr. Horn, who was born in 1906 in Kiev, Ukraine, and came to the United States in 1915, began his artistic career as a teen-ager working for the sculptor Henry Hudson Kitson in Boston. In the 1930's Mr. Horn participated in the Works Progress Administration and was a member of a circle of sculptors that included Chaim Gross and William Zorach. In 1936 he was a founding member of the National Sculpture Society.
        After moving to Chicago in 1949, Mr. Horn executed numerous public commissions in the city. His first commission, a 1951 stone relief for the facade of a synagogue in River Forest is considered by some to be the first figurative sculpture on a Jewish temple since the time of Christ. The work ignited a controversy that was resolved after Mr. Horn and his wife, Estelle, defended it at a meeting of 400 rabbis.
        He worked on several projects with the architect Frank Lloyd Wright and in 1957 organized a committee to save Wright's famous Robie House, which was in danger of being razed to make room for a dormitory.
        Other commissions included works for the National Congress of Parents and Teachers Headquarters Building, the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Chicago, Loyola University, Continental Can Company and Seward Park High School. Mr. Horn's "Hymn to Water" is visible on the Central District Water Filtration Plant on East Ohio Street in Chicago.
        Mr. Horn's wife died in 1975. He is survived by two brothers, Hyman, of Baltimore, and Samuel, of Brooklyn, and a sister, Gail Schupler of Lake Worth, Fla.
