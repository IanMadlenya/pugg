        Roland E. Wolseley, a journalism teacher who wrote one of the first surveys of the black press, died at his home in Syracuse on May 31. He was 94.
        Mr. Wolseley began his career as a reporter and editor of newspapers in Reading, Pa. After receiving a master's degree at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, he began to teach. In 1946, after eight years of teaching, he lost his position at Northwestern for being a pacifist. He was offered a teaching post at Syracuse University, where he taught journalism for 26 years.
        Mr. Wolseley wrote more than 1,000 magazine articles and for 65 years was the book review editor for Quill and Scroll magazine, a publication of the international honorary society of high school journalists, based at the University of Iowa.
        He was best known for the book ''Black Press U.S.A.,'' which was published in 1972 and was one of the first surveys of black journalism in the country. He also wrote textbooks on journalism, including ''The Magazine World'' (Prentice-Hall).
        He is survived by his wife, Isabel Champ Wolseley of Syracuse and two stepsons, John Champ Jr. of Canby, Ore., and Kelly Champ Sr. of Boise, Idaho.
