        Joseph Marshall, a former dancer with Feld Ballets/NY, the Joffrey Ballet and Oregon Ballet Theater, died on April 14 in Portland, Ore. He was 28.
        The cause was AIDS, said Lyle Sweeney, his companion.
        The dancer, whose full name was Joseph Marshall Brown, studied at the Joffrey Ballet School. He danced with Joffrey II, the Joffrey's junior company, before joining the Feld company. After becoming ill, Mr. Marshall left for Portland, where he danced with Oregon Ballet Theater.
        In addition to Mr. Sweeney, he is survived by his parents, Gary and Kathy Brown of Ridgefield, Wash.; three sisters, Shelly Holcomb of Ridgefield, Sandy Brown and Samantha Julian, both of Vancouver, Wash., and a brother, James, of Ridgefield.
