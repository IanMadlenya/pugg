        Robert G. Wilder, the former chairman and president of Tierney Communications, an advertising agency in Philadelphia, died on May 1 at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 82.
        The cause of death was heart disease, his wife, Annabel, said.
        Mr. Wilder joined Lewis & Gilman, a precursor to Tierney, in 1950 as the public relations director. He was named executive vice president in 1959 and president five years later. From 1964 to 1983, the agency's advertising billings grew to $60 million, which was considered substantial for an agency outside New York.
        Mr. Wilder was named chairman in 1983. That year, Lewis & Gilman merged with Aitkin-Kynett, a 62-year-old Philadelphia advertising agency owned by Foote, Cone & Belding Communications. He was named chairman and chief executive of the new company, Lewis, Gilman & Kynette. Mr. Wilder gave up the chief executive title in 1986, and retired in 1990. In 1994, the agency became Tierney Partners, and in 2000, Tierney Communications.
        After graduating from the College of Wooster in Ohio, in 1942, Mr. Wilder served in the Navy for eight years before joining Lewis & Gilman.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his son, Gordon H., of Malvern, Pa.; his daughter, Loraine W. Powell, of Coronado, Calif., and two grandchildren.
