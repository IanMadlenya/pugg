        John Marshall Karns Jr., a retired Justice of the Illinois Appellate Court, died Wednesday at Memorial Hospital in Belleville, Ill. He was 62 years old and lived in Belleville. His wife, Joan, said he died of lung cancer.
        A former prosecutor, he was elected without opposition in 1974 to the State Appellate Court for the Fifth District, in southern Illinois. He served there until he retired in 1987.
        In 1982, he was reprimanded by the Illinois Courts Commission, which found him guilty of judicial misconduct amid allegations that in 1978 he had arranged for the dismissal of drunken driving charges against him.
        Judge Karns was born in East St. Louis, Ill., and graduated from the University of Illinois and Harvard Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Black; a stepdaughter, Nancy Lange of Vandalia, Ill., and a grandson.
