        Francisco Manrique, a former Argentine naval officer, journalist and presidential candidate who served as Secretary of Tourism under President Raul Alfonsin, died of lymph cancer Monday at the Diagnostic Institute in Buenos Aires. He was 69 years old and lived in Buenos Aires.
        A native of Mendoza Province in western Argentina, Mr. Manrique graduated from the Argentine Naval Academy in 1938 and from the Argentine Naval War College in 1949. After being jailed as an opponent of President Juan Domingo Peron, he became head of the presidential household in 1955 under the military leader, President Pedro Eugenio Aramburu.
        Mr. Manrique resigned from the navy as a captain in the late 1950's to start a daily opposition newspaper, Correo de la Tarde, and in 1968 became a national television commentator.
        During the military Governments of the early 1970's he served twice as Minister of Social Welfare, and in 1973 he ran for President as the candidate of the Popular Federalist Alliance, a grouping of small moderate parties. He won 15 percent of the vote, the most received by a third-party candidate.
        In 1983, after eight years of military rule, he again ran unsuccessfully for President, as the candidate of the centrist Federal Alliance. The winner, Mr. Alfonsin, appointed him Secretary of Tourism, a non-Cabinet position.
        Mr. Manrique won election as a legislator in 1987 as a nonparty candidate on the Radical Civic Union ticket.
        Mr. Manrique's first wife, Esther Canepa Devoto, died in 1977. He is survived by his second wife, Cristina Ruiz, and by three sons and a daughter from his first marriage.
