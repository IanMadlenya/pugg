        Sgt. Harry Sakin, a highly decorated New York City police detective, died on Thursday at his home in Garden City, L.I. He was 57 years old.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Sergeant Sakin retired in 1988 after 25 years in the police department, where his assignments included the Central Robbery Division, the Organized Crime Control Bureau, and the Major Case Squad. At his death, he was a principal rackets investigator for the Statewide Organized Crime Task Force in the Inspector General's office of the New York City School Construction Authority.
        Sergeant Sakin made his reputation by weaving together leads from a network of informants, tipsters and police buffs. In 1986, he and fellow members of the Central Robbery Division captured three expert thieves stealing $18 million in Middle Eastern antiquities from a Long Island City warehouse. Watching the break-in with night-vision gear, they arrested the burglars as they were leaving with the loot.
        In another instance, acting undercover, he pretended to be a West Coast gunman to foil a conspiracy to rob the Long Island Rail Road of $200,000.
        Born Harold J. Sakin, he graduated from the New York Institute of Technology. He served in the United States Army's 82d and 11th Airborne Divisions and was a police officer in Keyport, N.J., before joining the New York City police force.
        Sergeant Sakin is survived by his wife, Barbara; a son, Harold Jr.; a daughter, Josephine; a sister, Joan Akins of Point Pleasant, N.J., and a brother, the Rev. Charles Sakin of Wall Township, N.J.
