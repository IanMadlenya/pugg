        Charles Harrison, a retired Manhattan advertising executive, died yesterday at the Southwest Florida Hospice in Sarasota. He was 76 and lived in Sarasota.
        He died of lung cancer, said Paul V. Higgins, his business partner.
        Mr. Harrison was chairman of Harrison Higgins Inc. until 1982. The firm was then sold to the Al Paul Lefton Company, a Philadelphia agency, but he stayed on as a vice president and creative director until his retirement in 1987.
        Mr. Harrison was a past trustee of the Karen Horney Institute and president of the International Federation of Advertising Agencies.
        He is survived by his wife, Esther; two daughters, Lynn Halpering of Boston and Cathy Fox of Long Island, and four grandchildren.
