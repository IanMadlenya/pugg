        Seymour Malman, a retired Long Island developer, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 76 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to Riverside-Nassau North Chapels, a funeral home in Great Neck.

He acquired large tracts of land, including the present site of Brookhaven National Laboratory. He was involved in the development of Harbor Hills and Soundview Village on the Port Washington shore, and waterfront acreage on the north fork in Riverhead and other towns.
        He also developed properties in Delaware, Kentucky and Indiana.
        Mr. Malman is survived by his wife, Elaine Cohan Malman; three sons, Roger, Sandy and Mark; a daughter, Bonnie, and three grandchildren.
