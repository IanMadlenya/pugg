        Bruno Stein, a professor of economics at New York University who wrote extensively on labor relations, mediation and pension systems, died last Sunday  of pancreatic cancer at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 65.
        Professor Stein, whose association with N.Y.U. dated to his days there as a freshman, started his career as an instructor in 1956. Beyond his teaching, he was director of the Institute of Labor Relations and director of graduate studies in the Department of Economics, where he oversaw the M.A. program.
        He wrote and edited books about labor economics, labor relations, retirement-income policy and the history of economic thought. They included "Work and Welfare in Britain and the U.S.A.," published in 1976, and and "Social Security and Pensions in Transition: Understanding the American Retirement System," in 1980. From 1990 until last year, he edited "Contemporary Problems in Labor and Employment Law."
        He often served on state and national panels as a labor arbitrator, mediator  and fact-finder.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith Paris Stein, and a 13-year-old daughter, Polly.
