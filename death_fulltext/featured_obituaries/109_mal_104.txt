        Ernest Manning, a Premier of Alberta for 25 years and father of the right-wing opposition leader Preston Manning, died on Monday at his home in Calgary, his son said. He was 87.
        Mr. Manning, who began his public career as a radio evangelist, served as Premier from 1943 to 1968, representing the populist Social Credit Party. He was re-elected seven consecutive times before resigning.
        He grew up on a Saskatchewan farm and later became a student of the evangelist William Aberhart at a Bible college in Calgary. Mr. Manning occasionally filled in for Mr. Aberhart on a religious radio show, and joined the provincial cabinet after Mr. Aberhart was elected Premier in 1935.
        Mr. Manning became leader of the Social Credit Party when Mr. Aberhart died in 1943. His Government experienced a windfall in 1947 when oil was discovered at Leduc, 150 miles north of Calgary. That allowed Mr. Manning to expand social  services while maintaining the lowest taxes in Canada.
        After stepping down as Premier, Mr. Manning spent 13 years in the Senate.
