        William R. Olander, the senior curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City, died of AIDS Saturday in Minneapolis. He was 38 years old.
        Mr. Olander lived in New York but had returned to Minneapolis, his native city, to be with his family.
        Since his arrival at the New Museum in 1985, Mr. Olander had been very much involved with video and performance art and with the theoretical issues and language of post-modernism.
        Mr. Olander's 1986 exhibition ''Homovideo: Where We are Now'' included several videos responding to AIDS. In 1987, at his invitation, the group Act Up (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) presented an installation, in the museum's window on Broadway near Prince Street, juxtaposing information and statistics on AIDS with apparently indifferent, callous or manipulative responses to AIDS from national figures.
        Mr. Olander received a Ph.D. in art history in 1983 from the New York University Institute of Fine Arts. In 1983 and 1984 he was acting director of the Allen Art Museum of Oberlin College, where he had been curator of modern art since 1979.
        His longtime companion was Christopher Cox.
        Mr. Olander is survived by his mother, Isabelle, of Minneapolis; a brother, Robert, and four sisters, Janet, Cathy, Pamela and Sheri.

        Because of a mechanical error, an obituary on Tuesday about William R. Olander, senior curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City, omitted the name of his longtime companion. He is Christopher Cox.
