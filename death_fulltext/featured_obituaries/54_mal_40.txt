        Lucien Kirsch Laporte, a Belgian-born cellist, died on Thursday at his home on Lopez Island in Puget Sound, Wash. He was 91 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        Mr. Laporte, who came to the United States in 1923, became first cellist of the NBC Orchestra in 1937 and the next year accepted a similar position with the CBS Orchestra.
        In the early 1940's, he was co-founder and cellist of both the New World String Quartet in Manhattan and the Guilet String Quartet. In 1953, he joined the Paganini Quartet. He also appeared as a soloist with many orchestras.
        A native of Liege, Belgium, Mr. Laporte graduated from the Conservatoire de Liege in 1918 with the first prize in cello.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Jones.
