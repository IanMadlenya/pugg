        Dr. William Charney, a retired microbiologist who helped develop and market pharmaceutical products at the Schering-Plough Research Institute, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Montclair, N.J. He was 77.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Charney retired in 1990 as director of microbiological development after 37 years with Schering-Plough. Working at its laboratories in Union, N.J., he applied his expertise to the isolation, characterization and commercial development of microorganisms.
        His work led to the development of prednisone and prednisolone, two successful synthetic corticosteroids of the 1950's that made Schering a leading maker of steroids. Corticosteroids are hormones produced naturally in the outer layer of the adrenal gland.
        He was born in Petrograd, Russia, and graduated from Johns Hopkins University. He received a Ph.D. in microbiology at Rutgers University in 1953. He was the author or co-author of more than 30 publications.
        Dr. Charney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Shulamit Steinberg Charney; two daughters, Miriam Charney Maltby and Didi Charney Beck, both of Manhattan; a sister, Elizabeth Shub, also of Manhattan, and a grandson.
