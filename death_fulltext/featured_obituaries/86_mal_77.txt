        Leon Schaefler, who practiced law in Manhattan for more than six decades, died last Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Schaefler, who specialized in trust and estate law, was one of the most senior members of the New York bar. He graduated from Fordham Law School in 1924 -- before he turned 21 -- and began to practice that year.
        He was first associated with the Fifth Avenue Bank of New York. In 1943 he joined Edward R. Finch, a retired judge of the State Court of Appeals, to form Finch & Schaefler. The firm was merged into LeBoeuf, Lamb, Green & MacRae in 1986, when he became counsel to it. He retired about three years ago.
        He was a founder and past president of the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel. He contributed many articles and studies about his specialty.
        Mr. Schaefler is survived by his wife of 66 years, Gertrude Herbert Schaefler; their daughters Roberta S. Adler-Lazar and Kathryn S. Pershan, both also of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
