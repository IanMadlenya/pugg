        Miroslaw Dzielski, a Polish political leader who espoused entrepreneurship and market-economy principles in his native country, died of bladder cancer on Sunday at the hospital of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. He was 47 years old and lived in Cracow, Poland.
        Mr. Dzielski was a spokesman for the Solidarity labor movement in the Cracow region, where he was born, and he went underground when Solidarity was suppressed in 1981. Educated as a physicist, he taught philosophy at the Jagellonian University in Cracow before joining the Solidarity movement.
        Later he helped to form the Cracow Industrial Society, which broke off from Solidarity to promote a market economy and to train individuals as entrepreneurs. He became the society's president when it was legalized two years ago.
        Mr. Dzielski came to the United States in January under the auspices of the United States Information Agency to discuss with American officials the formation of a private bank in Poland that could channel investment funds to restore the country's economy.
        He is survived by his wife, Maria, and a son, Witold, of Cracow.
