        Owen Hartley, a senior vice president and design director of Fairchild Publications, died yesterday at his home in Indian Wells, Calif. He was 44.
        His companion, Mitchel Mills, said the cause was complications from AIDS.
        Mr. Hartley, who joined Fairchild in 1979 as art director for Sport Style, was perhaps best known for his redesign of W magazine in the 1980's, which paved the way for its conversion from a large-size newspaper to its current format.
        In 1981, Mr. Hartley conceived the design for M, a monthly magazine for men,  and served as its first art director. In 1985, he was promoted to group design director of W and M, and in 1987 to group art and design director of W, M, WWD and Scene, which is defunct.
        Mr. Hartley, who was born in Brooklyn, was a graduate of the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan and studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology.
        Besides Mr. Mills, he is survived by a brother, Charles Goldstein of New Hyde Park, L.I., and three sisters, Susan Dolce of Alamogordo, N.M., Rhonda Goldstein of San Diego and Jacqueline Goldstein of Far Rockaway, Queens.
