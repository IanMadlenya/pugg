        Moishe Sacks, who helped keep Orthodox Judaism alive in the South Bronx as rabbi of the Intervale Jewish Center, died on Monday at Weiler Hospital of Albert Einstein Medical School. A resident of the Bronx, he was 82.
        From the 1960's, until his health failed last December, Mr. Sacks was the soul and staying power of the center, at 1024 Intervale Avenue in the Longwood section. It is the only synagogue left where once there were many.
        Spanish replaced Yiddish in the area long ago, and Mr. Sacks often had to wonder whether he would have a minyan of 10 men the next Saturday for a proper service. At times, he engaged in creative counting to fill the requirement.
        The temple opened in 1922 for immigrants from Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Mr. Sacks, who was brought to this country from Lithuania as a boy, moved to the neighborhood in 1936 and joined Intervale in 1962 while working in a nearby bakery. His energy, intellectual curiosity and ability to weave stories into a lesson made him a natural choice when the rabbi's position fell vacant in the mid-1960's.
        The elderly congregation saw him as its driving force. So did an anthropologist, Jack Kugelmass, who spent five years studying the Intervale center. The result was his chronicle, "The Miracle on Intervale Avenue" (Schocken Books, 1986).
        After retiring from the bakery about 10 years ago, Rabbi Sacks spent much of his time tending to the temple's daily business, paying bills, answering letters from neighbors or writing thank-you's to donors who helped to keep the center open.
        Mr. Sacks is survived by two sons, Dr. Irwin, of Virginia Beach, Va. and Arthur, of Tempe, Ariz.; two sisters, Estelle Feldman of Brooklyn and Rosalind Grossman of Kew Gardens Hills, Queens; two brothers, Herman, of Brooklyn and Edward, of Flushing, Queens, and four grandchildren.
