        Alvin B. Boxer, founder of the Canadian branch of Hasbro Inc., one of the world's biggest toy makers, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York. He was 86 and had homes in Montreal, Manhattan and Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Boxer was a native of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He started a career in sales. He became the co-owner of a crayon factory in Brooklyn, which led to an association with the Hassenfeld family, founders of what became the Hassenfeld Brothers company and, now, Hasbro Inc. of Pawtucket, R.I.
        Mr. Boxer founded Hasbro Canada Inc. in 1960, to assemble and distribute the company's brands, which include Playskool, Kenner and Milton Bradley.  At his death he was vice chairman and a director of the subsidiary in Longueuil, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal.
        He was a longtime supporter of the Israel Education Fund of the United Jewish Appeal. Through that charity he endowed nurseries and orphanages in Israel. He also established a sports arena in Israel and an orphanage in Italy.
        Mr. Boxer is survived by his wife of 56 years, Jeanette Katz Boxer, and a brother, William, of Fort Lauderdale and Brooklyn.
