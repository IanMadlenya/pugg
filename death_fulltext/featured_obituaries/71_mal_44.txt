        Leslie Cheek Jr., an architect and a former director of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, died on Sunday at his home in Richmond. He was 84 years old.
        He died after a series of strokes, said his daughter, Elizabeth Morgan of Belmont, Mass.
        As director of the state-sponsored museum in Richmond from 1948 until his retirement in 1968, Mr. Cheek introduced many innovative programs that transformed it from a small local gallery to a nationally known cultural center.
        In 1953, responding to the lack of exhibition spaces in remote areas of the state, Mr. Cheek designed Artmobile I, which took the museum's collections to the public. Two years later, the Virginia Museum Theater opened, integrating the gallery with the performing arts. Since then, film, dance and music series have become part of the museum's regular programs.
        Mr. Cheek was born in Nashville. He studied art at Harvard University and architecture at Yale and Columbia. Before joining the Virginia Museum, he was head of the fine arts department at the College of William and Mary.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Mary Tyler; two sons, Leslie 3d of Arlington, Va., and Richard Warfield, of Belmont; a sister, Huldah Sharp of Brentwood, Tenn., and seven grandchildren.
