        Justus Baldwin Lawrence, the Army's chief public relations officer in Europe in World War II, died Tuesday at New York Hospital of cardiopulmonary failure, his office announced yesterday. He was 83 years old.
        His wartime service began as a public relations aide to Earl Mountbatten of Burma with the British commandos in 1942. Mr. Lawrence served as the public relations chief, with the rank of colonel, under Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1943 to 1945, and was recalled to military duty by General Eisenhower as public information officer at the Allies' Supreme Headquarters in Paris from 1951 to 1952.
        Immediately after the war Mr. Lawrence was a vice president in the New York office of the J. Arthur Rank Organization, the British film maker. He later set up his own public relations and research company, J. B. Lawrence Inc., which advised various American and British industrial and financial companies.
        After graduating from Yale University in 1927, Mr. Lawrence started in Los Angeles as a journalist and magazine writer. He was advertising and publicity director for the film producer Samuel Goldwyn from 1933 to 1939, and was public relations director of the Motion Picture Film Producers Association from 1939 to 1942.
        Mr. Lawrence wrote two books, ''Include Me In,'' about Hollywood, and ''You Can't Shoot an Empty Gun,'' about World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carlene Roberts, and a sister, Mrs. Michael Moore of Los Angeles.
