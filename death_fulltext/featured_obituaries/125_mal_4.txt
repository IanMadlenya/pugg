        Theodore Dreier, an engineer and educator who was a founder of the legendary Black Mountain College, died on May 7 at Jefferson County Hospital in Fairfield, Iowa. He was 94 and lived in Fairfield.
        In 1933, Mr. Dreier and John Andrew Rice, both professors at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., founded a highly unconventional center of learning they called Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. The college soon became home to a creative community that at one time or another included the artists Josef Albers, Franz Kline, Kenneth Noland and Willem de Kooning, the poets Robert Creeley and Charles Olson, the choreographer Merce Cunningham, the composer John Cage and the multitalented inventor R. Buckminster Fuller.
        Financial problems forced the college to close in 1957.
        Mr. Dreier remained at Black Mountain until 1949, serving at various times as fund-raiser, treasurer and rector. In the 1950's and early 60's, he worked for General Electric and took part in a project to develop a power source for the first nuclear submarine.
        Mr. Dreier, who was born in Brooklyn, held degrees from Harvard and its engineering school.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara Loines Dreier; a daughter, Barbara B., also of Fairfield; a son, Dr. Theodore Dreier Jr. of Belmont, Mass., and four grandchildren.
