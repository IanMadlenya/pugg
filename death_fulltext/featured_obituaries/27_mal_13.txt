        Dr. Fine was chief of ophthalmology at Mt. Zion from 1959 to 1968. He practiced in San Francisco for 57 years and carried out thousands of corneal transplants, restoring sight to patients who might have been blind without the surgery.
        He was also a clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco Medical School and Stanford University Medical Center.
        Max Fine was born in Warsaw and came to the United States in 1913. He graduated from New York University and the University of California Medical School at San Francisco. He received the American Academy of Ophthalmology's honor award and the Castroviejo medal for training ophthalmologists in corneal surgery.
        Survivors include his wife, Emily Huggins Fine, and two sons, Thomas and Edward, both of San Francisco.
