        Mr. Boozer served as president of the District of Columbia Gay Activists Alliance from 1979 to 1981 and later became the District's director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
        He was an alternate delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention, where his name was placed in nomination as a candidate for Vice President. He withdrew after making a brief speech, and Walter F. Mondale, who was then Vice President, was renominated.
