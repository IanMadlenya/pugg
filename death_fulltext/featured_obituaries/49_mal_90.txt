        Elliot L. Gilbert, professor and chairman of the English department at the University of California at Davis, died on Monday at the university's medical center in Sacramento. He was 60 years old and lived in Davis and in Berkeley, Calif.
        He died after surgery for prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Gilbert, a native New Yorker, was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of New York University, where he also received a master's degree, and held a doctorate from Cornell. He taught at Columbia and at Brooklyn College before joining the Davis faculty in 1966. He became head of the English department last July.
        Mr. Gilbert was a specialist in Victorian literature, in particular the works of Charles Dickens and Rudyard Kipling, and detective fiction. Since 1972 he edited the California Quarterly, a literary journal.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sandra Mortola, a professor of English at Davis; a son, Roger, of Ithaca, N.Y., an assistant professor of English at Cornell; and two daughters, Katherine, of Oakland, Calif., and Susanna, of Santa Barbara.
