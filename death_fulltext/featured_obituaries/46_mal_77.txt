        Vito Russo, a film historian and critic and a prominent advocate of gay rights, died on Wednesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 44 years old.
        AIDS was the cause of death, said Jed Mattes, his literary agent.
        Mr. Russo was the author of "The Celluloid Closet," an analysis of the depiction of homosexuality in the movies and an essential reference book on the subject. Published by Harper & Row in 1981 and revised in 1987, the book was an adaptation of a film and lecture presentation that Mr. Russo developed in the early 1970's and subsequently presented at more than 200 colleges, film festivals and museums in the United States, Europe and Australia.
        The author, who received a master's degree in cinema from New York University in 1971, also wrote, produced and was the co-host of "Our Time," a 1983 WNYC television program dealing with lesbian and gay issues. His articles appeared in many publications, and he wrote material for several performers, including Lily Tomlin. He was national publicity director for the 1985 Academy Award-winning documentary "The Times of Harvey Milk."  Companion Died of AIDS
        His involvement in gay politics began in 1970, when he joined the Gay Activists Alliance. He later became a founding member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. In the early 1980's, he became involved in AIDS-related issues, was active in raising money for several organizations and spoke frequently at political rallies.
        In 1986, his companion, Jeffrey Sevick, died of AIDS. In his memory, Mr. Russo made a panel that was sewn into the AIDS quilt. It was one of four panels whose creation was the subject of the film "Common Threads," which won an Academy Award last year for best documentary.
        Mr. Russo is survived by his parents, Angelo and Angelina Russo of Lodi, N.J., and a brother, Charles, of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J.
