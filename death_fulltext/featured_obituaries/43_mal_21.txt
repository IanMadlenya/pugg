        Herbert O. Fisher, a test pilot and a retired aviation executive of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, died on Sunday at Chilton Memorial Hospital in Kinnelon, N.J. He was 81 years old and lived in Kinnelon.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his son, Herbert Jr., said.
        Mr. Fisher worked for the Port Authority for 23 years. As head of aviation-industry affairs, he evaluated requests for aircraft to use airports in the New York metropolitan region. He retired in 1975.
        He had worked for 14 years for the Curtiss-Wright Corporation in engineering, flight testing, public relations and sales. As chief test pilot, Mr. Fisher tested more than 4,000 military aircraft and helped develop the reversible propeller for use as a brake.
        In World War II he went to the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations to train members of the Flying Tigers on C-46 transports and P-40 fighters. Although he was a civilian, Mr. Fisher flew scores of combat missions. President Franklin D. Roosevelt presented him the Air Force Air Medal in 1944, making him the first living civilian to receive the honor.
        Mr. Fisher was also a councilman and police commissioner in Caldwell, N.J., and was on the New Jersey Civil Air Defense Advisory Council.
        In addition to his son, Herbert, of Lewisville, Tex., his wife, Emily, and a grandchild survive.
