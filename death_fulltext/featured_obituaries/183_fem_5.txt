        Beverly Bower, an operatic soprano who sang the lead at the first performance in the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center, died on March 24 at her home in Washington Township, N.J. She was 76.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Ms. Bower was born in Olean, N.Y., and began her career singing on radio and television, including on Jack Paar's ''Tonight'' show.
        She joined the New York City Opera in 1956. Her roles there included Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Micaëla in ''Carmen'' and the title character in Gian Carlo Menotti's ''Amelia Goes to the Ball.''
        Her debut at the Met was as Ortlinde, a Valkyrie in Wagner's ''Walküre,'' in 1965. She also sang Musetta in ''La Bohème,'' Senta in ''Der Fliegende Holländer'' and Micaëla at the Met.
        On April 11, 1966, Ms. Bower sang in the first public performance at the new Met, an acoustical test run, Puccini's ''Fanciulla del West,'' which was attended by 3,000 high school students. Ms. Bower sang the role of Minnie. The program began with the national anthem followed by a series of sound tests that included a blast from a gun and a loud chord from the orchestra.
        Ms. Bower also sang at the Vienna State Opera under Herbert von Karajan in 1963.
        After she retired, she joined the board of the New Jersey Pro Arte Chorale and was a voice teacher.
        Ms. Bower is survived by her husband, John, and a son, Mark, both of Washington Township.
