        Emerson Buckley, a former artistic director of the Greater Miami Opera and the tenor Luciano Pavarotti's conductor, died of emphysema at his home in Miami on Saturday. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Buckley was the musical director of the Miami opera from 1950 to 1973 and later became its artistic director and resident conductor.
        After retiring in 1986 from the Miami opera and as music director of the Fort Lauderdale Symphony, Mr. Buckley remained active. He was a guest conductor with various opera companies in the United States, China and throughout Europe. He spent much time during his last years touring as Mr. Pavarotti's conductor.
        Mr. Buckley, a striking figure with silver hair and goatee, appeared in the 1982 feature film ''Yes, Giorgio,'' which starred Mr. Pavarotti as a pampered opera star. Mr. Buckley also appeared in ''A Distant Harmony,'' a documentary about Mr. Pavarotti.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Buckley graduated from Columbia University in 1936. In the same year he obtained his first post, as conductor of the Columbia Grand Opera. For the next 10 years he held numerous positions in opera, ballet, symphony and broadcasting.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Henderson Buckley, a voice teacher; two sons, Robert, a theatrical producer and general manager in New York City, and Richard, of Ontario, Canada, a musical director.
