        James T. Leonard, the last non-lawyer to sit as a New Jersey municipal judge, died on Thursday in Rahway Hospital in Rahway, N.J. He was 80 years old and lived in Garwood, N.J.
        Mr. Leonard died of cardiac arrest, his wife, Anne, said.
        Mr. Leonard's judicial career began in 1946, when New Jersey's lower courts were often staffed by local residents not trained as lawyers. When the state began requiring that new judges have legal degrees, Mr. Leonard and 200 others like him stayed on the bench. By 1985, he was the last of the layman judges and retired in 1989.
        Mr. Leonard relished the close contact he had with the people he presided over, said one of his daughters, Mary Jane DeHanes of Cincinnati. Before his retirement, he expressed dismay over the direction the profession was taking.
        "He just felt the whole law profession was getting out of touch with the common person," Ms. DeHanes said.
        Mr. Leonard was born in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, and moved with his parents to Garwood. As an adult, he was responsible at one time or another for nearly every municipal duty in the working-class town of 5,000 in Union County.
        He had been mayor, a councilman, a volunteer firefighter and a special police officer, and he founded the first-aid squad.
        Besides his wife and daughter, Mr. Leonard is survived by a brother, Richard, of Springfield, N.J.; a son, James Jr., of Garwood; two other daughters, Patricia Olenick and Susan Leonard of Garwood; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
