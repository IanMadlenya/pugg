        John Gavin Hurd, a Texas oilman chosen by President Richard M. Nixon to be ambassador to South Africa in the apartheid era, died on Thursday at his home in San Antonio. He was 87.
        Mr. Hurd held the post from 1970 to 1975, beginning soon after the Nixon administration ordered a review of United States foreign policies in 1969.
        The administration chose a policy proposal for the southern African region that said in part: ''We can, through selective relaxation of our stance toward the white regimes, encourage some modification of their current racial and colonial policies.''
        Born in Sacramento, Mr. Hurd received bachelor's and law degrees from Harvard.
        His first wife, Patricia Killam Hurd, died.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy Smith Hurd; a son, John Radcliffe Hurd of San Antonio; three daughters, Sara Smith Hurd of Boerne, Tex., Patricia Hurd McGregor of Pike Road, Ala. and Victoria Hurd Goebel of San Antonio; 11 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
