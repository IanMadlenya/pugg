        Horace Hart, a printing executive and a United States Department of Commerce official from 1956 to 1963, died on Jan. 24 at his home in Rochester. He was 80 years old.
        He died of colon cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Hart ran a family printing concern, Leo Hart & Company, in Rochester from 1934 to 1955. After six years as director of the printing and publishing industries division of the Commerce Department, he became president of the Lanston Monotype Company in New York. He sold the printing machinery supply company in 1966 and worked as a graphic arts consultant.
        He wrote "A Bibliography of the History of Printing in the Library of Congress," a two-volume work published by the library in 1987 and 1990.
        Mr. Hart is survived by his wife, the former Joan Stein, and two daughters, Karen Hart and Nancy Wartow, both of Washington.
