        Leslie Davidson Taggart, a patent lawyer, died on Wednesday at Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut. He was 80 years old and lived in Westport.
        He died of a heart attack, his son William said.

        He was a past president of the St. Andrews Society, an organization that serves Scots in the United States.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, William, of Millington, N.J., and Douglas, of Floyds Knobs, Ind.; two daughters, Georgia Brackett of Hanover, N.H., and Patricia Shepherd of Cleveland; a sister, Aida Taggart of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
