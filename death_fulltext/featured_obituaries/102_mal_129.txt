        The guitarist and singer Floyd McDaniel, best known as a member of the Five Blazes, died on July 22 in Chicago, where he lived. He was 80.
        The cause was cardiac failure, said Doug Engel, the promotion director of Delmark Records, for which Mr. McDaniel recorded.
        Mr. McDaniel worked in the loose area between jazz and rhythm-and-blues that had been defined by the singer and saxophonist Louis Jordan. Early in his career he worked at the 1939 World's Fair with a washboard band called the Rhythm Rascals. A talent scout for the Cotton Club discovered Mr. McDaniel in a performance at the Apollo Theater in New York, and he began a long engagement as leader of the Cotton Club Tramp Band.
        In 1941 he joined the Blazes, a group that performed its own material along with hits of the day. The band stayed together until the mid-1950's, when Mr. McDaniel bought a bar in Chicago.
        He continued performing, however, backing the singer Sam Cooke, and in 1971 he joined the Ink Spots as a guitarist, a job that lasted 10 years. In 1986 at the Chicago Blues Festival he was drafted as part of the Big Three Trio, a group run by the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. He performed regularly after that, and in 1994 recorded "Let Your Hair Down!' (Delmark) with the Blues Swingers.
        He is survived by two daughters, Barbara Portwood and Doris Peck, and a son, Greg.
