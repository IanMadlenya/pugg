        William Dickey, a poet whose work spanned more than four decades, died on May 3 at Kaiser Hospital in San Francisco. He was 65 and lived in San Francisco.
        The cause was complications from surgeries, said his companion, Leonard Sanazaro.
        Mr. Dickey first attracted attention in 1959 when W. H. Auden chose his volume of poetry "Of the Festivity" for the prestigious Yale Series of Younger Poets. "It is possible to show evidence of great intelligence and sensibility but to be lacking in the first power essential to poetry, the power to speak," Auden wrote in a foreword for the book. "Mr. Dickey's lines have both."
        The most recent of Mr. Dickey's 15 books of poems was "In the Dreaming," published in January by the University of Arkansas Press.
        In 1991, he retired as a professor of English and creative writing at San Francisco State University, where he had taught for nearly 30 years. He also taught at Cornell University and Denison University.
        Mr. Dickey was born in Bellingham, Wash., and graduated from Reed College. He received a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard University, where he received a master's degree in 1955. He later attended the University of Iowa writers' workship and did postgraduate work at Oxford University on a Fulbright Scholarship.
        Besides Mr. Sanazaro, Mr. Dickey is survived by his brother, Donald, of Bellingham, and his former wife, Shirley Marn of Mill Valley, Calif. His mother, Anne, of Bellingham, died on Sunday.
