        Andre Cayatte, a lawyer turned film maker who was known for his films on crime and justice, died of heart failure Sunday at his home. He was 80 years old.
        In 1950, Mr. Cayatte's ''Justice Est Faite'' (''Justice is Done'') - an examination of the jury system in France - won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.
        He later made more films focusing on the weaknesses or errors of the judicial system, notably the 1951 film ''Nous Sommes Tous des Assassins'' (''We Are All Murderers''), a grim view of condemned prisoners awaiting execution. The film received a special award at the Cannes Festival in 1952.
        ''Tomorrow Is My Turn'' (1962) starred Charles Aznavour as a French baker who found more happiness as a prisoner on a German farm during World War II than in his life in Paris.
        Mr. Cayatte based ''Mourir d'Aimer'' (''To Die of Love,'' 1972) on the case of a female high-school teacher whose love affair with a student led to his imprisonment and her eventual suicide.
        ''His entire work is a long plea for justice to be more human, less blindly following rules and rites that sometimes make it pitiless if not inept,'' the newspaper Le Monde said of Mr. Cayatte.
