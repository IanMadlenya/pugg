        Stephan Berko, a professor of physics at Brandeis University for three decades, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Wellesley, Mass. He was 66 years old.
        Dr. Berko was the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Physics. He was chairman of the university's physics department from 1965 to 1967 and from 1971 to 1974.
        He joined the Brandeis faculty in 1961 after having taught for 10 years at the University of Virginia. Dr. Berko was a fellow at the Bohr Institute of Theoretical Physics in Denmark in 1958 and 1959.
        A native of Oradea, Romania, he was imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz and Dachau in 1944 and 1945. After World War II he helped organize a Jewish student union in Munich for war victims.
        He came to the United States and attended the University of Virginia, where he received bachelor's and doctoral degrees. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Dr. Berko was a specialist in the study of the interaction of positrons with other matter.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ellen Schmidt, and three daughters, Barbara, of Lawrenceville, N.J., Deborah Shayman of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Jacqueline Beckerman of Rochester.
