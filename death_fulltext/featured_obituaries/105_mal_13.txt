        Charles Lacy Veach, an astronaut who flew into orbit on two space shuttle missions in 1991 and 1992, died on Tuesday at his home in Houston. He was 51.
        The cause was skin cancer, NASA said.
        Mr. Veach joined NASA in 1982 as an engineer and research pilot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and he became an astronaut in 1985. On April 28, 1991, he was launched into space with six other astronauts aboard the shuttle Discovery on an eight-day Defense Department mission. As a mission specialist, he operated numerous instruments, including an X-ray telescope and an infrared telescope that observed Earth's atmosphere and the "Southern lights," or aurora australis.
        On his second shuttle flight, aboard the Columbia, he spent 10 days in space  with five other astronauts, beginning on Oct. 22, 1992. The crew deployed the Laser Geodynamics Satellite, which has a mirrored surface that reflects laser beams to measure movements of Earth's crust.
        Mr. Veach was born in Chicago and graduated from the United States Air Force  Academy with a bachelor's degree in 1966. He became an Air Force pilot the next  year, and he served as a fighter pilot for 14 years. He flew in the United States, Europe and the Far East, including 275 combat missions in Vietnam.
        Mr. Veach is survived by his wife, Alice; a son, Marshall, and a daughter, Katherine, all of Houston, and by his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Veach of Honolulu.
