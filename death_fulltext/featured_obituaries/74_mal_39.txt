        Arthur E. Coia, a retired general secretary-treasurer of the Laborers International Union of North America, died Thursday in Providence, R.I. He was 79.
        A union statement said his death followed a long illness.
        A native of Providence, Mr. Coia started working in construction at 20 and was first elected to office in 1936 at the union's Local 271 in Providence. Named an international representative in 1954, he organized workers throughout New England.
        In 1969, he became manager of the New England and eastern Canada region. He was elected general secretary-treasurer, the second-highest position in the union, 10 years later.
        He was best known for his efforts in education and training for construction workers. On his retirement in 1989 the 500,000-member union recognized his work by establishing a scholarship fund in his name and granting him emeritus status.
        Mr. Coia is survived by his wife, Marie; his son, Arthur A. of Barrington, R.I., and Washington, and two grandchildren.
