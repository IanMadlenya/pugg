        Alfred Steinberg, a journalist and biographer, died on Feb. 6 in Silver Spring, Md. He was 77.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Florence Schoenberg Steinberg.
        Mr. Steinberg wrote biographies of Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Eleanor Roosevelt and Sam Rayburn. He also wrote more than 200 magazine articles, as well as book reviews and features for The Washington Post.
        Mr. Steinberg's books included "Mrs. R," a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, whom he had known when she was United States Representative to the United Nations; "The Man From Missouri," a biography of Truman, and "Sam Johnson's Boy," about Lyndon Johnson.
        Another book, "The Bosses," told the story of six men who dominated big city political machines in the 1920's and 30's. "They collectively made the profession of democratic government and civil rights a hollow phrase in their time," he wrote.
        Mr. Steinberg was born in St. Paul, Minn., and received undergraduate and master's degrees from the University of Minnesota.
        In addition to his wife of 54 years, he is survived by his children, Arne Steinberg, Lise S. Haupt and Dr. Polly M. Steinberg, all of the Washington area, and a sister, Romaine Friedman of Stillwater, Minn.
