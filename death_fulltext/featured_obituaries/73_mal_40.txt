        Kenneth H. Lundmark, the retired chief lawyer of Conrail, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Nashua, N.H., at the age of 76. He was a resident of Stamford, Conn.
        His family said heart failure was the cause.
        Mr. Lundmark served as Conrail's corporate counsel. Before that he was a lawyer for the Penn Central and New York Central railroads, where he held the title of assistant solicitor general. He retired in the early 1980's.
        He was involved in the proceedings that changed the ownership of the railroads. When the New York Central was faltering financially and considering the elimination of commuter service, he helped work out agreements to keep the commuter lines running.
        Mr. Lundmark was born in Cleveland. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1937 and law degree in 1939, both at Case Western Reserve University. He started in private law practice in Cleveland, then moved to New York in the late 1940's and joined the staff of New York Central.
        His wife of 45 years, the former Shirley Punderson, died in 1987.
        Mr. Lundmark is survived by a son, Thomas A. of Stamford; a daughter, Jacqueline G. Karl of Nashua; a sister, Seville Lundgren of Fayetteville, Pa., and three grandsons.
