        Bob Walter, a prominent horse breeder whose champion Cavonnier finished second in the 1996 Kentucky Derby, died on Wednesday at his home in Sebastopol, Calif. He was 86.
        The cause was acute leukemia, his family said.
        In 1996 Cavonnier, who had won the Santa Anita Derby, ran the seventh-fastest Derby time up to that time. But he lost by a nose to Grindstone in a photo finish that took the judges five minutes to sort out.
        ''That's racing luck,'' Mr. Walter said after the race. ''Nothing you can do about it.''
        Mr. Walter moved from Wisconsin to Northern California in 1957, when he and his first wife, Mary Ellen, paid $450,000 for the 1,700-acre Fountain Grove Ranch. They operated the property as a cattle ranch until selling it in 1979 for $15.4 million.
        Mr. Walter began raising thoroughbreds at a former apple farm near Sebastopol. He bred a long list of horses, including Charmonnier, who won the California Cup Classic at Santa Anita in 1991 as a 28-1 shot.
        His first wife, Mary Ellen Walter, died in the early 1970's. Mr. Walter later married Barbara Walter, who survives him, along with his daughter, Cathleen Vicini of Santa Rosa; his brother, Jerome Walter of Wisconsin; and one grandson. His son, Pat, died in a helicopter crash in 1992.
