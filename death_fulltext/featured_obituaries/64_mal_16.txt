        Harvey Joshua Levin, a professor of economics at Hofstra University and a consultant on antitrust and telecommunications matters, died at his home in Garden City, L.I., on Friday. He was 67 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his son said.
        Dr. Levin was an internationally known telecommunications expert who wrote extensively on the political dimensions of radio and television regulation and the implications of communications satellites.
        Dr. Levin, a native of New York City, earned a bachelor's degree from Hamilton College and master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Columbia University. He taught at Columbia, Pennyslvania State University, Bard College and Rutgers University before joining the faculty at Hofstra in 1955. He was formerly the holder of the Augustus B. Weller Chair in Economics at Hofstra and was at the time of his death director of the school's Public Policy Workshop.
        Dr. Levin wrote five books on regulation and the broadcast industry and was at work on another.
        He was also active in the National Emergency Civil Liberties Union and the Long Island Alliance for Peaceful Alternatives.
        His companion was Nellie Akven of New York City. Dr. Levin's wife, the former Rhoda Pinsely, died in 1971. He is survived by his son, Adam R., of New York City, and a sister, Felice Kronfield, of Edina, Minn.
