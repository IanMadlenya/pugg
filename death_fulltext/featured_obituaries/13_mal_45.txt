        Thomas J. Gibbons, who was Philadelphia's first Police Commissioner under the City Charter that was adopted in the early 1950's, died here Friday after a brief illness. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Gibbons was appointed by Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. in 1952. Previously, the post had been superintendent of police.
        Mr. Gibbons earned the nickname Lone Wolf because, as an inspector, he was chosen for the commissioner's job over several officers who outranked him. At the time, the Police Department was afflicted with corruption and several investigations were under way.
        Mr. Gibbons joined the Police Department in 1929 and retired in 1960. He is survived by his wife, Alice; a son, Thomas J. Gibbons Jr.; three daughters, Rose Mary Stapleton, Dolores Weisman and Miriam Mandell; nine grandchildren and four great-grandchildren..
