        David Greer, founder and director emeritus of Bloomingdale House of Music, was found dead in his apartment on the Upper West Side last Friday. He was 55 years old.
        Ellen Borakove, of the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said further tests were required to determine the cause of death. Nancy Schmidt, assistant director of the Bloomingdale music school, said Mr. Greer retired last January because of a breakdown.
        Mr. Greer founded the school in 1964 at the West End Presbyterian Church, where he was an organist. The school later moved to 323 West 108th Street.
        Mr. Greer is survived by his mother, Mrs. Goldie Blaine, of Paradise, Calif.; a sister, Phyllis Nickerson of Peoria, Ill., and a brother, James E. Greer of Bakersfield, Calif.
        Services will be at the West End Presbyterian church, on Amsterdam Avenue at 105th Street, at 4 P.M. Saturday.
