        Marie McCarthy, who for many years designed the Larry Aldrich fashion collection, died on Tuesday at the Windermere Nursing Home in Virginia Beach, Va., at the age of 86.
        She entered the home in 1989 because of severe osteoporosis, and her condition had deteriorated, said her daughter, Polly Gillespie.
        Miss McCarthy, who was born in Cambridge, Mass., and attended Radcliffe College, started her career as a buyer for Filene's, the Boston department store. In New York in 1939, she became the designer for Larry Aldrich, a Seventh Avenue manufacturer known for simple, tasteful women's clothing.
        She became a partner in the early 1970's and continued to design the line until the company closed in 1975.
        In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Agnes Nessen, of Lincoln, Mass., and three grandchildren.
