        Dr. George N. Aagaard, former dean of the University of Washington School of Medicine, died on Wednesday at the university's Medical Center in Seattle. He was 83 and lived in Seattle.
        The cause was leukemia, said Leila Gray, a spokeswoman for the medical school.
        When he became dean in 1954, Dr. Aagaard gathered public support for the building of the medical center, which opened in 1959. It housed one of the nation's first federally financed clinical research centers, and researchers there soon made important advances in areas like long-term kidney dialysis.
        In 1962, he formed a partnership called Associated University Physicians that included all practicing physicians on the medical faculty. It was a pioneering effort to integrate clinical practice fully into an academic institution and was considered a model for other medical schools.
        After serving as dean, Dr. Aagaard founded the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at the medical school and taught and practiced medicine, becoming the university's first Distinguished Professor of Medicine in 1978. He did research on treatments for high blood pressure, including drugs and weight loss.
        Dr. Aagaard was born in Minneapolis and earned bachelor's and medical degrees at the University of Minnesota. Before joining the University of Washington, he was dean of the Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas in Dallas.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Lorna; a daughter, Diane McRea of Bellevue, Wash.; four sons, George, of Seattle, Buzz, of Bellevue, David, of Auburn, Calif., and Steven, of Kennewick, Wash.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
