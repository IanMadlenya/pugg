        Alexander Alexay, a pianist who coached and accompanied opera singers and recitalists, and who worked for many years with the composer Sigmund Romberg, died on Tuesday in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 97.
        Mr. Alexay was born in Ottawa in 1901. By the time he was 15, he was earning his living as a pianist in vaudeville and burlesque shows and in movie houses. After five years, he had saved enough money to travel to Europe to pursue more formal studies, and in 1921 he was accepted as a student of Emil von Sauer, a pupil of Liszt, in Vienna.
        He began working with singers during his student years, both as a pianist in vocal classes and as an accompanist in recitals. When he returned to the United States he performed both as a recitalist and in collaboration with singers, and in the 1930's, he was employed by Romberg as a coach on his operetta productions. He worked with Romberg for 15 years, until the composer's death in 1951. He also occasionally played with the NBC Symphony Orchestra.
        Among the singers he accompanied through the early 1970's were Helen Traubel, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Richard Tucker, Jan Peerce, Roberta Peters, Jerome Hines, Robert Merrill, Mario Lanza, Anna Moffo, Marian Anderson and Renata Scotto.
        Mr. Alexay is survived by his wife, Hiromi, and a son, Mario, of Green Valley, Ariz.
