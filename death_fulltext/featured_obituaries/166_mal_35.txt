        James Dorr Dunning, an insurance executive who was senior warden of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church in Manhattan during a rancorous dispute over high-rise development on its land, died on Tuesday at his home on the Upper East Side. He was 89.
        At the outset of the struggle, which went on in the 1980's and early 90's, he was the highest-ranking lay officer of St. Bartholomew's, at Park Avenue and 50th Street.
        St. Bartholomew's planned to build the skyscraper next to its landmark church building. A fervent opponent of the project was another St. Bartholomew's parishioner, J. Sinclair Armstrong, a lawyer and former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who died last  Sunday at 85. Mr. Dunning stood with the church leadership, and he and Mr. Armstrong opposed each other vigorously.
        Mr. Armstrong's contention that the church should be governed by city landmark preservation laws prevailed in various lower courts. That position was implicitly accepted by the United States Supreme Court in 1991, when it declined to hear the case. By then the project had been rejected by the municipal Landmarks Preservation Commission.
        Mr. Dunning, a retired vice president of the New York Life Insurance Company, was also active and prominent in the Episcopal Church in other ways, notably as a lay member of the church committee that worked on the revision of its Book of Common Prayer in the 1970's.
        He is survived by his wife of 66 years, the former Mary Bourne; a son, James D. Jr. of Manhattan; and two grandsons.
