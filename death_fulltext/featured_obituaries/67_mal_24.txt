        Vice Adm. Paul D. Butcher, retired, who capped 43 years in the Navy by helping to organize the movement of American forces to the Persian Gulf region, died on Monday at his home in Tampa, Fla. He was 62 years old.
        A Navy spokeswoman at the Pentagon, Lieut. Karen Jeffries, said she did not know the cause of death.
        Admiral Butcher joined the Navy as an apprentice seaman in 1948. He was commissioned an ensign five years later and rose to a destroyer command during the Vietnam War. He was the first director of planning of the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force, which drew up detailed plans for protecting Persian Gulf oilfields.
        During the 1991 war against Iraq, he served as chief of staff and deputy commander of the United States Transportation Command.
        Admiral Butcher, an avid baseball fan and friend of George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the New York Yankees, retired in 1991. Mr. Steinbrenner named him his successor as chairman and chief executive of the American Ship Building Company in Tampa, Fla. Admiral Butcher was head of the company at his death.
        Admiral Butcher is survived by his wife, the former Phyllis Christian; two daughters, Emily Rose Butcher of Manassas, Va., and Susan K. King of Culpeper, Va.; a son, Thomas E. of Vienna, Va., and two grandchildren.
