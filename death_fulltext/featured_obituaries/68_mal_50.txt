        Fritz Leiber Jr., an award-winning science-fiction and fantasy writer, died last Saturday at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 81 years old and lived in San Francisco.
        He died of a stroke, said his wife, Margo.
        Mr. Leiber was best known for his sword-and-sorcerer fantasy series about a mythical pair of adventurers, Fafhard and the Gray Mouser, the last of which was published in 1990. Among his other works, which have won many national and international awards, are "Conjure Wife," "The Green Millennium" and "The Wanderer."
        Mr. Leiber was born in Chicago, the son of Fritz Leiber and Virginia Bronson, Shakespearean actors. He graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in biology and studied at the General Theological Seminary in New York City. Before World War II, he dabbled in acting, both onstage and in film. He appeared with Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor in the 1937 "Camille."
        After the war, he became an associate editor for Science Digest; the job inspired him to become a full-time writer. After his first wife, Jonquil Stephens, died in 1970, he moved to San Francisco, the setting of many of his stories. His last book, "Gummitch and Friends," is to be published next month by Donald M. Grant.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Justin, of Houston; two granddaughters, and two great-grandchildren.
