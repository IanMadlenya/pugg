        Jean Fredette Ingrao, one of the first women elected to high office in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., died on Thursday at her home in Falls Church, Va. She was 63.
        She died of cancer, said Michael Byrne, a spokesman for the labor federation.
        Mrs. Ingrao (pronounced in-GRAY-oh) was elected in 1979 as executive secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Maritime Trades Department, which represents workers in 42 unions in the shipbuilding and seafaring trades and in other fields. She retired in 1993.
        Mrs. Ingrao, who was born in Washington and attended schools there, began her career in 1950 as an aide to George Meany, then president of the American Federation of Labor. She later served as administrative assistant to the federation's executive secretary-treasurer.
        She is survived by her husband, Leonard; two sons, Michael, of Falls Church, and Mark, of Alexandria, Va.; two sisters, Barbara Leonard of McLean, Va., and Mary Schmeich of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.
