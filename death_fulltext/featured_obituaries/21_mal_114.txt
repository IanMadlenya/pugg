        Carl Low, an actor who appeared widely on stage and in films and television, died of cancer yesterday at Nyack (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Nyack.
        Mr. Low, who was born in Knoxville, Tenn., made his stage debut in ''Janie'' on Broadway in 1942. His manager, Michael Oubre, said his last role was in the film ''Sea of Love,'' which has not yet been released.
        Mr. Low appeared as Dr. Bob Rogers on the television soap opera ''Search for Tomorrow'' for more than 15 years. He also appeared in productions of ''The U.S. Steel Hour,'' ''Studio One,'' ''Armstrong Circle Theater'' and ''Philco Playhouse.''
        His portrayal of Ephraim Cabot in a revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Desire Under the Elms'' in 1951 drew praise from Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic of The New York Times, for being ''acted with burning conviction.'' In 1978, his appearance in ''The Biko Conquest'' Off Broadway was described as ''first-rate'' in The Times. In 1979, he played the major role of Otto Frank in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' at the Hartman Theater Company in Connecticut.
        Mr. Low's longtime companion was Barbara Berjer.
        He is survived by three daughters, Jennifer Malament, Deborah Delia and Maggie Low; a sister, Elizabeth Chesser, and four grandchildren.
