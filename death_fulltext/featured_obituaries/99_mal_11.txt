        Kenneth Gay, who was the curator of the Poetry Collection of the State University College at Buffalo for 10 years and a longtime friend and assistant to the writer Robert Graves, died on March 26 in Palma, Mallorca. He was 83.
        Mr. Gay was the curator of the poetry collection -- 20th-century works written in or translated into English -- from 1968 until he retired in 1978. The collection, which includes manuscripts, periodicals, books and recordings, has sizable holdings of Mr. Graves's manuscripts and publications. During Mr. Gay's tenure, the overall collection more than doubled in size, to more than 65,000 items.
        The present curator, Dr. Robert J. Bertholf, said on Friday that Mr. Gay had brought about a remarkable improvement in the collection's holdings of first editions of books of poetry from Britain, Canada and other Commonwealth nations. "He was a very good ferret," Dr. Bertholf added.
        Mr. Graves's son William wrote in Thursday's issue of the British newspaper The Independent that Mr. Gay had been his father's "secretary and invaluable friend and collaborator" for 30 years. Mr. Graves, a novelist and essayist as well as a poet, lived on Majorca for many years. He died in 1985.
        Mr. Gay was born in Elbefeld, Germany. His original name was Karl Goldschmidt, and he remained widely known as Karl. After training as a graphic artist, he left Germany in 1933 when Hitler came to power. He served in the British Navy in World War II.
        Mr. Gay and his wife, the former Irene Parker, had two daughters.
