        Maurice Auslander, a mathematician who conceived several algebraic systems that bear his name, died on Nov. 18 in Trondheim, Norway. A professor at Brandeis University since 1957, he was 68 and lived in West Roxbury, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, said Gordana Todorov of Newton Center, Mass., a collaborator and former student who is a professor at Northeastern University.
        When he died, Dr. Auslander, a prominent teacher as well as researcher, was on a tour of academic centers where he worked.
        His development of new theories in the study of abstract algebra helped applied mathematicians gain working tools to solve practical problems. A concept he developed with Idun Reiten, a professor at the University of Trondheim, became a major research tool in the representation theory of Artin algebras, a complex area developed by Emil Artin, an algebraist who died in 1962.
        A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Auslander received an undergraduate degree in 1949 and a Ph.D. in 1954 from Columbia University. He taught at Princeton University, the University of Chicago and the University of Michigan before joining Brandeis. He headed the mathematics department in 1960-61 and 1976-78.
        He wrote more than 90 articles and books, including "Representation Theory of Artin Algebras," with Professor Reiten and Sverre Smalo, which is to be published by Cambridge University Press.
        Dr. Auslander is survived by his mother, Ida, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Leora, of Chicago, and a son, Philip, of Alpharetta, Ga.

        An obituary on Dec. 10 about Maurice Auslander, a mathematics professor at Brandeis University, omitted two survivors. Mr. Auslander, who died on Nov. 18, is also survived by his wife, Bernice, of Newton Centre, Mass., and a brother, Louis Auslander, of Pelham Manor, N.Y.
