        Publio A. Esperdy, who was the Immigration and Naturalization Service's district director for the New York region for a dozen years beginning in 1959, died on Wednesday at Sunrise Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 89 and had lived in retirement in Fort Lauderdale.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his son Philip.
        Mr. Esperdy was widely known as P. A. Esperdy or as Peter A. Esperdy.
        He was born in Key West, Fla. He received a law degree from George Washington University in Washington in 1927. He then entered the Immigration Service and rose through its ranks to become a high regional official, based in Richmond, from 1955 until 1959.
        Among Mr. Esperdy's tasks in the New York regional post was trying to cope with the large number of Dominicans coming to the United States on tourist visas and then staying illegally.
        His wife, the former Marion Cristel, died in 1974 after 40 years of marriage.
        In addition to his son Philip, of Philadelphia, he is survived by another son, Robert, of Richmond.
