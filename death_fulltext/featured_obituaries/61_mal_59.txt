        Melvin L. Sokolow, a literary agent, television producer and national amateur squash champion, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Sokolow was born in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brandeis University he began working in public relations in Manhattan and became the eastern publicity director for TV Guide.
        Later he became a literary agent and was the co-publisher of Warner Books from 1971 to 1973. Continuing as an agent, he and his wife, Diane, formed Sokolow Productions. Among the writers he worked with were Timothy Leary, Abbie Hoffman and Salvador Dali. The Move Into Films
        In recent years the Sokolow company moved into film and television-movie production. Working with New World Television and Tri-Star, the Sokolows produced the television movie "Miles From Nowhere," starring James Farentino, which CBS broadcast last month. The Sokolow company produced three other movies planned for broadcast this year: "Trial," with Peter Strauss, Beverly D'Angelo, Ned Beatty and Jill Clayburgh, for ABC, "Guest of the Emperor," with Gena Rowlands, and "Hand in the Glove," with Crystal Bernard and Annabeth Gish, both for NBC.
        Mr. Sokolow and Edward Simmons were the national squash doubles champions in the veterans age category in 1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982 and in the seniors category in 1989 and 1990.
        Surviving are his wife; a daughter, Betsy, of Manhattan; two sons, Alec, of Santa Monica, Calif., and Samuel, of Manhattan, and his mother, Sally Hecker of Delray Beach, Fla.
