        Joe Jones, an artist, musician and inventor of music machines and mechanical orchestras, died on Feb. 9 at his home in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim, Germany. He was 58.
        The cause was heart failure, said Geoffrey Hendricks, a friend and colleague, who informed The Times of his death yesterday.
        Mr. Jones was one of many artists associated with Fluxus, a free-form movement of avant-garde musicians, artists, writers and performers that began in the 1960's. He first started experimenting with mechanical instruments in 1962, creating objects like musical boats, solar music umbrellas and a pedaled vehicle that pulled handmade instruments on wheels (it was called "The Longest Pull Toy in the World"). The following year his works were exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York a show called "Toys by Artists." Since that time, he has been represented in major Fluxus and sound-object exhibitions in the United States and Europe.
        Mr. Jones was brought up in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and studied music at the Hartnett School of Music in Manhattan and with the composer Earle Brown. In 1969, he opened the Music Store, a shop in which music machines inside could be operated by pushing buttons outside, and where Fluxus events for Yoko Ono and John Lennon took place. A reconstruction of the store was made in 1980 for an exhibition in Berlin.
        Leaving New York for Europe in 1972, Mr. Jones eventually settled in Germany. In 1982 he created a solar orchestra made of solar-powered motors that generated sounds, and most recently he made films about the Music Store and the history of Fluxus.
        Mr. Jones's wife, Dr. Anna Christa Funk-Jones, died in 1990. He is survived by his mother, Irene Jones, of Phoenix.
