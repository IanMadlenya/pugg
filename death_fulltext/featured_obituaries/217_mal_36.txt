        Dick Weber, perhaps the greatest bowler ever and for more than a half-century an international ambassador for the sport, died Monday at his home in Florissant, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. He was 75.
        Weber's wife, Juanita, said he had experienced breathing problems and could not be revived by paramedics. The cause of death was not immediately determined.
        Weber had returned Sunday from Baton Rouge, La., where he had helped open the American Bowling Congress championships.
        Weber, at 5 feet 10 inches and 130 pounds, was one of the first big stars of bowling when it was a major attraction on Saturday afternoon television in the 1960's.
        In 1959, he became a charter member of the Professional Bowlers Association, and from 1959 to 1992 he won 26 P.B.A. Tour titles and six titles on the P.B.A. Senior Tour.
        He was voted bowler of the year in 1961, 1963 and 1965. He won four all-star tournaments before that event was succeeded by the United States Open, and he was elected 11 times to Bowling Magazine's all-American first team.
        He was especially proud that his three sons and one daughter had all rolled 300 games. One of those sons, Pete, has become the second-leading money-winner in bowling history. He was scheduled to defend his title in the United States Open, which began Sunday in North Brunswick, N.J., but withdrew.
        Dick Weber was elected to the A.B.C. Hall of Fame in 1970 and the P.B.A. Hall of Fame in 1975. Pete Weber was voted to the P.B.A. Hall of Fame in 1975, giving it its first father-son team.
        In 1999, a Bowling Magazine panel voted Dick Weber the best bowler of the 20th century, with Earl Anthony second and Don Carter third. An A.B.C. poll in 1995 ranked Anthony first, Dick Weber second and Carter third.
        To promote the sport, Dick Weber bowled on the beach in Miami Beach and in the belly of a cargo plane. Appearing on television with David Letterman, he rolled bowling balls at ketchup bottles, beer bottles and lava lamps. He traveled overseas to publicize bowling.
        As Steve James, the retired executive director of the A.B.C. Hall of Fame, said: ''He was a lot bigger than the Tour. He was probably the best-known bowler worldwide.'' Sports Illustrated said in 1985, ''Whether he wins or loses, Weber, like Arnold Palmer, will mesmerize the masses.''
        Richard Anthony Weber was born Dec. 23, 1929, in Indianapolis. At 8, he was setting pins by hand for 3 cents a game and worked himself up to 5 cents a game. He paid $20 to enter his first tournament, won $36 and was hooked.
        He spent one semester at Butler University and worked as a mailman, a salesman and a street photographer. In 1955, he moved to St. Louis to bowl with the Budweiser team, which included Carter.
        In 1958, that team rolled a 15-game total of 3,858, a record that lasted 36 years. Weber, the anchorman, rolled games of 258, 258 and 259.
        In later years, Weber owned and operated bowling centers and was a spokesman for AMF, which manufactures bowling equipment. He retired from full-time duty on the regular Tour in 1985 and the Senior Tour in 1995, but he kept making occasional appearances. In 1993, he told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch why.
        ''I'm a ham,'' he said. ''I love it. I love the autographs. I love the attention.''
        Weber is survived by his wife, the former Juanita Delk, whom he married in 1948; his sons, Richard Jr. and John of St. Peters, Mo., and Pete of Saint Ann, Mo.; a daughter, Paula Darmon, of St. Charles, Mo.; a sister, Sharon Nozzola, of St. Louis; nine grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
        Weber was disappointed that bowling had failed to reach the mainstream of American sports. In 1985, he told The New York Times: ''I think the biggest reason is crowds. You can't put a crowd of 25,000 in a bowling alley.''
