        P. J. Boatwright Jr., long known as the world's foremost authority on the Rules of Golf, died of bone cancer yesterday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J. He was 63 years old and lived in Gladstone, N.J.
        Mr. Boatwright had served as the United States Golf Association's executive director of rules and competitions since 1980.
        "He was unquestionably the world's foremost authority on the Rules of Golf," said Frank Hannigan, former executive director of the U.S.G.A., who was a close friend of Mr. Boatwright. "As such, he had a profound and positive influence on the game, not only in the United States, but wherever golf is played."
        Mr. Boatwright grew up in Spartanburg, S.C., and attended Georgia Tech University and Wofford College. An accomplished amateur golfer, he won the Carolina Open in 1957 and 1959, and qualified for four United States Amateurs. Mr. Boatwright also played 72 holes of the 1950 United States Open at Merion Golf Club, won by Ben Hogan.
        He joined the U.S.G.A. as an assistant director in 1959. In 1969, he succeeded Joseph C. Dey Jr. as executive director after Mr. Dey resigned to become the first commissioner of the PGA Tour.
        Mr. Boatwright's work in his recent position included the rewriting of the Rules of Golf in 1984, and the recodifying of the Decisions on the Rules of Golf in 1987.
        Since 1984, Mr. Boatwright was also charged with setting the conditions of play at the United States Open. He determined the speed of the greens, the pin and tee positions and the length of the rough.
        Mr. Boatwright was an inductee of the Carolinas Golf Hall of Fame, the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Wofford College Hall of Fame.
        Mr. Boatwright is survived by his wife, Nancy; two daughters, Cindy, of Wayne, N.J., and Carolyn, of Columbus, Ohio; a son, P. J. Boatwright 3d, of Dallas, and three grandchildren.
