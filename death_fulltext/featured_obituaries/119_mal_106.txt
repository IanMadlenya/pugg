        NBC made a long-expected appointment official yesterday when it named Matt Lauer the next co-host of the ''Today'' show, replacing Bryant Gumbel, who will step down on Jan. 3 after 15 years in the job.
        Mr. Lauer, who has been the news anchor for ''Today'' and Mr. Gumbel's vacation replacement since 1994, will assume the co-host role, alongside Katie Couric, on Jan. 6. The terms of his contract were not revealed during a telephone news conference.
        Unlike Mr. Gumbel, who was always identified as the host of the show with Ms. Couric as co-host, Mr. Lauer will officially be called co-host, the same title as Ms. Couric's. Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said it had been Ms. Couric's choice on whether to be listed as host or co-host.
        Mr. Lauer, who will turn 39 on Monday, has so long been known to be the choice to succeed Mr. Gumbel that he joked yesterday that ''heir apparent'' should have been stenciled on his office door. He said he did not even remember exactly when Mr. Lack had told him he would definitely have the position.
        He said he thought his ''biggest hurdle'' would be ''being compared to Bryant.''
        Mr. Lack said he expected no change in the presentation of the show, adding that ''Today'' is largely about its mix of on-air personalities: ''the family,'' as he called it.
        ''The family on the show is very well established,'' he said. ''All that will stay exactly as it has been.''
        Mr. Lack said he would continue to negotiate with Mr. Gumbel in the hope of keeping him at NBC News. ''I want very much for him to stay,'' he said.
        Ann Curry will temporarily take over as the news anchor for ''Today.'' Mr. Lack said he would soon name a permanent replacement for Mr. Lauer in that position.
