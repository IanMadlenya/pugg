        Mr. Garretto's caricatures of political figures and show-business celebrities in the 1930's attracted attention for their stark, stylized manner. He was among the first artists to use the airbrush technique.
        When World War II broke out, Mr. Garretto, an Italian citizen living in the United States, was interned as an enemy alien and deported to Italy. He was approached by the Nazis to produce caricatures of President Roosevelt and other Allied leaders. When he refused, he was interned as a political prisoner in Hungary from 1942 until the end of the war.
        After the war he did illustrations for the Italian magazine Epoca, remaining active until he became ill.
        He is survived by his wife, Eva; a son, Ezio, of Paris; and a brother, Dr. Ugo, of Rome.
