        Dr. Hans W. Loewald, clinical professor emeritus in psychiatry at Yale University, died on Saturday at Whitney Manor in Hamden, Conn. He was 86 and lived in Hamden.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Dr. Loewald was a psychoanalyst practicing in New Haven until he retired four years ago.
        Until he retired, he taught at the department of psychiatry of Yale Medical School and the Yale Child Study Center. Joined Yale Faculty in 1955
        A native of the Alsatian town of Colmar, Dr. Loewald received his medical training in Germany and served his internship in Berlin. He received a medical degree from the University of Rome in 1934 and practiced psychiatry in Padua until 1939, when he brought his family to the United States.
        He trained in psychiatry at Rhode Island State Hospital and in child guidance at the University of Maryland Hospital. He was an assistant professor in psychiatry at the university's Medical School in Baltimore from 1945 to 1955, the year he joined the Yale faculty as an associate clinical professor in psychiatry.
        In 1955, he also became a training analyst and member of the education committee of the Western New England Institute for Psychoanalysis in New Haven.  He was a past chairman and former president of the institute, and reached full professorship at Yale in 1972.
        His many honors included the Mary S. Sigourney Fund Award in 1991 for significant psychoanalytic contributions, and the Laughlin Award presented to him last year by the American College of Psychoanalysis.
        Dr. Loewald is survived by his wife of 39 years, the former Elizabeth Longshore, a psychiatrist; a son, Francis, of South Salem, N.Y.; two daughters, Katherine Loewald of Brooklyn, and Caroline Loewald of New Haven, and three grandsons.
