        Fabio Coen, a children's book editor, died on Aug. 19 at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        Mr. Coen worked with many leading writers and illustrators of books for children and young adults, among them Roald Dahl, Roger Duvoisin and Robert Cormier. Until his retirement in 1979, he was editor in chief of the juvenile list at Pantheon Books and Alfred A. Knopf.
        In earlier years, he worked as an editor at McDowell Obolensky, and it was there, in 1959, that he encouraged a friend, Leo Lionni, to write and illustrate a children's book.
        Mr. Lionni, who was then the art director of Fortune magazine, produced ''Little Blue and Little Yellow,'' which was notable for its innovative use of collage and was followed by such critically acclaimed books as ''Swimmy'' and ''Frederick.''
        Mr. Coen, who was born in Rome and raised in Trieste, immigrated to the United States in 1940. He worked briefly as a stage manager with the Barter Theater in Virginia before being inducted into the Army, where he served in the psychological warfare division and was eventually stationed in Italy.
        His first wife, Silvana Siega, with whom he founded and operated the Package Library of Foreign Children's Books, died in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Adri; two sons from his first marriage, Axel, of New York, and Paul, of Locke, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
