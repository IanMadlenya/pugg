        Adele Ravsky Heller, who with her husband, Lester, bought and nurtured the Provincetown Playhouse in Massachusetts and tried to rebuild it after it burned in 1977, died on Nov. 12 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 75.
        Mrs. Heller was born in New York City and began her career as director of audience development for the American College Theater Festival. She then became publicity director for the Act IV Theater in Provincetown. In 1972, Mrs. Heller took the same position with the Provincetown Playhouse-on-the-Wharf, which had been the first theater to produce the work of Eugene O'Neill.
        At the end of the 1972 season, the Hellers bought the Playhouse.
        She is survived by her husband; her son, Daniel, of Silver Spring, Md.; two daughters, Julie, of Provincetown and Amy Weisman of Washington, and a sister, Nora Schwartz of New York City.
