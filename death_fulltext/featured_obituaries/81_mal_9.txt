        Thomas F. Jones, former chief investigator of the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, died on Tuesday at Lakeland Regional Medical Center in Lakeland, Fla. He was 71.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said a daughter, Kathleen Ogle.
        Mr. Jones, a graduate of Fordham University's School of Law, started his career in law enforcement as an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in New York and Atlanta.
        From 1951 to 1953, he was an investigator with the New York State Crime Commission, whose findings led to the creation of the Waterfront Commission in 1953. He joined the commission when it began, helping to investigate the exploitation of longshoremen at what was then the nation's busiest port. He was promoted to direct the investigation section in 1961, heading a 48-member police force.
        He was a founding member and former president of the International Association of Air and Seaport Police. He retired in 1978 and moved to Florida in 1986.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a son, Thomas Jr., of Syracuse, N.Y.; four daughters, Kathleen Ogle of Annapolis, Md., Christine Liguori of Lakeland, Peggy Ford of Stratford, Conn., and Maryann Leonard of Nanuet, N.Y., and 18 grandchildren.
