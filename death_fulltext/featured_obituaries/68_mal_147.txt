        Howard L. Hausman, a retired New York talent-agency executive, died on Tuesday at his home in Bradenton, Fla. He was 77 years old.
        He died after a long illness, said the William Morris Agency, from which he retired in 1981.
        A graduate of New York University and Harvard Law School, Mr. Hausman joined the agency in 1950 after rising to vice president at CBS. At William Morris, he was an executive vice president with responsibilities in its offices in New York, Rome, Paris, Munich, Madrid and London. He worked with many entertainment stars, including Al Pacino, Ralph Bellamy and Stan Getz.
        Mr. Hausman is survived by his wife, the former Marie Henkel; two sons, Robert of Woodstock, N.Y., and Richard of Newbury, Vt., and four grandchildren.
