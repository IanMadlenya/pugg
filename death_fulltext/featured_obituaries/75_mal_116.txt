        Alois M. Nagler, a scholar of theater history, died on Monday at his home in Wallingford, Conn. He was 85.
        He had been in failing health, said a friend, Phyllis Warfel.
        Dr. Nagler taught theater history at Yale University for 30 years and was the director of graduate studies in theater history and the curator of the Yale-Rockefeller collection of theater memorabilia.
        He was a co-founder and past president of the International Federation for Theater Research and a co-founder and former chairman of the American Society for Theater Research.
        His books included "Sources of Theatrical History" (1952) and "Shakespeare's Stage" (1958). He also wrote articles for journals, including The Theater Annual and Shakespeare Quarterly.
        Dr. Nagler was born in Graz, Austria, and educated at the University of Graz. In the 1930's he was the literary editor and theater critic for a Vienna newspaper.
        In the late 1930's Dr. Nagler visited the United States as a guest lecturer at colleges and decided not to return to Europe. His wife subsequently joined him.
        Dr. Nagler joined the Yale faculty in 1946 and retired in 1976. He continued to give guest lectures.
        He was married for 50 years to the former Erna Scheinberger, who died in 1983.
