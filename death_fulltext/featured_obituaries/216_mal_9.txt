        Max Lowenthal, a longtime staff editor on the foreign desk of The New York Times, died on Thursday in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 85.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Claire Cox, his wife.
        He worked as a copy editor for The Binghamton Sun, The Buffalo Evening News and The New York Daily News before joining The Times in December 1951 as a copy editor on the foreign desk, where he contributed in 1971 to the preparation of the articles and texts on the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret government archive on the origins of the Vietnam War.
        He later worked as an editor on the Living/Style desk.
        Mr. Lowenthal was born in Buffalo and earned undergraduate and master's degrees in philosophy from the University of Buffalo. He served in the Army Air Corps in World War II.
        After retiring from The Times in 1985, Mr. Lowenthal was an editor for The Scarsdale Inquirer. With Ms. Cox, who had worked for United Press, he published a newspaper for their retirement community in northern Westchester County.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Lowenthal is survived by his sister, Barbara Lowenthal Joffe.
