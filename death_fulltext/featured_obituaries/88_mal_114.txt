        John Wain, a poet, novelist and critic who was one of Britain's antiheroic "angry young men" in the 1950's, died on Tuesday at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England. He was 69.
        The cause was a stroke, the hospital said.
        Mr. Wain did not like to be categorized as one of the "A.Y.M.'s," as the members of the postwar literary group -- which also included John Osborne, Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin -- were sometimes branded. "The so-called angry young men, with or without capitals, were only called that because of the success of Osborne," he said. "I don't like being lumped together with other writers in this way." 'Hurry on Down'
        Nevertheless, Mr. Wain's first novel, "Hurry on Down," published in 1953, had an irreverent attitude that British critics later placed in the same category as Mr. Amis's more successful novel, "Lucky Jim," which came out the next year. The protagonist of "Hurry on Down," after graduating from Oxford and rejecting his middle-class origins, becomes a window cleaner, a driver of automobiles for export, a drug smuggler, a hospital orderly, a nightclub bouncer and a gag writer for radio shows.
        Mr. Wain's novel represented the iconoclastic tone of much fiction written in the 1950's. When "Hurry on Down" was published in the United States in 1955, it was retitled "Born in Captivity." The author's later novels included "The Contenders" (1958), "A Traveling Woman" (1959), "Strike the Father Dead" (1962), "The Young Visitors" (1965), "The Pardoner's Tale" (1978) and "Young Shoulders" (1982).
        Writing in The New York Times in 1959 about Mr. Wain's early fiction, the critic Orville Prescott called the author "one of the most accomplished and versatile of the younger English writers."
        John Barrington Wain was born in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, the son of a dentist. After being found unfit to join the armed forces because of his poor eyesight, he went in 1943 to St. John's College, Oxford. There, he began to publish his first verse and met Mr. Amis and Mr. Larkin, both of whom he later introduced to BBC listeners in a series of poetry-reading programs.
        In 1947, Mr. Wain became a lecturer in English at the University of Reading, where he remained until 1955. In 1973, he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and he held that post until 1978. While there, he warned that English was "in danger of becoming a dead language."
        Mr. Wain published several volumes of verse, including "Young Shoulders" and "Poems: 1949-79," and an autobiography, "Sprightly Running" (1962). He was also author of a highly respected biography, "Samuel Johnson" (1974), and was a prolific literary journalist, broadcaster and author of radio plays.
        He was married in 1947 to Marianne Urmston; they divorced in 1956. In 1960, he married Eirian James, who died in 1988, and in 1989 he married Patricia Dunn. He is survived by his wife and by three sons from his second marriage.
