        Kenneth W. Haskins, an educator who advocated greater community control over public schools, died last Tuesday at his home in Lithonia, Ga. He was 71 and lived in Lithonia since his retirement in 1987.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Verna Haskins Denny, of Manhattan.
        As a high school principal in Washington and later as president of the fledgling Roxbury Community College in Boston, Mr. Haskins looked to the schools' communities as a vital and underused resource.
        He was an early advocate of the movement that culminated in decentralization, and in 1967 he became principal of the Morgan Community School in Washington, one of the nation's first community-controlled schools in modern education.
        He was named a vice superintendent of the District of Columbia's public schools before joining Harvard University in the early 1970's as a lecturer and research associate in its Graduate School of Education.
        In 1978, he returned to administrative positions, becoming president of Roxbury Community College.
        Returning to Harvard in 1982, he became a senior lecturer at the Graduate School of Education and co-director of its principals' center, where heads of elementary and secondary schools are trained.
        He was born in the Bronx, and he received an undergraduate degree from Long Island University in 1949 and a master's in social work from Adelphi in 1952. He began his career as a social worker, but he quickly moved into education and worked as a counselor at Wiltwyck School for Boys and in New York City's public schools.
        Besides his daughter Verna, he is survived by his wife of 48 years, Ernestine; a second daughter, Bari Haskins-Jackson of Lithonia; a sister, Edna Johnson of the Bronx; a brother, William, of Buckingham, Va., and three grandchildren.
