        Spencer A. Samuels, a leading art dealer for more than 50 years, died on Jan. 30 at St. Johns Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 85 and lived in Santa Monica.
        Mr. Samuels was born into the business. The son of Mitchell Samuels, a co-founder of French & Company, a major New York art concern, he attended Yale University and then went to Europe to continue his studies at the University of Florence and the Courtauld Institute in London.
        He began his career at French & Company as an elevator operator, said his cousin Eugene S. Jones. He ultimately became president of the company. Over the years Mr. Samuels organized acquisitions for museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre and the Tate Gallery.
        He also arranged sales to collectors like J. Paul Getty and Norton Simon, specializing in works by Old Masters but also including contemporary artists like Picasso and Jackson Pollock.
        He eventually formed his own company, and even after retiring to California continued to sell Old Master drawings to an international clientele.
        He is survived by his wife, Maxine; a son, Geoffrey; a daughter, Susan, and two grandchildren.
