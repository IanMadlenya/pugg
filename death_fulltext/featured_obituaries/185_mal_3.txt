        Robert L. Bien, a prolific architect who designed a number of Manhattan apartment buildings from 1959 to 1967, often using the fashionable white-brick facades of the era, died on May 25 at his home near Stuyvesant Square in Lower Manhattan. He was 78.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Lynne.
        In the 1950's and 60's, Mr. Bien attracted notice for the use of novel materials on the exteriors of buildings he designed, and for his generous use of space in designing luxury apartments.
        A good number of his designs were constructed with outside walls covered with white-glazed brick, seen by its enthusiasts as making a modern statement appropriate for midcentury architecture.
        By 2000, that brick had fallen out of favor, but Mr. Bien contended that year that the unfavorable view was ''just a yuppie fad'' and that ''there's nothing wrong with white-glazed brick buildings.''
        An office building designed by Mr. Bien and his father, Sylvan Bien, who was also an architect, made use of another striking material in its facade: 100,000 square feet of gold-colored anodized aluminum. The structure, built in 1958 on Lexington Avenue at 51st Street, represented the first use of that material on a New York building, according to Sam Minskoff & Sons, the building's owner at the time.
        Robert Bien also designed a 19-story apartment house, with only 17 apartments, for the corner of Fifth Avenue and 67th Street.
        Most of his architectural work was done for projects in New York City, but he also worked on designs for sites in the East and Midwest.
        Mr. Bien was born in New Rochelle, grew up in Manhattan and received a bachelor's degree in architecture from Cornell.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Deborah Jensen of Stonington, Conn.; two grandchildren; and a sister, Phyllis McGovern of Westport, Conn.
