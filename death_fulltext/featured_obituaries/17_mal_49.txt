        Born in South Africa, Mr. Sholomir abhorred apartheid and left home at 19. In 1958 he wrote a book, ''Sholomir's Journey,'' about his trip from South Africa to England and the time he spent making his living as a magician.
        Mr. Sholomir specialized in car stunts and appeared in the James Bond movies ''Octopussy,'' ''To Russia With Love'' and ''Diamonds Are Forever.''
