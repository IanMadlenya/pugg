        Miss McGillicuddy, a Democrat, was elected to the Appellate Court in 1976 and retired in 1986. Previously she was on the Cook County Circuit Court bench.
        Miss McGillicuddy was a member of a three-judge appeals panel that ruled in 1981 that 14-year-old Walter Polovchak should be returned to his parents in their native Soviet Union. The boy, who had come to the United States with his parents, eventually won the right to stay in the United States.
        Miss McGillicuddy graduated from Northwestern University and De Paul University College of Law.
        She is survived by a brother and a sister.
