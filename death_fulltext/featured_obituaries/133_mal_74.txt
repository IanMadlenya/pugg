        Jacques Robert, a key leader of the Resistance in France in World War II, died on Feb. 8, Le Monde reported on Saturday. He was 83.
        Mr. Robert, born in Paris, was decorated for bravery as a lieutenant in a tank unit during the German invasion in 1940.
        In August, 1940, he joined the Resistance. He came to the attention of Gilbert Renault, the highest-ranking secret agent inside France for General Charles de Gaulle, the Free French leader, who was in London during much of the war.
        Mr. Robert made his way to London briefly in 1942, plunged into intelligence work there and parachuted back into France. Then he set up an underground Resistance group named Phratrie. It had several subgroups, and its activities included intelligence, action and evasion.
        Capt. Andre Dewavrin, a high de Gaulle aide known as Colonel Passy, wrote later that Phratrie was ''the most extraordinary'' network that worked for the general's Central Bureau for Intelligence and Action.
        He was arrested in 1943 in Nice but escaped to London, aided by patriotic French police. When the Allies invaded Normandy in 1944, he parachuted into France again, to lead guerrilla operations in central France.
        After the war he became a printing executive. No information is  available about survivors.
