        Mr. Johnson, who was born in Paris to American parents, was working as a messenger at the American Embassy in London in February 1942 when he decided to enlist in the Army, becoming the first ''Yank'' in Britain to do so.
        After receiving infantry training from Americans in the British Isles, he saw service in North Africa. He also served in the Korean War, retiring from the Army in 1963. He worked as a systems analyst for Western Union until he became disabled in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, William 3d, of Bear, Del., and Paul, of Glen Rock, and four grandchildren.
