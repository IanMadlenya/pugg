        Sir Neville Stack, who commanded forces that airlifted British paratroops to Jordan in 1958 to support King Hussein and went on to become Air Chief Marshal, died on Wednesday in a London hospital. He was 74 and lived in London.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jenny. .
        Sir Neville was knighted in 1972 and retired from the air force in 1978 after four decades of service.
        The 1958 airlift that he oversaw carried 2,000 paratroopers from a British base on Cyprus to Jordan in a single day, July 17, after King Hussein asked Britain for help. The King also appealed to the United States, which airlifted much-needed oil to Jordan.
        The King was then 22, and the Arab world was turbulent. It was widely thought in Jordan that King Hussein would be overthrown.
        The paratroopers' speedy arrival in Jordan has been said to have forestalled any sizable outside interference in Jordan, and the King's Government survived and consolidated its power.
        The King wrote, in his 1962 volume of memoirs, "Uneasy Lies the Head," "The British force was small, but its very presence gave us a chance to breathe." He is still in control one-third of a century later.
        In later years, Sir Neville, a native of Kent, headed his alma mater, the R.A.F. College at Cranwell, and served as an aide to Queen Elizabeth II.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son and a daughter.
