        Walter Ward, a former Democratic member of the New York City Council who fought for clean beaches and against airplane noise, died on Wednesday at his home in Howard Beach, Queens. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        From 1968 until his defeat last year, Mr. Ward, the Council's oldest member, represented Howard Beach, the Rockaways, Ozone Park and South Ozone Park. He was chairman of the Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Committee, and a member of the Education, Finance, Youth Service and General Welfare committees.
        He owned the Ward Advertising Company, which specialized in outdoor advertising. After selling the business in 1973, he became a full-time Councilman.
        After losing his bid for a 13th term, Mr. Ward continued to serve as a Democratic district leader. He had been active in Democratic politics for decades and served as a President elector in the 1960's.
        Born in Brooklyn, he studied at the Dale Carnegie Institute before establishing his business.
        Mr. Ward is survived by a daughter, Edythe J. Morrison of Howard Beach; three sisters, Beatrice Schlicht of East Islip, L.I., Elizabeth Wetterer of Massapequa, L.I., and Marie Roehrig of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I.; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
