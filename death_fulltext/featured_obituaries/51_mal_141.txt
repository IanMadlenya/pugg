        Jack Yellen, who wrote the lyrics for songs including "Happy Days Are Here Again," died Wednesday at his home in Springville, N.Y. He was 97 years old.
        He had been bedridden and under nursing care for 15 years, said Bob Buyer, a reporter for The Buffalo News and a friend of the family.
        Mr. Yellen wrote "Happy Days Are Here Again" in 1929, with Milton Ager, and it became a campaign song for the Democratic Party, although Mr. Yellen considered himself a Republican, Mr. Buyer said.
        Among other songs for which he wrote lyrics were "Down by the O-Hi-O"(1920), "I Wonder What's Become of Sally?" (1924), "Ain't She Sweet" (1927), "Hard-Hearted Hannah, the Vamp of Savannah" (1924) and "Are You Havin' Any Fun?" (1939), as well as "My Yiddisha Momme" (1925), one of many songs he wrote for Sophie Tucker.
        Writing in Variety in 1963, Mr. Yellen recalled: "Tucker sang it at the Palace -- the song and recitation in English, then a chorus in Yiddish. She made it a hit not only in this country but in Europe." Born in Poland
        Born in Poland, Mr. Yellen grew up in Buffalo and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1913. He began writing songs in high school and continued on the side during his first job, as a reporter on The Buffalo Courier.
        He was on the board of Ascap from 1951 to 1969.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Lucille Hodgeman; a son, David, of Buffalo; a daughter, Beth Wilcove, of Gaithersburg, Md.; a brother, Irving, of Buffalo, and six grandchildren.
        A funeral service is scheduled at 1 P.M. Monday at Temple Beth Zion in Buffalo.
