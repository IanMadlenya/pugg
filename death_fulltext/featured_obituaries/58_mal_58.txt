        Walter J. Mordaunt, a former spokesman for the New York State Court of Appeals and a press aide to Gov. W. Averell Harriman in the 1950's, died on Sunday at Samaritan Hospital in Troy, N.Y. He was 72 years old and lived in East Greenbush, N.Y.
        He died of stomach cancer, said his wife, Peggy Ann.
        Mr. Mordaunt was a spokesman for the court, which is the state's highest, from 1973 until his retirement last year. Its Chief Judge, Sol Wachtler, said after Mr. Mordaunt's death that "he thrived on letting the public know of the court's great history and traditions."
        He was a press officer for Governor Harriman for his full term, from 1955 to 1959.
        Mr. Mordaunt was born in Saginaw, Mich., grew up in Buffalo and served in the Army during World War II. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1948 and then worked for The Albany Times Union before he joined Mr. Harriman's staff.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a brother, Lawrence Mordaunt of Williamsville, N.Y.; a daughter, Elizabeth Jo Thompson of Atlanta, and six grandchildren.
