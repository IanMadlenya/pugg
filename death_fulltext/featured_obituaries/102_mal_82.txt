        Dr. Louis C. Abelson, who in 1950 started what became the J.F.K. Medical Office in a Quonset hut when Kennedy International was little Idlewild Airport in Queens, died on Tuesday at Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway, Queens. He was 83 and lived in Far Rockaway and Montauk, L.I.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Abelson remained the airport's medical director until he sold the medical office to the Catholic Medical Center of Brooklyn and Queens in 1990. By then, it had grown into the world's largest airport medical office: a two-story hospital and clinic with a staff of 10 physicians and 70 other workers, handling 40,000 cases a year, from bruises to heart attacks.
        With his partner, Dr. Leon D. Star, Dr. Abelson also developed a mobile emergency hospital to go to the scene of accidents. The mobile unit has been copied at airports around the world.
        He was chairman of the Kennedy Airport Medical Disaster Plan and played a pivotal role preparing for the worst. That entailed the development of an emergency response system in conjunction with nearby hospitals and emergency crews from the area's public agencies.
        He graduated from City College and in 1937, from medical school in Cincinnati. During World War II, he served in the China-Burma-India theater as a major in the Army Medical Corps.
        After he and Dr. Star's estate sold the airport clinic, he stayed on as a consultant for two years.
        Dr. Abelson is survived by his wife, Rita Spiegelman Abelson; their two daughters, Jane Abelson of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Nancy Silver of Manhattan; three sons, David, of Far Rockaway, Michael, of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Paul, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; a stepdaughter, Carol Bernstein of Lake Success, L.I.; a stepson, Philip Spiegelman of North Miami; a brother, Nathan, of Rockville Centre, and 10 grandchildren.
