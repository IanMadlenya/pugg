        Luis Rivera, a Spanish dancer and company director, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 54 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Erica Shank, a friend.
        Mr. Rivera, whose original name was Robert Luzell, was born in Los Angeles. As a dancer, he was known for the intensity, warmth and understated virtuosity of his dancing. Inspired to study Spanish dance after seeing a performance by Jose Greco, Mr. Rivera trained in Los Angeles with Michael Brigante, Martin Vargas and Luisa Triana, and studied flamenco in Spain.
        Mr. Rivera performed with the Ballet Espanol Ximenez-Vargas, the Ballet Lorquiana of Spain and was a principal dancer with the Greco company for three years. In 1970, he founded the Luis Rivera Spanish Dance Company, which specialized in flamenco and medieval regional and classical dances of Spain, and continued to perform into the early 1980's.
        He also performed in films in Hollywood and Madrid and toured with Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich and Alan King.
        He is survived by his mother, Maura G. Luzell, of Los Angeles.
