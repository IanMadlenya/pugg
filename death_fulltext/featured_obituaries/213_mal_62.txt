        Charles H. Stein, whose company built Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, N.J., and operated well-known restaurants like Tavern on the Green and Maxwell's Plum in Manhattan, died on Oct. 10 in Miami Beach. He was 76 and lived in Miami Beach.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said his wife, Rusty.
        Mr. Stein was co-founder, chairman and chief executive of the Hardwicke Companies, which developed or operated more than 50 restaurants.
        The company also owned the Safety Harbor Resort and Spa near Tampa, Fla.; the Ritz Hotel in Atlantic City; a chain of duty-free stores called the Ammex Group; and theme parks in Asia and Europe.
        Before starting the Hardwicke Companies, Mr. Stein was president and chief executive of the Kitchens of Sara Lee, then a division of Consolidated Foods.
        Charles Howard Stein was born on Dec. 13, 1927, in Manhattan and attended the University of Miami and New York University. He was still in college when he started a citrus company to bottle fruit segments and distribute them to hospitals, hotels and restaurants. The company's annual sales reached $20 million within six years. Mr. Stein then sold it to Kraft Foods and became general manager of Kraft's citrus division.
        When he joined Sara Lee in 1962, he also became a director, vice president and member of the executive committee of Consolidated Foods, which changed its name to Sara Lee in 1985. While leading the Hardwicke Companies, which closed in the mid-1980's, Mr. Stein also helped form Wild Animal Kingdoms, a builder of theme parks in Europe and Japan.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Stein is survived by two sons, Bradley, of South Miami, Fla., and Clifford, of Aventura, Fla.; a daughter, Candice Kersh, of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.
