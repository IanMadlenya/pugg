        The Rev. Gabriel Abdelsayed of Jericho, L.I., the archpriest of the Coptic Orthodox Church of St. Mark in Jersey City, died on Thursday at the Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 66.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his daughter, Wafaa Abdelsayed.
        Born in Egypt, Mr. Abdelsayed moved to the United States in 1969 and became a leader in this country of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the native Christian church of Egypt and Ethiopia. The North American branch of the Coptic Orthodox Church has more than one million members who worship in more than 50 individual churches, of which Mr. Abdelsayed helped found 15.
        Mr. Abdelsayed was a member of many interfaith bodies, representing the Coptic Orthodox Church on committees and on boards of the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches and the Oriental Orthodox Catholic Dialogue on Christian Unity, among others. During the Carter Administration, Mr. Abdelsayed served on a Presidential committee that dealt with religious issues.
        Mr. Abdelsayed received a doctorate in history from Cairo University and over the years taught at several institutions in Egypt and the United States, including St. John's University.
        He was also an author of books about religion and history, including "Egyptian Monasticism and Cenobitism" (1963), "The Rise of the Second Mamluk Dynasty" (1967) and "St. Mark in Africa" (1968).
        He is survived by his wife, Tahani Abdelsayed of Jericho; two sons, Dr. George Abdelsayed of Jericho, and Wafeek Abdelsayed of Hartford, and two daughters, Wafaa Abdelsayed and Lucy Abdelsayed, both of Jericho.
