        Casimir A. Rogus, an engineer who helped build New York City's garbage incinerators and landfills, died yesterday at the Carillon House Nursing Home in Huntington, L.I. He was 85 years old and lived in Huntington and Pompano Beach, Fla.
        He died of a blood disorder, his son Robert said.
        Mr. Rogus retired in 1966 as director of engineering for the City Department of Sanitation. He joined the City Board of Transportation in 1928, moved to the State Department of Public Works and then joined the Department of Sanitation in 1932.
        He helped design the city's garbage disposal system of 13 incinerators, 10 transfer sites, and eight landfills.
        He was a graduate of the University of Rhode Island and the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.
        He is survived by two sons, Robert, of Redding, Conn., and Richard of Huntington; a daughter, Carol Ann Rogus of Manhattan; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
