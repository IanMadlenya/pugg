        Padmini Ramachandran, a star of Indian films who later started an influential school of Indian classical dance in New Jersey, died on Sept. 25 in Chennai (formerly Madras), India. She was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to hospital officials.
        Known for her beauty and her acting as well as for dancing in many styles, she was most famous as an exponent of the classical southern Indian dance form called Bharata Natyam. She helped popularize and set the standard for the pseudoclassical style of dance widely used in the Indian cinema.
        After making more than 250 movies in several Indian languages, she retired in 1970 and moved with her husband, Dr. K. T. Ramachandran, to Hillsdale, N.J.
        In 1977 she started a dance academy, the Padmini Institute of Fine Arts, in the basement of her home with four students. Soon the school had five branches in New Jersey and New York.
        Born on June 12, 1932, in Poojappura in the southern Indian state of Kerala, Ms. Ramachandran was the second daughter of a landlord and a homemaker. The family eventually settled in Chennai. Her elder sister, Lalitha, and younger sister, Ragini, were also talented actresses and dancers; the three were known as the Travancore Sisters.
        Ms. Ramachandran started taking dancing lessons at 4, joined a dance troupe at 10, and had her first film role, in ''Kalpana,'' in the 1940's, when she was a teenager. She had acting roles in Hindi, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam films and spoke Telugu as well. She considered ''Thillana Mohanambal'' (1968) her best film.
        Like many southern Indian film actors, she also entered politics and became a member of the Indian Congress.
        Her husband died in 1981 and her sisters died two years ago. She is survived by a son, Prem Ramachandran, of New Jersey.
