        Gerald Garvey, who wrote extensively on the inner workings of government as a professor of politics at Princeton University, died on April 9 at Princeton Medical Center. He was 64 and lived in Princeton.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Garvey focused on American politics, public policy, public administration and political theory, writing about these subjects in 11 books and numerous articles.
        Born in Chicago, he graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1959. While in service as an officer, he studied Russian at Columbia University and earned a doctorate from Princeton in 1962.
        He taught political science at the Air Force Academy before joining the Princeton faculty in 1968 as an associate professor; he rose to full professor in 1972.
        His most recent book titles, as author or co-author, include ''Public Administration: The Profession and the Practice'' (St. Martin's, 1996), ''Facing the Bureaucracy'' (Jossey-Bass, 1993), and ''Improving Government Performance: An Owner's Manual'' (Brookings Institution Press, 1993).
        Dr. Garvey is survived by his wife of 34 years, Lou Ann Benshoof Garvey; three sons, Edward, of St. Paul, Gregory, of Rochester, N.Y., and Scott, of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Sarah Garvey, of San Francisco; two brothers, David, of Rhinelander, Wis., and George, of Silver Spring, Md.; three sisters, Noni Thomas and Judy Alexander of Chicago, and Margaret Cox of North Canton, Ohio; and two granddaughters.
