        William P. Collins, a former Undersecretary of Energy in the Reagan Administration, died Wednesday at Fairfax County Hospital in Virginia. He was 47.
        Mr. Collins, a resident of Alexandria, Va., died of a heart attack, his sister, Nancy Collins, said.
        A native of Washington, Mr. Collins grew up in Hamilton, Mont., and graduated from Hamilton High School in 1964. He earned a bachelor's degree in history from the University of Montana at Missoula in 1968. Later that year, Mr. Collins enlisted in the Army and, as a lieutenant, served two tours of duty in Vietnam.
        After his discharge, Mr. Collins returned to Washington and became involved in Republican politics. He worked as an aide to Representative Ron Marlenee of Montana and as a staff member of the Congressional Environment Study Committee. Later, he served as director of the Political Action Committee of the National Association of Homebuilders.
        In 1983, Mr. Collins was appointed an Undersecretary of Energy, serving concurrently as assistant secretary of conservation and renewable energy and as head of the Office of Alcohol Fuels. Since leaving public service, Mr. Collins had headed his own public relations company in Washington.
        He is survived by his sister, who lives in Manhattan.
