        Henry W. Broido, a retail executive who was president of Hammacher Schlemmer in the 1950's, died of pneumonia on Tuesday at the Jewish Home and Hospital. He was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Broido, who was born in Pittsburgh, owned a building-supply company there until he joined the Gimbels department store in New York City in 1943.
        He was a merchandise manager at Gimbels when he left to assume the presidency of Hammacher Schlemmer, the housewares retailer, in 1953. After leaving Hammacher Schlemmer four years later, he became an independent consultant in mergers and acquisitions. He retired in 1975.
        His wife, the former Phoebe Lasner, died last September. Surviving are his son, Henry Jr., of Manhattan, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
