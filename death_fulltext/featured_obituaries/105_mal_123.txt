        Gerald B. Olanoff, an architect who worked on the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and the Bronx Zoo, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 42.
        The cause was complications from AIDS, his companion, Ronald Csuha, said.
        In 1979, Mr. Olanoff joined Davis, Brody & Associates in Manhattan. At that  firm, he served as a project architect for the rehabilitation of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.
        He was also a project architect for the renovation of the old Bird House at the Bronx Zoo.
        He was born in Plainview, L.I. He graduated from Yale College in 1974 and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1977.
        Besides Mr. Csuha, he is survived by his mother, Mildred Zimmerman of Pittsfield, Mass., and a brother, Richard Olanoff of Syracuse.
