        ''Monsieur Vincent,'' a dramatization of the life of St. Vincent de Paul that starred Pierre Fresnay, won the Academy Award in 1947 for best foreign film. It also was honored as the best film in France that year.
        Mr. Cloche, whose career spanned more than a half-century, also made spy thrillers and films with religious and social themes.
        His best-known films include ''La Cage aux Oiseaux'' (''The Bird Cage''); ''Le Docteur Laennec,'' the story of the inventor of the stethoscope; ''Ne de Pere Inconnu'' (''Father Unknown'') and ''La Cage aux Filles (''The Girl Cage'').
        In 1940, Mr. Cloche founded a film society for young talent. It later became France's leading film school, the Institute of Advanced Film Studies.
