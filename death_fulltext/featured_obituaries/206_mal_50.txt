        J. J. Jackson, one of the five original MTV video jockeys and an influential black broadcaster on rock radio and on television, died Wednesday in Los Angeles. He was 62.
        Mr. Jackson apparently suffered a heart attack, friends told The Associated Press.
        He started in radio in the late 1960's at WBCN in Boston and KLOS in Los Angeles, both major rock stations.
        He also worked as a music reporter at KABC-TV in Los Angeles.
        After being hired by MTV in New York, he and the other four original V.J.'s -- Martha Quinn, Alan Hunter, Mark Goodman and Nina Blackwood -- quickly became stars in their own right after the network began to broadcast: at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 1, 1981, with ''Video Killed the Radio Star'' by the Buggles. The V.J.'s became celebrities almost overnight.
        ''Within a month of going on the air in Manhattan, I had to move,'' he said in the book ''MTV Uncensored,'' edited by Jacob Hoye.
        Mr. Jackson covered Live Aid in London for MTV in 1985 and helped inaugurate its ''120 Minutes'' series. He remained at MTV until 1986.
        Mr. Jackson, whose given name was John, then returned to Los Angeles radio. He worked at KTWV until about six months ago and had hoped to rejoin Mr. Goodman on another new musical frontier, Sirius Satellite Radio.
        Mr. Goodman told The Associated Press that Mr. Jackson is survived by a daughter and two grandchildren in the Bahamas.
