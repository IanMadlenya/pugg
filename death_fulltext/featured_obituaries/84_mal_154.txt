        Adolph Baller, a pianist who accompanied the violinist Yehudi Menuhin and other soloists, died on Saturday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 84.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his daughter, Nina Lobban.
        Mr. Baller, who was born in Poland, was sent to Vienna at the age of 8 to study, and made his debut with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra at 13. His career was halted by the Nazis in 1938, but he and his fiancee, Edith Strauss, escaped to Hungary, married, and came to the United States.
        Mr. Baller was a pianist for the New York radio station WQXR, where he met Mr. Menuhin, whom he later accompanied on several world tours. In 1941 Mr. Baller, the violinist Roman Totenberg and the cellist Gabor Rejto formed the Alma Trio, and toured extensively until the mid-1980's. Mr. Baller also taught, at Stanford University and the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
        In addition to his daughter, of Palo Alto, he is survived by a grandson, Andrew Lobban.
