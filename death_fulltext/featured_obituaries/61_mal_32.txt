        The Rev. Robert W. Hovda, a leader in the movement to revise the Roman Catholic liturgy during and after the Second Vatican Council, died on Wednesday in his Manhattan apartment. He was 71 years old and died of heart failure, funeral home officials said.
        From 1965 to 1978, Father Hovda worked full time as an editor and writer for the Liturgical Conference in Washington, writing a monthly newsletter, Living Worship, three books and many articles for religious journals on scripture and ritual. His publications and lectures were influential during a time when the language of the Catholic liturgy was being changed from Latin to English and other contemporary languages and the rites altered to allow more congregational participation.
        Born in Clear Lake, Wis., and reared in Minnesota, he was active in politically radical Methodist youth groups during his high school years in Minneapolis. He later became an Episcopalian, a member of the Episcopal Peace Fellowship and a conscientious objector during World War II. Contact with the Catholic Worker movement led by Dorothy Day led him to become a Catholic in 1943.
        He taught at Catholic University from 1960 to 1963 and in 1978 at the Jesuit School of Theology in Chicago.  Since 1978, he lived in Manhattan, serving as a priest at St. Joseph's Catholic parish in Greenwich Village until his retirement in 1985, when he moved to an apartment on the Lower East Side.
        He is survived by a brother, Leslie R., of Sun City, Ariz.
