        Eric Waha, a former Vienna bureau chief for The Associated Press, was killed in a car crash today about 12 miles from Vienna. He was 63 years old.
        A police report said Mr. Waha was alone in his car when it went off a highway and hit a tree.
        In 1956, Mr. Waha was among the Western correspondents covering the Hungarian uprising and was arrested. He was released several days later and expelled from Hungary. He also covered the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
        A native of Vienna, Mr. Waha joined The A.P. in 1953 and became Vienna bureau chief in 1965. He left Vienna in 1979 to become a representative of A.P. Dow Jones in Hong Kong. He later returned to Europe, where he was an A.P. correspondent in East Berlin for 2 and a half years before retiring in 1984.
