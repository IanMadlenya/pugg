        Lord Penney, the father of the British atomic bomb in the 1950's and an adviser on earlier American atomic projects, died on Sunday, his family announced today. He was 81 years old.
        He died at his home in the village of East Hendred, about 50 miles west of London. No cause of death was given.
        William George Penney studied mathematics at London University's Imperial College, the University of Wisconsin and Cambridge University. In 1936, he became assistant professor of mathematics at Imperial College, where he turned to nuclear physics.
        Soon after the start of World War II in 1939, he began working for the Government on weapons research. At Los Alamos Project
        In 1944, he became principal scientific officer of the British team involved in the atomic bomb development project at Los Alamos, N.M., and assisted in the construction of the world's first atomic bomb, which was exploded near Alamogordo, N.M., on July 16, 1945. He helped assemble the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, on Aug. 6, 1945. The United States recognized his contribution by awarding him the Medal of Freedom.
        In later life, he admitted to qualms of conscience about his part in the development of atomic weapons. But he said he was convinced that Britain had to have them and maintained that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction would make major wars impossible.
        On Oct. 3, 1952, he directed the test explosion of Britain's first atomic bomb in the Monte Bello Islands off the northwest coast of Australia. He was knighted in 1952. Headed Weapons Research
        Sir William was director of the Government's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment from 1953-1959. In 1954, he also became responsible for weapons research at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.
        In 1959, he became the authority's member for scientific research, concentrating on long-term research into peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including projects to develop cheap electricity. He was made a life peer in 1967.
        In 1985, he was questioned by the Australian Royal Commission investigating safety standards of Britain's 1950's test program at Monte Bello and Maralinga. He acknowledged that "in hindsight" at least one of the 12 devices in those tests was exploded in unsafe conditions.
        He married Adele Elms in 1935. She died in 1944, and he remarried in 1945. He is survived by his second wife, the former Joan Quennell, and two sons by his first marriage, Martin and Christopher.
