        Frank R. Thoms Jr., who served as director of athletics at Williams College from 1950 to 1971, died on Monday at Geisinger Medical Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. He was 85.
        His family said he was stricken with viral pneumonia during a trip from his home in East Boothbay, Me.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Thoms graduated from Williams, where he played basketball, baseball and soccer, in 1930 and received a master's degree from Harvard in 1932. After working on Wall Street and for the Zeta Psi fraternity, he spent 15 years operating the Haller Inn in Williamstown before taking over the athletic department.
        He is survived by two sons, Frank R. and Peter W., and two grandchildren.
