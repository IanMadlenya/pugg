        John E. Robson, whose leadership as president and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States helped shape the Bush administration's trade and foreign policy agenda, died today. He was 71.
        The cause was complications from a six-month battle with cancer, according to a statement by the bank.
        Mr. Robson's career in the federal government spanned four administrations, including the first Bush administration, during which he served as deputy Treasury secretary.
        As chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in the Ford administration, Mr. Robson worked for the deregulation of the airline industry. He also served in the Johnson administration as under secretary of transportation.
        President Bush said today that he was saddened by the death of Mr. Robson, who had served as head of the Export-Import Bank since May 2001. ''John set an example of distinguished public service,'' Mr. Bush said in a statement.
        The Export-Import Bank is a government agency that provides loans to foreign companies, enabling them to buy goods and services from American companies. The bank has come under fire in recent years from critics who say it does little more than provide public subsidies for international companies.
        Before joining the bank last year, Mr. Robson worked as an investment banker and senior adviser with Robertson Stephens, the investment banking firm based in San Francisco.
        From 1978 to 1985, he served as president and chief executive of G. D. Searle & Company, a pharmaceutical and consumer products concern. Later, he served as dean of the Goizueta Business School at Emory University in Atlanta.
        Mr. Robson was raised in Chicago and graduated from Yale and the Harvard Law School. He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and a son, Douglas.
