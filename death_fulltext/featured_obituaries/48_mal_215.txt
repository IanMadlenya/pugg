        Stephen P. Guardino Jr., the former president of Guardino & Sons Marine Contractors, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack after collapsing in an office building, a nephew said.
        Mr. Guardino took over a tank- and hull-cleaning business founded by his father that grew enormously during World War II. Mr. Guardino, who had already joined the business, served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy during the war. The company closed when he retired two years ago.
        Born in Brooklyn, he attended Cheshire Academy and graduated from Lafayette College.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two sons, Stephen 3d, of Tampa, Fla., and Henry, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a sister, Lillian Chirello of Richmond, and three grandchildren.
