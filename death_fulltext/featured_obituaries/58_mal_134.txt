        William R. Strickland, a conductor and composer who promoted American music in the United States and abroad, died on Nov. 17 at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 77 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, friends said.
        Mr. Strickland was born in Defiance, Ohio, and moved with his family to New York City, where he began studying the organ at the age of 10. He attended the Cathedral Choir School at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. As a teen-ager, he became the organist of Christ Church in Bronxville, N.Y., and Calvary Episcopal Church in Manhattan.
        In 1946, he helped to found the 60-member Nashville Symphony Orchestra, serving as its first conductor for five years. In the 1950's, he was the conductor of the Oratorio Society of New York.
        Working with the State Department, he conducted concerts of American music in Europe and the Far East. A number of American pieces he conducted were recorded.
        In 1955, he conducted the inaugural concert in a fund-raising series to preserve Carnegie Hall. In 1956 he conducted a concert for the 60th anniversary of the American Guild of Organists.
        In his later years, he specialized in electronic music and in adapting the scores of Charles Ives to it.
        He is survived by a sister, Winifred Randolph of Montecito, Calif.
