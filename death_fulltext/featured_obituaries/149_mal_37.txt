        A Brooklyn native, at the time of his death Mr. Dillon maintained residences in Boynton Beach, Fla., and Jamesburg, N.J.
        Mr. Dillon was educated at Syracuse University and the Cornell University Law School. After serving as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II, he joined Shearman & Sterling in 1947 and took up the practice of law.
        During his years at the law firm, Mr. Dillon began his relationship with Air Reduction, informally known as Airco.
        After serving as the company's legal counsel for a number of years, in 1962 he left Shearman & Sterling, where he had been named a partner, to join Airco as a vice president.
