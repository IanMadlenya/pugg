        Grant H. Webb, an advertising executive, died on Thursday at a Manhattan hotel. He was 78 years old and lived in Keene, N.Y.
        His stepson Jonathan Weld of Brooklyn said Mr. Webb had been released several days ago from Lenox Hill Hospital and had died of complications from open-heart surgery.
        Mr. Webb graduated from the University of Utah in 1936. During World War II, he was a major in the Army Air Corps. He later worked for a securities firm before establishing Grant Webb & Company, an advertising agency based in Manhattan until 1980, when he moved the business to Keene.
        He is also survived by his wife, Sally; another stepson, A. Matthew Weld of Manhattan; two brothers, Archibald and Wellington, and a sister, Margaret Hunter, all of Ogden, Utah, and three grandchildren.
