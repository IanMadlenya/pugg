        Rosetta Miller, a benefactor of the World Monuments Fund and the Newark Museum, died Saturday night or Sunday morning at her home in Sarasota, Fla., where she was spending the winter. She was thought to be 73, and also had homes in Manhattan and on Pawleys Island in South Carolina, her home state.
        She died in her sleep, said her husband, Samuel Miller, director emeritus of the Newark Museum. They worked together to help raise $23 million for the museum's renovation in 1989, contributing money and giving fund-raising parties. Mrs. Miller was also a fund-raiser for and contributor to the monuments fund's campaign to restore the ancient city of Angkor, in Cambodia.
        Rosetta Averil was born in Columbia, S.C. She studied acting at the American Theater Wing, but turned to cabaret singing in Manhattan clubs. After inheriting an uncle's fortune, she retired from performing in 1977, when she married Mr. Miller.
        Mrs. Miller's first marriage, to William Blanton, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Mr. Miller is her only immediate survivor.
