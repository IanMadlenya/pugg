        The Rev. Richard J. Cronin, a Jesuit priest who was a professor of theology at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, died on Oct. 7 in an infirmary at Fordham University in the Bronx. He was 69 and had been a resident of the college's Jesuit community residence in Jersey City.
        He was in ill health for some time, said Nancy Haiduck, the spokeswoman for the college.
        Father Cronin became professor of theology at St. Peter's, a Jesuit institution, in 1977 and taught there until earlier this year. His writings included numerous scholarly articles on theology and Jesuit history and the book "The Jesuits and the Beginning of St. Peter's College" (1983). He spent 50 years in the Jesuit order.
        He was born in Brooklyn, studied theology at the Catholic Institute of Paris and taught for years at the Jesuit university in Manila. He returned to the United States in 1970 and taught at Fordham, Le Moyne College in Syracuse and Regis High School in Manhattan before joining the faculty of St. Peter's.
        In 1990, while on leave from the college, he taught theology at the Seminary of SS. Peter and Paul in Ibadan, Nigeria.
        His survivors include two nieces, Mary Elizabeth Cronin and Christine Shanahan.
