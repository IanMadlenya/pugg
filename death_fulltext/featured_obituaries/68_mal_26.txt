        Jack Ossofsky, whose leadership of an organization for older Americans let him play a role in shaping Government policy on the aging, died on Friday at his home in East Boothbay, Me., where he lived in retirement. He was 66 years old.
        His family said he died of a brain tumor.
        Mr. Ossofsky was chief executive of the Washington-based National Council on the Aging from 1971 until his retirement in 1988. The council is often called on to frame policy recommendations, and as its leader Mr. Ossofsky was credited with developing pilot programs to open employment and other opportunities for older workers.
        Mr. Ossofsky was in the forefront of the fight against mandatory-retirement policies. He promoted social-service networks under the Older Americans Act, equal access to those networks for members of minority groups and the strengthening of social insurance programs, including Medicare.
        He played a prominent role in the 1981 White House Conference on Aging, which the Reagan Administration had called to set policy for the decade ahead. At the time, he was chairman of the Leadership Conference on Aging, a coalition of 24 groups that sent 2,900 delegates to Washington to plan for the White House meeting.
        His survivors include his wife, Eula.
