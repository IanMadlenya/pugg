        The Rev. Dr. James Arthur Graefe, the former bishop of the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Lutheran Church in America, died of cancer of the adrenal glands Saturday at his home in Westtown, N.Y. He was 64 years old.
        Bishop Graefe, who was born in India, where his parents were missionaries, headed the 100,000-member Lutheran denomination from 1969 until he retired in 1987.
        He graduated from the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia in 1950. During World War II, he was a medical technician and treated victims of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, an experience that led him to call for reductions in nuclear weapons.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor Stroehmann Graefe of Westtown; four sons, John, of Tuxedo, N.Y., David, of Craryville, N.Y., Thomas, of Red Bank, N.J., and Stephen, of Concord, N.H., and four grandchildren.
