        Mr. Copple was the founder and former president of Commonwealth. The industrial loan and investment company failed Nov. 1, 1983. In 1984, he was sentenced to 12 to 14 months in prison after pleading no contest to making a false bank entry to deceive bank examiners. Mr. Copple served time in a Federal prison at Dallas, and was released in 1986.
        The failure of the industrial loan and investment company led to substantial changes in Nebraska state law.
