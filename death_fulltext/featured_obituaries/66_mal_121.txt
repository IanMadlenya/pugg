        Henry Starr, the former chairman of the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation, which provides funds for research in Jewish studies, died on Saturday at the Nathan Littauer Hospital-Nursing Home, in Gloversville, N.Y. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Starr and Lucius Littauer, a Gloversville manufacturer of gloves who became a philanthropist and Congressman from New York, had several things in common: Both were raised in Gloversville; both had graduated from the high school there and had gone on to Harvard College, where Mr. Starr earned a bachelor's degree in 1921 and a law degree in 1924. And both were lifelong supporters of Jewish causes, including furthering Jewish education.
        Their primary vehicle for that was the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation, which Mr. Starr advised Mr. Littauer to establish in 1929. The foundation has provided money for Jewish studies prorams at Harvard and more than 40 other colleges and universities.
        As Mr. Littauer's legal adviser, Mr. Starr was secretary of the foundation from 1929 to 1944, when Mr. Littauer died. Mr. Starr then became president and served in that post until 1985, when he became chairman, a post he held until 1991. At his death he was the foundation's honorary chairman.
        Mr. Starr was a member of many boards of philanthropic and educational institutions in the United States and in Israel. They included the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the American Jewish Committee, Touro College and the American Friends of Hebrew University.
        Mr. Starr's wife, the former Cecile Aronsohn, died in 1977. He is survived by a brother, Samuel, of Manhattan, and a sister, Sarah Siegel, of Gloversville.
        Correction:  July 29, 1992, Wednesday
        An obituary yesterday about the former chairman of the Lucius N. Littauer Foundation, which finances research in Jewish studies, misstated his first name. He was Harry Starr.
