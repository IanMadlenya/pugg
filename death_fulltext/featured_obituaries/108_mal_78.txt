        Paul Borsky, who studied the effects of aircraft noise on people just when the term sonic boom was entering the common vocabulary, died last Tuesday at his home in Plainview, L.I. He was 75.
        The cause was cancer, his daughter Phyllis Borsky said.
        At a time when jet planes were making the world an ever smaller and noisier  place, Mr. Borsky measured the psychological consequences on communities and people.
        As a result, Mr. Borsky, a professor at Columbia University's School of Public Health, was called by government agencies as an expert witness. His professional publications included a study of human reactions to sonic booms, a  work on fear as a factor of community annoyance at airplane noise and reports of sleep disturbances near air traffic.
        Mr. Borsky, who was born on Nov. 15, 1920, in Paterson, N.J., was valedictorian of his class at Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. He graduated from Brooklyn College in 1942 and completed his graduate courses in economics in 1946 at American University.
        His interest in airplane noise began a decade later, while he was a senior study director for the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
        To find his research subjects, Mr. Borsky sometimes looked no farther than his own children. In the early 1970's, he asked his son Arthur, then a senior at Adelphi University, to gather some college friends to be in a control group. But Arthur rode to his father's office in a car with a faulty muffler, leaving him with a short-term hearing loss that kept him from participating in the study.
        Besides his son, Arthur, of Princeton, Mass., and his daughter Phyllis, of Westbury, L.I., Mr. Borsky is survived by his wife, Rosalyn; another daughter, Susan Cohen of Columbia, Md.; a sister, Ruth Gold of Mexico, and three grandchildren.
