        Donald J. Olsen, a historian of urban architecture and professor emeritus of history at Vassar College, died on May 19 at his home in Seattle. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, said the office of Lawrence Hard, his lawyer in Seattle.
        Dr. Olsen retired in 1994 as Eloise Ellery Professor in Vassar's history department. He had joined the faculty in 1955 after teaching at the University of Massachusetts and University College of Hull, England.
        He was the author of ''Town Planning in London: The 18th and 19th Centuries'' (1964). The book grew from his studies at the University of London as a Fulbright scholar and his research on town planning by landowners in that city before 1900.
        Subsequent studies in Europe as a Guggenheim Fellow produced another, highly acclaimed volume, ''The City as a World of Art: London, Paris, Vienna'' (1986). The New York Times Book Review termed it ''enthralling'' and ''a fascinating analysis of the different ways in which the inhabitants of his three cities chose to live, eat, sleep and amuse themselves.''
        Both books remain in print at Yale University Press.
        Donald James Olsen was born in Seattle and received B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. degrees from Yale. He began at Vassar as an instructor, was appointed Ellery Professor of History in 1972 and was department chairman in the early 1970's.
        He taught English history, including courses on the medieval, Tudor, Georgian and contemporary eras. A railroad buff, he rode most of the world's famous trains and traveled  throughout Europe and Australia.
        He is survived by his mother, Anna Marie Lungdahl Olsen of Seattle.
