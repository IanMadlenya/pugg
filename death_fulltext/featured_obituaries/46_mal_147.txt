        Andrew Gerzel, a restaurateur who for the last 25 years managed Sweet's, the 148-year-old seafood restaurant on Fulton and South Streets in lower Manhattan, died on Sunday at the City Hospital Center in Elmurst, Queens. He was 81 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He was taken to the hospital when he suffered what appeared to be a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Gerzel, who was born in Manhattan, was known as "Mr. G." to restaurant patrons. He managed the business for Lea Lake, a longtime owner who died in 1988, and became a partner shortly before she died.
        For more than 60 years, he was a volunteer director of youth activities at settlement houses in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Billie Polinori, and a brother, Leonard, of Queens.
