        Mordi Gassner, an artist and mural painter whose most prominent work reflected the spirit of the Renaissance and humanity's knowledge of science, died on Monday in Southside Community Hospital in Farmville, Va. He was 95 and lived in Drakes Branch, Va.
        Mr. Gassner's family said the cause was heart failure.
        After training at Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League, where he later taught in the 1950's, Mr. Gassner was a set designer in Hollywood in the early 1920's and later for television and the theater.
        In the late 1920's, he was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships for a two-year project for a set of murals that he completed in Florence, Italy, and later exhibited in the Brooklyn Museum and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington.
        During the 1930's, Mr. Gassner created murals for several United States post offices.
        Other works were shown in the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art.
        Mr. Gassner's first wife, Augusta, died. He is survived by his second wife, Marion; a daughter, Judith G. Schlosser of Manhattan; a granddaughter, Lynn Jacobson of Santa Monica, Calif.; a grandson, Eric Schlosser of Manhattan, and five great-grandchildren.
