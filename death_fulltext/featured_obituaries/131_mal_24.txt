        Joel Barlow, a Washington tax lawyer and former treasurer of the United States Chamber of Commerce, died Tuesday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 89.
        He died of complications from a stroke, his former law firm, Covington & Burling, said.
        Mr. Barlow retired in 1977 after 43 years at the firm. He was chairman of the chamber's tax committee from 1955 to 1960 and from 1962 to 1971, often acting as the point man on business tax issues.
        He advocated cuts in income tax rates in 1960, when the top personal income tax rate was 91 percent. But he counseled that public support would not develop so long as corporations abused the tax system.
        ''Thoughtful management,'' he said, ''is perfectly willing to admit that corporations have gone too far'' in shifting and minimizing taxes paid by executives through the use of expense accounts, profit-sharing, pension and stock option plans.
        In 1964 he was the chamber's spokesman in urging a 5 percent national sales tax. He said it would raise enough money to cut personal and corporate income tax rates.
        He was also a collector of model ships, ship figureheads and ship's barometers, many of which he donated to the Smithsonian Institution.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor Livingston Poe Barlow; three daughters, Eleanor Poe Barlow of Friendship, Me., Jae Barlow Roosevelt of Cambridge, Mass., and Grace Barlow Bowman of McLean, Va., and five grandchildren.
