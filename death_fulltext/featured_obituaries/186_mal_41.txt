        Ira Eaker, a founder of Back Stage, the weekly theatrical newspaper that is a must-read for many actors seeking work, union news and reviews, died on June 26 at a hospital in Tamarac, Fla. He was 80.
        An advertising man who worked for various publications during college, Mr. Eaker got his first taste of the entertainment industry in 1948 when he became the advertising manager of Show Business, a theater trade paper. He held that job for 12 years before joining with Allen Zwerdling in 1960 to found Back Stage, printing 10,000 copies a week out of a cubbyhole office on West 46th Street in Manhattan.
        The paper's editorial mandate was clear from the beginning: a healthy mix of news about forthcoming film and theater productions, reviews and previews for the ticket-buying audience, and features on aspects of the lives of striving actors, whether it was how to choose an agent or where to find cheap pasta. As the television industry expanded in New York during the 1960's, so did Back Stage's circulation; its current circulation is about 32,000.
        Mr. Eaker remained an ambitious force, leading the paper, opening a West Coast office in 1975 and eventually extending his publication's coverage to Chicago, Boston and Florida, as the television and advertising industries grew in those places.
        In 1986, Mr. Eaker and Mr. Zwerdling sold Back Stage to Billboard Publications, though Mr. Eaker continued as an adviser to the newspaper until 1989, when he retired. A sister publication, Back Stage West, based in Los Angeles, was started in 1994.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Eaker attended public schools in the city and graduated from City College with a business degree after serving in the United States Army during World War II. He is survived by his wife, Lee; a daughter, Sherry Eaker, editor in chief of Back Stage; a son, Dean, of Cos Cob, Conn.; a sister, Lillian Herman, of Rockaway, Queens; and two grandchildren.
