        William E. Powers, the victim of an accident that left him blind, who become a Justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court and the state's Attorney General, died Saturday at the Wayland Health Center in Providence. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Powers became totally blind in 1928, at the age of 20, after an accident at home the previous year, when a battery wire for a radio snapped and hit him in the right eye. He later graduated from Boston University Law School.
        He was a probate judge from 1936 to 1949, a State Representative from 1939 to 1949, Attorney General from 1949 to 1958 and Supreme Court Justice from 1958 to 1973.
        In 1954 he was cited by President Eisenhower's committee on employment of physically handicapped people for efforts to promote equal opportunity in employment for the disabled.
        ''Why make basket-weavers, mattress-makers or chair-caners out of everybody that's blind?'' Mr. Powers asked in an address in 1939.
        Mr. Powers prided himself on being able to remember many people by voice and to make mental images of others.
        ''I see every man and woman I meet,'' he said once, ''and the women are always good-looking.''
        He is survived by his wife, Olive Higgins Powers, two daughters, a brother, seven grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.
