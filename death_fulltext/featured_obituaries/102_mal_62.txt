        Rabbi Robert E. Goldburg, the former spiritual leader of Congregation Mishkan Israel in Hamden, Conn., died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan, where he moved from Hamden after retiring in 1982.
        The cause was cancer, said Rabbi Herbert N. Brockman, who now heads Mishkan Israel, New England's oldest continuous synagogue.
        Rabbi Goldburg, who led the synagogue for 34 years, was outspoken in his support of civil rights and other causes. During his rabbinate, he often invited guest speakers considered controversial, like Dr. Daniel Ellsberg, Alger Hiss and Stokely Carmichael. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached at Mishkan Israel in 1961.
        Rabbi Goldburg spoke against McCarthyism and the House Committee on Un-American Activities when it subpoenaed writers and artists to investigate their political attitudes. His sermons emphasized the harmony between Jewish values and democratic principles, weaving together themes from the Talmud, Shakespeare and contemporary writers.
        He was born in Yonkers. Rabbi Goldburg graduated from New York University and received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1939. He was ordained in 1945 at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.
        Rabbi Goldburg is survived by a brother, Edwin Greer of Scarsdale, N.Y.
