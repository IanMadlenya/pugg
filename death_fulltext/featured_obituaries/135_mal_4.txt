        David Bourdon, a critic who was closely involved in the innovative Manhattan art world of the early 1960's and who was one of the early writers on the Minimalist movement, died on March 27 at Simi Valley Hospital in Simi Valley, Calif. He was 63.
        The cause was esophageal cancer, said a friend, the artist Les Levine.
        Among Mr. Bourdon's books were studies of the artists Christo (1972), Alexander Calder (1980) and Andy Warhol (1989). His book on Warhol was a detailed insider's account of the artist's career in which he reported having assisted Warhol in producing a series of his 1963 Elvis Presley silk-screen paintings. A friend of the artists Robert Smithson and Michael Heizer, he also wrote about the Earth Art movement in the late 1960's and 70's. He was a past president of the United States section of the International Association of Art Critics and an arts editor at Vogue from 1983-86.
        Mr. Bourdon wrote for many art magazines and was a frequent contributor to Art in America, for whose 1977 summer issue he produced a memorable diary-style, show-by-show review of the entire New York art season, a marathon task he never attempted again. As a critic, his style was fluid, often conversational, and his insights and wit were sharp, as was evident in a eulogy he wrote for the artist Ray Johnson in Art in America in October 1995.
        Mr. Bourdon, who graduated from Columbia University with a bachelor of science degree in 1961, was an assistant editor at Life magazine from 1966-71, associate editor at The Smithsonian magazine in Washington from 1972-74 and senior editor at Geo magazine in New York from 1981-83. His last book, ''Designing the Earth'' (1995), was about how people have used earth and stone to shape their environment. In recent years  he had become involved with organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and the World Wildlife Fund.
        He is survived by his parents, David and Marilyn Bourdon of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; a brother, Gary, of Simi Valley, and two sisters, Beverley Post and Diane Bourdon of Encino, Calif. A memorial service is to  be held on April 30 at 6 P.M. at St. Francis Xavier Church, 42 West 16th Street, in New York City's Flatiron district.
