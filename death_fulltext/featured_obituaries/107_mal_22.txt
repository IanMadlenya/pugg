        Dinesh Singh, a former Foreign Minister, died on Thursday after a long illness, his family said. He was 70.
        Mr. Singh, who had been a member of Parliament for 38 years, became Foreign Minister in 1993. He was made a Minister Without Portfolio this year after failing health made active duty too difficult.
        Mr. Singh attended Doon, India's elite secondary school, at Dehra Dun. He went into politics after graduating from Lucknow University.
        Mr. Singh won a seat in Parliament in 1957. He served in the External Affairs Ministry from 1962 to 1966 and held several Cabinet posts under Indira Gandhi.
