        Raymond Everett Lisle, a dean emeritus of the Brooklyn Law School and a former Foreign Service officer, died on Sunday at his home in Freeport, L.I. He was 83.
        Mr. Lisle, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from City College of New York in 1929 and began teaching history there in 1930 after earning a master's degree from Columbia University. He received a law degree in 1936 from New York University School of Law, where he was editor of The Law Quarterly Review.
        He served as a law professor at Brooklyn Law School from 1946 to 1948.
        He joined the Foreign Service in 1948. He was promoted to senior Foreign Service inspector in 1959 and, after serving as minister of the Belgrade Mission, in 1962 was appointed deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs. He was named the State Department's director for relations with Eastern Europe in 1965 and became the focus of a cold war spy incident in 1966, when two Czechoslovak diplomats were caught trying to plant an electronic listening device in his office.
        He returned to Brooklyn Law School in 1970 and taught courses in international law, jurisprudence and comparative law. He was appointed dean in 1972 and served for five years before becoming dean emeritus and rejoining the teaching faculty. He continued teaching until last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Aileen Coggeshall Lisle, of Freeport; a son, Raymond, of Palmdale, Calif., and two grandchildren.
