        Nat Werner, an American sculptor, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died after a long illness, his wife, Geri Pine, said.
        Mr. Werner was born on Dec. 8, 1907, in New York City and was brought up in the Hebrew Orphan Asylum. He studied at City College and the Art Students League and had his first exhibition in 1937 at the A.C.A. Gallery, where he continued to exhibit until 1963. Throughout his career he worked in both figurative and abstract styles and with nearly every sculptural method, including terra-cotta, carved wood and stone, welded steel and found-object assemblage.
        He is survived by his wife.
