In 1945, he was the assistant commander at the liberated Dachau concentration camp, where he set up three hospitals and later led a convoy of 20 trucks to repatriate former inmates to Italy and Greece.
        His wartime decorations included the gold star of Italian Solidarity with the rank of knight, the Croix de Guerre with a gold star, and the United States Army's commendation medal.
        His wife, Elsie, died in 1982. Surviving are his son, Ronald, of Fort Salonga, L.I., and three grandchildren.
