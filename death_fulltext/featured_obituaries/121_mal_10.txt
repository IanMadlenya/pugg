        Michael Braun, one of the producers of the musical ''Titanic,'' scheduled to open at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in April, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60.
        The cause was heart failure, said his sister, Kathy Braun.
        Mr. Braun was born in New York City and graduated from Harvard University in 1958. During the 1960's and part of the 70's, he worked in London, writing for The Observer and The Sunday Times. He was the author of ''Love Me Do!'' (1964), a diary of the Beatles' first British tour. The book was reprinted by Penguin Books in 1995.
        From 1960 to 1963 he was an assistant to Stanley Kubrick, and he later worked for Roman Polanski. He moved to Los Angeles in the 1970's and produced Waylon Green's ''Secret Life of Plants'' (1975).
        He is survived by his sister.
