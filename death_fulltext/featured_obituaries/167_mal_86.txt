        The Rev. John Wesley Rice Jr., who rose from the segregated South to become a minister and university leader, died on Sunday in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 77 and the father of Condoleezza Rice, who was recently selected by President-elect George W. Bush to be his national security adviser.
        Dr. Rice's wife, Clara Bailey Rice, said he went to the Stanford University Medical Center last Friday after suffering an irregular heartbeat. He had experienced similar heart problems since February, she said.
        Dr. Rice was born in Baton Rouge, La. He worked as a Presbyterian minister, teacher and coach at a high school in Birmingham, Ala., before becoming dean of students at Stillman College in Tuscaloosa. In 1969, he became a professor and assistant vice chancellor of the University of Denver.
        Dr. Rice married Clara Bailey in July 1989, four years after the death of his first wife, the former Angelena Ray, the mother of Condoleezza. Besides his daughter, he is survived by a sister, Theresa Rice Love, 79, of New Orleans.
        Dr. Rice lived in Palo Alto. Although retired, he volunteered at the local school district tutoring students and worked with members of the Stanford University football team.
        ''He would make sure they studied and kept quiet,'' his wife said.
        As a young black man living in Alabama in the early 1950's, Dr. Rice was denied the right to vote, his daughter said in her speech at the Republican National Convention in August.
        So in 1952 he joined the Republican Party, because it offered to register him for the forthcoming elections, she said.
        ''My father has never forgotten that day, and neither have I,'' Ms. Rice said.
