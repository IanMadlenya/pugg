        Mr. Delaunay, the son of the painters Robert and Sonia Delaunay, established the Hot Club of France, an association of jazz enthusiasts, with Hugues Panassie in the mid-1930's. The two men started Le Jazz Hot in 1934, now the world's oldest jazz magazine, and organized recordings in the 1930's and 1940's by jazz musicians such as Bill Coleman, Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli and Benny Carter.
        Mr. Delaunay published ''Hot Dis=cography,'' the first comprehensive jazz discography, in 1936. He edited Le Jazz Hot for many years, and later was director of Vogue Records, a French jazz label.
