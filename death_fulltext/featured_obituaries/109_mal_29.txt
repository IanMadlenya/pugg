        Kevin Williams, a former star wide receiver at U.S.C. and a member of the 1978 national championship team, was killed in a freight-train crash, family members and railroad officials said. He was 38.
        Mr. Williams died early Thursday when the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation train derailed and caught fire as it rounded a downhill bend on the  Cajon Pass northeast of Los Angeles.
        Mr. Williams, a brakeman on the train, was killed, along with the conductor  Gilbert L. Ortiz, 25, of Fullerton, Calif.
        Playing at U.S.C. from 1977 to 1980, Mr. Williams caught 71 passes for 1,358  yards and 25 touchdowns, which is still a school record. He was also a member of two National Collegiate Athletic Association champion 400-meter relay teams.
