        Al DeRogatis, a former defensive tackle for the New York Giants who achieved  considerable popularity and recognition through his keen analyses of pro football games on radio and television, died today at Jersey Shore Medical Center. He was 68.
        In 1960, when pro football was on the upswing across the nation and the Giants were the darlings of New York, DeRogatis began his broadcasting career for WNEW-AM, working with Marty Glickman on Giant games. After six years, he moved to television and worked along side Curt Gowdy on NBC telecasts of the N.F.L. Game of the Week.
        Born in Newark, DeRogatis attended Central High School. He later went to Duke University, where he excelled at football in his sophomore and senior year. A knee injury sidelined him for most of his junior year.
        DeRogatis was drafted by the Giants in 1949 and he played defensive tackle under Coach Steve Owen through 1952. He made All-Pro his second and third years.
        The knee injury recurred, though, and brought his professional career to an end at age 25.
        For the next 33 years, DeRogatis was a vice president with the Prudential Insurance Company, spending many of his autumn and winter Sundays in the broadcasting booth, shrewdly explaining why this play worked and that play misfired.
        DeRogatis, who lived in Spring Lake, N.J., is survived by his wife of 45 years, Louise; two daughters, Mary Ann D'Agostino and Diane Hagen; two brothers, Pat and Michael; two sisters, Rose Mastracchio and Paula Mossucco, and five grandchildren.
