        Ernest Cole, a South African photographer who published a pioneering collection of photographs documenting life under apartheid, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 49 years old.
        Mr. Cole's book, ''House of Bondage'' was published by Random House in 1967. For many Westerners, it was their first sight of what life was like for blacks in the South African mines, compounds and townships.
        In reviewing the book in The Guardian, Dan Jacobson, the novelist, wrote: ''Anyone who looks into the book will at once be aware of the photographer's lack of sentimentality, his tenderness, his anger, his wit. He has photographed his people everywhere - in the streets, in the mines, in the homes of their white employers, in their own homes.
        ''Deprivation and discrimination are shown to us for what they are.''
        Mr. Cole, who was black, managed to have himself racially reclassified as colored or mixed race so he could travel throughout the country taking photographs for the book. He started his career as a darkroom assistant for Drum magazine. He left South Africa and resettled in the United States in 1966.
        He is survived by his mother, Martha Kole of Mamelodi Township, Pretoria; two sisters and a brother.
