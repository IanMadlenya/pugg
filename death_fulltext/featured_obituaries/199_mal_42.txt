        Harold Altman, a painter, printmaker and lithographer whose work was shown internationally and in major American museums including the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art, died on July 28 in State College, Pa. He was 79.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        For the last 40 years Mr. Altman lived and worked in a converted church in the nearby village of Lemont. Until recently he also kept an atelier in Paris, where he printed his lithographs.
        Mr. Altman was a professor emeritus of art at Pennsylvania State University. A native New Yorker and a regular in Paris, he drew inspiration from many places, as evidenced by series inspired by Central Park, the parks and markets of Paris, and the Pennsylvania countryside.
        Mr. Altman was born in the Bronx. He studied at the Art Students League and Cooper Union in New York and at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, where he had his first one-man show in 1951.
        Since then his work was shown widely in solo or group exhibitions in galleries and museums as far away as Tokyo. He received two Guggenheim fellowships, grants and numerous awards.
        He taught at Penn State's School of Visual Arts from 1962 to 1976, following academic appointments at the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and, in the mid-1950's, the University of North Carolina in Greensboro.
        Mr. Altman is survived by three sons, Evan and Toby of Lemont, and Eli Beers-Altman of State College; two daughters, Ann Chantal Altman of Manhattan and Jessie Beers-Altman of State College; a sister, Edith Levine of River Edge, N.J.; and one granddaughter.
