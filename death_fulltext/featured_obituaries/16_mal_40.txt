        In the Depression, Mr. Speidel worked as a reporter for The Seattle Times. He bought Seattle Guide Inc., which published a weekly entertainment-tourist guide, and established the Nettle Creek Publishing Company to publish his books.
        Mr. Speidel was best known for starting Seattle's Underground Tours of the old downtown upon which the new one was built. He began the tours in 1955 and about 120,000 people take them each year to see Seattle as it existed before the Great Fire of 1889.
