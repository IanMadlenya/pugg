        Nelson Mandela's first wife, Evelyn Mandela, who quit the couple's marriage after telling him to choose between her and the African National Congress liberation movement, died April 30 at the age of 82, South African newspapers and news agencies have reported.
        The Johannesburg Star reported that she had died of an respiratory ailment. News agencies said that Mr. Mandela, who was in Trinidad and Tobago lobbying to bring the 2010 World Cup soccer championships to South Africa, had cut short his trip to return for her funeral.
        Ms. Mandela, a member of the Jehovah's Witness denomination, separated from Mr. Mandela in 1955 after what her husband described in his autobiography, ''Long Walk to Freedom,'' as an irreconcilable conflict between politics and religion.
        ''I could not give up my life in the struggle, and she could not live with my devotion to something other than herself and her family,'' he wrote. ''I never lost my admiration for her, but in the end we could not make our marriage work.''
        Evelyn Mandela, a cousin of the legendary anti-apartheid figure Walter Sisulu, married Nelson Mandela in 1944. The couple had four children, one of whom died in infancy. Mr. Mandela acknowledged in his autobiography that he was a ''too-often distant father,'' and that the children grew up largely without his help.
        Ms. Mandela said little of their relationship until 1994, as South Africa held its first democratic election, when she said that her former husband was primarily responsible for her black countrymen's right to vote.
        Ms. Mandela remarried in 1998, to a retired businessman, Simon Rakeepile, and lived in Soweto, in southern Johannesburg. Mr. Mandela remarried in 1958, to the fiery activist Winnie Nomzamo. They were later divorced, and he is now married to Gra√ßa Machel, the widow of the former president of Mozambique, Samora Machel.
