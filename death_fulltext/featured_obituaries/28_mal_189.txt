        Colonel Jacobson served in Vietnam for 18 years. His first tour was with the Military Assistance Advisory Group from 1954 to 1957. He returned in 1961 as deputy chief of staff of the group.
        He later became associate director of field operations in Saigon for the Agency for Internationmal Development and assistant chief of staff for the pacification program, which was intended to win support of the Vietnamese people through education, public works projects and improvements in public health and agriculture.
        Colonel Jacobson, who retired in 1976, was among the last Americans to leave Saigon in 1975 after the North Vietnamese defeated South Vietnamese military forces.
        He joined the Army in 1941 and served with an armored cavalry reconnaissance unit in France and Germany in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Marge Stockdale.
