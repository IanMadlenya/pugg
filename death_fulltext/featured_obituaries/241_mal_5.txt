        Ken Kavanaugh, an All-Pro receiver for the Chicago Bears in the 1940s and an assistant coach and scout for the New York Giants for 45 years, died Jan. 25 in Sarasota, Fla., where he had lived since retiring from football in 1999. He was 90.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, a spokesman for the Giants said.
        At 6-foot-3 and 207 pounds, Kavanaugh was gangly, rawboned and fast. He was an all-American end at Louisiana State before he joined the Bears in 1940. The Bears, known then as the Monsters of the Midway, won four National Football League championships in the '40s.
        In the 1940 title game, Kavanaugh caught the only touchdown pass in the Bears' 73-0 victory over the Washington Redskins. He might have caught more. The Bears had an outstanding passer in Sid Luckman, but their owner and coach, George Halas, preferred to run the ball.
        In eight seasons, Kavanaugh caught 162 passes and scored 50 touchdowns. He holds or shares four Bears records, more than half a century after his last game. They include most career touchdown catches (50) and most single-season touchdown receptions (13, tied by Dick Gordon in 1970). Kavanaugh, who was with the Bears until 1950, spent three years in the Army Air Forces during World War II. A bomber pilot in Europe, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
        After coaching wide receivers for the Bears, Boston College and Villanova, he joined the Giants in 1955 as one of four assistant coaches. (Two others were Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry.) Kavanaugh stayed for 15 years, then spent the next 30 years, into his 80s, as a scout, focusing on wide receivers and tight ends, like tight end Mark Bavaro.
        ''When he scouted Mark Bavaro, he loved him because Mark was tough, and never mind his bad knee,'' said Tom Boisture, the Giants' former director of player personnel.
        Kenneth William Kavanaugh was born Nov. 23, 1916, in Little Rock, Ark. After college, he was signed by Branch Rickey as a first baseman for a St. Louis Cardinals' farm team for $300 a month. He was unaware the Bears had taken him in the second round of the draft. Halas offered him $50 a game. Kavanaugh got him up to $300 a game and signed.
        Kavanaugh was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1963.
        He is survived by his wife of 64 years, the former Ann Porter; a son, Ken Jr., of Atlanta, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
