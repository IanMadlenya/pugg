        Charles Loloma, a Hopi artist who changed the look of American Indian jewelry, died on Sunday. He was 70 years old.
        The cause of death was not given.
        Although a painter, potter and sculptor, he was best known for his jewelry, which has been exhibited at museums and galleries around the world. He went beyond the traditional turquoise and silver, using bold mosaics and exotic materials like coral, the ivory of fossilized mastodons and the deep blue of lapis lazuli.
        One of his trademarks was to line the inside of a bracelet or ring with stones more valuable than those on the outside.
