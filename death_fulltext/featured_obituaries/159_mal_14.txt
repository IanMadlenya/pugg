        Byron Goldman, a garment industry executive who was better known as a theatrical producer, died last Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, said a friend, Sidney Kraines.
        Most recently Mr. Goldman was a co-producer of the Broadway production of ''Copenhagen,'' which opens on April 11.
        In the early 1960's Mr. Goldman, who was an executive with GGG Clothes in Manhattan, a family business, was one of Broadway's most successful angels, as investors in theater productions are known.
        He began his show-backing career in 1946 with an investment of $1,000 in ''The Bench Warmer,'' which flopped. He made more successful investments in shows including ''Butterflies Are Free'' and ''Hello, Dolly!''
        Mr. Goldman was born in Manhattan and earned a bachelor's degree from New York University. No immediate survivors were known.
