        Parke Atherton Dickey, a petroleum geologist and retired educator, died on Feb. 3 at his home in Haverford, Pa. He was 85.
        He had been in declining health for several years, said a son, Thomas M. Dickey of Lincoln University, Pa.
        After receiving a doctorate in geology from Johns Hopkins University in 1932, Dr. Dickey went to Colombia, where he began mapping out a large area of the Magdalena River Valley, developing new techniques for measuring the content of rocks and soil.
        After tropical diseases forced his return to the United States, he took a job preparing maps of the Titusville, Pa., area. The maps are still being reprinted by the Pennsylvania Geological Survey.
        In 1946 he moved to Tulsa, Okla., to organize a geological research group for the Esso Standard Oil Company, now Exxon.
        From 1961 until his retirement in 1975, he headed the department of earth sciences at the University of Tulsa. He also wrote a textbook, "Petroleum Development Geology" (PennWell 1979).
        In addition to his son Thomas, he is survived by his wife of 59 years, Janet Woods Dickey; another son, Andrew, of Nowata, Okla.; two daughters, Margaret Wilde of Bethlehem, Pa., and Louise Pinkow of Boulder, Colo., and six grandchildren.
