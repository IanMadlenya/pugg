        The Rev. Daniel Christopher Fives, a religious educator and parish priest, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 85 years old and lived at Our Lady of Victory Church in lower Manhattan.
        Father Fives died of pneumonia, following a stroke and a heart attack suffered two weeks earlier, said Msgr. Edward J. Mitty, pastor of the church.
        In 1931, Father Fives was admitted to the Society of St. Suplice, which is dedicated to the education of priests. He taught at St. Charles College in Catonsville, Md., St. Joseph's College Seminary in Mountain View, Cal., and was dean of studies at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore.
        For 53 years, during the summer months, Father Fives was vicar at St. Jerome's Church in the Bronx.
        He is survived by a niece and four nephews.
