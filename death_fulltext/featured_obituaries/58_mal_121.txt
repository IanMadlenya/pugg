        Samuel Ralph Sapirie, who headed the operation of the Atomic Energy Commission's giant plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn., in the 1950's and 1960's, died Monday in Englewood, Fla., at Engelwood Community Hospital. He was 82 years old and had homes in both Oak Ridge and Englewood.
        He suffered from Parkinson's disease and died after a short illness, said Jim Alexander, a spokesman for the Department of Energy, which now operates the Oak Ridge plant.
        A native of Indianapolis and civil engineering graduate of Purdue University, Mr. Sapirie worked on military construction projects in World War II and went to Tennessee in 1946 as a manager on the Manhattan District Project. When that nuclear project was transferred to the A.E.C. in 1947, he was placed in charge of production and engineering.
        He was appointed general manager of Oak Ridge in 1951, and for 21 years held responsibility for development and improvement of operations, design and construction at the sprawling plant. He retired in 1972.
        Mr. Sapirie is survived his wife of 45 years, the former Kathryn Canatsey; a son, Stephen A. of Lausanne, Switzerland; a daughter, Sally Ann Copley of Sedova, Ariz.; a brother, Jack Sapirie of Lafayette, Ind., and four grandchildren.
