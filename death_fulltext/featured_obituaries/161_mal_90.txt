        Louis Finkelstein, a painter, teacher and critic who was professor emeritus in the art department of Queens College, City University of New York, died last Tuesday at a Manhattan hospice. He was 77 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Finkelstein was born in New York and studied at the Cooper Union Art School and the Art Students League. He had his first one-person show in 1950 and had seven solo exhibitions at the Ingber Gallery in Manhattan from 1974 to 1988. He was included in group shows at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Queens Museum. His work is in several institutional collections, including those of the National Academy of Design, the Butler Art Institute and the Hood Museum, Dartmouth College.
        As a critic, Mr. Finkelstein wrote for Artnews and the College Art Journal. He was highly regarded as a teacher both at Queens College, where he worked from 1964 to 1989, and at the Yale University School of Art. He was a regular and popular lecturer at the New York Studio School in Manhattan from 1966 to 1998.
        He was given the distinguished teacher award by the College Art Association in 1979, and the Maryland Institute College of Art awarded him an honorary doctor of fine arts last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane Culp; a daughter, Martha Campbell of Potsdam, N.Y.; a son, Henry, of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.
