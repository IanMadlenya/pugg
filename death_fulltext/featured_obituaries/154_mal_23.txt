        Robert L. Schiffer, who was a speechwriter for United States delegates to the United Nations, including Adlai E. Stevenson and Arthur J. Goldberg, and who was also an international affairs consultant and an author, died on Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York City. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, his son, Michael, said.
        Robert Lester Schiffer was born on Oct. 17, 1920, in Manhattan. A graduate of City College, he began his career in international affairs as a reporter for The New York Times as World War II was ending. He covered the plight of European refugees, then returned to New York and became a director of the Greater New York Israel Bonds campaign.
        In 1961, he joined the United States mission to the United Nations, where he held several jobs.
        After he left the United Nations in 1982, Mr. Schiffer founded an international public affairs consulting firm. He also wrote books like ''The Exploding City'' (St. Martin's, 1989).
        In addition to his son, who lives in Washington, Mr. Schiffer is survived by his wife, Selma; a daughter, Suzi Parrasch of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.
