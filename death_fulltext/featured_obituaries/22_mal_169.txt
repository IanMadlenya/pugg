        Leonid Bolotine, a violinist and guitarist, died of heart failure on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Bolotine was best known as a guitar teacher. He taught at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan from 1958 until 1984, and established the guitar department there. In 1975, he founded the American Institute of the Guitar in Manhattan, a guitar school that now has 200 students. But by the time he started playing guitar, in the 1940's, he had already established a career as a violinist.
        Mr. Bolotine was born in Poltava, the Ukraine, in 1901, and after local violin studies he entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory as a student of Leopold Auer. He arrived in the United States in 1924, and became an assistant concertmaster of the San Francisco Symphony, and a violinist with the Philadelphia Orchestra, the CBS Symphony, and other ensembles. He took up the guitar as a hobby in the 1940's, and taught himself. By the 1960's, he was freelancing as a guitarist and mandolinist, playing in the Metropolitan Opera orchestra and in other New York ensembles.
        He is survived by his wife, Cleopatra; a daughter, Yolanda Kulik of Elkins Park, Pa., and a son, David, of Centereach, N. Y.
