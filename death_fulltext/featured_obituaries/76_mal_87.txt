        Joe L. Parkin, a former insurance company executive and president of the Retirement Research Foundation since 1986, died on Sunday while playing golf in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. He was 70 and lived in Evanston, Ill.
        The cause was a heart attack, said the foundation, a charitable organization endowed by the founder of Bankers Life and Casualty Company.
        Mr. Parkin spent 30 years with Bankers Life and Casualty. He was a senior vice president for 10 years, overseeing all of the company's insurance subsidiaries and coordinating their relations with the parent company in Chicago. He had been a trustee of the foundation for three years when he retired in 1985.
        John D. MacArthur, the late founder and principal stockholder of Bankers Life, endowed the foundation in 1978. It gives about $6 million a year in grants to support programs, research and public-policy studies aimed at improving the lives of the elderly in the Midwest and Florida.
        Mr. Parkin was born on a farm in Iowa and received his initial education in a one-room schoolhouse. His college education was interrupted by World War II, in which he served as a navigator in the Army Air Forces. He graduated from Northwestern University in 1947 with a B.S. degree in commerce and served with the Air Force in the early 1950's.
        Joining Bankers Life in 1955, he began as advertising director and assumed increasingly responsible positions in marketing and promotion of the company and its many affiliates. He became senior vice president in 1973. He was elected a director in 1983 and became a member of the executive committee the next year. He held both positions when he retired from the company.
        Mr. Parkin is survived by his wife, Louise Lovett Parkin; four sons, Judd and Jeffrey, of Los Angeles, Jon, of Jacksonville, Ill., and Jason, of Iowa City; a sister, Helen Morton of Garden Grove, Iowa, and eight grandchildren.
