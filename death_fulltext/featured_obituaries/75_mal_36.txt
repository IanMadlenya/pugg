        Paul Laszlo, an architect and interior designer in the United States and Europe, died on March 27 at home in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 93.
        Mr. Laszlo, who retired two years ago, was known for his ultra-modern, spacious designs for celebrities, luxury stores and casinos.
        His residential clients included Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbara Stanwyck, Robert Taylor and Barbara Hutton. He designed stores for Bullock's Wilshire, Goldwater's, Robinson's and Orbach's and most of the casinos and showrooms in the Howard Hughes hotels in Las Vegas, Nev. His other work included offices, banks, theaters and hospitals.
        Mr. Laszlo was born in Hungary. At the age of 24 he opened a decorating business in Vienna and was soon working around Europe.
        Because of his Jewish roots and an early brush with the Gestapo in Germany, he moved to America in 1936. He went straight to Los Angeles and, as he later recalled, on his first day in town he bought a car, rented an apartment in Beverly Hills and joined the West Side Tennis Club. Because his reputation preceded him, he obtained commissions within a few days.
        He served in both World Wars, fighting with the Hungarian artillery at the Italian front in the first war, and enlisting in the United States Army and serving domestically in the second.
        Surviving are his wife of 44 years, the former Maxine Fife, a former movie actress; a son, Peter of Santa Monica; two brothers, Stephen of London, England, and Elemer of Toronto, and a grandson.
