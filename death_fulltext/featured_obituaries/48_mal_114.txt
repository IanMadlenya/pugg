        Dr. Stuart (Stubsy) Forster, the house physician at the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Second Stage Theater and a member of the staff at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, died Friday in his office on West End Avenue. He was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, said Richard Kornberg, a spokesman for the Shakespeare Festival.
        Dr. Forster specialized in internal medicine and treated primarily the aged and people with AIDS. Many of his patients were in the entertainment industry. He was also on the faculty of Columbia University's department of medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, Carole Rothman, artistic director of the Second Stage Theater; a son, Charles; a daughter, Molly; his parents, Arnold and Mae Forster of New Rochelle, and a sister, Janie Berman of Manhattan. Dr. Forster's father is general counsel of the Anti-Defamation League and is a partner in the law firm Shea & Gould.
