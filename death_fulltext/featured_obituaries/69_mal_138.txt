        David J. Bohm, an American-born physicist who taught at the University of London for 22 years, died Tuesday. He was 74 years old.
        A colleague, Basil Hiley, said Mr. Bohm died of a heart attack.
        Professor Bohm was the author of several books and articles for various scientific journals. Of a textbook he wrote in 1951, titled "Quantum Theory," N. David Mermin, a professor of physics at Cornell University, said yesterday: "There was a time when that was probably the best of the available textbooks about quantum mechanics, which lies at the heart of contemporary physics. It is the theory of matter at the atomic and subatomic levels, and it is notorious for being philosophically obscure."
        In 1951, Professor Bohm, who had been teaching at Princeton University, was acquitted of contempt charges as a result of his refusal to tell the House Un-American Activities Committee whether he had been a Communist. He had also refused to respond to questions about whether Communists had been active at the radiation laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked in World War II.
        Judge Alexander Holtzoff of Federal District Court ruled that Professor Bohm was within his constitutioal rights in pleading that his answers might expose him to prosecution.
        Professor Bohm retired in London in 1983. He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. and earned his doctorate at the University of California.
        After leaving Princeton in 1951, he taught in Brazil and Israel and in 1957 moved to Britain, where he was a research fellow at Bristol University and then joined the London faculty in 1961.
        He is survived by his wife of 36 years, the former Sarah Woolfson.
