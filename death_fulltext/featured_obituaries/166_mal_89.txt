        Alan S. Emory, one of the longest-serving journalists in Washington and correspondent for one of the smallest papers to maintain its own bureau there, died on Monday at his Falls Church, Va., home. He was 78.
        He was Washington correspondent of The Watertown Daily Times of Watertown, N.Y., from 1951 until his death.
        He had cancer, The Daily Times said.
        Mr. Emory covered 10 presidential administrations for his paper. He was a former president of the Society of Professional Journalists' Washington chapter and the Gridiron Club.
        Born in Manhattan, he received degrees from Harvard and Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism.
        He joined The Daily Times in 1947 as a reporter in Watertown and was its legislative correspondent in Albany before going to Washington.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Nancy Goodman; two sons, Marc, of Ratingen, Germany, and John, of McLean, Va.; a daughter, Katharine Emory of Arlington, Mass.; a brother, Eric, of Katonah, N.Y.; and several grandchildren.
