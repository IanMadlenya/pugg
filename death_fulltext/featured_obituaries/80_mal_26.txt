        William A. Raidy, a Broadway and Off-Broadway theater critic for the Newhouse News Service and The Star-Ledger, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said Fred Koven, a friend.
        Mr. Raidy, a Manhattan native, was educated at Georgetown University and the Sorbonne. He attended theater classes at the Yale University School of Dramatic Arts and earned a master's degree in fine arts at New York University.
        In the mid-1940's, he was hired as a feature writer for The Long Island Press, a defunct Newhouse paper. He became theater critic for the syndicate 20 years later and had been covering the New York stage since. He also wrote a weekly entertainment column.
        He is survived by his twin sister, Marijane Tinklepaugh of Queens.
