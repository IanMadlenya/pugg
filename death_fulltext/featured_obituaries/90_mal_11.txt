        Earle S. Draper, a top executive with the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930's, died on Friday at his home in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 100.
        He had been in declining health for a month, said his son Lieut. Col. Frederic F. Draper.
        Mr. Draper became the T.V.A.'s director of land planning and housing in 1933, soon after the authority, an independent government corporate agency, had been created by an act of Congress. The authority was intended to carry out regional planning and development in the Tennessee River basin, with an area of more than 40,000 square miles and a population, then, of about three million.
        From 1934 to 1940, Mr. Draper was the authority's director of regional planning studies, with broad responsibilities for planning. From 1940 through 1945, he was an assistant commissioner, Deputy Commissioner and Acting Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration.
        He later was a landscape architect and city planner.
        Mr. Draper was born in Falmouth, Mass., and received a bachelor's degree from Massachusetts State College in 1915.
        His first wife, the former Norma Farwell, died, as did his second wife, the former Elizabeth Jordan.
        In addition to Colonel Draper, of Vero Beach, Fla., Mr. Draper is survived by two other sons, Earle S. Jr., of Charlotte, N.C., and Charles A., of Superior, Mont.; 7 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
