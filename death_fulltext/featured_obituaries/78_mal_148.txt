        John Brooks, a longtime staff writer for The New Yorker whose best-selling books exposed the excesses of the business world, died yesterday at the Southampton Nursing Home in Southampton, L.I. He was 72 and lived in East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was complications of a stroke, said his wife, Barbara Mahoney Brooks.
        Mr. Brooks was known for his ability to give Wall Street trends, history and personalities a narrative flavor far beyond standard financial reportage. He wrote three novels, all published by Harper: "The Big Wheel" (1949) about a news magazine resembling Time; "A Pride of Lions" (1954), and "The Man Who Broke Things" (1958). He was also the author of 10 nonfiction books on business and finance, including "Once in Golconda: A True Drama of Wall Street, 1920-1938" (Harper, 1969); "The Go-Go Years" (Weybright, 1973), a history of the speculative 1960's on Wall Street, and "The Takeover Game" (Dutton, 1987), about the epidemic of mergers in the 1980's. A collection of his work, "Business Adventures" (Weybright, 1969), included his most famous New Yorker article, "The Fate of the Edsel." Advocate for Authors' Rights
        Mr. Brooks contributed his special knowledge of business and interest in authors' rights to organizations of professional writers. He was president of the Authors Guild from 1975 to 1979, and with John Hersey he was instrumental in creating a recommended book contract for authors. He served as vice president of PEN from 1962 to 1966, was vice president of the Society of American Historians in 1984, and was a trustee of the New York Public Library from 1978 to 1994.
        He was born in New York City on Dec. 5, 1920, grew up in Trenton and graduated from Princeton University in 1942. During World War II, he was a communications and radar officer in the Air Force from 1942 to 1945. He was aboard the First Army headquarters ship on D-Day during the invasion of Normandy in 1944.
        After World War II, Mr. Brooks became a contributing editor at Time magazine, where he remained for two years. In 1949, he joined The New Yorker as a staff writer, and later he said this was the lucky break that made his career. While contributing articles and Talk of the Town pieces to the magazine, he also wrote book reviews for Harper's magazine and The New York Times Book Review.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Carolyn, of Los Angeles; a son, and John Alexander, of Williamstown, Mass.; three stepsons, Dennis and Nicholas Mahoney of New York City and Seamus Mahoney of St. Paul; two sisters, Elizabeth Berg of West Falmouth, Mass., and Gertrude Lushington of Greenwich, Conn., and three grandchildren.
