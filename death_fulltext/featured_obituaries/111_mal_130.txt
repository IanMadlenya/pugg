        Joseph Judge, a writer and editor who spent 25 years at National Geographic magazine, died on April 20 at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He retired in 1990 as the senior associate editor of the monthly, which began publication in 1888. His articles brought to American coffee tables such far-flung subjects as Alaska, Ireland, Jerusalem, Hong Kong, the Zulu of South Africa and a replay of the first trek across Australia in 1859.
        He was the author of "Season of Fire: The Confederate Strike on Washington" (Rockbridge, 1994), about the exploits of Gen. Jubal A. Early, who twice led his troops to the capital gates in 1864.
        Mr. Judge is survived by his wife, Phyllis Mitchell Judge; three sons, Joseph M. of Virginia Beach, Va., Michael, of Washington, and Mark, of Potomac; a daughter, Alyson Frederick of Silver Spring, Md.; two sisters, Anita Judge of Washington and Dorothy McDonough of Potomac; a brother, John, of Rockville, Md., and two grandchildren.
