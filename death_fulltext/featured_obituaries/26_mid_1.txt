        Mrs. Wilentz's illness drew public attention in 1986 during the renomination of her husband, Robert N. Wilentz, as Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. He was criticized for living in Manhattan, where he said his wife was receiving cancer treatment, rather than in New Jersey. Amid much debate, his renomination was narrowly confirmed.
        Mrs. Wilentz had painted since 1971 and had exhibited her work in New York City, Philadelphia and Southampton, L.I.
        Mrs. Wilentz was born in Manhattan and graduated from Vassar College. She was a former president of the Council of P.T.A.'s in Perth Amboy, N.J.
        Surviving are her husband; a daughter, Amy, and two sons, James and Thomas, all of Manhattan, and a sister, Emily Scheuer, of Washington and Manhattan.
