        Mr. Topolski came to London in 1935 as a correspondent for a Polish satirical newspaper to cover the jubilee celebrations of King George V. He stayed and later became an official War Artist for the Government during World War II, painting the Battle of Britain and other wartime scenes.
        His other works included a 100-foot-long painting of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II for Buckingham Palace and a 60-by-20 foot painting titled ''Cavalcade of the Commonwealth'' for the 1951 Festival of Britain.
        Mr. Topolski's paintings, water colors and drawings are in the British Museum, the Tate Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Imperial War Museum and museums in New York, Toronto, Tel Aviv, Melbourne and Warsaw. He also designed theater sets and costumes and published an annual pictorial journal called ''Chronicle'' for 26 years.
        Born in Warsaw on Aug. 14, 1907, Mr. Topolski was educated at the Mikolaj Rey School and the Academy of Art in Warsaw. He was a member of the Royal Academy.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Caryl J. Stanley, a son and a daughter.
