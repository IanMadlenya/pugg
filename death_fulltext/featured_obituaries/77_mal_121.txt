        H. Huber Boscowitz, a retired packaging-industry executive and former champion bridge player, died on Monday at his Manhattan home. He was 91.
        He died after a brief illness, said Julia Meade, a friend.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Boscowitz graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and Columbia University. He spent his business career with F.N. Burt Company, a Buffalo-based maker of folding cartons, boxes and other paper products. He was in charge of its metropolitan regional office in midtown Manhattan until his retirement 16 years ago.
        During the 1920's and early 1930's he played on the winning side of many national bridge tournaments. In recent years, he and his wife, Lillian Emerson Boscowitz, were active in charitable causes. Among other things, they raised more than $1 million for George Junior Republic, an institution for problem teen-agers in Freeville, N.Y.
        Mrs. Boscowitz died in 1985.
