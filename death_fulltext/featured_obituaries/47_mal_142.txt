        Morton Eisen, a shoe importer who touched off a court battle in the 1970's over payment of costs in class-action lawsuits, died on Sunday at the Hospice by the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 75 years old and lived in Delray Beach, Fla., and in Bayside, Queens.
        He died of complications from lung cancer, his family said.
        In 1971 Mr. Eisen sued the New York Stock Exchange and two member firms, contending that investors who bought "odd lots" of fewer than 100 shares of a stock were unfairly charged higher brokerage fees than buyers of larger blocks.
        In one phase of the complex suit he won a Federal District Court ruling that the exchange and the member firms had to pay 90 percent of the cost of public notices inviting other investors to join the lawsuit. The case went twice to the United States Supreme Court before an appeals court nullified the lower-court ruling and directed plaintiffs seeking to recover damages for a class of investors to bear the cost of notifying the other investors.

        Lawyers said the decision inhibited class-action suits where money damages are sought -- which made up a third of the class-action suits in Federal Court at the time, as opposed to political and civil-rights suits that simply seek to compel a course of action.
        Mr. Eisen, who was born in Baltimore, left school in the Depression to work in New York's garment district. He joined the merchant marine in 1940 and emerged a lieutenant commander at the end of World War II. He entered the shoe business in the late 1940's and owned several retail outlets in the Bronx before he retired in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Victoria Goldstein; three sons, Michael Rubenstein of Tampa, Fla., Eric, of Washington and Mark, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a daughter, Debra, of Anchorage, and six grandchildren.
