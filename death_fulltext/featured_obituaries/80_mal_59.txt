        Leon A. Katz, who represented the Flatbush, Marine Park and Sheepshead Bay sections of Brooklyn in the City Council from 1969 to 1982, died on Monday in Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. He was 62 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Katz, a Democrat, was a strong opponent of rent control. After his district was realigned in 1983, he was defeated for renomination by Councilman Noach Dear.
        A lawyer and a real-estate owner and investor, he was the first president of the Community Housing Improvement Program, an organization of 2,500 property owners in the city. He was also a member of the Rent Stabilization Association.
        He is survived by a daughter, Susan Katz Schulman of Roslyn, L.I.; two sons, Ronald of Searington, L.I., and David of Roslyn; a brother, Sheldon of Scottsdale, Ariz., and four grandchildren.
