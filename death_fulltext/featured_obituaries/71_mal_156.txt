        Demitri Boris Shimkin, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, died Tuesday at the Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana. He was 76.
        Professor Shimkin died of complications from cancer, Mary Creswell, a university spokeswoman, said.
        Mr. Shimkin, who was also a professor of public health at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, was known for his research on the anthropology and ethnology of peoples in the Soviet Union, the Arctic, East Africa, and, in the United States, of the Shoshone Indians and black people. He also wrote widely about issues of military intelligence, human ecology and public health.
        Professor Shimkin was born on July 4, 1916, in Omsk, Siberia. He emigrated with his family shortly after the Russian Revolution, first to Indonesia, then to Holland, and finally to the United States. He earned bachelor's and doctoral degrees in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley in the 1930's.
        Professor Shimkin served in the military intelligence division of the United States Army in Washington and Europe during World War II. He joined the faculty at Illinois in 1960 and retired officially in 1985, but continued on active duty there until earlier this month.
        Professor Shimkin's first wife, the former Edith Manning, and a son, Alexander, died.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Tauby Heller; a daughter, Eleanor Shimkin-Sorock, of Framingham, Mass.; a stepdaughter, Rae Spooner, of Urbana; two stepsons, Joel Weichsel of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Jeremy Weichsel of Montreal, and four grandchildren.
