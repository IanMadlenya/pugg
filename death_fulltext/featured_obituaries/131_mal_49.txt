        Samuel Grafton, a liberal voice in American journalism from the 1940's into the 1960's, died on Dec. 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.
        Mr. Grafton, who continued to contribute to national magazines into the 1980's, became widely known through his syndicated column, ''I'd Rather Be Right.'' Appearing in as many as 120 newspapers nationwide, it ran from 1939 to 1948 and supported the New Deal, the Spanish Republic and Gen. Charles de Gaulle's Free French, among other things.
        Born in Brooklyn and raised in Philadelphia, Mr. Grafton started writing for The New Republic as a teen-ager. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1929 and that year won a national essay contest and, with it, a reporting job on The Philadelphia Record. He moved to New York in 1932 and became editor of The New York Post's editorial page.
        Mr. Grafton also wrote magazine articles, short stories and television plays. He occasionally appeared on ''The World at 10'' on Channel 13.
        In recognition of his stand against Vichy France and his support of the Free French, President de Gaulle awarded him the Legion of Honor.
        Mr. Grafton is survived by his wife, Edith; a daughter, Abigail, of Berkeley, Calif.; two sons, John and Anthony, both of Princeton, N.J.; a sister, Mildred Lipshutz of Philadelphia, and two grandchildren.
