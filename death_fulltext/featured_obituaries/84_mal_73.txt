        Dr. Irving Berchuck, a former official with the New York City Board of Education, died Monday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Ivy Berchuck.
        Dr. Berchuck joined the school system as a teacher in 1948, became a junior high school principal and in 1970 was appointed superintendent of Community School District 24, which consists of the Maspeth and Middle Village sections of Queens.
        He continued in that position until 1976, then after a period of service as assistant to the deputy chancellor, Dr. Berchuck served as head of the board's Education Facilities, Planning and Design Department. He retired in 1982.
        He later was a financial analyst with Irwin E. Bloom & Company, an accounting firm in Manhattan. He received a doctorate in education from New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, and two sons, Andrew, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Matthew, of Birmingham, Ala.
