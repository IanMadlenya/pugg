        Carl Weinrich, an organist and professor emeritus of music at Princeton University, died on Monday at the Medical Center at Princeton, N.J. He was 86 years old and lived in Princeton.
        He had Parkinson's disease and had broken his hip, a Princeton spokesman said.
        He was known for his recitals and recordings of Bach, and he was a leader in a revival of Baroque organ music in the United States in the 1930's.
        He was also interested in contemporary music. He performed new organ works and edited Schoenberg's "Variations on a Recitative" (Op. 40).
        He was the director of music at the University Chapel at Princeton from 1943 to 1973 and taught organ at Princeton, Wellesley College, Vassar College and Columbia University.
        He was born in Paterson, N.J., and graduated from New York University and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Annette Stewart Broderick; two daughters, Elise Friedley of Sylmar, Calif., and Cynthia, of New York City; two stepdaughters, Diane Hamilton of Ashland, Ore., and Linda Miller of Hopewell, N.J., and a brother, Albert, of Chapel Hill, N.C.
        A memorial service is to be held at 3 P.M. Friday in the Princeton University Chapel.
