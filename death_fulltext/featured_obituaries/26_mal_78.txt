        Mr. Cofacci began his career as an architect but with the encouragement of a friend, the late James Beard, he switched to a culinary career in 1972. Mr. Cofacci studied pastry-making in Paris and returned to the United States, where he created elaborate pastries for a number of New York restaurants.
        He was co-author of two books, ''How to Eat (And Drink) Your Way Through a French (or Italian) Menu,'' with Mr. Beard, and ''Desserts With Spirit,'' with Robert Carmack, published in 1971. He retired in 1986.
        He is survived by a sister, Elena, of Rome.
