        Mary Drayton, a playwright whose work appeared on Broadway, died on Friday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla., where she lived. She was 89.
        The cause was a blood clot in her lung, said her daughter, Kristin Helmore.
        Ms. Drayton was born in Hope, Ark., on Feb. 27, 1905. She turned to writing after an automobile accident in the 1940's cut short her career as an actress. Her plays included two that were performed on Broadway: "Debut" (1956) and "The Playroom" (1965). She also wrote the plays "Salt of the Earth," "Build Me a Bridge" and "Ducks in a Row," and a novel, "All Our Secrets."
        In addition to her daughter, of Clinton, Conn., she is survived by her husband, Tom Helmore.
