        George Oliver, a leading professional polo player from the 1930's to the 1960's, died yesterday at his home in Sparta, N.C. He was 83.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, the family said.
        Mr. Oliver, who was born in Yonkers, grew up on a ranch in Salmon, Idaho, where his father raised horses for the New York City police mounted unit.
        After taking up polo at the age of 23, Mr. Oliver quickly became one of the leading players on the high-goal polo circuit and eventually proved one of the most durable, maintaining a nine-goal handicap until he was in his 50's.
        Mr. Oliver, who lived in Delray Beach, Fla., during his playing days, played for several teams.
        He was a paratrooper during World War II and was awarded two Silver Stars and a Purple Heart during combat in the Philippines. After his retirement he became a rancher in Florida and North Carolina.
        He is survived by his wife, Ferne; two daughters from previous marriages, Karel Mattison of New Canaan, Conn., and Mimi Gracida of Wellington, Fla., and five grandchildren.
