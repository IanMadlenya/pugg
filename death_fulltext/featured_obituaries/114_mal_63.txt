        Dr. Allen H. Postel, a surgeon who was one of the first doctors to treat shock by lowering the body temperature of the patient, died on Sunday at his home in Katonah, N.Y. He was 70.
        The cause was mesothelioma, a cancer of the chest cavity, the family said.
        Dr. Postel, who also had a home in Manhattan, devoted most of his practice in recent years to treating breast cancer and melanoma. He was an associate professor of clinical surgery at New York University School of Medicine, where he was also an attending surgeon, and was medical director and director of surgery at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island.
        Dr. Postel was an attending surgeon at Bellevue Hospital Center. For about 20 years, he was chief of the tumor section at the New York State Division of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Manhattan.
        Dr. Postel was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois College of Medicine. As an Air Force officer in the early 1950's, he was assistant chief of surgical service at Mitchel Field on Long Island.
        In the mid-1950's, Dr. Postel was one of the first doctors to treat patients  in shock by lowering their temperatures, thus slowing their heartbeats and greatly increasing the chance of arresting the shock progress. The treatment is  a standard one today.
        Dr. Postel belonged to Alpha Omega Alpha, a medical honor society. For many years, he was medical director of the New York County Health Services Review Organization, part of a national network of panels authorized by the Federal Government to try to hold down Medicare and Medicaid costs.
        He is survived by his wife, Diana; a son, Steven, of Manhattan; a daughter, Suzan, of Manhattan, and a brother, Sholem, who lives in Arizona.
