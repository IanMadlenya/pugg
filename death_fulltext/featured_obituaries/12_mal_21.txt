        Henrique de Souza Filho, a prominent Brazilian cartoonist better known locally as Henfil, died here from pneumonia and other AIDS-related complications Monday. He was 43 years old.
        Mr. Souza's case gained attention here because he and his two brothers, Heberto and Francisco, contracted AIDS after transfusions of blood contaminated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. The brothers are hemophiliacs.
        Mr. Souza's brother Heberto was the first Brazilian to admit publicly that he had contracted AIDS. He later led a movement to put pressure on the Health Ministry to require screening of blood supplies used by the country's hospitals and clinics.
        Henfil published his cartoons in the Rio de Janeiro daily, O Globo, and other publications, He recently made his first movie, ''Tanga - It Was in The New York Times,'' a political comedy about a Latin American dictator who banned all newspapers except one copy of The New York Times, which only he was allowed to read.
