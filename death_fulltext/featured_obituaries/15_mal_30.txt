        Dr. Bromberg started training in his native Vienna before coming to this country, where he received his M.D. degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1937. He served as a Navy psychiatrist in World War II and practiced psychoanalysis in Manhattan, moving his practice to Tarrytown about 30 years ago.
        He helped found the Tappan Zee Mental Health Clinic, now a part of Phelps Memorial, serving as chief psychiatrist from 1955 to 1959 and again from 1969 to 1971.
        Dr. Bromberg joined the faculty of Albert Einstein in 1955.
        Dr. Bromberg is survived by his wife, the former May Vladeck; two sons, Charney, of Tarrytown, and David, of Chicago; a daughter, Sarina Bromberg of Middletown, Conn.; a sister, Freda Zimmerman of Brooklyn, and six grandchildren.
