        Carlos Clarens, a movie historian, died of a heart attack Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 56 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Clarens was born in Havana and was a graduate of the architectural school of the University of Havana. Soon after graduation he went to Paris to study architecture and languages, but his enthusiasm for film making overcame his interest in architecture. He became a production assistant to the French directors Jacques Demy and Robert Bresson.
        He came to New York in 1956. His large collection of still photographs from movies became the basis of a rental business, Phototeque, which he ran at the time of his death with his partner, Howard Mandelbaum.
        Mr. Clarens was the author of ''An Illustrated History of the Horror Film,'' and ''Crime Movies.'' Fluent in several lanaguages, he wrote English subtitles for foreign-language films, including those for the 1982 film version of ''La Traviata,'' directed by Franco Zeffirelli.
        He is survived by two brothers, Fernando Figueredo of Miami, and Angel Figueredo of Englewood, N.J.
