        Milton Pitts, the barber who prompted President Richard M. Nixon to set up a White House barbershop and who cut the hair of three other Republican presidents as well as other celebrities, died on Sunday at Georgetown University Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Barbara.
        Mr. Pitts was first asked to cut President Nixon's hair in 1970. Mr. Nixon was so pleased that he installed a tiny barbershop in the basement below the Oval Office. Mr. Pitts worked there twice a month. That routine continued with President Gerald R. Ford and resumed with Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
        Her father's personal politics were as "Republican as they come," Ms. Pitts said. But at least one prominent Democrat, former Senator George McGovern, was a regular at the Pitts Hairstylist shop in the Sheraton Carlton, a downtown hotel. In fact, Mr. Pitts and Mr. McGovern once did a television commercial for Bic razors.
        Mr. Pitts was repeatedly asked whether Mr. Reagan colored his hair. "Absolutely not," the normally garrulous barber would invariably reply, even to family members.
        Mr. Pitts was born July 4, 1912, in Greenville, S.C. He moved to Washington in the 1930's.
        In addition to his daughter, of Bethesda, Mr. Pitts is survived by his wife, Izetta; a son, Bob Elliot, a radio personality in Atlanta; two sons by a previous marriage, James, of Travelers Rest, S.C., and Don, of San Mateo, Calif., and five grandchildren.
