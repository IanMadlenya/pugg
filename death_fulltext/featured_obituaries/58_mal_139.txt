        Dr. Morris M. Goldberg, the rabbi of Congregation Ezrath Israel in the theater district in Manhattan, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        A graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, he was ordained in 1927. His first assignment was as a student rabbi at the Temple Israel in Long Beach, L.I., where he became involved in community relations and raised money for the Palestine Emergency Campaign, a predecessor of the United Jewish Appeal. In 1929, he secured a contribution that helped set up a second synagogue in Long Beach, Temple Beth El.
        From 1935 until 1960, he was assigned to the Congregation Sharare Zedek in Manhattan, and from 1960 to 1974, to the Hewlett-East Rockaway Jewish Center on Long Island. He organized an interfaith group for East Rockaway, Lynbrook and Malverne and was the chaplain of the police and fire departments there.
        He earned a law degree from the New York University Law School in 1933 and a doctor of divinity in 1966.
        He was a founder of the Commission on Synagogue Relations and a member of the New York Board of Rabbis for more than 50 years. He served at various times as the board's secretary, treasurer and vice president, and was president of the board from 1951 to 1953. He received the board's lifetime achievement award in 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; a son, Perry Morrison, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Sandra Wolfer, of Long Beach, L.I.; four grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
