        Robert H. McClure, a salesman and tennis enthusiast who late in his life founded the Prince Manufacturing Company, died on Nov. 21. He was 98 years old and lived in Potomac, Md.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, his son, Donald, said.
        Mr. McClure, who was born and raised in New York City, graduated from Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., and spent most of his career as a salesman of furniture, building materials and other industrial products.
        In 1968, when he was 75, he and a tennis partner, Jerry Sweeton, built a tennis ball-throwing machine that became the cornerstone of the Prince Manufacturing Company, named after Princeton, N.J., where he lived.
        Mr. McClure retired in 1974 and turned the company over to Howard Head who expanded it and developed the Prince tennis rackets.
        Besides his son, Donald of Princeton, Mr. McClure is survived by his wife, Helen, who lives in Manor Care Nursing Center in Potomac; two other sons, Alan of Houston and Richard of Columbia, Md.; a brother, Sam, of Palm Coast, Fla.; 13 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.
