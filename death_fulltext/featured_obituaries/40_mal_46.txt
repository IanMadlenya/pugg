        Lionel Lambert, a clothing designer known professionally as Tony Lambert, died of complications from AIDS on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 47 years old. Mr. Lambert was born in Woonsocket, R.I., and began his fashion career as director of merchandising and design at Beaunit Textiles in New York City. In 1977, he formed Anton Knits, an independent production house, to manufacture knitwear for Seventh Avenue houses. Two years later he founded T/J Knit Enterprises to produce his own designs, which featured graphic sweaters in cotton, silk and linen.
        In the last four years, Mr. Lambert expanded his lines to include sportswear separates for men and women. He received the 1988 Cutty Sark Award for outstanding men's sportswear design.
        He is survived by two brothers, Donald and Ronald, and a sister, Jane Sullivan.
        His longtime companion is Jack Devine.
