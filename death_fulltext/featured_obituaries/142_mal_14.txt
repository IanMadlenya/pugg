        Bernard James Dwyer, a former Representative from New Jersey, died Saturday in Edison, N.J., at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center, which he had served as a trustee. He was 77 and, a longtime Edison resident, had lived in Metuchen, N.J., for the last few years.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Dwyer, a Democrat, spent six terms in the House of Representatives, from 1981 until his retirement in 1993. He rarely spoke from the floor but was known as a legislative tactician whose work behind the scenes on the powerful Appropriations Committee substantially benefited his state and its institutions, like Rutgers University.
        Mr. Dwyer relinquished his position as Senate majority leader in Trenton to move up to the House. His experience in the State Legislature as chairman of its Joint Appropriations Committee gained him a place on the same panel in Washington, a rare distinction for a Congressional freshman. He remained at Appropriations until he left Congress.
        In 1976, he was the New Jersey campaign chairman for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign.
        Mr. Dwyer is survived by a daughter, Pamela D. Stockton of Harrison, N.Y.; a sister, Bernice Dwyer of Edison, and two grandchildren. His wife, Lilyan Sudzina Dwyer, died in 1993.
