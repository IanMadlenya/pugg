        Alfred Sauvy, a sociologist who studied the effects of population trends, from the crisis of developing countries to the baby boom in France, died Tuesday in a Paris hospital, the National Institute of Demographic Studies said. He was 92 years old.
        He was pessimistic about the world's population explosion, suggesting in his 1961 book "Fertility and Survival" that the apocalypse would be averted only by a huge increase in global production of food and other necessities or by a big reduction in the birth rate.
        Mr. Sauvy predicted the 1968 student riots in Paris in his book "The Rise of Youth," published in 1959.
        He founded the National Institute of Demographic Studies and was its director from 1945-62. He was the first director of the United Nations Population Commission.
