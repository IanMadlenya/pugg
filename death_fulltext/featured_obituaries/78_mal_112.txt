        Kirtilal M. Mehta, who worked in the gem industry for nearly 75 years and built an international wholesale diamond business, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Antwerp, Belgium. He was 86 and lived in Antwerp and Tel Aviv.
        He had a long illness, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Mehta ranked as India's largest diamond dealer, his company said. His business was the cutting, polishing and trading of diamonds. He expanded his operations into foreign diamond centers and also dealt in colored gems.
        His career began at age 12, when he dropped out of school upon his father's death to begin working in the branch of the family's gem business that was in Burma (now Myanmar). Seven years later he became the head of its Bombay, India, branch.
        In 1944 he founded his own company, now known as Beautiful Diamonds, in Bombay. In 1953 he opened his Gembel company in Antwerp, followed in 1956 by a Gembel branch in Hong Kong, in 1968 by a Gembel center in Tel Aviv and in 1973 by Occidental Gems in Manhattan.
        His first wife, Lilavati, is deceased. He is survived by his wife, Esther; four sons, Kishore of Bombay and Vijay, Prabodh and Rashmi, all of Antwerp; three daughters, Anila Kothariof Hong Kong, Rekha of India and Lisa Mehta of Antwerp and Manhattan; and many grandchildren and great grandchildren.
