        Peter B. Flint, a former reporter for The New York Times who specialized in obituaries of film and theater figures, died on Thursday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. Mr. Flint, who lived in Glen Ridge, N.J., was 67.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Marianne.
        Mr. Flint wrote obituaries of Ginger Rogers, Irving (Swifty) Lazar, Lawrence Welk and Frank Capra. He recalled Lana Turner's first role, in "They Won't Forget": "Wearing a skintight sweater and skirt," he wrote, "she sauntered along a street, spoke not one line, was murdered in the first reel and began a quick climb to stardom."
        On the death of Federico Fellini, he recounted his "personal vision of society and his preoccupation with the relationship between men and women and between sex."
        Mr. Flint had a reputation among colleagues as having a virtual encyclopedic  knowledge of movies produced since the early 1930's. Without consulting a reference book, he could summarize the plots of thousands of movies and identify most of their casts, directors, producers and cinematographers. He retired in 1991.
        Mr. Flint, who grew up in Yonkers and the Bronx, graduated in 1950 from Haverford (Pa.) College with a degree in political science.
        He joined The Times in 1952 as a clerk in the reference library and eventually became a reporter, covering metropolitan news and then writing obituaries.
        He is survived by his wife.
        Correction:  November 16, 1995, Thursday
        An obituary on Saturday about Peter B. Flint, a reporter for The New York Times, referred incorrectly to the first film role of Lana Turner, whose obituary he wrote. She did speak a few lines in the film "They Won't Forget."
