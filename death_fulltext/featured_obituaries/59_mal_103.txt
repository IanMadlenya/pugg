        William H. Wolff, a Madison Avenue dealer in Asian art for more than 30 years, died on Monday at his apartment in New York City. He was 85 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his secretary and longtime friend, Ann Gray.
        Mr. Wolff, a collector turned dealer, sold Asian bronzes, antiquities and wood and stone sculpture at several galleries from 1959 to his retirement last year. He sold to many prominent collectors, including John D. Rockefeller 3d, Norton Simon, Avery Brundage, Christian Humanns and Arthur Sackler, and to museums with major holdings in Asian art: the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the Musee Guimet in Paris and the Victoria and Albert and the British Museum in London.
        Mr. Wolff, who was born in Brussels and educated in Mannheim, Germany, was a buyer for a feather importer when he came to the United States in 1936. On trips to China in the 1930's to acquire feathers, Mr. Wolff began buying archaic bronzes and Asian sculpture.
        Mr. Wolff's wife, the former Susanne Koschinsky, died in 1972.
        He is survived by a stepson, Klaus Winter of New York City, and a sister, Marianne Weil of San Francisco.
