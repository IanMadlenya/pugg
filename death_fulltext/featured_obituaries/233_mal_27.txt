        Kemoko Sano, the choreographer and director who founded Les Merveilles de Guinée, an African dance and music troupe, died on May 25 in Conakry, Republic of Guinea. Mr. Sano was unsure of his birth date and is believed to have been in his mid-70's.
        The cause was complications of diabetes, said Louise Bedichek, a friend.
        Born in a village near Macenta, in the Forest Region of Guinea, Mr. Sano became a leading figure in the country's performing arts in the decades after Guinean independence in 1958, when traditional arts were revived and initially supported by the government. He performed with Les Ballets Africains and later with Ballet Djoliba through 1986 and was a resident choreographer at Les Ballets Africains from 1987 to 2000.
        In 1986 Mr. Sano founded Les Merveilles, which toured the world, appearing in New York City several times. He taught music and dance as a Fulbright artist-in-residence at San Francisco State University in 1994 and at Long Island University/C. W. Post and the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 2000 and 2001.
        Over the last year, Mr. Sano collaborated with the choreographer Hamidou Bangoura on the creation of an evening-length work, ''Mémoire du Mandingue,'' for Les Ballets Africains.
        Correction:  June 20, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on June 10 about Kemoko Sano, a choreographer and director, misstated his estimated age. Mr. Sano, who was not sure of his birth date, was believed to have been in his mid-60's, not his mid-70's.
