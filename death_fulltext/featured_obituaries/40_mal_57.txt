        Dr. H. Harris Funkenstein, a neurologist and a specialist in Alzheimer's disease, drowned while swimming off Miami Beach on Friday. He was 50 years old and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        Dr. Funkenstein, who was on the staff of Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston and taught at Harvard Medical School, was attending a professional conference in Miami Beach.
        He was a principal investigator in the five-year East Boston Study on Aging, which was completed last summer and produced the finding that Alzheimer's disease was considerably more prevalent than had previously been thought.
        He also took part in the recent Harvard Medical School study that recommended reorienting the education of doctors from rote learning to more concern for patients' overall needs.
        A native of Jacksonville, Fla., Dr. Funkenstein received his medical degree from Harvard and a master's in physiology from Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar.
        Besides his duties at Brigham & Women's Hospital, he was director of the Learning Disabilities Clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston. He was the author of numerous papers in professional journals, many of them on language and cognition.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Karen Danziger; a daughter, Amy; a brother, Dr. Daniel Funkenstein Jr. of La Jolla, Calif., and his parents, Dr. Daniel Funkenstein Sr. and Hannah Bessie Funkenstein of Jamaica Plain, Mass.
