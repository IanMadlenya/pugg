        J. Garvin Mecking, a New York antiques dealer for 30 years, died Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan after suffering a stroke five days earlier. He was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Mecking's shop at 72 East 11th Street attracted customers well versed in the field, including Mario Buatta, Mark Hampton, Bill Blass and Arthur Hadley, a partner in Parish Hadley.
        Debonair, with white hair, Mr. Mecking had an unerring sense of style and was known for his ability to mingle easily with the well-to-do and meet their needs without intruding on their social lives. He had an eye for antiques that never missed, said Betsey Whitney, a longtime customer and friend.
        Mr. Blass, the fashion designer, used to keep careful tabs on Mr. Mecking's shipments from abroad. When a new one arrived, he would get there before the doors opened to be first in line, Mr. Blass recalled yesterday.
        Mr. Mecking was born in Long Beach, L.I. He attended St. John's College and the Traphagen School of Fashion Design before graduating from the Parsons School of Design in 1953. He later received a bachelor's degree in education from New York University.
        Early in his career he worked as an assistant to Paul Vogler, head of display at Lord & Taylor, and through recommendations from Mr. Vogler and Dorothy Shaver, then president of the store, he was selected to coordinate world trade fairs abroad for the United States Government. After several years of traveling in that capacity, he went into business for himself in 1959.
        He is survived by two sisters, Patricia A. Liptrot of Montville, N.J., and Judith A. Fontanelli of Florence, Italy.
