        Bernard D. Fischman, a lawyer and civil liberties advocate, died on July 11 at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan.
        A commercial litigator and a corporate lawyer, he also worked without charge as a civil liberties lawyer.
        Mr. Fischman was of counsel to the Manhattan-based law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, L.L.P. from 1994 to his death. Before his association with that firm, he spent 44 years with Shea & Gould, also in Manhattan, and other firms.
        As a longtime board member of the New York Civil Liberties Union, he represented plaintiffs in test cases involving the protection of the legal rights of the mentally disabled. He also served on the New York State Advisory Committee on Recodification of the Mental Hygiene Law.
        From 1987 to his death he was a trustee and the secretary of the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity, which works to remind people of the horrors of the Holocaust and to prevent its recurrence.
        Most recently Mr. Fischman was a leader in the effort to obtain a pardon for Jonathan Pollard, an American who was convicted of spying for Israel.
        Much of Mr. Fischman's legal practice involved public utility matters, notably representation of the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and other utilities in condemnation cases.
        A native New Yorker, he received his law degree at New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, Hilda; a daughter, Judith Johnson; and a son, Robert, all of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.
