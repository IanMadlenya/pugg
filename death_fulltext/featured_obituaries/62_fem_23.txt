        Catherine Wolkonsky, a French and Russian teacher for 50 years and founding chairman of the Slavic Department at the State University of New York at Albany, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 96 years old and lived in Spring Valley, N.Y.
        She died after a brief illness, her family said.
        Born into a landowning family in St. Petersburg, she came to the United States in 1924. She taught French in Cooperstown, N.Y., until World War II, when Cornell University started training Army officers in Russian. She became the only woman on the faculty then. She was chairman and professor of Russian at Vassar College from 1946 to 1961, after which she led the Slavic Department at SUNY, Albany, until 1972.
        Mrs. Wolkonsky continued to teach at the Russian Summer School at Norwich University in Northfield, Vt., until 1985, when she was 90 years old.
        She is survived by her daughter, Maria Marr, of Spring Valley, two grandchildren and a great-grandson.
