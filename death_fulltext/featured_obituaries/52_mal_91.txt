        Philip Spiewak, a manufacturer of clothing for men and boys, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 95 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his son Gerald.

        He is survived by his wife, Shirley; two sons, Robert, of Teaneck, N.J., and Gerald, of Valley Stream, L.I.; a daughter, Lenore Feldman of Lawrence, L.I.; 16 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren.
