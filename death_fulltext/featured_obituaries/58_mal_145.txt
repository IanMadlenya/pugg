        John Ogden Whedon, a writer for radio, television, theater and films, died on Friday at a nursing home in Medford, Ore. He was 86 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, said his daughter, Jill Whedon of Manhattan.
        Mr. Whedon was best known for his collaboration with Sam Moore on the 1940's radio show "The Great Gildersleeve." He also wrote scripts for such radio programs as "The Chase & Sanborn Hour," "Music in the Air" and "The Rudy Vallee Hour."
        A graduate of Harvard University, he was a managing editor at The New Yorker magazine in the early 1930's. His radio script writing led him to television, where his credits included "The Donna Reed Show," "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and "Leave It to Beaver." "A Night to Remember," a drama he wrote for "Kraft Television Theater," earned him an Emmy nomination.
        Mr. Whedon had several plays produced on Broadway, including "Life's Too Short" (1933) and "Texas Li'l Darlin' " (1950). His screen credits include "The Bears and I" and "Island at the Top of the World," both Disney films.
        Survivers in addition to his daughter are a son, Tom, of Pacific Palisades, Calif.; four stepchildren, a sister and a brother.
