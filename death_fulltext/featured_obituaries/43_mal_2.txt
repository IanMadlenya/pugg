        Charles M. Mapes, a communications consultant and retired engineer with A. T. & T., died on Friday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. He was 89 years old and lived in Suffern.
        He died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Mapes was president of Complan, a communications consulting firm he founded after retiring from A. T. & T. in 1966 as assistant chief engineer. He joined the utility after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1923. He helped supervise the work that led to the development of direct long-distance dialing and later helped with preparations for push-button dialing.
        He is survived by three daughters, Alexandra Shaw of Greenwich, Conn.; Judith Metz of Saddle River, N.J., and Mary Watson of Bronxville, N.Y., and 10 grandchildren.
