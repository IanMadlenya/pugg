        Howard Grad, a retired managing partner in the Grad Partnership, a New Jersey architectural firm, died on Sunday at his home in Verona, N.J. He was 79 years old and also kept a home in Monmouth, Me.
        He died of cancer after a long illness, his family said.
        A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Grad became a professional engineer in 1934.
        In 1945, he joined his brother, Bernard, and his father, Frank, in the Newark architectural firm (now known as Grad Associates) that his father had founded about 20 years earlier. Grad designed many New Jersey public buildings, including courthouses and college halls, as well as private office buildings.
        During the 1950's, Howard Grad was in charge of the company's projects for the North American Treaty Organization in France and Britain. For the last two years he worked as a consultant for the Grad firm, which is no longer family owned.
        Mr. Grad is survived by his second wife, the former Jane Goldberg; his daughters, Kathryn Balinkie and Ellen Gottlieb; his wife's children, Susan Goldberg, Cynthia Cooper and Eugene Cooper; his brother Bernard J., and eight grandchildren.
