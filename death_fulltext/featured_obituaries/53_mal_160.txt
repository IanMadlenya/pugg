        Lewis Sylvester May, a retired stockbroker, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90 years old.
        He died of heart failure, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. May was a partner in May, Borg & Company, one of the largest stock-specialist units of the American Stock Exchange. In the 1960's he was a member of a special committee that revamped the exchange's governing structure.
        Mr. May bought a seat on the New York Curb Exchange in 1927 and was chairman of the Curb Exchange Partners Association in the 1930's. In recent years, he had been a partner in the firm of John Jay Mann Jr. & Company.
        He is survived by his wife of 60 years, the former Marion Friedlander; a daughter, Patricia Schwartz of New Orleans; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
