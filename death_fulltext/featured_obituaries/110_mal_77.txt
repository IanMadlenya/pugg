        Charles William Tobias, an emeritus professor at the University of California at Berkeley who helped shape electrochemical engineering into a scientific discipline, died on March 3 at his home in Orinda, Calif. He was 75.
        The cause was emphysema, the university said.
        Dr. Tobias's field deals with the effect that electricity has on chemical reactions and with the electricity produced by such reactions. Its practical applications lie in batteries and electroplating, for example.
        By putting electrochemical engineering on a sound scientific footing, Dr. Tobias prepared the ground for long-lasting lithium batteries and batteries with greater storage capacities and higher energy concentrations.
        He investigated ozone production in electrochemical cells, the electrical deposition of alloys and metals, the electrochemical machining of hard alloys and the ways reactive metals are deposited in electrodes. As a teacher he trained many of the electrochemical engineers at work in the United States.
        A native of Budapest, Dr. Tobias received his chemical engineering diploma and Ph.D. there at the University of Technical Sciences. He left Hungary in 1947 when the country was taken over by the Communists and headed for Berkeley for postdoctoral studies.
        He became an instructor in the newly formed department of chemical engineering, advanced to full professor by 1960 and served as department chairman from 1967 to 1972. He retired in 1991.
        Dr. Tobias is survived by his wife, Katalin Voros, whom he married in 1982; a daughter, Carla Tobias of Fremont, Calif.; two sons, Anthony of Piedmont, Calif., and Eric of San Diego; a brother, Cornelius, of Eugene, Ore.; two stepdaughters, Eszti and Reka Pigniczky of Cleveland and Budapest, respectively, and two grandchildren. His first wife, Marcia Rous Tobias, died in 1981 after 31 years of marriage.
