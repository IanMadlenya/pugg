        Louis Weinstock, a New York labor union official in the 1930's and 40's who was also a leader of the Communist Party in the United States for more than half a century, died on Saturday at the Brookside Healthcare Center in Redlands, Calif. He was 91 and lived in Hemet, Calif.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Weinstock had been a member of the central board of the Communist Party of the United States, business manager of The Daily Worker and head of the painters' union in New York City.
        With 12 other Communists, Mr. Weinstock was imprisoned in 1955 for 27 months for his 1953 conviction of conspiring under the Smith Act to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States Government. The Smith Act was later repealed. In 1957, after completing his prison sentence, Mr. Weinstock received a hero's welcome at a Communist Party rally at Carnegie Hall.
        Despite his lifelong advocacy of Communist principles, Mr. Weinstock was warmly regarded by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who would often greet him with a friendly "Good morning, Louis," when following him around New York, his daughter, Susan Gould, said yesterday.
        Mr. Weinstock was also known among Communists as "Mr. May Day" because of his leadership in organizing the party's annual May Day parade.
        Mr. Weinstock is survived by his wife, Rose, and daughter Susan, both of Lake Arrowhead, Calif.; a son, John, of Goldens Bridge, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
