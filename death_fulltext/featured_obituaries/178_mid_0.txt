        Roberta Pryor, a literary agent who acquired the best-selling author Peter Benchley as a client when he was 16 and was still his agent two decades later, when he became famous as the author of ''Jaws,'' died on Monday in a hospital in Brooklyn. She was 77 and lived in Brooklyn.
        She had Alzheimer's disease, said Jed Mattes, a friend.
        The clients of Ms. Pryor, who retired in 1997, also included David Halberstam; Roger Caras, the nature writer; and Cecelia Holland, the historical novelist. She was also the United States agent of P. D. James, the British mystery writer.
        Mr. Benchley recalled that Ms. Pryor took him on at such a young age because his father, Nathaniel Benchley, was a client of the agency she worked for. It later evolved into International Creative Management.
        ''She shepherded me through the fish book,'' Mr. Benchley said, referring to ''Jaws.'' Shortly before it was published in 1974, Publishers Weekly reported that more than $1 million in subsidiary rights to the book had already been sold.
        Born Roberta Baughman in Claremont, Calif., Ms. Pryor graduated from Pomona College and became a Manhattan-based agent in 1963. After more than two decades of agency employment, she left to work independently until her retirement.
        Her marriages to Robert Smith and Hugh Pryor ended in divorce.
        She is survived by a stepson, David Pryor, of Queens.
