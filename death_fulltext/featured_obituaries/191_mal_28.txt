        David E. Davis, a sculptor and advocate of the visual arts who created numerous large-scale public works in Cleveland and elsewhere, died Nov. 13 in Cleveland. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Davis was born in Romania in 1920 and immigrated to Ohio in 1934. He studied art at the Cleveland School of Art (now the Cleveland Institute of Art) and, after service in World War II, studied at L'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and later earned a Master of Fine Arts at Case Western Reserve University. He worked as a designer until 1967, when he turned to sculpture full time, having his first show at the Akron Art Museum in 1972.
        In 1989 he and his wife, Bernice, founded the Sculpture Center in Cleveland for the support of emerging artists, and in 1997 he founded the Artists Archives of the Western Reserve to document the work of regional artists.
        His work is in the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum in New York and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother and sister, Herschel Davidovits and Rose Bensinger, both of Cleveland; his son, Jed, of Seattle; his daughter, Tina Davis Snyder of Jerusalem; and five grandchildren.
