        The Rev. William Holmes Borders Sr., a civil rights leader in Atlanta and the pastor emeritus of the Wheat Street Baptist Church there, died on Tuesday at the Southwest Community Hospital in Atlanta. He was 88.
        He died of heart failure, hospital officials said.
        Mr. Borders was credited with leading the successful campaign to desegregate Atlanta's buses in 1957.
        Despite his activism in championing civil rights, Mr. Borders was known as well for working behind the scenes to bring about change, saying, "You can march till you don't have shoes, and that's dramatic, but it's not a program."
        He helped in the placing of blacks in jobs traditionally held by whites and was an early leader in programs to build apartments for low-income blacks.
        Some followers of the civil rights movement noted that for years Mr. Borders was not on the best of terms with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Sr., the father of the slain civil rights leader and the pastor of the neighboring Ebenezer Baptist Church. Mr. Borders had criticized the appearance of the Ebenezer choir in the 1930's at events he viewed as segregated.
        Mr. Borders is survived by a son, Dr. William H. Borders Jr., a daughter, Dr. Juel P. Borders, both of Atlanta, and six grandchildren.
