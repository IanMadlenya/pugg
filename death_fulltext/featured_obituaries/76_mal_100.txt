        Richard Murphy, who wrote the screenplays for "The Desert Rats," "Boomerang!" and "Compulsion," died on Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 81 and lived in Beverly Hills.
        The cause was complications from a stroke two years ago, said his niece, Carol Ward Dudley.
        Mr. Murphy was born in Boston and grew up in New York City and Darien, Conn. After earning a bachelor's degree in English from Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., in 1936, he worked as an editor at Literary Digest. For a brief period he wrote screenplays for the short-film department at M-G-M. He also wrote one feature screenplay, for the Gene Autry film "Back in the Saddle" (1941), before serving five years with the Army in New Guinea. He attained the rank of captain.  Back to Hollywood
        After the war, Mr. Murphy returned to Hollywood and turned out a string of screenplays, most of them for 20th Century Fox. They included "Cry of the City" (1948), "Panic in the Streets" (1950; directed by Elia Kazan), "Broken Lance" (1954), "The Last Angry Man" (1959) and "Compulsion" (1959). Two of his screenplays, for "Boomerang!" (1947) and "The Desert Rats" (1963), were nominated for an Academy Award.
        Mr. Murphy served as both screenwriter and director on two films, "Three Stripes in the Sun" (1955) and "The Wackiest Ship in the Army" (1960). He also wrote the television series "Our Man Higgins" and "The Hardy Boys."
        He was a longtime board member of the Motion Picture and Television Fund and served on the board of the Writers Guild.
        He is survived by his wife, Katherine; a sister, Eleanor Dudley Jervis, of Manhattan, and two sons, John and Michael, both of Los Angeles.
