        Jose A. Martinez, who in the early 1940's danced with the American Ballet Caravan and Ballet Society, precursors of the New York City Ballet, died on June 24 at the Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. He was 84 and lived in Pasadena.
        Mr. Martinez, who was born in Mexico, was an early student at the School of American Ballet, founded in New York City in 1934 by Lincoln Kirstein, George Balanchine and Edward M. M. Warburg.
        Mr. Martinez ''conceived the idea and found the old words,'' Kirstein wrote in ''Ballet: Bias and Belief,'' for the 1941 ''Pastorela,'' choreographed by Lew Christensen and Jose Fernandez for a tour of Latin America the same year. Mr. Martinez's scenario delighted audiences in one Latin country, Kirstein added, ''because they saw in it a reverent use of folk material, not in an exotic or purely decorative style, but simply and with a definite connection to a living primitive tradition.''
        He served with the United States Army in northern France from 1943 to 1945. As a member of Ballet Society, he danced in the original cast of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments,'' performing the first Theme with Beatrice Tompkins in the 1946 ballet. He originated the role of the minister in William Dollar's 1947 ''Highland Fling.'' He was also a frequent model for the painter Paul Cadmus.
        A knee injury forced Mr. Martinez to stop performing in 1947. Over the next two decades, he founded studios in Virginia, Ohio and California, where he retired from teaching in the mid-1960's.
        Mr. Martinez is survived by two sisters, Aurora Martinez of Alhambra, Calif., and Dolores Riddle of Garden Grove, Calif.
