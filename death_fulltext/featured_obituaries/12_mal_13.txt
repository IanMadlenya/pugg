        Gaston Eyskens, a former Prime Minister of Belgium, who led six Governments during a period that spanned 24 years, died at his home in Louvain on Sunday. He was 82 years old.
        His terms included a time in 1960 when his Government faced two sensitive issues -social unrest at home and the granting of independence to the Congo, which later became Zaire.
        He was Prime Minister in 1949, from 1958 to 1961 and from 1968 to 1972.
        Mr. Eyskens was a professor of political science and also served as Finance Minister in several administrations.
        Born in Lierre, he graduated from the University of Louvain and received a master's degree from Columbia University. He had a doctorate in economics and in political science, both from the University of Louvain, and taught at the university's law school.
        During World War II, he served in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and in 1939 was elected to Parliament. He became Minister of Finance in 1945. A Member of Catholic Party
        A member of the Social Christian Party, the Roman Catholic party, he led a Catholic-Liberal coalition in 1949 after Parliament split over the restoration of King Leopold.
        He also led the Government, in 1970, during the constitutional revision that granted some autonomy to Flanders and Wallonia. He spoke both Flemish and French.
        Animosities between Flemings and the French-speaking Walloons, in the north and south of Belgium respectively, brought down Mr. Eyskens's Government in 1972, when the Flemish wing of his party demanded greater autonomy for a Flemish enclave in Wallonia.
        Mr. Eyskens was the father of Mark Eyskens, who was briefly Prime Minister in 1981 and was Finance Minister in the outgoing Government of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens.
