        Eric Larson, who helped bring to life classic Walt Disney cartoon characters in such films as ''Pinocchio'' and ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' during a 50-year career in animation, died Tuesday at his home in La Canada-Flintridge, a suburb of Los Angeles. He was 83 years old.
        For decades, Mr. Larson was one of a closely knit group of artists hired by Mr. Disney himself, who called the animators his ''nine old men.''
        Mr. Larson also worked on ''Cinderella,'' ''Alice in Wonderland,'' ''Fantasia,'' ''The Three Caballeros,'' ''Lady and the Tramp,'' ''One Hundred and One Dalmatians,'' ''The Jungle Book'' and ''Sleeping Beauty.''
        Mr. Larson was born in Cleveland, Utah, and graduated from the University of Utah. He was hired by Mr. Disney in 1933 to work on ''Snow White.'' which was Mr. Disney's first full-length animated film. Mr. Larson's final film credit was for ''The Great Mouse Detective'' in 1986.
        In the last few years before his retirement two years ago, Mr. Larson also served as the Disney studio's training director.
        He is survived by two brothers, Bland and Peter.
