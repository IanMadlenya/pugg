        Dr. Martin J. Feldman, a dentist and a former Democratic legislator in predominantly Republican Suffolk County, L.I., died on Tuesday at his home in Dix Hills, L.I. He was 58 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife said.
        Dr. Feldman, a graduate of New York University's School of Dentistry, was elected to the Suffolk County Legislature in 1971 by 19 votes. He served for eight years and pressed for an investigation into allegations of mismangement in a billion-dollar sewer construction project that led to the defeat of County Executive John V. N. Klein in a primary in 1979.
        Dr. Feldman ran for county executive himself that year as the Democratic nominee, but he was soundly defeated by Peter F. Cohalan, a Republican. Because of his knowledge of the County Legislature, Dr. Feldman was immediately hired as the top aide to its Republican presiding officer, Anthony Noto. He subsequently retired from politics after being beaten in a primary for the seat he had vacated.
        He was a practicing dentist and in recent years was active in medical enterprises, including a pharmaceutical company he co-founded in 1982.
        Besides his wife, Renay, he leaves a son, Lawrence, of Syosset, L.I.; three daughters, Alisa Secofsky of Great Neck, L.I., and Karen Antuzzi and Jayne Feldman, both of Manhattan, and one grandson.
