        Fred H. Fuller, developer of a voice analyzer that was used as a lie detector and for personality assessment, died on May 30 at his home in Wood-Ridge, N.J. He was 64 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Fuller, an engineer and a psychologist, was a native of Reifton, Pa., and a graduate of Pennsylvania State University. In 1974 he developed the analyzer, which was intended to detect variations in speech tremors as a means of gauging truthfulness of replies to questions of a skilled interrogator. It was later modified to be used by recruiters to determine personality traits.
        Mr. Fuller, as a consultant to the Army in the 1970's, helped develop life-saving vests.
        He is survived by four sons. Fred. Jr., of Alexandria, Va., Mark, of Washington, Michael, of Yardley, Pa., and Robert, of Charlottesville, Va.; a daughter, Barbara, of Concord, Mass.; a brother, Richard, of Short Hills, N.J., and five grandchildren.
