        Brother Bernard Alfred Welch, who retired in 1974 after 38 years on the faculty of Manhattan College, died on Tuesday at De La Salle Hall, a Christian Brothers residence in Lincroft, N.J. He was 82 years old.
        He died after a long fight with cancer, college officials said.
        A native of Manhattan, Brother Alfred took his final vows in 1933, earned a master's degree in mathematics at Catholic University of America and did postgraduate work at New York University and Columbia University. He joined Manhattan College's mathematic faculty in 1936 and was chairman of the mathematics department from 1945 to 1963.
