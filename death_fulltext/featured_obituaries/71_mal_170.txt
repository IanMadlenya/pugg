        William C. Trueheart, a former Ambassador to Nigeria and deputy chief of mission in Saigon just before the American military buildup in Vietnam, died Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 74 and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Trueheart died of cancer, said his son, Charles Trueheart.
        Born on Dec. 18, 1918, in Chester, Va., Mr. Trueheart received a bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in 1939 and a master's degree in philosophy from there in 1941.
        He was a civilian intelligence analyst in the Navy Department for a year, starting in 1942, after which he served in the Army, rising to the rank of captain. He joined the State Department in 1949 as an intelligence officer.
        As deputy chief of mission in Saigon from 1961 to 1964, he was among the first American diplomats to raise concerns about the ability of the corrupt Diem government to survive a groundswell of public opposition, particularly when Buddhist monks led protests. His concerns "let loose a floodgate of doubts," wrote David Halberstam in "The Best and the Brightest."
        Mr. Trueheart was Ambassador to Nigeria from 1969 to 1971. Before that he was director of Southeast Asian Affairs for the State Department from 1964 to 1966 and deputy director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research from 1967 to 1969.
        Besides his son, Charles, of Washington, Mr. Trueheart is survived by his wife, Phoebe; another son, Joshua Trueheart of Nyack, N.Y.; a half-sister, Rose Wilson of London, and four grandchildren.
