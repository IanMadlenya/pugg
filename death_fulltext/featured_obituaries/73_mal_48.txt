        Otto Fenn, a fashion photographer and landmarks preservationist in Sag Harbor, L.I., died on Friday at his home there. He was 79.
        Heart failure was the cause of death, said John Krug, his companion for 34 years.
        Mr. Fenn photographed fashions, decorations and food for Harper's Bazaar, Town & Country, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's, House Beautiful and House and Garden magazines.
        Among the celebrities he photographed were Tallulah Bankhead, Jackie Gleason, Sid Caesar, Bette Davis, Yves Montand and Rosalind Russell. He also did Lord & Taylor's advertising photography.
        Mr. Fenn served as chairman of the Sag Harbor Historic Landmarks District. He lived in the Nathan P. Hand house, which dates to the 1600's and is named for a whaling captain who once owned it.
        Since 1964 Mr. Fenn and Mr. Krug operated the 1964 Sag Harbor Antiques Shop.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Fenn grew up in Lincoln Park, N.J. He studied at the New York School of Design and taught painting there.
        Early in his career he made sets for summer theater and backgrounds for fashion sittings and painted murals for the 1939 World's Fair and the passenger ship America. He had an extensive collection of early works by Andy Warhol, a friend.
        Besides Mr. Krug, his survivors include a brother, Gene, of Paris, and two sisters, Camille Hedges of Sag Harbor and Dolores Fenn of Manhattan.
