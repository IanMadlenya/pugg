        J. David Grey, an expert on the author Jane Austen, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan at the age of 57. He resided in Manhattan and Spring Lake, N.J.
        The cause of death was bone cancer, his family said.
        He was a co-founder and the first president of the Jane Austen Society of North America. He lectured on Austen's work and wrote and edited articles and books about her. In 1981, he discovered that Crown Publishers had issued a new volume of Austen's early works with an erroneous cover picture of someone else.
        Mr. Grey, a career educator, was an English teacher and school administrator in New York City for 35 years. He was assistant principal of the John S. Roberts Junior High School in East Harlem from the 1970's until he retired last year.
        He was born in Elizabeth, N.J. After graduating from Fordham University, he earned a master's degree in education from Hunter and did doctoral studies at New York University. He taught English at Mace, a private school in Manhattan, and then joined the public school system.
        His survivors include his sister, Dorothy Thompson of Spring Lake.
