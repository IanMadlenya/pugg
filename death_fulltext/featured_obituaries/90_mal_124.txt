        John Martin Cates Jr., a retired lawyer and former Foreign Service officer, died on July 14 while on a visit to Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic. He was 82 and lived in Nassau, the Bahamas.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        A native of Denver, Mr. Cates graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School and was admitted to the bar in California, Washington and New York. Starting in 1947, he worked for the State Department as an expert on the United Nations and its specialized agencies, becoming a familiar figure skilled  at lobbying United Nations diplomats from Latin America for their votes.
        He later served in various positions at the United States embassies in West Germany, Mexico, Venezuela and Switzerland, as well as at the Organization of American States. He advised the United States Mission to the United Nations on Latin American affairs and acted as its liaison to representatives of the region from 1963 to 1970.
        He was a past president and director of the Center for Inter-American Relations in New York -- now the Americas Society -- from 1971 to 1975.
        Mr. Cates is survived by his wife, Nelia Barletta Cates; a son by a previous  marriage, John M. 3d; and three grandchildren.
