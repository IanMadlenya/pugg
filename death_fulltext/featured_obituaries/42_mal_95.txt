        State Senator Eugene Levy, a Republican from Suffern, N.Y., who had served in the State Legislature since 1969, died yesterday in Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. He was 63 years old.
        Mr. Levy died of leukemia, the hospital said.
        Mr. Levy represented the 38th District, which covers Rockland County and parts of southern Orange County. As a legislator, first in the State Assembly and then in the Senate, he was interested in consumer affairs, education, the handicapped and the environment.
        Mr. Levy died only hours after petitions were filed to place his name on the ballot for the Republican primary in September in what would have been his bid for a fourth Senate term. He had served eight terms in the Assembly.
        At his death, Mr. Levy was chairman of the Senate's Consumer Protection Committee.
        Widely regarded as a popular politician, Mr. Levy did not face a Democratic opponent in his last race in 1988. Running on the Republican and Conservative lines, he received 82,000 votes, compared with 4,000 received by the Right to Life candidate, Robert Garrison.
        Mr. Levy was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y. He served in the Navy Medical Corps during World War II and attended New York University and Queens College.
        He started his political career in 1963 when he was elected councilman of the town of Ramapo, retaining that position until he successfully ran for the Assembly in 1968.
        Mr. Levy is survived by his wife, Geraldine Schack Levy; a son, William, of Pompano Beach, Fla.; his mother, Helen Levy of Lauderhill, Fla., and a brother, Walter, of Spring Valley.
        Services are to be at Temple Beth El in Spring Valley at 10 A.M. Sunday.
