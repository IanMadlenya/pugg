        Joseph M. Beitel, a horticultural taxonomist at the New York Botanical Garden who was an authority on ferns, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 39 years old and lived in the Bronx.
        He died of brain cancer, said a spokesman for the botanical garden.
        From 1983 though 1990, Mr. Beitel conducted research and taught at the botanical garden. He had carried out fieldwork in China, Mexico, the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, Venezuela and many parts of the United States and Canada. He was the author of "The Ferns of Oaxaca, Mexico" (New York Botanical Garden, 1988).
        Mr. Beitel was an expert on the flora of Long Island, where he led hundreds of field trips.
        He is survived by his mother, Genoefa, of Bellport, L.I., and a sister, Julie Edwards of Brooklyn.
