        Walter Kerr, a former foreign correspondent and a magazine publisher who was the general manager of the international edition of The New York Times in the 1960's, died on Jan. 10 in White Plains. He was 91.
        Mr. Kerr was born in Syracuse in 1911. He attended Yale University before becoming a foreign correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune.
        He was in Prague when the Nazis invaded in 1938, and in Paris when the German Army entered in June 1940.
        After reporting on World War II from the Soviet Union, he worked in Europe for the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the Central Intelligence Agency, until the end of the war.
        Then he was the Paris bureau chief, European editor and Washington bureau chief of The Herald Tribune.
        In 1958, he and his wife, Vivianne Lovell Kerr, a former White House correspondent for Agence France-Presse, founded Americans Abroad, a magazine for Americans living in Europe, which they published monthly for five years in Zurich.
        Mr. Kerr was general manager of the Times edition in Paris, from 1962 to 1965. The Times ended the international edition when it became part owner of The International Herald Tribune in 1967.
        Mr. Kerr lived later in Santa Fe, N.M., where he was the general manager of The New Mexican and a political adviser to Gov. David F. Cargo, and in Paris, where he wrote three books about Russian history.
        He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Cynthia, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a son, Philip, of Sacramento; and by four grandchildren.
