        Dr. Eugene W. Friedman, former chief of head and neck surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died there on April 18. He was 86 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Friedman, who was about to take emeritus status after more than 50 years at Mount Sinai, was an innovator in the use of lasers in cancer surgery, a specialty he taught as a clinical professor of surgery and wrote about extensively, often in journals that he founded.
        A native New Yorker, Eugene Warren Friedman graduated in 1939 from N.Y.U., where he also received his medical degree in 1943. He was a resident in surgery at Mount Sinai beginning in 1947, trained further at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and returned to Mount Sinai as chief of the division of head and neck surgery in 1952.
        Until a few years ago he also had a private practice on the Upper East Side.
        Dr. Friedman is survived by his wife of 49 years, the former Geraldine Gewirtz; two sons, John H. and Robert J., both of Manhattan; a brother, Dr. David Friedman, also of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.
