        Raymond D. Hodge, a retired civil engineer who supervised projects in many parts of the world, died Saturday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. He was 68 years old and lived in Potomac, Md.
        He died of complications of rheumatoid arthritis, his son Raymond Jr. of Washington said.
        Mr. Hodge was a senior partner in the engineering firm of Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton and retired in 1987 after more than 30 years with the firm.
        He was involved in the planning and design of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue and the rehabilitation of Union Station in Washington. He also directed development of airports in Bangkok; Seoul; Teheran, Iran; Amman, Jordan, and Lisbon. He directed development of the Mount Newman Iron Ore project in Northwest Australia, which included the planning and design of a 285-mile railroad, two towns and port and industrial complexes.
        A graduate of Manhattan College and Cornell University, Mr. Hodge served with the Navy in World War II and the Korean War.
        In 1979, the American Society of Civil Engineers, of which he was a member, awarded him the James Lurie Prize for his contributions to international transportation.
        He is survived by his wife, Lorraine; two daughters, Susan and Patricia, of Potomac; another son, Christopher, of Bethesda, Md.; a sister, Lucille De Bellis, of Hartsdale, N.Y.; a brother, Christopher, of Scottsdale, Ariz., and two grandchildren.
