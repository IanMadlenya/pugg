        Danny O'Neil, a consulting producer and a former acting program manager at Channel 31, died Thursday at Doctors Hospital of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, according to his family. He was 45 years old.
        As a producer, Mr. O'Neil won praise from critics for bringing audiences high-quality shows put together on shoestring budgets. Among them were his television version of A. J. Gurney's ''Scenes From an American Life''; ''New York Screening Room,'' a 13-part series of documentary and dramatic films selected from those shown at New York cultural institutions, and the 1984 series ''Mothers by Daughters'' - co-produced with Barbara M. Van Dyke - in which Estelle Parsons discussed with women in the arts their relationships with their mothers.
        At his death, Mr. O'Neil was preparing a series of 30- to 60-second ''spots'' with new poets reading from their works, to be used during station breaks. For this project, he received a grant from the Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry.
        Born in Brasher Falls, N. Y., Mr. O'Neil studied drama at Catholic University in Washington. He is survived by two sisters, Nancy of New York City and JoAnn Coria of Syracuse, and a niece, Micaela Coria. A memorial serivce will be held in the spring.
