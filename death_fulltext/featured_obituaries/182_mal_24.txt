        Howard R. Young, a director and former partner at Goldman, Sachs, died on Feb. 21 at his home in Rumson, N.J. He was 83.
        The cause was liver cancer, his wife, Betty, said.
        Mr. Young, who was known as Ray, joined Goldman, Sachs, then a private securities firm, as a securities sales representative in 1946 and remained with the firm his entire career. He held several sales positions before being elected a partner in 1958. Three years later, he was appointed to the firm's management committee. Mr. Young retired in 1980 but remained a limited partner. In 1999, when Goldman went public, he was named a senior director.
        Mr. Young graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in 1941 and received a master's degree from Harvard in 1943. He served three years in the Navy before joining Goldman.
        Mr. Young's first wife, Margaret Gibson, died earlier. A son, Lawrence, died last year.
        In addition to his wife, Betty, Mr. Young is survived by a daughter, Margaret Young Kavookjian, of Westcliffe, Colo.; three sons, Richard, of Colorado Springs; John, of Sedona, Ariz.; and Charles, of Atlanta; three stepchildren, Amy B. Lane, of New York; Jeffrey M. Lane, of Oakland, Calif.; and Andrew J. Lane, of Park Ridge, N.J.; 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
