        Carlo Francovich, a leader of anti-Fascist partisans in Florence in World War II and a prominent historian of Italian unification, died today. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Francovich was considered a leading expert on Italy's unification in the 1860's, and taught the subject at universities in Siena and Florence. He wrote a two-volume history of the anti-Fascist resistance in Florence, where he took part in the 1944 uprising.
        The President of the Italian Senate, former Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini, said in a message of condolence to Mr. Francovich's family that the historian had "studied in depth the themes of the formation of democratic, secular Italy" and had been "an authoritative and original voice."
