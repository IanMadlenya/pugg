        Paul Russell Carro, a former official of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, died on Friday. He was 34 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Carro died of complications from AIDS, said Greg Lugliani, the assistant director of the AIDS service and health advocacy organization.
        Mr. Carro, who earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and a master's in psychology from the City University of New York at Queens College, joined Gay Men's Health Crisis as a volunteer in 1983 when it was still a small grassroots organization.
        He joined the staff later that year and in 1985 became its director of finance and administration. He resigned in December 1989 because of his illness.
        He is survived by his parents, Mario and Jeraldine, and two sisters, Geraldine and Elaine, all of Brooklyn. His companion was Randy Dreyer.
