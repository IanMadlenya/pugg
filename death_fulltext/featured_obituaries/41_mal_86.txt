        Jack Paparo, a retired clothing manufacturer, died yesterday at his home in Miami. He was 86 years old and had suffered from Parkinson's disease, his son said.
        He was the founder of the House of Ronnie, a New York-based manufacturer of underwear, sleepwear and sportswear. The company was started in 1943 as an underwear contractor in a storefront in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and grew into a business with five factories in the South. He was a former chairman of the company.
        He is survived by his son, Irving, of Manhattan; a daughter, Beatrice Rappaport of Brooklyn; a brother, Meyer, and a sister, Sophie Behar, both of Miami Beach; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
