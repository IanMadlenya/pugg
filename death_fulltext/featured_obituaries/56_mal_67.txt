        The pianist and teacher Robert Goldsand died yesterday at a nursing home in Danbury, Conn. He was 80 years old.
        A family friend said the cause of death was diabetes; Mr. Goldsand had also been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Goldsand had an active concert career until the late 1970's, offering ambitious programs of the 19th-century piano repertory. In 1962, Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times called him "a throw-back to a romantic style of piano playing that has all but vanished from the scene."
        Born in Vienna, Mr. Goldsand studied with two piano virtuosos, Moriz Rosenthal and Emil Sauer. He also studied music with the composer Joseph Marx.
        He gave his New York debut recital in 1927 at Town Hall at the age of 16. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, called his performances "rare and admirable." Later reviews praised his highly personal talent, his "aristocracy" of phrase and his compelling programming.
        In 1940, a year after fleeing Vienna to escape the Nazis, he came to the United States, returned to concert life and began teaching at the Cincinnati Conservatory. From 1953 to 1990 he taught piano at the Manhattan School of Music.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary.
