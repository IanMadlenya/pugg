        Jean-Louis Curtis, whose novel "Forests of the Night" won him France's highest literary prize, died today of a heart attack in a Paris hospital. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Curtis won the Prix Goncourt in 1947 for "Forests of the Night," a fictional account of Nazi occupation through the eyes of a young village girl.
        He was elected to the prestigious French Academy in 1986.
        Born on May 22, 1917, in the town of Orthez in the Pyrenees, Mr. Curtis wrote more than 30 novels, including "Lucifer's Dream" and "The Side of the Angels." Many of his works were published under the pseudonym of Louis Laffitte.
        He gained widespread popularity in France, yet once wryly observed that a writer's real life consisted of "combat with the angel in solitude."
