        Alexander Fried, a widely respected critic of music, dance and art in San Francisco for 51 years, died of a heart attack Monday morning at St. Luke's Hospital in San Francisco. He was 85 years old. Mr. Fried's plain-spoken, gentle, supportive criticism was practiced mainly at The San Francisco Examiner, but he also lectured and was a host of San Francisco Opera radio broadcasts and a master of ceremonies at San Francisco Symphony youth concerts. He was a key force in encouraging both the symphony and San Francisco's art museums to upgrade management and budgets.
        Born in New York, Mr. Fried studied piano and composition and received his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from Columbia University. He edited the magazine Musical Digest in New York before becoming music editor of The San Francisco Chronicle in 1926. His post included responsibility for dance coverage.
        In 1934 he moved to The Examiner as music and art editor. Fluent in French, Russian, Italian, German and Spanish, he evinced a cosmopolitanism that was reflected in his wide-ranging, open-minded attention to all manner of artistic innovation in the Bay area. He retired in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Edith, of San Francisco; two daughters, Madelyn English and Harriet Fried, and a grandson, Andrew English, all of New York.
