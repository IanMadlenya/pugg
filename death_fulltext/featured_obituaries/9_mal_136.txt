        Mr. Alajalov, who was born in the Russian town of Rostov, amused several generations of readers of The New Yorker, The Saturday Evening Post, Vogue and other publications with his droll, slice-of-life cartoons. He painted murals and posters for the Soviet Government, then went to Persia before immigrating to the United States in 1923. Mr. Alajalov, a longtime resident of New York City and Southampton, L.I., was a sports cartoonist for The New York Evening Post in the 1930's, taught classes in drawing and modern art, painted murals for the Sherry-Netherland Hotel and the liner America and illustrated many books. His works are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum and other institutions.
        He is survived by a brother, Semyn Ivanovich Alajalov, of Moscow.
