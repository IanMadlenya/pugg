        Dr. Herbert Holt, a psychiatrist who pioneered in training members of the clergy in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of leukemia, said his daughter, Renata Holt of New York.
        Dr. Holt was dean of graduate training at the Westchester Institute for Psychoanalysis, president of the American Society for Existential Psychiatry, founding president of the Association for Applied Psychoanalysis and director of training in psychiatry and psychoanalysis at the American Foundation for Religion and Psychiatry.
        Among Dr. Holt's students were rabbis, Roman Catholic priests and Protestant ministers.
        The Rev. Carl Sword, a member of the Order of the Holy Cross of the Episcopal Church, said Dr. Holt's students in the ministry went to work in hospitals and drug rehabilitation centers as well as traditional parishes.
        In 1976, the New York Ontoanalytic Association awarded Dr. Holt the Binswanger Award in Existential Psychiatry. He wrote "Free to Be Good or Bad," published in 1976, and contributed to many journals and texts.
        In addition to his daughter Renata, Dr. Holt is survived by his wife, Dolores; a son, Gerhard, another daughter, Roberta, and a grandson.
