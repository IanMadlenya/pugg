        Charles P. Tolchin, who survived with cystic fibrosis decades longer than expected and who wrote and taught about the disease, died today at Georgetown University Hospital. He was 34.
        The cause was complications of the disease and a double lung transplant Mr. Tolchin received in 1997, both of which he chronicled in a book, ''Blow the House Down'' (iUniverse.com, 2000). In it, he described his experiences before and after his transplant to educate and encourage patients and health professionals.
        Mr. Tolchin, who continued to work as an advertising executive at America Online until February, was 5 when his parents learned that he had cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that clogs the lungs and pancreas with mucus. Doctors said he would probably live about three more years.
        In January, he was the subject of a profile in The New York Times in which he reflected on the medical achievements that allowed him and others to outlive the odds.
        Mr. Tolchin, a graduate of George Washington University, went on rounds with doctors at the National Institutes of Health and at Georgetown hospital, teaching the staff about genetics and rehabilitation medicine, as well as ways to deal with very sick patients. He lectured frequently on medicine, nursing and physical therapy.
        Mr. Tolchin is survived by his parents, Martin, a former Washington correspondent for The New York Times and publisher of The Hill, a Congressional newspaper, and Susan, of Washington; and a sister, Karen of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
        Asked by a reporter for The Times what he told people who were fighting life-threatening diseases, Mr. Tolchin said: ''Don't believe there's nothing you can do. I tell doctors to think twice before they tell a patient that nothing can be done.''
