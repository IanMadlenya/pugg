        Rear Adm. William Heald Groverman, a commander in World War II and the Korean War who became one of the leading cold war experts on anti-submarine warfare and Soviet naval forces, died on Dec. 25 at the Peninsula Hospital in Burlingame, Calif. He was 87 and lived in San Mateo, Calif.
        Admiral Groverman retired in 1971 after 43 years in the Navy. In the 1950's, after commanding the cruiser Des Moines, flagship of the Sixth Fleet, he became an architect of anti-submarine technologies, tactics and procedures.
        He established the Undersea Warfare Division in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and became the first director of anti-submarine research and development programs.
        Born in Covington, Ky., Admiral Groverman graduated from the Naval Academy and was commissioned an ensign in 1932. Until World War II he served at sea and shore stations and taught postgraduate courses at the Academy.
        He then saw duty on destroyers in both the Pacific and Atlantic Fleets, and commanded destroyers in several engagements in the Pacific. He ended the war as commander of the destroyer DeHaven and, finally, as submarine warfare officer for the Atlantic Fleet.
        President Harry S. Truman cited him in 1950 for his work on submarine defenses, and during the Korean War he was commander of a destroyer division.
        He reached flag rank in 1961 and won a number of medals and commendations, including two Silver Stars and two Bronze Stars.
        From 1968 until November 1971 he oversaw planning and operations for the defense of the Western United States and Canada -- submarine detection, naval reconnaissance and readiness for foreign attacks, natural calamities and other threats.
        Admiral Groverman is survived by his wife of 43 years, Paola Copeland Groverman.
