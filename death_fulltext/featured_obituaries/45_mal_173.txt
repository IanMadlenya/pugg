        The Rev. Leonard P. Mahoney, a Jesuit priest who was a professor of modern European history and international affairs at Boston College, died last Tuesday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 74 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        He died of cancer, said a spokeswoman for the college, where Mr. Mahoney taught for 36 years.
        He is survived by a brother, Thomas of Cambridge.
