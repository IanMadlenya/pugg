        Germain Bazin, an art historian and the former chief curator of paintings at the Louvre, died on Thursday, the Academie des Beaux Arts announced. He was 88 years old.
        In accordance with the family's wishes, the cause of death was not disclosed, a spokesman for the institute said.
        The son of an engineer, Mr. Bazin studied art in Paris as a young man and became an art professor at the University of Brussels in 1934. He returned to Paris in 1936 as a curator of paintings at the Louvre.
        He was named chief curator of the Louvre's 10,000 paintings in 1951. Mr. Bazin served in that position until 1965, when he left to head the painting restoration section of France's vast national museum system for five years.
        One of the world's leading museum experts, Mr. Bazin also earned the titles of research professor at York University in Britain and at the University of Toronto.
        He wrote about 30 works of art history, translated into 17 languages, including his two-volume ''History of Painting,'' ''The Loom of Art,'' ''The Language of Styles,'' ''Edouard Manet'' and ''Gallery of Flowers.'' The subjects of his works ranged from Italian Baroque to 20th-century avant-garde art.
