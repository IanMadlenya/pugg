        Les Horvath, a multipurpose back at Ohio State who won the Heisman Trophy in  1944 as college football's best player, died at his home in Glendale, Calif., on Tuesday. He was 74.
        Horvath, who was graduated in 1945 with a degree in dentistry, was the first  of four Ohio State players to win the Heisman, leading the Buckeyes to a 9-0 record in 1944. He played quarterback, halfback and defensive back, accounting for 1,248 yards.
        In winning the Heisman Trophy, he beat out Army's two outstanding backs, Glenn Davis and Doc Blanchard, winners of the award in 1945 and 1946.
        A native of Parma, Ohio, Horvath was also a member of Ohio State's top-ranked 1942 team. In his career, he had 290 rushing attempts for 1,546 yards, an average of 5.3 yards per carry and 12 touchdowns. He also completed 25 of 50 passes for 509 yards.
        After serving in the Navy, he played three years of pro football with the Los Angeles Rams and the Cleveland Browns before starting a dentistry practice in Los Angeles.
