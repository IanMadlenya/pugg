        Bill Quackenbush, who proved that defensemen could play hockey without being excessively rough or committing penalties, died last Sunday in the Chandler Hall Hospice in Newtown, Pa. He was 77.
        The cause was pneumonia and complications from Alzheimer's disease, said his son Bruce.
        In 1976, Quackenbush was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame. In a sport in which two-minute penalties are common and five-minute penalties are not rare, Hall of Fame officials cited his total of only 95 penalty minutes in a major league career of 774 games, an average of 7 seconds a game. They said the average was one of the lowest in history for a player at any position.
        In one stretch, he played 131 games, almost two full seasons, without a penalty. He was assessed no penalties in the National Hockey League's 1948-49 season, when he was voted the annual Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for the player who best combines sportsmanship, gentlemanly conduct and playing ability.
        In 13 N.H.L. seasons -- 6 with the Detroit Red Wings and 7 with the Boston Bruins -- Quackenbush was known as a strong rusher and excellent checker. He was named to the N.H.L. first all-star team three times and the second team twice.
        Hubert George (Bill) Quackenbush was born March 2, 1922, in Toronto. After 10 games as an N.H.L. rookie in 1942, he broke a wrist. After that, his shooting power reduced, he turned to finesse. His N.H.L. career totals showed 62 goals and 222 assists during the regular season and 2 goals and 21 assists in 80 playoff games.
        His playing career ended in 1956. He later coached Princeton teams in men's hockey (1967-73), women's hockey (1978-85) and men's golf (1969-85).
        He and his wife, the former Joan Kalloch, lived in Lawrenceville, N.J. He is survived by his wife; three sons, Bruce and Scott of Greenwich, Conn., and Todd of Pennington, N.J.; two brothers, Ted of Toronto and Max of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and seven grandchilden.
