        Jerome Sill, a former radio executive and later publisher of The Scarsdale (N.Y.) Inquirer, a weekly newspaper, died on Tuesday at the Boca Raton Community Hospital in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 88.
        Mr. Sill died of complications of a lung infection, said his son, Peter.
        Born in 1905 and raised in the Bronx, Mr. Sill first went into advertising, working for several agencies in New York City. During the early days of network radio in the 1930's until 1947, he worked first for CBS and later for ABC, advising new affiliates on how to operate their businesses.
        Between 1947 and 1961, Mr. Sill owned and operated a succession of radio stations in Milwaukee, Reading, Pa., and Atlantic City.
        In 1961, he bought The Scarsdale Inquirer, which now has a circulation of about 7,000, and began introducing national and foreign news to the usual local coverage. He retired and moved to Florida in 1971.
        Besides his son, who lives in Seattle, Mr. Sill is survived by a daughter, Joan Corwin of St. Louis, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
