        Alfred Lee Loomis Jr., a businessman and avid sailor, died last Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where he had been admitted for tests. The cause of death was not known, said his daughter, Candace DiLello. He was 81.
        Mr. Loomis had homes in Bluffton, S.C., and Oyster Bay, L.I. During his mid-30's he won a gold medal in the 1948 Olympic Games in Britain while sailing a 6-Meter yacht. In 1977, he was manager of the Independence-Courageous syndicate, the yachting team that successfully defended the America's Cup that year.
        After spending his childhood in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., Mr. Loomis graduated from Harvard College in 1935 and from Harvard Law School in 1939. He served as a flag lieutenant in the United States Navy in World War II, and then became one of the nation's first venture capitalists. He was involved with domestic oil and gas drilling operations.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia Davis; three daughters, Nancy Chance, of Austerlitz, N.Y.; Sabra Loomis, of New York City, and Mrs. DiLello, of Los Angeles; a son, Chip Loomis, of New York City; a brother, Henry Loomis, of Jacksonville, Fla.; and five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
