        Thomas Francis Lambert Jr., a law professor and dean who served as a trial lawyer for the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg after the defeat of Nazi Germany, died on Wednesday at his home in Boston. He was 85.
        For the past 27 years, until last May, Professor Lambert taught at Suffolk University Law School in Boston, where he held an endowed chair. He previously had taught at Boston University School of Law for nine years.
        Fellow lawyers knew him nationally for his long association with the American Trial Lawyers Association, formerly the National Association of Claimants' Compensation Attorneys.
        Roscoe Pound personally picked  Professor Lambert in 1955 to succeed him as editor in chief of the organization's law journal and its other publications. Mr. Lambert continued in that position for 40 years.
        He earned a bachelor's degree in jurisprudence at Oxford University, attended Yale Law School as a Sterling Fellow and, at age 26, became dean of Stetson University College of Law in St. Petersburg, Fla.
        Justice Robert H. Jackson of the Supreme Court, when named to head the American prosecutors at the principal Nuremberg Trial, asked Professor Lambert to join his team. He helped to prepare the case against the Nazi Party as a criminal organization and to prosecute, in absentia, Martin Bormann, one of Hitler's closest aides.
        Professor Lambert is survived by his wife of 47 years, Elizabeth Branon Lambert, and two siblings, Margaret Teagle and Owen Lambert, both of California.
