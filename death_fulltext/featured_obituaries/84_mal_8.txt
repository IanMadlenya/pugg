        Allan Morrow, a New York real-estate developer, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 53 and also kept a home in Bridgehampton, L.I.
        The cause was complications arising from AIDS, according to a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, where he was a member of the board of directors.
        At his death, Mr. Morrow was executive vice president of Kenilworth Equities Ltd., a developer of commercial and residential properties in New York City and Baltimore. He held the position for 20 years and was active in restoring landmark buildings in Maryland and New York.
        He was a supporter of many causes, among them the fight against anti-Semitism and efforts favoring AIDS research and opposing homophobia. He also supported charities aiding early-childhood education and was a benefactor of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
        Mr. Morrow was born in Brooklyn.  He attended the University of Pennsylvania and New York University.
        He was on the board of the Burden Center for the Aging, the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund.
        He is survived by his mother, Mary Morrow of Cedarhurst, L.I.; his brother, Robert of Manhattan; his sister, Janet Morrow of Lawrence, L.I., and his companion, Frank Faulkner.
