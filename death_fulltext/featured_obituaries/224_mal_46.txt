        William S. Bartman, an art patron and the founder of a nonprofit publishing company and exhibition space, died last Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 58 and a Manhattan resident.
        Yael Meridan Schori, president of the board of Art Resources Transfer, or ART, Mr. Bartman's organization, said that Mr. Bartman, who required dialysis, died of multiple organ failure. Mr. Bartman had long-term health problems, including an H.I.V. infection.
        Mr. Bartman founded ART in Los Angeles in 1987, inviting artists to interview other artists about their work for pocket-size books. He moved ART to New York in 1990, operating a bookstore-gallery in Chelsea from 1996 to 2004.
        Born in Chicago and reared in Los Angeles, Mr. Bartman first worked in theater and film. He instituted a theater program at the federal penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif., staging an all-inmate production of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' At ART he founded the Distribution to Underserved Communities Program, which distributes free books on art to rural and urban libraries across the country.
        Mr. Bartman is survived by his mother, Norma Bartman; his brother, Thomas; and his sister, Barbara, all of Los Angeles.
