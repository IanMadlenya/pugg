        Igal Roodenko, a printer arrested many times in anti-war and civil-rights protests, died on Sunday at Downtown Beekman Hospital. He was 74 years old and lived in Manhatttan.
        He apparently died of a heart atttack, said David McReynolds of the War Resisters League.
        Mr. Roodenko was chairman of the league from 1968 to 1972 and had been a member of its executive committee from 1947 to 1977.
        He worked as an independent printer from 1953 to 1970.  In World War II, he served 20 months in a Federal prison as a conscientious objector.
        Mr. Roodenko was arrested many time over the years. In 1947, on the first Freedom Ride into the South, he was arrested with Bayard Rustin and two other men. All four were sentenced to 30 days at hard labor on a North Carolina road gang for defying segregation rules on a bus.
        He was also arrested for demonstrating for Soviet dissidents; for protesting Cornell University's investments in South Africa; and, in 1987, was among five War Resisters members arrested and deported from Poland for trying to strengthen contacts with the then unofficial group, Freedom and Peace.
        He was a board member of the A. J. Muste Memorial Institute and at his death was part of Men of All Colors Together, a group intended to overcome racism within the gay community.
        A native New Yorker, he was a graduate of Townsend Harris High School in Manhattan and Cornell University.
        Mr. Roodenko is survived by a sister, Vivien Lang of Philadelphia.
