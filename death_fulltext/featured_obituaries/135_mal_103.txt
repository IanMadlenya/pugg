        David Goheen Leach, a plant geneticist, authority on horticulture and internationally renowned breeder of ornamental plants like hybridized rhododendrons, magnolias and azaleas, died on April 22 at his home in Madison, Ohio. He was 85.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A past president of the American Horticultural Society, Mr. Leach wrote and lectured extensively about his creations, which, like his books, sold worldwide.
        As a geneticist, Mr. Leach said he felt he had artistic and esthetic responsibilities, leading him to breed ever showier, hardier plants or pretty pygmy hybrids to enthrall the weekend gardener and visitors to public parks. His best known book was ''Rhododenrons of the World'' (Scribner, 1961), a bible for aficionados.
        ''You have to be motivated,'' Mr. Leach said, ''in the mind's eye, by sheer delight of the beauty you are expecting to create.''
        The Holden Arboretum in Kirtland, Ohio, has a sizable garden of Leach hybrids. It also houses the David G. Leach Research Station, his  legacy to the arboretum, which  will carry on the plant research and hybridization he began in the 1950's.
        Much of Mr. Leach's writing grew from his own study of plants, particularly in Southeast Asia. He frequently contributed to Life, National Geographic, The New York Times and other publications, as well as to the Encyclopedia Britannica.
        A native of New Bethlehem, Pa., he graduated from the College of Wooster in Ohio in 1934.
        He is survived by a daughter, Robin Leach of San Diego; two sons, David Jr., of Marysville, Tenn., and Brian, of Singer Island, Fla., and a sister, Ruth Humphrey of Brookville, Pa.
