        Robert Hershman, a producer of documentaries for CBS News, died at his home in Santa Monica, Calif., on Sunday. Mr. Hershman, who lived in Manhattan until recently, was 41.
        The cause of death was AIDS, said Gary Barton, his companion.
        Among the highlights of Mr. Hershman's career as a producer with the news magazine shows "West 57th" and "48 Hours" were interviews with Prince Charles of Britain and Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, the former Prime Minister of Iran, as well as shows on the World War II German anti-Nazi group White Rose and AIDS in Orange County, Calif.
        He also worked for "CBS Reports" and "The MacNeil-Lehrer Report" and played a formative role in the founding of the Museum of Television and Broadcasting, serving as its first vice president.
        Mr. Hershman helped change hospital policies for AIDS patients when he filed a lawsuit on behalf of his companion Ronald James that led New York University Medical Center and other hospitals to alter policies that excluded AIDS patients from sharing semiprivate rooms with other patients.
        Mr. Hershman, who was born in Cleveland, graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard College in 1975.
        Besides Mr. Barton, of Santa Monica, he is survived by his parents, Phyllis and Eugene Hershman of Beachwood, Ohio; a sister, Marcie Hershman of Boston, and two brothers, Clifford and Daniel, both of Cleveland.
