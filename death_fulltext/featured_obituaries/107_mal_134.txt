        Klaus Heinrich Hofmann, University Professor emeritus of experimental medicine and biochemistry at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, died on Monday at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He was 84 and lived in Mount Lebanon, Pa.
        The cause was acute kidney failure, the Freyvogel Funeral Home in Pittsburgh  said.
        Dr. Hofmann was internationally known for his work on the degradation and synthesis of natural compounds like peptides and pituitary hormones, and for his research on the structure and metabolism of bacterial fatty acids. His contributions led to his election to the National Academy of Sciences in 1964.
        Born in Karlsruhe, Germany, he received his biochemical training and a Ph.D.  in organic chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich before beginning studies at Rockefeller University in New York in 1938. He joined the University of Pittsburgh's chemistry department in 1944 and became chairman of the biochemistry department in the School of Medicine in 1952.
        Since 1964 he had directed his own research institute, the Protein Research Laboratory, within the School of Medicine at Pittsburgh. There he focused on the partial synthesis of protein and novel ways of isolating the human insulin receptor molecule, a substance that recognizes insulin and alerts the cell to it. He was the author of more than 200 scientific papers and received many honors, including the Borden, Humboldt and Pierce Awards.
        Dr. Hofmann is survived by his wife, Frances Finn Hofmann; a daughter, Suzanne Sevray of Paris, and three grandchildren.
