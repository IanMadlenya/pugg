        Albert Rubenstein, the president and chairman of the Franklin Stores Corporation from 1953 until the company was sold in 1973, died on Tuesday at Stamford Hospital in Connecticut. A resident of Stamford and New York City, he was 78 years old.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Franklin Stores was founded in 1938 by Mr. Rubenstein's father, Frank. The younger Mr. Rubenstein joined the business after college and succeeded to the chairmanship upon his father's death. Under his guidance, Franklin Stores grew into a major regional retailer with 220 branches from the Southwest, its original location, to the Northeast and the Caribbean.
        After the stores were sold to Slater Walker of America Ltd., Mr. Rubenstein remained president of its Franklin Stores division until his retirement in 1978. He also took part in numerous charitable and community activities, including the Bicultural Day School in Stamford, United Jewish Appeal, Metropolitan Opera, Museum of Modern Art, and Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Rubenstein is survived by his wife, Marion Freedman Rubenstein; three children, Franklin D. of Westport, Conn., Robin Ann Winick of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Marke Ellen Rubenstein of Stamford, and six grandchildren.
