        John D. Mattus, an entrepreneur and advocate for people with AIDS, died on Jan. 31 at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS-related lymphoma, a friend, Joanna Kimberley, said.
        Mr. Mattus graduated from Harvard Business School in 1976. He worked at Thomson McKinnon Securities in New York City from 1980 to 1985. In the late 1980's, he developed Howard Johnson and Ramada motels in Georgia and Montana and owned and operated radio stations in Montana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Idaho and Utah.
        In recent years, he was on the board of the AIDS Action Foundation, the fund-raising arm of the AIDS Action Council of Washington, which represents about 1,000 AIDS groups nationwide.
        He is survived by his companion, Kevin Brown of Manhattan; his parents, John  S. and Anne Mattus of West Hartford, Conn., and a brother, Gregory, also of West Hartford.
