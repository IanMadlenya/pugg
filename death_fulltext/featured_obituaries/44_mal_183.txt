        Daniel W. Hofgren, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon who contradicted statements by former Attorney General John N. Mitchell at Mr. Mitchell's conspiracy trial in 1974, died Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 54 years old and died of cancer, said his former wife, Joan T. Howard.
        Mr. Hofgren, who retired in 1989 as a vice president of Goldman, Sachs & Company, testified at the trial of Mr. Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans, who were both leaders of Mr. Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972. Both were accused of perjury, obstruction of justice and conspiracy for allegedly attempting to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.
        At the trial, Mr. Hofgren disputed a statement by Mr. Mitchell to a grand jury in 1973 that he ''never told Mr. Hofgren to stay away from anything.'' Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Stans were later acquitted of all charges in the case.
        Mr. Hofgren served as an assistant to Mr. Stans during Mr. Nixon's Presidential campaign in 1968 and from 1969 to 1970 was a special assistant to the President.
        He worked as a fund-raiser in the 1972 election and later served as director of the President Nixon Presidential Archives Foundation.
        A 1958 graduate of Colgate University, Mr. Hofgren also attended Columbia University Law School and served on the Board of Foreign Scholarships, the group that administers the Fulbright scholarships.
        He is survived by a son, Nicholas, of Washington and a sister, Catherine Hofgren, also of Washington.
