        Dr. Stuart M. Berger, an author of best-selling diet and health books, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.
        A spokeswoman for the New York City Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove, said that an autopsy had been performed but that the cause of death had not yet been determined.
        Dr. Berger, a health advice columnist for The New York Post since 1984, wrote several books in which he advocated healing and dieting techniques based on nutrition and improving the strength of the body's immune system. He also contended that his programs would result in increased longevity and promised a long life to patients who followed his advice.
        "Dr. Berger's Immune Power Diet" (NAL Books, 1985), a No. 1 best-seller in the advice category, described how Dr. Berger, who was 6 feet 7 1/2 inches tall, reduced his weight to 210 pounds from 420.
        At the time of his death, his weight had risen to 365 pounds, a preliminary autopsy report said.
        Dr. Berger, who was known for the Southampton Diet, also wrote "Forever Young -- 20 Years Younger in 20 Weeks: Dr. Berger's Step-by-Step Rejuvenation Program," (William Morrow & Company, 1989) and "How to be Your Own Nutritionist" (Morrow, 1987).
        For several years, the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct had been investigating Dr. Berger on allegations involving his medical practice on Central Park West in Manhattan. With his death, that investigation is expected to end without any disclosure of the allegations against him.
        Dr. Berger was born in Brooklyn. He atended Harvard College and Tufts University.
        He is survived by his father, Otto, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
