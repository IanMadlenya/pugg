        James Tyeska, a bass-baritone who was also a voice teacher at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Sept. 5 at his home in New York City. He was 43.
        The cause was AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Tyeska sang on the opera and concert stages. He was heard as Escamillo in the Peter Brook production of "La Tragedie de Carmen" at Lincoln Center, and as Malcolm X in "X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X" by Anthony Davis at the first American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia.
        This year, he made his debut with the Deutsche Oper Berlin singing Porgy in "Porgy and Bess," was bass soloist in Verdi's Requiem with the Eastern Connecticut Symphony, and performed in concert with the Tulsa Philharmonic.
        Mr. Tyeska performed the Porgy role with the Houston Symphony, the Fort Worth Symphony, the Philadelphia Pops Orchestra and at the 50th anniversary performance of the Gershwin opera in Charleston, S.C.
        He is survived by his father, James Tyeska Sr., and two sisters, Stephanie Cole of Kansas City, Mo., and Barbara Dixon of Dallas.
