        Rear Admiral William L. Knickerbocker, who retired from the United States Navy in 1963 after a 40-year career, died of cardiac arrest on Tuesday in York, Me., where he lived. He was 84 years old.
        Admiral Knickerbocker was a direct descendant of John van Berghen Knickerbocker, a Dutch naval captain who, after action against the British fleet in July 1665, sailed his ship up the Thames River with a broom at his masthead. The captain's son, James, though wounded in the battle, survived to become a founder of the Knickerbocker family in the Hudson Valley of New York.
        A 1927 graduate of the United States Naval Academy, Admiral Knickerbocker transferred to the Supply Corps in 1935. He commanded a series of bases and held other logistical posts during World War II. From the mid-1950's until his retirement he commanded supply depots in Brooklyn and Bayonne, N.J. He was awarded the Legion of Merit with a gold star.
        After retiring, Admiral Knickerbocker was executive director of the United States Foreign Visitors Association.
        Admiral Knickerbocker's first two wives died. He is survived by his third wife, the former Virginia M. Dalton; a daughter, Anne Michaud of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Phyliss McTiernan of Portsmouth, N.H., and a granddaughter.
