        Dr. Leonard Sidney Rosenfeld, an expert on public health and a retired professor of health administration, died Monday at North Carolina University Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 77 years old and lived in Chapel Hill.
        He died of pneumonia, his wife, the former Irene Kantor, said.
        Dr. Rosenfeld graduated from New York University Medical School in 1937 and had further training at Johns Hopkins University.
        In the 1940's he served for four years in Nicaragua with the Institute for Inter-American Affairs, setting up sanitary programs and health centers.
        Helping to lay the foundation for government-sponsored health care in Canada, he was director of the Saskatchewan Hospital Services Plan. He was also active in setting up prepaid health plans, coordinating hospital planning and community health associations in southern New York State, Boston and Detroit.
        In 1970 he became vice president of New York Medical College and from 1973 until his retirement in 1982 he taught at the University of North Carolina School of Public Health.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lynn Rosenfeld, of Manhattan and a brother, Mortimer, of Brooklyn.
