        Donald D. Jones, a retired ombudsman for The Kansas City Star, died on Sunday at a hospital in Kansas City, Mo. He was 73 and lived in Kansas City.
        The cause was cancer of the bone marrow, the newspaper said.
        Mr. Jones, who was known as Casey, spent much of his career at The Kansas City Times, which The Star absorbed in 1990. He retired in 1994.
        A native of Kingsville, Mo., he worked for The Times as a summer intern in 1949 and joined the staff as a copy editor in 1952 after graduating from the University of Kansas City.
        He served as night city editor, assistant managing editor and in 1981 was named national editor. The next  year he was named ombudsman for The Times and The Star, with responsibility for following up complaints from readers and monitoring the news report for fairness and balance.
        Mr. Jones, a bachelor, left no immediate survivors.
