        Arthur J. McCashin, a rider and jumping-course designer who served as captain of the United States Equestrian Team that won a bronze medal in show jumping at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, died last Saturday at Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church, Va. Mr. McCashin, a resident of Ocala, Fla., was 79 years old and had undergone heart surgery.
        Mr. McCashin, who was inducted into the National Horse Show Hall of Fame in 1986, was known for his innovative course designs that challenged the rider's intelligence as well as the horse's stamina.
        A native of Ireland who came to the United States with his family at the age of 4, Mr. McCashin helped his father train horses in Morristown, N.J., before becoming an acclaimed professional rider in the 1930's.
        After his 1937 marriage to the former Helen Wolcott Bedford, Mr. McCashin gave up professional riding, serving during World War II as a pilot for Colonial Airlines, which operated a civilian supply service for the armed forces. In 1950 he resumed competitive jumping as an amateur member of the nation's first civilian equestrian team.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, James P. McCashin of Dublin; four sons, Arthur Jr., of Mocksville, N.C., Fred B. of Southern Pines, N.C., James P. 2d of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Bruce E. of Palm Beach Fla., and seven grandchildren.
