        Elwood T. Driver, one of America's first black combat pilots and later a high-ranking safety official with two Federal transportation agencies, died March 26 at his home in Reston, Va. He was 70 years old.
        He died of liver cancer, his family said.
        President Jimmy Carter appointed Mr. Driver in 1978 to the National Transportation Safety Board, where he became vice chairman. He directed the 1979 investigation of the American Airlines jetliner crash in Chicago that killed all 271 people on board and two on the ground.  Tuskegee Airman
        Mr. Driver was born in Trenton and graduated from Trenton State College in 1942. He immediately joined the Army Air Corps and became one of the "Tuskegee airmen," named for the location of the Alabama airfield where black fliers trained in the segregated military. Serving in the black 99th Fighter Squadron, he shot down a German plane over the Anzio, Italy, beachhead in 1944.
        He remained in the Air Force until 1962, when he retired as a major to join the North American Aviation Company in California as safety director of its Minuteman missile program.
        The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration hired him in 1967 as director of vehicle crash-worthiness and crash avoidance. In 1978 he went to the National Transportation Safety Board, which oversees the safety of aircraft, ships and trains.
        In 1981 he became a private consultant on safety, based in Rockville, Md. In 1986 he joined the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as director of aircraft management. He retired last fall.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 32 years, the former Shirley Martin; a son, Timothy of Alexandria, Va., by his first wife, from whom he was divorced; two grandchildren; two brothers, Warren Russell Driver and Earl Driver, both of Los Angeles, and a sister, Barbara D. O'Neal of Somerville, N.J.
