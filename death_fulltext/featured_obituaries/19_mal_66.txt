        Abraham Goldin, a scientist emeritus with the National Cancer Institute who was a pioneer in the development of chemotherapy, died of cancer Aug. 5 at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. He was 76 years old and lived in Bethesda.
        Dr. Goldin was associated with the institute for four decades, a period in which he was recognized as a leader in the development of experimental models of human malignancy. He employed the models to design drugs now used in clinical medicine.
        Dr. Goldin joined the National Cancer Institute in 1949. When its clinical center was completed in 1954 he moved to the Bethesda campus as a biologist in the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, where he began his work on experimental drug therapy. He became scientist emeritus in 1983.  He was graduated from Brooklyn College in 1933 and received an M.A. from Columbia University in 1935 and a Ph.D in 1942.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Jessica Wolfe; two daughters, Deborah Meyers of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and Laura Piekarski of Acton, Mass.; two brothers, David of Los Angeles, Calif., and Isaac of West Hampton, L.I.; and three grandchildren.
