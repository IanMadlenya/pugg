        Helen L. Phillips, a lyric-dramatic soprano who preceded Marian Anderson in breaking color barriers at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere in the 1940's and 50's, died on July 27 in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. She was 85.
        The cause was heart failure, her nurse at the Isabella Geriatric Center said.
        In 1947 Ms. Phillips became the first black singer known to have appeared with the Metropolitan Opera Chorus, in what she recalled as an apparently accidental breaking of an unofficial color barrier.
        The stage manager at the opera had called her agent seeking the agent's best soprano because several chorus members were missing; when Ms. Phillips arrived, she remembered, he looked at her twice, then told her to hurry up and go backstage.
        ''I just slipped in,'' Ms. Phillips would tell friends. ''Then after the performance, I slipped back out again.''
        Her groundbreaking status was confirmed by Jeff McMillan, an archivist at the Met, who said there had been no written policy barring blacks from performing there.
        The first black chorister to be granted a contract was Elinor Harper, who made her debut at the opera in 1962.
        Ms. Phillips was also the first African-American soloist with Edwin Franko Goldman's Band, which played in Central Park in the 1940's and 50's.
        After World War II, Ms. Phillips made more than 500 concert appearances for the State Department in Austria and West Germany, then made her Town Hall debut in 1953.
        She appeared as a soloist with symphonies in St. Louis and Madrid and the St. Louis Opera, and played Queenie in the 1954 production of ''Show Boat'' at City Center in New York.
        Ms. Phillips, a native of St. Louis and a graduate of Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Mo., became a schoolteacher and a vocal coach later in her career.
        She leaves no immediate survivors.
