        John Brennan, a nationally recognized expert on polling who for the last four years directed the Los Angeles Times Poll, died on Sunday at Midway Hospital in  Los Angeles. He was 41 and lived in nearby Marina del Rey.
        The cause of death was a stroke related to brain cancer, The Los Angeles Times reported.
        Since joining the Times poll as its director, Mr. Brennan had overseen groundbreaking surveys among Vietnamese-Americans and Korean-Americans in Southern California and Roman Catholic priests and nuns throughout the United States.  For surveys of Americans leaving the voting booths in the 1992 Presidential election, his poll was the only alternative to Voter Research and Surveys, a pool effort of four television networks, to which many leading newspapers subscribed.
        Mr. Brennan attended Boston College and started his career at the Urban Institute in Washington in 1976. He subsequently worked for the Roper Organization and took polls for The Daily News of New York from 1980 to 1990. While in New York, he was also host on a weekly classical jazz program on radio  station WEVD for four years.
        He is survived by his father, John W. Brennan Sr. of Ocean Grove, N.J.
