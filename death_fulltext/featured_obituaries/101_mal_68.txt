        Walter Landor, founder of an industrial design firm that created logos for some of the world's largest and best-known corporations, died on Friday in Tiburon, Calif. He was 81 and lived in San Francisco and Saint Helena, Calif.
        He had been in bad health for several years, said a spokesman for Landor Associates, the firm Mr. Landor founded.
        During his more than 50 years in design, Mr. Landor helped to create identities and logos for a wide variety of companies, including Levi Strauss, General Electric, Fuji Film and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing. One of his best-known designs was the script for Coca-Cola.
        In recognition of his work, the National Museum of American History in Washington established a permanent collection of Mr. Landor's designs and packaging last year.
        Born in Munich, Mr. Landor left Germany in 1931 to complete his education at the Goldsmith College School of Art at London University. Four years later he helped to found Britain's first industrial design consulting firm, the Industrial Design Partnership. In 1936, at age 23, he became the youngest Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.
        He came to the United States in 1939 and moved to San Francisco, where, in 1941, he founded Landor Associates.
        From 1964 until the late 1980's he conducted his firm's business from a ferryboat, the Klamath, docked at a San Francisco pier.
        The firm grew to a worldwide staff of more than 300, with 17 offices in more than a dozen countries. Landor Associates was sold in September 1989 to Young & Rubicam Inc., the international marketing communications company.
        Mr. Landor is survived by his wife, Josephine Martinelli Landor, of San Francisco; two daughters, Lynn Landor of Berkeley, Calif., and Susan Landor Keegan of Sausalito, Calif., and four grandchildren.
