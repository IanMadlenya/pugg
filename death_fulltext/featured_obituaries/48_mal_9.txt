        Harry Drackert, a former dude ranch operator whose ranches housed celebrities and others in search of quick divorces in Nevada in the 1940's to the 1960's, died Dec. 26 at St. Mary's Hospital in Reno. He was 86 years old and lived in Reno.
        Mr. Drackert died of heart failure, his wife, the former Joan Abry, said.
        With his wife, Mr. Drackert operated three dude ranches where men and women could stay as residents of Nevada for the six weeks necessary to file for divorce. Among their guests were the playwright Arthur Miller and the author Saul Bellow. The ranches operated from 1945 to 1976.
        In 1962, Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller was a guest at the Drackerts' Donner Trail ranch in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada while she obtained a divorce from Nelson A. Rockefeller, then Governor of New York.
        Mr. Drackert was born in Pony, Mont., and was a rodeo champion in the late 1920's and early 1930's.
        Besides his wife, there are no immediate survivors.
