        Thomas F. Hennessy, an architect in Manhattan for four decades, died on Tuesday in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 80 years old and had lived for many years in East Williston, L.I.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Hennessy, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, designed the Top of the Fair Restaurant, now Terrace on the Park, in Flushing Meadows, Queens; the Shea Stadium Diamond Club and the Inn of the Clock at United Nations Plaza.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Kathryn Dunlop; a son, Paul, of San Jose, Calif.; a daughter, Joan Syms of Newton Upper Falls, Mass., and four grandchildren.
