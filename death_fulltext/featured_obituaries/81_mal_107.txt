        Fred C. Shapiro, a journalist who covered the Chinese Government's suppression of the 1989 anti-Government demonstration at Tiananmen Square for the New Yorker magazine, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 62.
        His wife, Iris, said he had been under treatment for pancreatic cancer.
        Mr. Shapiro won an Overseas Press Club prize for his Tiananmen Square coverage. After going to China in 1987, he worked as an editor for the official New China News Agency.
        Chinese students and workers began the Tiananmen protest in May 1989, seeking democratic reforms. In June, Chinese troops, using tanks and armored personnel carriers, fired on the protesters, killing hundreds, although some estimates put the death toll at 1,000 or more. Mr. Shapiro suspended his work for the news agency, covered the story for The New Yorker, then returned to work at the agency.
        Mr. Shapiro won the Robert F. Kennedy journalism award in 1969 for his New Yorker articles on George Whitmore, who was wrongly accused and convicted of the murders of Janice Wylie and Emily Hoffert in 1963 in an apartment they shared on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Shapiro's survivors include a son, Paul, of New York, and a daughter, Mary, of Austin, Tex.
