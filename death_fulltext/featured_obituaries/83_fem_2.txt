        Adele Earnest, one of the founders of the Museum of American Folk Art, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Wash. She was 92.
        In 1961 Mrs. Earnest was one of a group of six founding trustees of the museum and helped its early development at 2 Lincoln Square in Manhattan.
        She made several significant donations and contributions, including an 1840 weather vane depicting Archangel Gabriel that became a symbol for the museum. She compiled two books, "The Art of the Decoy: American Bird Carving" and "Folk Art in America: A Personal View."
        Mrs. Earnest was born in Waltham, Mass. She graduated from Wellesley College. In 1929 she was stage manager for Eva Le Gallienne's 14th Street Repertory Theater. In 1939 she established the Stony Point Art Gallery in Stony Point, N.Y., where she specialized in decoys and folk sculpture.
        Mrs. Earnest's husband, Joel, died many years ago. She is survived by her son, Eugene, of Anacortes, Wash., and two grandchildren.
