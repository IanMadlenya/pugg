        Walter E. Kingston, an authority on powder metallurgy, died of cancer of the liver on July 4 at his home in West Caldwell, N.J. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Kingston, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spent many years with Sylvania Electric Products Inc., eventually becoming vice president of its atomic-energy division.
        After his retirement from Sylvania in the early 1970's, he became a consultant in powder metallurgy, the process of reducing metals to powder and reshaping them into solids under heat and pressure. He was the author of the textbook, ''The Physics of Powder Metallurgy.''
        He is survived by his wife, Gertrude; two daughters, JoAnne Dreier of Huntington, L.I., and Jane Kingston-Kettler of San Francisco; a sister, Gladys Shaw of Bowdoinham, Me., and two grandchildren.
