        Prof. Mieczeslaw Maneli, an expert on international law and political science, died on April 9 in New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 72 and lived in Forest Hills.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Professor Maneli was dismissed as department chairman on the law faculty of Warsaw University in Poland in 1968 for political reasons. He taught law and political science at Queens College, City University of New York, since then.
        At his death, Professor Maneli, known as Mietic, was also chairman of the Council for Study of Ethics and Public Policy at Queens College.
        He was the author of 12 books, including "Freedom and Tolerance" in 1988 and "Juridical Positivism and Human Rights" in 1983.
        A native of Poland, he was a resistance fighter and Auschwitz survivor in World War II. After the war he graduated from Warsaw University and started teaching law in 1949.
        In the 1950's and 1960's, he worked with the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam as legal adviser and Polish delegate. The commission tried to bring peace to Indochina, and he was an important liaison between Hanoi and Saigon in that fruitless effort.
        He was removed from the law faculty by order of the Communist Polish Government, which called his behavior "in striking discord with socialist ideology."
        Professor Maneli is survived by his companion, Stephane Silvers; a daughter, Elizabeth Maneli of Forest Hills; a son, Lester of Houston, and two granddaughters.
