        John S. Nagel, a retired Ford Foundation executive who focused on family planning in Latin America, died on Saturday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 81.
        The cause was complications of lung cancer, his family said.
        A graduate of Northwestern University, Mr. Nagel spent 25 years working for management consulting and advertising concerns in the Chicago area before he joined the Ford Foundation in 1962. He represented it in Mexico and Central America and later headed its office for Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay.
        He transferred to New York headquarters in 1968 as a program officer for population programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. He returned to work in Mexico in 1973 and retired to Naples in 1977.
        Mr. Nagel is survived by his wife of 59 years, Elizabeth Barker Nagel; three daughters, Lyn Slater of Mequon, Wis., Diane Johnson of Arnold, Md., and Joan Spector of Shorewood, Wis.; a brother, William R., of La Grange Park, Ill., and 10 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.
