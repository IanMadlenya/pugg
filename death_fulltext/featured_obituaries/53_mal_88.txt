        John T. Dudich, a public relations representative for many classical music artists, died on Sunday in Anaheim, Calif. He was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said Steven Kitezh, a friend.
        Mr. Dudich represented such artists as the Tokyo and Alexander String Quartets, the pianist Ruth Laredo and the violinist Daniel Heifetz along with the North American tours of the Japanese performing group Kodo.
        A native of Akron, Ohio, Mr. Dudich came to New York in 1970, and five years later became the program coordinator for the Off Broadway theater complex Cubiculo. He was the general manager of Kazuko Hillyer International from 1977 to 1982 and the associate director of Hamlin/Landau Management from 1982 to 1984, when he started his own public relations firm.
        He is survived by his parents, John and Dolores Dudich of Anaheim; four brothers, Sam, of Akron; Steven, of Arroyo Grande, Calif.; Mike, of Anaheim, and Nick, of La Habla, Calif., and two sisters, Jennifer Charles of Irvine, Calif., and Cheryl Dietrich of Diamond Bar, Calif.
