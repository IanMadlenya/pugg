        Bob Kowalski, a dancer and choreographer who helped found Works Contemporary Dance, a Hartford dance company, died of AIDS on Tuesday. He was 37 years old.
        Mr. Kowalski, who trained at the Hartford Ballet in the early 1970's, once described his dance company as ''the group that can dance in sneakers in the park or on street corners.''
        The company, founded in 1983 by Mr. Kowalski and Ted Hershey, developed a reputation for its humorous, energetic and widely eclectic style, mixing jazz, modern and classical dance.
        Mr. Kowalski's final work as a choreographer, ''Shadows and Light,'' dealt with the AIDS crisis and was presented last fall.
        He is survived by his mother, three sisters and a brother.
