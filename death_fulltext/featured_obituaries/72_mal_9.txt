        Roger Halle, a research architect who devoted himself to reducing the cost of construction, died on Thursday at Hartford Hospital. He was 74 and lived in Salisbury, Conn.
        Mr. Halle died from a stroke a week after undergoing coronary bypass surgery, said his son, Peter Halle.
        After receiving a graduate degree in architecture from Princeton University, Mr. Halle worked for several architectural firms. He worked under Edward Durrell Stone and Wallace K. Harrison during the late 1940's.
        He helped produce the design for the United Nations Secretariat building and later started his own firm in New York City and Caracas, Venezuela. A major part of his career was devoted to developing ways to reduce the cost of construction, and he held patents in 17 countries for his work.
        Mr. Halle also helped in the preservation of the Halle Ravine and other nature preserves in Pound Ridge, N.Y., and was a founding trustee of the Lower Hudson chapter of the Nature Conservancy.
        In addition to his son, Peter, of Falls Village, Conn., Mr. Halle is survived by his wife, Vlasta Smolka Halle; a daughter, Titi, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
