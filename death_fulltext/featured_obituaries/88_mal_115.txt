        Rudolf Muhsam, a leading behind-the-scenes figure in the world of bridge, died on Tuesday at the Fort Tryon nursing home in Manhattan. He was 88 and died of cancer, said Patricia Muhsam, a relative.
        Mr. Muhsam worked as an engineer in his native Berlin, where he was also a bridge tournament organizer and a respected player just below the top rank.
        In 1937, at the World Bridge Championships in Budapest, he met the bridge champion Ely Culbertson, who arranged for Mr. Muhsam's admission to the United States.
        For the next 35 years he was secretary of the world's most celebrated bridge club, the Cavendish in Manhattan. He was responsible for finance and admissions policy, and became friends with many top American players.
        He is survived by a sister, Louise Tiktin of Melbourne, Australia.
