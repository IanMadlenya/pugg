        Morton Edell, an executive in the cosmetics and vitamin industries, died on Dec. 30 in Sarasota, Fla., at age 88. The cause of death was lung cancer, according to his son David.
        Born in New York, Mr. Edell worked as a clothing salesman and a stockbroker before founding Morton Edell & Company, a stock brokerage firm. In 1941 he founded the Vitamin Corporation of America, a vitamin provider, and helped persuade drug retailers to take vitamins from behind the counter and put them in display units in the front of the store.
        Mr. Edell resigned from the Vitamin Corporation in 1955 and in 1962 was elected president and chief executive of Hazel Bishop Inc., a cosmetics and toiletries manufacturer. He changed its name to Bishop Industries in 1967 as the company was going through what he said was a ''vigoruous diversification program.'' He retired in 1969.
        Mr. Edell is survived by his wife, Joan, of Sarasota, N.Y.; two sons, David of Ancram, N.Y., and Dennis of Toronto; and a daughter, Dale Tessler of Bradenton, Fla. He is also survived by a brother, Philip, of San Diego, and a sister, Dorothy Diener, of East Orange, N.J.
