        Adolph Oscar Krisch, a founder of what became the largest Holiday Inn franchise in the United States, died at his home Thursday, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, a medical examiner said. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Krisch, who lived in Roanoke, Va., had been ill for some time, a spokesman for the family said.
        He and his brother, Joel, also of Roanoke, built their first motel near Hollins, Va., in 1956 and soon built others. Their original $40,000 investment eventually became American Motor Inns, the largest Holiday Inn franchise in the country until it was sold for $350 million in 1984. Mr. Krisch retired in 1985.
        Besides his brother, Mr. Krisch is survived by his wife, the former Heidi Feller; two daughters, Victoria Mills of Chicago and Julie Krisch of Arlington, Va., and four grandchildren.
