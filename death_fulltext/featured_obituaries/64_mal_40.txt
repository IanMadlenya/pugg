        H. Bert Mack, a business executive and philanthropist who was active in Jewish communal affairs, died on Friday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 82 years old and also had a home in the Jamaica Estates section of Queens.
        His family said he died of lymphoma, said Sam Hartstein, director of public relations at Yeshiva University, where Mr. Mack was a longtime member of the Board of Overseers.
        Mr. Mack was for half a century the chairman of the board of the Mack Company, a privately held real estate and investment concern, which is based in Rochelle Park, N.J. He still held the post at his death.
        In the 1960's the company bought thousands of acres of undeveloped land in the Meadowlands area of New Jersey. It built warehouses and office buildings on that land and elsewhere in New Jersey and in the Northeast. Recent projects include developments in Arizona and Florida.  Benefactor and Philanthropist
        Mr. Mack, a founder of Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, supported other parts and programs of the university.  He was also a benefactor of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, Queens, and St. Mary's Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla.
        He was a former member of the board of directors of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and a founder, board member and trustee of the Hillcrest Jewish Center in Queens. His other philanthropies included the Jewish Federation/United Jewish Appeal in Palm Beach.
        Mr. Mack was also a member of the New York Statue of Liberty Centennial Commission and was on the board of the New York State Commission to Commemorate the 200th Anniversary of the American Revolution.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Kaufman, and four sons: Earle, William and Fredric, all of Manhattan, and David of Kings Point, L.I.  Mr. Mack is also survived by four grandsons.
