        Dr. Uwe K. Brinkmann, a Harvard epidemiologist and an expert in tropical diseases and health care in developing countries, died last Saturday while traveling on field research in Fortaleza, Brazil. He was 53 and lived in Brookline, Mass.
        He died of a heart attack, according to the Harvard School of Public Health, where he had been an associate professor for the last three years.
        Dr. Brinkmann, a native of Hamburg, Germany, held a medical degree from the University of Berlin, a diploma in tropical public health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a doctorate in epidemiology and tropical medicine from the University of Hamburg.
        He was the author of nearly 100 scientific papers on the control of tropical diseases like malaria and schistosomiasis and recently wrote about the AIDS epidemic.
        During his 23-year career Dr. Brinkmann worked throughout the third world, including Ethiopia, Guatemala, Thailand and the West African countries of Burkina Faso and Togo. He joined the Harvard faculty in 1990 as an associate professor in the departments of epidemiology, population and international health, and tropical public health.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Agnes Brinkmann, who collaborated with him in his scientific work, and a son, Patrick, of Munich, Germany.
