        Mac Brier, a men's clothing manufacturer, died of a rare blood disease on Sunday at Bates Hospital in Oakland, Calif. He was 73 years old and lived in Oakland.
        Mr. Brier was a former owner and chairman of several clothing firms, including Petrocelli Clothes Inc., the Eagle Shirt Company and Carlo Palazzi Designs. He attended City College of New York and graduated from the Philadelphia Textile Institute.
        In World War II he served in the Quartermaster Corps dealing with textile manufacturers. After his discharge, he was an agent for various textile mills and in 1948 formed Export Import Woolens Company in Manhattan to import textiles from Italy and Japan. He sold his interests in 1971 and was a consultant before becoming a partner in a company that bought Petrocelli in 1974. The partnership was dissolved in 1980 and he was again a consultant to manufacturers before moving to California in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, Edith; two sons, Robert, of North Dartmouth, Mass., and Andrew, of Oakland; two sisters, Ethel Brodsky and Ceil Hillman, both of West Palm Beach, Fla.; a brother, Hyman, of Miami, and two grandchildren.
