        Jack Douglas, an Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and a frequent guest on Jack Paar's television talk show in the late 1950's and 60's, died Tuesday at West Hills Humana Hospital, where he was admitted four days earlier with pneumonia. He was 80 years old.
        ''He saw the world from a different angle than the rest of us,'' said George Schlatter, who was the creator and producer of the television show ''Laugh-In.'' ''He was not only funny, he was nice.''
        Mr. Douglas wrote for the ''Laugh-In'' hosts, Dan Rowan and Dick Martin, as well as for Bob Hope, Woody Allen, Red Skelton, Ozzie and Harriet Nelson and Bing Crosby. He and three other writers won an Emmy in 1954 for best-written comedy material.
        Mr. Douglas is survived by his wife, Reiko, a singer and comedian who often joined him on the Paar show, and two sons, Bobby and Timothy.
