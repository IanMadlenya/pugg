        Dr. Jay Morris Arena, former director of Duke University's Poison Control Center and inventor of the child-proof safety cap, died on Friday of a heart attack. He was 86.
        Dr. Arena served on the Duke pediatrics faculty for 42 years, retiring in 1979. He directed the university's Poison Control Center from its beginning in 1953 until his retirement.
        Dr. Arena and Dr. Wilburt Davison dean of the Duke Medical School, developed index cards on types of poisoning that led to an inventory of treatments.
        In the 1940's, Dr. Arena's work with a manufacturer of children's aspirin led to the production of the first child-proof safety cap.
        Dr. Arena was president or a member of the executive board of the American Association of Poison Control Centers for 20 years.
        The Federal Department of Health, Education and Welfare hired him as a consultant on child safety and on hazardous substances, and he advised the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
