        Rear Adm. Walter Chilcott Ford, a destroyer commander in World War II and the executive director of the newborn Central Intelligence Agency in the later 1940's, died on Saturday at the Mariner Health facility in Bethesda, Md. He lived in Annapolis and would have turned 96 this week.
        Admiral Ford spent 40 years in the Navy and the Maritime Administration. After his retirement in 1961, he worked as a maritime consultant and corporate director.
        Born in Buffalo, Walter Ford graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1925. He reached the rank of captain soon after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and the United States entered the war.
        Serving in the South Pacific, he commanded the U.S.S. Perkins and Destroyer Squadron 23 and saw combat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Guadalcanal campaign. His conduct at the Coral Sea earned him a Bronze Star, and his night operations against Japanese forces at Guadalcanal brought a Silver Star and assignment as administrative aide to the under secretary of the Navy.
        In 1947, Congress decreed the transformation of Gen. William J. Donovan's Office of Strategic Services into the C.I.A. Admiral Ford was named its executive director and served until 1949, after which he was assistant naval chief of staff for intelligence in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean command.
        He transferred to the Maritime Administration in 1954 and served intermittently as deputy and acting administrator until his retirement. He instituted various shipping programs, encouraged research and oversaw the construction of the country's first nuclear merchantship, the Savannah.
        Admiral Ford is survived by a daughter, Barbara Rosin of Columbia, S.C.; 9 grandchildren, and 18 great-grandchildren. His wife of 66 years, Channez Gates Ford, died in 1992.
