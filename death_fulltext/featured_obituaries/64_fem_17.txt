        Constance Montague Montgomery, who at the age of 66 started a successful fashion designing career that continued for 26 years, died on Wednesday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan.
        She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan. She died a few days after suffering a stroke, according to Ralph Allen, a friend and co-executor of her estate.
        Mrs. Montgomery worked for several leading fashion companies, including Bill Blass, Geoffrey Beene, Norman Norell and Donald Brooks. She also had a private clientele with prominent customers.
        She specialized in knitting sweaters, dresses and evening clothes and also knitted jewelry. She was noted for her designs and unusual materials, which included metallic thread and fur. Most of her creations were one of a kind, but some were reproduced. She remained active in her work until her illness.
        For more than 40 years she was married to James Montgomery, the playwright who wrote "Nothing but the Truth" and the book for the musical "Irene," among other works. When he died in 1966, she expanded her knitting hobby into a full-time business.
        In the 1970's she was an associate producer with Harry Rigby for the revival of "Irene," starring Debbie Reynolds.
        Mrs. Montgomery was born in London and moved to New York City as a child with her family.
        There are no immediate survivors.
