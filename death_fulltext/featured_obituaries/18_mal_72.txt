        With his business partner, Anne Livet, Mr. Reichard started and directed Art Against AIDS, one of the largest fund-raising efforts for AIDS research and education. In 1987, the drive raised $2.5 million through exhibitions of the work of more than 600 artists at more than 70 galleries in New York City.
        A native of Southbury, Md., Mr. Reichard began a company to manage the careers of visual artists in 1975. In the late 1970's he was instrumental in establishing P.S. 1, a leading exhibition space for contemporary art in Long Island City, Queens. Since 1979 he had been a partner with Ms. Livet in Livet Reichard, a leading arts management firm in New York City.
        He is survived by his mother, Mrs. Juanita Reichard Cochrane, and his stepfather, Robert B. Cochrane, of Easton, Md., and by his brother, Charles S. Reichard Jr.
