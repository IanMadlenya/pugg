        Peter Tali Coleman, a native of American Samoa who was its first popularly elected Governor, from 1978 to 1985, died on Monday in Honolulu. He was 77 and a longtime resident of Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa.
        He had liver cancer, Agence France-Presse reported.
        Mr. Coleman, a lawyer, was appointed by the Eisenhower Administration as Governor of the unincorporated territory in 1956, and held the office until 1961. After becoming the first popularly elected Governor in 1978, he was re-elected in 1980. He was prevented by the territory's Constitution from running for another term in 1984, but five years later he was again elected Governor, serving to 1993.
        He also was the founding chairman of the territory's Republican Party, serving from 1985 to 1988.
        American Samoa consists of seven small South Pacific islands, with a total area of 76 square miles, and is 2,300 miles southwest of Hawaii. It is the most southerly of all lands under United States sovereignty, and has been under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department since 1951. Its population was 46,773 in 1990.
        Mr. Coleman was born in Pago Pago to William Patrick Coleman and the former Amata Aumua. After serving with the Army in the Pacific in World War II, he received a bachelor's degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1949, and later received a law degree from Georgetown.
        Mr. Coleman was a Pacific area analyst at the Interior Department in Washington in 1951 and 1952; a public defender, planning officer and customs officer in American Samoa from 1952 to 1955, and the territory's Attorney General in 1955 and 1956 before being appointed Governor.
        From 1961 to 1965 Mr. Coleman was district administrator of the Marshall Islands, part of the United States-administered Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and was the Acting High Commissioner of the Trust Territory when he resigned in 1977 to run for governor.
        Governors appointed by Washington served in American Samoa until 1977, when a plebiscite in the territory mandated its first election for governor. Mr. Coleman defeated his Democratic opponent, Aifilili P. Lutali, after a campaign centered largely on economic issues.
        Mr. Coleman's influence extended well beyond his home islands. A champion of regional cooperation, he was a co-founder, in 1980, of the Pacific Basin Development Council.i  In 1980, he and the Governors of two other United States possessions in the Pacific, Guam and the Northern Marianas, joined with Gov. George R. Ariyoshi of Hawaii to draw up a $1.4 billion, five-year economic development plan for their islands.
        Among Mr. Coleman's survivors are his wife of 55 years, the former Nora Stewart, and 12 children: William Patrick, Peter Talifiliga, Milton John, Amata, Bruce Joseph, Charles Ulualofaigna, Richard James, Paul Vaelaa, Barrett Francis, Alan David, Sina Ellen and Limonmon Mary.
