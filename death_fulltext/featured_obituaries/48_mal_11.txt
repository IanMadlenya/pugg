        Oliver Daniel, a musicologist who was a producer and director of documentaries and dramatic programs for CBS Radio and later a vice president of Broadcast Music Inc., died on Sunday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 79 years old.
        He died in his sleep of natural causes, said a friend, Donald Ott.
        Mr. Daniel joined CBS in 1942 as musical director of its educational division. From 1947 to 1954 he produced and directed music programs for CBS, including "20th-Century Concert Hall," "Invitation to Music," "The Music Room," and broadcasts of the New York Philharmonic and the Louisville Symphony.
        He was also coordinating manager of the American Composers Alliance and editor of its bulletin for many years. In 1954, Mr. Daniel moved to Associated Music Publishers, a subsidiary of BMI, as director of contemporary-music projects.
        He had a longtime association with Leopold Stokowski that began when he produced programs featuring the conductor on CBS Radio. He wrote an 1,100-page biography, "Stokowski: A Counterpoint of View," published by Dodd, Mead in 1982.
        Mr. Daniel was born in De Pere, Wis. He studied at St. Norbert College in Wisconsin and with pianists in Amsterdam, Berlin and Boston before teaching at the Boston Conservatory from 1936 to 1938 and at Marot College in Connecticut from 1939 to 1942.
        There are no immediate survivors.
