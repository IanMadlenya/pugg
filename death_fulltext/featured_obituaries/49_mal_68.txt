        John Steinbeck 4th, a writer and son of the Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck, died Thursday at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, Calif., where he was undergoing surgery for a herniated disc. He was 44 years old and lived in Encinitas.
        A nursing supervisor, Marlys Weberg, said Saturday that Mr. Steinbeck had been admitted to the hospital on Thursday, gone into surgery, and then suffered cardiac arrest. The San Diego County Coroner's office performed an autopsy, but the results were not available yesterday.
        Mr. Steinbeck, a freelance writer who had contributed to many magazines, including The New Yorker. He was the author of a book, "In Touch," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1969), about his experiences in Vietnam with the Army and his return home, which he described as a transition from "hawk" to "dove."
        In a New York Times book review of "In Touch," Jonathan Segal wrote that Mr. Steinbeck "is extremely honest in a time when honesty is badly needed."
        The younger Mr. Steinbeck came to public attention when he wrote in the magazine "The Washingtonian" in 1967 that three-fourths of the American soldiers in Vietnam smoked marijuana.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Steinbeck, who had been a recovering alcoholic for three years, was working on his autobiography, "Legacy," in which he said he intended to examine the heredity in addiction and try to link what he believed to be his father's alcoholism to his own.
        Suriving are his wife, Nancy, three children, Megan, Blake and Michael, and a brother, Thomas.
