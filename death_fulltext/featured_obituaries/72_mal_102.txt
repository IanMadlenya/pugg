        Richard Waring, the actor who created the role of Morgan Evans, the rude Welsh coal miner who is transformed by a sympathetic teacher in the Broadway production of "The Corn Is Green," by Emlyn Williams, died on Monday at the City Island home of his former wife, Kathy Waring. He was 82.
        He died of natural causes, Mrs. Waring said.
        Mr. Waring was born in Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, England. His theatrical career blossomed in New York City in 1931 when, at 21, he played opposite Eva LeGallienne in "Romeo and Juliet," "Camille" and "Cradle Song" in her Civic Repertory Theater.
        In 1940, Mr. Waring established himself as a commercial actor playing opposite Ethel Barrymore in "The Corn Is Green." He appeared in the same role in a revival with Miss LeGallienne, and was signed to play the role again in the movie verson opposite Bette Davis, but entered the Army during World War II before filming could begin. He did, however, make one film with Ms. Davis, "Mr. Skeffington," which was released in 1944. Back to Broadway
        After his discharge, Mr. Waring returned to Broadway as the Duke of Buckingham in "Henry VIII," John Shand in James M. Barrie's "What Every Woman Knows" and the Captain in Shaw's "Androcles and the Lion."
        Although he became a familiar face on television, Hollywood largely eluded Mr. Waring and he concentrated on Broadway.
        As a statuesque actor with a classical ring to his voice, he was rarely absent from any important production of Shakespeare mounted in the New York area in the 1950's and 60's. At the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., he was Cassio in "Othello," with Alfred Drake and Earl Hyman; Antonio in "The Merchant of Venice," with Katharine Hepburn as Portia; Oberon in "A Midsummer Night's Dream," with June Havoc as Titania, and Macduff in "Macbeth," with Pat Hingle and Jessica Tandy.
        He is survived by a brother, Peter John Stephens of London.
