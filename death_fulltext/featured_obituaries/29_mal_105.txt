        Mr. Ross was born in Pittsburgh, but moved to France when he was 12 years old. He studied the harpsichord and organ at the Paris and Nice Conservatories, and in 1971 won the Bruges International Competition, in Belgium.
        In 1979 Mr. Ross began recording the complete keyboard works of Scarlatti - 555 sonatas. It was a project that occupied him through the Scarlatti tercentenary in 1985. When the first installment, of 30 sonatas, was released in 1980, Peter G. Davis wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Ross ''possesses all the necessary virtuoso flair and stylish sensitivity to bring this exciting music bounding to life.'' Erato released the complete set on 34 compact disks in Europe last year.
