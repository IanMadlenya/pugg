        Mr. Bolloten, who was born in Wales, covered the war as a correspondent for United Press in 1936. After leaving Spain he moved to Mexico where, in collaboration with his first wife, Gladys Eve Green, he spent years assembling material on the war, a collection that is now at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
        Mr. Bolloten wrote three books on the subject, ''The Grand Camouflage,'' published in 1961; ''The Spanish Revolution,'' published in 1979, and the recently completed third volume, ''The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution.'' He came to the United States in 1949 and lived for many years in Sunnyvale, working as a real estate executive.
