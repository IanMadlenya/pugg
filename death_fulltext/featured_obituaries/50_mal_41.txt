        Austin Moore Brues, a pioneer in radiation biology who studied the effects of the atomic bombs dropped on Japan, died Feb. 27 at his home in Hinsdale, Ill. He was 85 years old.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Dr. Brues was the senior biologist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois from 1946 to 1971. He became a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago in 1945 and was named professor emeritus in 1979.
        A 1930 graduate of Harvard University Medical School, he studied the biological effects of exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. He served as an expert to the Secretary of War in a study of casualties of the bombings at Nagasaki and Hiroshima and was a consultant to national and international commissions studying the long-term effects of radiation.
        He wrote hundreds of articles on radiation. He was a past president of the Radiation Research Society and of the American Association for Cancer Research.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred; a daughter, Nancy Carter Noven of Chicago; a son, Charles, of Houston; a sister, Alice Brues of Boulder, Colo., and two grandchildren.
