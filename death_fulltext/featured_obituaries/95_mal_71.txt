        Sir Geoffrey Rudolph Elton, an eminent Tudor scholar and Regius professor emeritus of history at Cambridge University, died on Dec. 4 in his home in Cambridge, England. He was 73.
        He suffered a heart attack, according to Patrick Collinson, the present Regius professor.
        Firmly traditionalist in his interpretation of history, Sir Geoffrey was a prolific author on England under the Tudors and Stuarts, on Cromwell, the Reformation in Europe and the political reforms and upheavals of the era.
        Reviewers noted the crisp, lucid and authoritative style of his writing. And he brought the same energy to his lectures in the classroom. At Cambridge, he was regarded as a sensitive and generous guide to the young.
        He held the Regius chair, a high distinction, from 1983 to 1988, when he retired. But he continued his writing and remained a fellow of Clare College, a position he had taken in 1954. He was knighted in 1986.
        Sir Geoffrey was born Gottfried Ehrenberg in Tubingen, the son of Victor Ehrenberg, a German classical scholar. The family moved to Prague in 1929 when his father obtained a chair at the German university there.
        He was in his final year at the Stephansgymnasium when his family left for Britain in 1939, a month before the Germans occupied Prague. He went to school in Wales, but his English was not yet good enough for him to qualify for a history scholarship at Oxford.
        The British Army called him up in 1943, and he served in the infantry and intelligence in the Italian campaign, though he was not naturalized until 1947. The army ordered him to Anglicize his name.
        He earned a doctorate at the University of London in 1947 and started at Cambridge University as an assistant lecturer in history in 1949.
        He took a determined stand in the argument between the traditionalists and the "cliometricians," so called after Clio, the muse of history. Cliometrics applies computer-generated statistical data and analysis to the study of history. Professor Elton argued the matter with Robert W. Fogel of the University of Chicago in their book "Which Road to the Past?" (Yale, 1984).
        Among his other titles were such classic textbooks as "England Under the Tudors" (Routledge; 3d rev. ed., 1991), "Reformation Europe, 1517-1559" (Harper & Row; 1966), "Reform and Reformation" (Harvard, 1977), and "The Parliament of England, 1559-1581" (Cambridge, 1986).
        He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and served as its publications secretary from 1981 to 1990.
        He is survived by his wife of 42 years, Sheila Lambert, who is also a historian.
