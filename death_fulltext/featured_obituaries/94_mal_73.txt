        Brian Dutton, a scholar of medieval Spanish literature, died on Oct. 21 at his home in Oak Park, Ill. He was 59 and also had a home in Madison, Wis., where he taught at the University of Wisconsin.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his daughter Anna Dutton, also of Oak Park.
        Professor Dutton wrote a seven-volume work, "El Cancionero del Siglo XV" ( Universidad de Salamanca, 1990-1991), that catalogued Spanish lyric poetry from 1360 to 1520. He also wrote an eight-volume edition of the works of the Spanish medieval poet Gonzalo Berceo.
        Born in England, Professor Dutton received bachelor's and master's at the University of London's Kings College, and a doctorate at the university's Birkbeck College.  He came to the United States in 1966 as a researcher and adviser at the Armed Forces Office of Scientific Research. Professor Dutton headed the Spanish department at the University of Illinois in Chicago from 1970 to 1974 and was director of graduate studies and a professor of Spanish literature at the university campus in Urbana from 1976 to 1986.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Brunella Notarmarco-Dutton; two children from a previous marriage, Andrew Dutton and Rachel Grundsman, both of Yorkshire, England, and a sister, Anne Jackson of North Staffordshire, England.
