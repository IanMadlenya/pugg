        Solomon Cutner, a British pianist known to the musical public as Solomon and greatly admired for his immaculate, stately renditions of works by Schubert, Beethoven and others, died on Feb. 2 in London. He was 85 years old.
        Although his reputation spread in this country once he began to make recordings, Solomon was always known best in Europe and his native England, where he spent most of his career and attained something of a cult status among musicians. His performances in the United States were infrequent but always met with widespread critical praise. 'Most Civilized'
        Reviewing a New York recital by Solomon in 1955, Harold Schonberg of The New York Times called him ''that most civilized of pianists.'' Writing in The New Grove Dictionary, William S. Mann described him as ''an evocative poet.''
        Born in London's East End, the son of a tailor, Solomon began piano studies at the age of 7 with Mathilde Verne, a pupil of Clara Schumann, and made his debut a year later playing Tchaikovsky's First Concerto at Queen's Hall. He followed this appearance with a tour of England and a performance at Buckingham Palace.
        Solomon's New York debut came in 1926. He performed at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, but did not play again in this country until 10 years later.
        During World War II, the pianist gave many recitals for Allied troops in Europe. He played often in Europe during the 1950's and early 60's - making recordings of the standard piano repertory - until 1965, when a stroke ended his performing career.
