        Lee Coffey, an insurance company executive and philanthropist, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 93.
        Mr. Coffey, who lived in Manhattan, died of a stroke, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was an associate of Hogg Robinson, a New York insurance company with which he remained active until shortly before his illness. He was a founder of Seligman & Coffey, an insurance company that was sold to Hogg Robinson 20 years ago.
        Mr. Coffey, a native of Brooklyn, was the son of Fannie and Samuel Coffey, who in 1907 helped found the Brooklyn Hebrew Home and Hospital for the Aged in Browsville, Brooklyn. In 1968, the home was renamed the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center. Earlier this year, the Phyllis and Lee Coffey Foundation donated $100,000, the first installment of a $500,000 pledge, to help build a clinic for patients with acute medical needs at the geriatric center's Brenner Pavilion in Borough Park.
        Mr. Coffey and his wife, Phyllis, have also made major gifts to the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, Mount Sinai Medical Center, Long Island Jewish Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. They also helped to found the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra and Boys Town of Jerusalem and were sponsors of a clinic for hemophiliacs at Tel Hashamir Hospital in Israel.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Coffey is survived by a sister, Loretta C. Persky of Great Neck, L.I.
