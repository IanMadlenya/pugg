        Arnold Gurin, a former professor and dean at Brandeis University, died Friday at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 73 years old and lived in Boston.
        Dr. Gurin died of an aneurysm, his sister Ann Levey of Manhattan said.
        He joined the faculty of Brandeis in 1962 as an associate professor of social welfare administration. He became a full professor in 1966 and was named to the Maurice B. Hexter Chair in American Philanthropy in 1971, the year in which he began his five-year term as dean of the university's Florence Heller Graduate School for Advanced Studies in Social Welfare.
        He retired in 1982, but continued to serve as a consultant to organizations like the Council of Jewish Federations and Beth Israel Hospital, in this country and in England, France and Israel.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from City College in 1937. He received an M.A. from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from the University of Michigan. Before joining Brandeis, he taught at Columbia's New School of Social Work and at Michigan State University.
        Besides his sister, Dr. Gurin is survived by his wife, the former Helen Bass; a son, Nathaniel of Huntington Woods, Mich., principal trombonist for the Detroit Symphony; a daughter, Naomi Harrison of South Orange, N.J.; a second sister, Gloria Ross of Southfield, Mich.; a brother, Gerald of Ann Arbor, Mich.; and four grandchildren.
