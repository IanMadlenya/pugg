        Willard Hamlin, a real estate broker who used his knowledge of chemistry to create the fruit drink Orange Julius and helped build a worldwide chain of 700 juice stands, died here May 29. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Hamlin helped found the Orange Julius business in 1926 after Julius Fried had approached him seeking a site in Los Angeles to sell freshly squeezed orange juice. Mr. Hamlin, himself a customer, found that the acidity of the juice upset his stomach and suggested an additive to take away the sting. The additive, developed through Mr. Hamlin's knowledge of chemistry, consisted of crushed ice, syrup and a powder whose contents remained a company secret.
        Mr. Hamlin, who later bought out Mr. Fried, retired in 1967 after selling the company to International Industries. By then, there were about 700 Orange Julius stands in the United States and abroad.
