        John Lotas, the original producer of Hal Holbrook's "Mark Twain Tonight!" in New York, died on Friday after being struck by a car in Austin, Tex. He was 74.
        Mr. Holbrook had been performing his one-man show around the United States for about eight years in the 1950's when Mr. Lotas saw him do it at the Lambs Club in Manhattan. In 1959, Mr. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theater, where it won acclaim. Running for 174 performances, it became Mr. Holbrook's signature performance and set him off on his acting career. The show later reopened on Broadway.
        Mr. Lotas was born in Springfield, Mass., and for many years headed a production company in New York.
        He is survived by a son, Christopher, and two daughters, Sasha and Amanda, all of New York City.
