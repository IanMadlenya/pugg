        Dr. Bernard Jankelson, a dentist and a pioneer researcher in cranio-mandibular orthopedics and the study of head pain traceable to jaw malfunction, died here Monday. He was 84 years old.
        When he was 67, and after 45 years as a specialist in prosthodontics, Dr. Jankelson began research that led to development of electronic devices to relax muscle tension and instruments to measure muscle status in jaw action.
        In an interview last year he explained his work as the investigation of ''maladjustments in the relationship of the jaw to the skull which cause sustained muscle tension.'' He said he had found jaw movement malfunctions to be at the root of many health problems, ranging from headaches to insomnia.
        Born Sept. 8, 1902 at Bloemfontein, South Africa, he was reared in Saskatchewan and graduated from North Pacific College of Dentistry in 1924, now part of the University of Oregon, where a memorial fund to him has been established. He is survived by his wife, Agnes; two sons, Dr. Robert Jankelson of Seattle and Roland Jankelson of Tacoma, Wash.; a sister, Cecilia Magnuson of Seattle, and four grandchildren.
