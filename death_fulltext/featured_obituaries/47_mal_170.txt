        Dr. Joseph Zubin, a research psychologist whose career spanned more than 60 years, died on Tuesday at the home of his son in Buffalo, where he was visiting. He was 90 years old and lived in Leonia, N.J., and Pittsburgh.
        He died of congestive heart failure, the son, David, said.
        At his death, Dr. Zubin, a professor emeritus of psychology at Columbia University, was research career scientist at the Highland Drive Veterans Administration Medical Center in Pittsburgh, where he established a biometrics laboratory in 1976. He was Distinguished Research Professor at the Western Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh, and was for many years the Gregory Razran Psychology Professor at Queens College.
        In the last year Dr. Zubin, an authority on the diagnosis of schizophrenia and other diseases, conducted several symposiums in this country and abroad, the most recent in Cleveland last month.
        He was born in Raseiniai, Lithuania, and grew up in Baltimore. He was a graduate of Johns Hopkins and received a doctorate from Columbia, where he taught from 1939 until 1969.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Winifred Anderson; another son, Jonathan, of Baltimore; a daughter, Winifred Riley of Manhattan; a brother, Henry of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; three sisters, Blanche Becker of Worcester, Mass., and Doris Goldstein and Shirley Levin, both of Baltimore, and seven grandchildren.
