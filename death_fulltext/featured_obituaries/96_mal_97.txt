        James Michalos, a retired professor of civil engineering at Polytechnic Institute of New York and a consultant to government agencies and private builders, died on Jan. 7 in his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his son, Peter, of Manhattan.
        For 19 years, he was professor of civil engineering and chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering at New York University. When it merged with the Polytechnic Instittue of Brooklyn to form the Polytechnic Institute of New York, he continued as a professor until his retirement in 1981.
        Before his earlier teaching posts at Iowa State University and Syracuse University, he was an engineer for the Tennessee Valley Authority, the United States Steel Corporation and various private contractors. Throughout his academic career, he continued to advise architects and builders on the feasibility of projects and methods to accomplish them.
        He wrote the textbooks "Theory of Structural Analysis and Design" (Ronald Press, 1958) and, with Edward N. Wilson, "Structural Mechanics and Analysis" (Macmillan, 1965).
        He received an undergraduate degree from the University of Wisconsin, a master's from Yale University and a Ph.D. in engineering from Northwestern.
        Besides his son, Peter, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, Claire, and a daughter, Kiki, of London.
