        Richard J. Reynolds 3d, a grandson and namesake of the founder of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, died on June 28 at his home in Pinehurst, N.C. He was 60.
        The cause of death was emphysema and congestive heart failure caused by smoking cigarettes, his half-brother, Patrick Reynolds, an anti-tobacco crusader in Los Angeles, said on Tuesday.
        Dr. Roy Duke, who treated Richard J. Reynolds 3d earlier this year in West Palm Beach, Fla., said: "I saw Mr. Reynolds in January, and he was suffering very severe emphysema. The cause of death was end-stage emphysema as a result of smoking."
        Patrick Reynolds said that his brother gave up cigarettes in 1986 after years of heavy smoking. Their father, Richard J. Reynolds 2d, also died of emphysema, in 1964 at the age of 58.
        Patrick Reynolds said of his brother: "His interests ranged from writing poetry to raising thoroughbred horses. He gave generously to a variety of charities."
        Mr. Reynolds's wife, Marie, died earlier this year. They had no children.
