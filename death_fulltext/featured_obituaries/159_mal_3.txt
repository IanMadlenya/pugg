        Kenneth N. French, an actor who performed with many dance companies, died March 22 at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, said Joyce Herring, a friend and colleague.
        Born in Albion, Okla., Mr. French came to New York in the mid-1950's but continued to perform throughout the country in regional and summer theaters.
        In New York he performed as an actor with the Pina Bausch Tanz-  theater Wuppertal at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and with dance companies including Linda Mussmann's Time and Space Limited, New York Theater Ballet, Yung-Yung Tsuai Dance Company and, most recently, the Pascal Rioult Dance Theater, where he played the wryly detached narrator of ''Fables.'' Mr. French also performed at Symphony Space for several years in the annual ''Bloomsday on Broadway'' and in ''Wall-to-Wall Renaissance.'' He appeared in six television films on CBS.
        He is survived by a sister, Maggie Williams of Hot Springs, Ark.
