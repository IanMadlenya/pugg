        Stanley Salzman, an architect and industrial designer who received many honors as a teacher in both fields, died on Monday at the New York University-Bellevue Medical Center. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of stomach cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Professor Salzman taught architecture and design at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn for 46 years. For distinction as a teacher, he was named a Fellow of the National Institute of Architectural Education, Pratt Institute's Distinguished Professor of Architecture, a Fellow of the American Institute of Collegiate Schools of Architecture and also Distinguished Professor there.
        Professionally he was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He worked with major architectural firms, including that of Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer and Skidmore Owings before helping to establish Salzman & Breger in Manhattan in 1947.
        In 1955, he opened his own firm, Stanley Salzman, Architect. From 1960 to 1979, he was a partner in Edelman & Salzman, which was then sold.
        From 1979 on, he worked on special projects, including a book, "Drawing and Color," written in collaboration with Albert Lorenz, a colleague and former Salzman student at Pratt Institute. The book is scheduled for release in the fall by Whitney Publications.
        Professor Salzman was born in Queens. He received both an undergraduate degree and a master's in architecture from Harvard University.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan; two daughters, Bly Mann of Los Angeles and Amy Milch of Washington; a son, Brie, of Manhattan; a brother, Emmanuel, of Denver, and two grandchildren.
