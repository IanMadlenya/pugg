        Dr. William S. C. Dolan, an obstetrician-gynecologist, died on Tuesday at Howard County General Hospital in Columbia, Md. He was 79 years old and lived in Norway, Me.
        He died of a hypertensive disease and a series of strokes, a brother, Dr. Jerome Dolan of Jersey City, said.
        Dr. William Dolan, a native of Jersey City, began practicing in Nassau County, L.I., where he was director of obstetrics and gynecology at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre. He was also director of the obstetric-gynecologic outpatient department and attending physician at the Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow.
        After the death of his wife, Julia, in 1971, Dr. Dolan retired from private practice. He then was a consultant to the Ministry of Health in Cross River State, Nigeria. His work there ceased after he had a stroke in 1982.
        Besides his brother Jerome, Dr. Dolan is survived by two sons, Charles F., of Baltimore, and Philip C., of Biddeford, Me.; a daughter, Elizabeth, of Germantown, Md.; two sisters, Alice Rohan of Pelham Manor, N.Y., and Eileen Dolan of St. Elizabeth's College, Convent, N.J.; four other brothers, the Rev.
