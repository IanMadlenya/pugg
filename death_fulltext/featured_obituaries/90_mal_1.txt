        Churchill Eisenhart, an authority on the use of statistics in research and manufacturing who was associated with the National Bureau of Standards for many  years, died on Saturday at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was 82 and lived in Kensington, Md.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Eisenhart joined the staff of the National Bureau of Standards, an agency of the United States Commerce Department, in 1947 and founded its Statistical Engineering Laboratory. He directed that office until 1963, when he  was named a senior research fellow. Ten years ago he retired from the bureau, which was later reorganized as the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
        Dr. Eisenhart was born in Rochester and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Princeton University. He received a doctorate in mathematical statistics at University College in London in 1937.
        From then until he moved to the Bureau of Standards and the Washington area,  he taught at the University of Wisconsin. During World War II, he conducted mathematical research in ordnance development for the Navy.
        He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Mildred Behrens Eisenhart; two daughters, Evelyn E. Wollman of Ellicott City, Md., and Penelope E. Veerhoff of  Chevy Chase, Md.; a sister, Katharine E. Brown of Cambridge, Mass., and seven grandchildren.i
