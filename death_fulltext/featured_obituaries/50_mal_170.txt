        Landis Gores, one of five architects who gained international reputations in the 1950's while living and working in avant-garde houses they designed for themselves in New Canaan, Conn., died on Monday at Norwalk Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in New Canaan.
        Mr. Gores died of a respiratory illness, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        While the most publicized of the five houses was Philip C. Johnson's, Mr. Gores's was praised for the skillful blending of native stone and large glass areas in a design well suited to the heavily wooded site. The house was built for the architect's own use.
        Mr. Gores was associated with Mr. Johnson from 1946 until 1951, when he started his own practice. Helped Break German Code
        Among his works are the House for All Seasons, a private residence in New Canaan using alternate sources of energy; Van Doren Hospital and Strathmore Village in Fairfield, Conn., and the middle school and science buildings of New Canaan Country Day School.
        During World War II, Mr. Gores took part in a top-secret operation that broke the code of the German high command. He attained the rank of major and was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Order of the British Empire.
        He graduated from Princeton University summa cum laude in 1939 and from the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1942, when he was awarded the gold medal of the American Institute of Architects.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Pamela Whitmarsh; four daughters, Catherine Lynch of Miami; Ainslie Gilligan of Croton, N.Y.; Valerie Gores of Lyndhurst, N.J., and Elizabeth Gores of Howell, N.J.; a son, Karl, of San Anselmo, Calif; a brother, Guido Gores Jr. of Cincinnati, and eight grandchildren.
