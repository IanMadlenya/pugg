        Ernest Lowy, a lighting manufacturer, died on Saturday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 80 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Lowy, who was born in Teplitz, Czechoslovakia, became a lawyer and left the country when the Germans occupied it in 1941. He came to the United States and set up a machine shop, the Bohemia Machine Works, in lower Manhattan to make parts for military contractors during World War II.
        In 1945 he founded his lighting business, Koch & Lowy, which he operated until he retired last January.
        Mr. Lowy is survived by his wife, the former Lilly Wiener; a daughter, Ruth Bazil of Valley Stream, L.I.; a son, Thomas, of Manhattan and six grandchildren.
