        Joachim-Ernst Berendt, a German writer who was best known as a jazz critic but who was also a radio and concert producer and the author of books on nature and acoustical phenomena, died Feb. 4 in Hamburg, Germany. He was 77.
        He died a day after he was struck by a car, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Berendt's most popular work, ''The Jazz Book,'' written in 1952, went through six editions, the most recent one published in the United States in 1992. The Independent Publishers Group, his American distributor, said the book sold almost two million copies worldwide.
        Among histories of the genre, ''The Jazz Book'' is perhaps the most encyclopedic; its focus is on aesthetic lineage. In it, Mr. Berendt relentlessly traced practitioners, no matter how new or ephemeral, to the roots of their styles, dividing and naming musical substreams of each era.
        Mr. Berendt also wrote ''The Third Ear,'' a book on hearing, and had just published a new book, ''Nur Gehen'' (''Only Walking''), on his experiences with nature. A cofounder of the Suedwestrundfunk radio station in Baden-Baden, Mr. Berendt programmed more than 10,000 broadcasts of jazz and produced records for labels like MPS, Atlantic and Electrola.
        He is survived by his wife, Marijan.
