        George N. Cavalero, who co-founded a publishing company of Roman Catholic books and worked there for almost eight decades, on died Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 98 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of stomach cancer, his relatives said.
        As a teen-ager, Mr. Cavalero joined two of his brothers in starting the Catholic Book Publishing Company in Manhattan in 1911. He served as its vice president and remained active in the business until he became ill this year.
        The company, one of the nation's largest Catholic publishers, pioneered in printing liturgical texts, Bibles and other books.
        Mr. Cavalero's wife, Theresa, to whom he was married for 72 years, died last year. There are no immediate survivors.
