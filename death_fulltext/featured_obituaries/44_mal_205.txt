        Frank P. Sheridan, an antiques and imported furniture buyer for Lord & Taylor in Manhattan for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Sheridan died of congestive heart failure, said a friend, Frank Moorman.
        Mr. Sheridan joined Lord & Taylor after World War II and remained with the store until he retired in 1982. He was the originator of the store's ''Now & Then'' shop, which he stocked with antiques and bibelots. He also bought imports for the furniture department.
        When Mr. Sheridan was on what he referred to as a wood hunt, which usually lasted about 90 days, he went to large cities and tiny villages to select the most unusual tables, chests and chairs he could find.
        He is survived by a brother, John, of Milwaukee.
