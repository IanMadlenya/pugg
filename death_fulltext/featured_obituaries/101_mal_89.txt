        Louis Berry, a Michigan businessman and philanthropist, died on Wednesday at his home in West Bloomfield, a Detroit suburb. He was 92.
        Mr. Berry was born in Liverpool, England, came to this country in 1922 and entered the hotel business in 1939 with the purchase of the Palmetto in Detroit. He developed a chain that included properties in New York and Washington, and in 1962 headed a group of investors who bought the Fisher Building in Detroit.
        Among the beneficiaries of his philanthropic works was Sinai Hospital in Detroit, where he was a founding director. His donation to the hospital in 1980 resulted in a Berry Health Center for outpatient surgery in the suburb of Farmington Hills.
        Mr. Berry is survived by his wife of 30 years, Vivian Tatken Berry; a son, Harold, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; four daughters: Joan Provizer of Farmington Hills, Selma S. Schwartz and Barbara Morse, both of Franklin, Mich., and Marcy Feldman of Huntington Woods, Mich.; two sisters, Ann Eisler and Bertha Dworkin, both of Southfield, Mich.; 13 grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren. His first wife, Betty Eisenman Berry, died in 1959.
