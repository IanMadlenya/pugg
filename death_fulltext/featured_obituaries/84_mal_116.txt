        Capt. Jeremiah T. Driscoll, whose companies supplied fuel oil to ships and boats in New York City waters for more than 40 years, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. Captain Driscoll, who lived in Manhattan, was 84.
        The cause was cancer, said a niece, Anne O'Driscoll.
        Captain Driscoll was the master of the tanker Linekin Islander, which was based near the South Street Seaport. The vessel provided all kinds of craft in New York harbor and other waterways with diesel fuel and other petroleum products.
        Captain Driscoll was a part owner of Harbor Diesel Fuel, which owns the tanker, and he had previously operated a similar company, New York Marine Fuel.
        A native of Baltimore in County Cork, Captain Driscoll came to New York in 1928, becoming first a partner in a fishing boat out of Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and then a ship pilot.
        After service in the United States Navy during World War II, Captain Driscoll was in 1945 one of the founders of Sightseeing Yachts Inc. The company eventually became known as the Circle Line. Captain Driscoll left that company in 1947 to enter the marine fuel business.
