        Emanuel Geltman, a founding editor of the political journal Dissent, died last Wednesday at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 81.
        The cause was heart failure, said Frances Sosnoff, with whom he had lived for 23 years.
        Mr. Geltman, who founded Dissent with Irving Howe and Stanley Plastrik in 1954 and served as its executive editor, was a committed democratic socialist, with a broad circle of friends among the intellectuals of the left.
        Deeply engaged with politics and scholarly discourse, he supported himself through much of his life as an editor for Horizon Press, the Free Press of Glencoe, the Chicago University Press and Quadrangle Books. He also edited Labor Action, a national socialist newspaper.
        Mr. Geltman, who grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College, was introduced to politics by his older brothers. A virulent anti-Stalinist, he worked for many years for the Trotskyists, whom he represented in Paris during the 1930's.
        During World War II, he served with the Army Corps of Engineers in England and France. After the war, he became a proofreader, which led him into editing. He met Irving Howe, who was to achieve prominence as a literary critic, author, academic and advocate of democratic socialism, when they were teen-agers. The two men shared a profound involvement in literary, political and Jewish affairs. The magazine they helped found was critical of the abuses of capitalism and repelled by leftist totalitarianism.
        Mr. Geltman is survived by two children from his marriage to Mary Hansen of Tampa, Fla., which ended in divorce: a son, Marc Geltman of Tampa, and a daughter, Helen Geltman of Canton, N.C.; two sisters, Fanya Del Bourgo of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Anna Silverman of Brooklyn, and three grandchildren.
