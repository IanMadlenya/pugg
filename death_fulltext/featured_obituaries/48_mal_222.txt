        Glenn Langan, a leading man or second lead in dozens of Hollywood films, died on Saturday at Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo, Calif. He was 73 years old and lived in Camarillo.
        He died of lymphoma, a hospital spokesman said.
        Mr. Langan portrayed a French teacher idolized by a student (Jeanne Crain) in "Margie" (1946), a young doctor shielding a shy governess (Gene Tierney) in "Dragonwyck" (1946) and a psychiatrist treating a psychotic patient (Olivia de Havilland) in "The Snake Pit" (1948).
        Among his other films were "Wing and a Prayer" (1944), "A Bell for Adano" and "Hangover Square" (both 1945), "Forever Amber" (1947), "The Treasure of Monte Cristo" (1949), "The Big Chase" (1954) and "Mutiny in Outer Space" (1965).
        He was born and educated in Denver. He studied acting in a repertory company there and in New York, where he played opposite Luise Rainer in a 1942 Broadway revival of James M. Barrie's "Kiss for Cinderella." His performance won him a Hollywood contract. In later years, he became a prosperous real estate salesman.
        He is survived by his wife, the actress Adele Jergens, and a son, Tracy, of Simi Valley, Calif., who is the marketing director for Panavision, which makes movie cameras.
