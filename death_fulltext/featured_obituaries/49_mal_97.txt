        Bernard Sauer, an actor in Yiddish theater, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He appeared on Broadway in 1966 in "Let's Sing Yiddish," starring Ben Bonus. He also performed in "Light, Lively and Yiddish" and in "Sing Israel Sing." He was also part of a Yiddish repertory company that performed in 1971 at the Anderson Theater in Manhattan.
        He was the president of the Hebrew Actors Union for the last five years and a board member of the Yiddish Theatrical Alliance.
        He was born in Buenos Aires and attended drama school there. His first theatrical appearance was in 1945 in Joseph Buloff's "Yoshke, the Musician."
        He is survived by four sisters and a brother, all of Buenos Aires.
