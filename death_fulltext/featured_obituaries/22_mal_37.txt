        Raphael Bronstein, who taught over a thousand violinists during a 65-year career in New York, died at St. Luke's Hospital yesterday. He was 93 years old and had suffered a stroke Monday evening after an active day of teaching.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Bronstein was on the faculties of the Manhattan School of Music, Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Among his previous academic affiliations were the Hartt School in Hartford and Boston University. One of his former pupils was the violinist Elmar Oliveira.
        Mr. Bronstein, who was born in Vilnius, was a child prodigy and eventually studied with Leopold Auer at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. He came to the United States in 1923, first serving as assistant to Auer, who had arrived in New York in 1918, and then continuing in his stead when Auer died in 1930. Mr. Bronstein had toured Europe as a soloist but never performed publicly in this country. He was also a composer and the conductor of the Bronstein Symphonietta, which he formed in 1949. His editions of Bach and published violin methods were used by other teachers.
        Mr. Bronstein is survived by his daughter, Ariana Bronne, who is a violinist, and by three grandchildren and one great-grandson. No funeral is planned, but family, friends and students will meet in remembrance at 5 P.M. today in the Manhattan School of Music, Broadway at 122d Street.
