        Eugene Adkins, who served as the flight engineer and turret gunner on the famed World War II bomber Memphis Belle, died on Friday after collapsing at his  home here. He was 76.
        Mr. Adkins was part of a crew that completed 25 bombing missions over Nazi-occupied Europe in 1943 and 1944. At a time of heavy Allied flight crew losses, the entire Memphis Belle crew survived the war.
        The crew gained fame late in the war through a documentary shown to national movie audiences as part of a drive to sell war bonds and boost public morale.
        He was awarded a medal of honor from the British Royal Air Force this year, and he and other surviving crew members were guests of President Clinton at a dinner to mark the 50th anniversary of V-E Day.
