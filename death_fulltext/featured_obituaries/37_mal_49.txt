        Bin Akao, a figure in Japan's rightist movement associated with a series of terrorist attacks in postwar Japan, died of heart failure today. He was 91 years old.
        He had a record of 25 arrests for violent political activities.
        Mr. Akao had commuted almost daily for 35 years to central Tokyo's Ginza district, where he preached to the thousands of passers-by through a loudspeaker from atop a truck, painted with slogans such as ''Japanese unite under the Emperor.''
        After World War II, Allied occupation forces banned him from public office. When the ban ended in 1951, he established the anti-Communist Great Japan Patriots' Party.
