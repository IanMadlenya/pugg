        Mr. White, a native of Philadelphia, was former chairman of the law firm of Duane, Morris & Heckscher. He was a founding member and president from 1971 to 1986 of the Old Philadelphia Development Corporation, which helped to redevelop the Society Hill section and much of Philadelphia's center city.
        A Republican, his appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Navy was rejected by the Eisenhower Administration in 1957 because he had contributed $50 to the campaign of Senator Joseph S. Clark, a Democrat, who was a close friend.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Bersbach Coffin; a son, William 3d of Bryn Mawr; a daughter, Carolyn of St. Davids, Pa.; a sister, a brother and two granddaughters.
