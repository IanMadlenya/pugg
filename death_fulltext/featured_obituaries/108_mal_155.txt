        Heinz H. Weissenstein, a photographer whose work dealt with musicians and social organizations, died on Saturday in the Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, Mass. He was 84 and lived in Lenox, Mass.
        Mr. Weissenstein was born in Holzminden, Germany, and worked as a banker in Leipzig, where he also led a Jewish youth organization. After leaving Germany for the United States in 1938, he turned his hobby, photography, into a profession.
        Initially he photographed children, going door to door to obtain work. In 1939, while teaching photography at a boys' summer camp in the Berkshire Mountains, he began photographing the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which was performing nearby at the Tanglewood Music Festival. He soon became the orchestra's official photographer, a position he held until he retired in the late 1980's. In the late 1950's and early 1960's he was also the official photographer for Carnegie Hall.
        Before retiring, he donated many of his negatives to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and to the United Federation of Teachers, both longtime clients. He also did photographic work for the March of Dimes and the United Jewish Appeal.
        He is survived by his wife, Charlotte; four sons: Herbert, of Manhattan; Peter, of Lenox; Robert, of Houston, and David, of Colchester, Vt., and seven grandchildren.
