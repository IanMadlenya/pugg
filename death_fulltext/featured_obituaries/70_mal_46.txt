        William M. Phillips Jr., a professor emeritus of sociology at Rutgers University, died on Tuesday at his home in Skillman, N.J. His family said he was in his late 60's.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said a son, William M. 3d, of Kingston, Jamaica, who is a Foreign Service officer.
        Professor Phillips taught at Rutgers from 1963 to his retirement in 1987. During the late 1960's he served as the first director of the Office of Research and Development for the New Jersey State Department of Education, which he helped create.
        He was born in Waco, Tex. In 1944, he interrupted his studies at Langston University in Oklahoma to enlist in the Navy as a navigator's assistant. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Fisk University in Tennessee in 1948 and 1950, and a doctorate at the University of Chicago in 1957.
        He was active in civic and scholarly organizations, including the American Sociological Society, the Association of Black Sociologists, the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
        He was the author of numerous scholarly papers and two books: "An Illustrious Alliance: The African American and Jewish American Communities" (Greenwood Press, 1991) and "The School Sociologist: A Need for an Emergent Profession" (University Press of America, 1981).
        In addition to his son, William, Professor Phillips is survived by his wife, Marie; another son, Eric, of Skillman; a brother, Waldo, of Waco, and four grandchildren.
