        Herman G. Berdolt, retired senior vice president and controller of the Greenwich Savings Bank, died on Thursday at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, L.I. He was 88 years old and had been a lifelong resident of Manhattan until he moved to Huntington Station, L.I., two years ago.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Berdolt spent half a century in banking. He joined Greenwich Savings in 1944 as assistant treasurer, became controller in 1946 and was named senior vice president in 1962. After he retired in 1963 Mr. Berdoldt joined the International Executives Service Corps, for which he helped to solve financial problems in several foreign countries, including Iran, Turkey, Brazil and Colombia.
        He is survived by a niece, Phyllis Benson of Smithtown, L.I., and a nephew, John Berdolt of Cape Coral, Fla.
