        Margaret A. Hickey, a longtime advocate of women's rights, died on Wednesday in a Tucson, Ariz., nursing home, where she had lived for several years. She was 92 and had been a Tucson resident for more than 20 years.
        At her death, Miss Hickey held the title of public affairs editor of Ladies' Home Journal, a position she had held since 1946.
        A lawyer who became the owner and operator of a business school in St. Louis, Miss Hickey was prominent in World War II as chairwoman of the Women's Advisory Committee of the national War Manpower Commission, from 1942 to 1945.
        At acommittee session in August 1944 she declared that the nation's "magnificent war production" was due to the "hidden army" of women working for victory. But near that war's end, she estimated that at least 500,000 women had lost their jobs as a result of cutbacks, and she called for measures to protect women in the workplace.
        After the war, she served on a variety of high-level panels concerned with women's rights and other policy spheres. In January 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her chairwoman of the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. The council had been set up in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy "to assure effective and continuing leadership in advancing the status of women." She headed it until 1966.
        Miss Hickey was born in Kansas City, Mo., and earned a law degree from the University of Missouri in 1928.
        She married Joseph T. Strubinger in 1935. He died in 1973.
