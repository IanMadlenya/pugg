        After the war, Mr. Savitsky rose to the rank of air marshal and commanded Soviet antiaircraft forces.
        His daughter, Svetlana, an astronaut, became the second woman in space aboard a Soyuz T-7 capsule on Aug. 19, 1982. The first woman in space was Valentina V. Tereshkova, who orbited the earth in 1963.
