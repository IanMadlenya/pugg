        Dr. Silberschlag, who translated Aristophanes and Menander from Greek into Hebrew, was considered an authority in the field of Hebrew literary criticism. He joined the faculty of Hebrew College in 1944 and was named dean in 1947. In the late 1960's, his title was changed to president. He retired in 1970.
        In 1951, he won the Tschernichowsky Prize of the Municipality of Tel Aviv for his translations of the comedies of Aristophanes. He also received the Florence Kovner Memorial Award in 1971 for a book of poems, ''Letters to Other Generations.''
        Dr. Silberschlag received a doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1925. He was a past president of the National Association of Professors of Hebrew in the United States and a trustee of Hebrew College in Brookline, Mass.
        His wife, Milkah, died in 1970. Internment will be Friday in Jersualem.
