        Norton Mockridge, a jack-of-all-trades New York newspaper man, humorist, columnist and author, died on April 18 in San Antonio, where he lived. He was 88.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his daughter, Nancy Minor.
        As a columnist, first for The World-Telegram from 1963 to 1966, then nationally syndicated by Scripps-Howard Newspapers and United Feature Syndicate from 1966 until 1980, Mr. Mockridge wrote about everything from murder to malapropisms.
        ''I see a human story in virtually everything that happens and I think it's because I've done so many things myself,'' he wrote in Editor & Publisher in 1963, listing jobs from semi-pro football player to advertising salesman to film critic.
        His love of mangled language, which prompted him to write ''Fractured English,'' may have arisen from the frequent botching of his own name, which, he once said, appeared in hundreds of mutations, among them Gordon Mockowitz, Morton Muckeridge and Gordon Muskrotch.
        When people asked him if his name was really Norton Mockridge, he would invariably reply, ''You think I'd make it up?''
        Mr. Mockridge was born on Sept. 29, 1915, in the Bronx. His father was a New York Telephone Company executive. He graduated from high school in Mount Kisco, N.Y., got his start in journalism in 1933 as a reporter for The Mount Kisco Recorder, a weekly, and in 1936 moved to The White Plains Daily Reporter as a reporter, critic and city editor. In 1940 he became a reporter and rewrite man for The World-Telegram & Sun.
        He joined the Army in 1942, and rose to the rank of first lieutenant.
        In 1956, he became city editor of The World-Telegram & Sun. In 1963 the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for local reporting for its coverage of a plane crash in Jamaica Bay in which 95 people died.
        Mr. Mockridge was the host of a daily radio show on WCBS from 1963 to 1964 and on the CBS Radio Network from 1964 to 1970. The first of his more than half a dozen books was ''This Is Costello,'' written with Robert H. Prall, about the mob figure Frank Costello and his lieutenants. A sequel, ''Costello on the Spot,'' was published in 1957. The two also collaborated on ''The Big Fix,'' about a municipal scandal involving a bookie, Harry Gross, who in 1950 exposed a New York plainclothesman for permitting him to operate a $20 million-a-year gambling enterprise.
        Mr. Mockridge's 16-year marriage to Margaret Eleanor Gleason ended in divorce in 1961. In 1963 he married Valborg Palmer, an interior designer, who survives him, as do two of his three children from his first marriage, Nancy, of Bridgeport, Conn., and John, of Stuart, Fla., eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
        In 1978, Mr. Mockridge filed an age-discrimination suit against the Scripps-Howard Newspapers, charging that he had been pushed into premature retirement at age 63. The suit was settled out of court for what Mr. Mockridge told The New York Times was ''a satisfactory sum.''
        Correction:  May 15, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on April 24 about Norton Mockridge, a New York newspaperman and nationally syndicated columnist, misstated the name of the newspaper he joined in 1940. It was then The New York World-Telegram; a merger in 1950 created The World-Telegram & Sun.
