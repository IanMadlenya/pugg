        Dr. Smith, who helped develop training methods for intern and resident physicians that are still in use, was an administrator for the City Department of Hospitals, the predecessor of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, from 1930 to 1970. He was assigned to Morrisania for most of his career, but worked at Fordham Hospital as the medical superintendent for a brief period in the 1940's.
        He returned to Morrisania and worked there until 1965, when he was named deputy commissioner of the hospitals department, a post he held until he retired in 1965. He was awarded the Mayor's Medal as the outstanding city employee of 1962.
        Dr. Smith graduated from the City College of New York and received his medical training at the University of Cincinnati. He was a co-founder and past president of the Hospital Adminstrators' Club of New York.
        Dr. Smith is survived by two daughters, Gleniss Schonholtz of Manhattan and Marna Sherman of the Bronx; a sister, Janet Isenstein of Miami, and four grandchildren.
