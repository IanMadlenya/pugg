        Leonard Eisner, a concert pianist and teacher, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 70 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his brother, Harold Eisner of Rockville Center.
        In a review of his 1946 debut recital at Town Hall, Noel Straus of The New York Times wrote that Mr. Eisner "held the attention by the imaginative, comprehending nature of his interpretations."
        He made many orchestral and recital appearances in the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan, and was the accompanist for Lauritz Melchior during the tenor's American tours, as well as for other artists.
        Mr. Eisner was a native of Brooklyn. He attended the City College of New York and the Juilliard School. He was on the piano faculty of the Juilliard School Pre-College Division since, and taught at Queens College and the State University of New York at Purchase.
        Other than his brother, there are no immediate survivors.
