        Jack Katzen, a former Pentagon official and defense industry executive, died on Oct. 28 while vacationing on Lan Tau Island in Hong Kong. He was 70 years old and lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        Mr. Katzen's death was apparently caused by a heart attack, a doctor at the scene said.
        President Ronald Reagan appointed Mr. Katzen Assistant Secretary of Defense for Production and Logistics in 1988. In that post for two and a half years, he was responsible for areas that included weapons production and the closing of military bases.
        Mr. Katzen, a native of New York City, graduated from the Carnegie Institute of Technology with a degree in aeronautical and mechanical engineering.
        In the early part of his career, he managed design engineering for winged aircraft and missiles for the Navy. He then worked for 22 years at General Electric in its aerospace, military, information, industrial components and Far East divisions. Before joining the Government, he was a vice president of the Avco Corporation, a company in Greenwich whose operations included making aircraft components.
        He is survived by two daughters, Jill Johnson and Jan Katzen, and a grandson, all of Phoenix, and a brother, Julian, of Boynton Beach, Fla. His companion for the last 15 years was Mary Anne Cline.
