        Peter Kilham, a biology professor at the University of Michigan, died Sunday, apparently of a heart attack, at Lake Victoria in Kenya. He was 45 years old.
        Professor Kilham, who joined the Michigan faculty in 1972, was an ecologist who specialized in the biogeochemistry of African lakes and rivers and the ecology of marine and freshwater phytoplankton.
        He was one of five researchers studying the effects of global pollution on Lake Victoria. The expedition was being financed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
