        Henry A. Truslow Jr., a textile manufacturing executive who retired in 1978 as a vice president of Westpoint Pepperell, died yesterday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. He was 77 years old and lived in Saco, Me.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Truslow, a native of Summit, N.J., was a graduate of the New York Military Academy. He began his textile career in 1933 and two years later joined the Pepperell Manufacturing Company in Biddleford, Me.
        After serving with Pepperell as assistant manager of its plant in Fall River, Mass., he left in 1952 to join Ponemah Mills in Taftville, Conn., where he became president and treasurer two years later. He returned to Pepperell in 1966 and, after a merger, was made vice president of northern operations for Westpoint Pepperell in Biddeford and Lewiston, Me., in 1966. He was a past president of the Northern Textile Association.
        Mr. Truslow is survived by his wife, the former Cora Whitin, whom he married 53 years ago; two sons, Henry 3d of Sunbury, Pa., and Peter, of Saco; three daughters, Nina McKee of Scarborough, Me., Nancy Lundgren of Dover, Mass., and Barbara Cole of Saco; a brother, John, of Atlanta, 13 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
