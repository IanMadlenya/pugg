        Laldenga, a leader of India's Mizo tribe who fought a secessionist war before joining mainstream politics, died today in London, the Press Trust of India reported. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Laldenga was suffering from lung cancer and was on his way to New Delhi after treatment in New York. The Press Trust said that his condition deteriorated on the flight and that he got off the plane at London. He died on the way to a hospital.
        Mr. Laldenga, who had one name, led an insurgency in Mizoram state in the northeast for nearly two decades. But in 1986, after reaching an agreement with the Government, he left the secessionist movement and became the state's chief minister.
        He was arrested several times and spent 10 years in exile in Bangladesh and Pakistan. He lost power in 1988 after defections from his party.
