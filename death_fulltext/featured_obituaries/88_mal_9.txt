        Peter Reed, a dancer, dance-company director and film maker, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 40.
        The cause was AIDS, said Frances Murdock, a friend.
        Mr. Reed was born in Cincinnati. He trained as a dancer at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where he became a principal performer and choreographer with the Pacific Ballet.
        In 1980 he moved to New York and founded the Contemporary Ballet Company. He performed at City Center, the Kitchen, the Band Shell in Central Park, and the Bette Stoler Art Gallery, among other places.
        Mr. Reed also wrote and directed short films. His first feature, "Under Heat," starring Lee Grant and Robert Knepper, is to have its world premiere on June 16 at the San Francisco Gay and Lesbian Film Festival.
        He is survived by his mother, Dorothy Whittaker Reed of Cincinnati; two sisters, Janet Goss of Boulder, Colo., and Dede Hagist of Aspen, Colo., and two brothers, Larry and Foster, both of San Francisco.
        Mr. Reed's companion, the sculptor James Ford, died of AIDS in 1992.
