        Felix Partz, a member of the three-man Canadian art collaborative General Idea, died on June 5 at his home in Toronto. He was 49.
        The cause was AIDS, said A. A. Bronson, the group's surviving member. Jorge Zontal, the group's third member, died of AIDS in February.
        General Idea, which was formed in Toronto in 1968, exhibited widely in North America and Europe and was the subject of several retrospectives. The group developed a witty, slick-looking form of Conceptual art that borrowed liberally from advertising and other art. It devoted the last decade almost entirely to art about AIDS and was especially well known for its appropriation of Robert Indiana's colorful "Love" emblem, which it changed to read AIDS.
        Mr. Partz, whose original name was Ron Gabe, tended toward the iconoclastic. While still at the University of Manitoba School of Fine Arts in Winnipeg, his hometown, he made photocopies of famous artworks for his print-making class. At the time of his death he had just finished work on a series of AIDS-related General Idea projects that incoporated mutated simulations of works by Mondrian and Duchamp.
        He is survived by his parents, Perry and Olive Gabe, and a brother, Roy, all of Winnipeg.
