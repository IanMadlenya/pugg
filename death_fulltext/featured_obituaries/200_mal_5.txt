        Claude Passeau, an All-Star right-hander who pitched a one-hitter in the 1945 World Series for the Chicago Cubs' last pennant-winning team, died Saturday in Lucedale, Miss. He was 94.
        Pitching for 13 seasons in the National League, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Cubs, Passeau had a career record of 162-150 with a 3.32 earned run average.
        A five-time All-Star, he was victimized in one of the most dramatic moments in All-Star Game history when Ted Williams hit a three-run home run off him with two outs in the ninth inning of the 1941 game at Briggs Stadium in Detroit, giving the American League a 7-5 victory.
        But in 1945, Briggs Stadium was also the scene of one of the most dominating pitching performances in World Series history when Passeau, coming off a 17-9 regular-season record, threw a one-hitter against the Tigers in Game 3. Pitching the Cubs to a 3-0 victory, he faced only 28 batters, one more than the minimum.
        ''I felt so good I began to tease the Detroit hitters,'' Passeau told The Sporting News afterward. ''I am naturally fidgety -- rub my fingers up and down my trousers, pick at my cap, pull at my belt, take my time in the box. I noticed it annoyed them, so I put it on more than ever.''
        Passeau, a native of Waynesboro, Miss., is survived by a son, Claude Jr., of Lucedale; a daughter, Patty Passeau, of Mobile, Ala.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
        Passeau felt that his accomplishments were tarnished somewhat by a reputation for throwing a spitball.
        ''They put it on my baseball card that I was a cheater,'' he told The Associated Press in 1997, displaying a card with the label ''Spitballer?'' above his picture. ''I couldn't throw a spitball if it was legal, I threw different speeds and sunk the ball and slid it. I have been told it was one of the liveliest fastballs some of the scouts ever saw.''
