        Norman Schwartz, a concert manager and record producer, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Suzanne Crosby.
        Mr. Schwartz, a graduate of Juilliard and New York University, held degrees in music and accounting. Early in his career, he founded a tax and management firm that represented personalities from all areas of the arts and entertainment. In the 1970's, he turned to producing records on his own labels, Skye and Gryphon, with artists including Lena Horne, Mel Torme, Michel Legrand, Woody Herman and Buddy Rich. He also recorded the 1973 Newport in New York Jazz Festival, with Aretha Franklin, Stan Getz and Ella Fitzgerald, among others. Six of his recordings won Grammy Awards.
        From 1982 to 1985, Mr. Schwartz oversaw the refurbishing of Manhattan Center and the construction of its highly regarded recording studio. He also developed a course of studies on the recording business for the Thelonious Monk Institute at Duke University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Nicholas and Timothy; three daughters, Nell, Elizabeth Morrison Hannum and Ilona Morrison, and a grandson.
