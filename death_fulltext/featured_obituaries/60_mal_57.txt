        Joseph J. Linhart, a recording industry executive, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 72 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said his son, Peter Hirshberg, of Palo Alto, Calif.
        From 1961 to 1966, Mr. Linhart was the musical director of RCA Victor's show music department, which produced original-cast Broadway recordings and invested in musical theater. Among the albums he produced were "Oliver," "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," the 1965 Lincoln Center revival of "Carousel" and "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," for which he won a Grammy Award. He also managed RCA's investments in many musicals and was the associate producer of the musical "Hallelujah Baby" in 1967.
        Mr. Linhart was born in the Bronx and served as an Army pilot during World War II.
        Before joining RCA, he was the general manager of Frank Loesser Music Publishing. He was a founding board member of the Musical Theater Works and was on the advisory council of the Actor's Studio, both in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and another son, Ted, both of Manhattan.
