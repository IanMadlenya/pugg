        Mr. Gold, with others, founded the coalition for people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1985. The organization, at 31 West 26th Street, puts out a monthly newspaper written by and for people with AIDS, with a worldwide circulation of 14,000, said Jane Rosett, an editor and founding board member.
        He is survived by his mother.
