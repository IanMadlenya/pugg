        Stephen J. Pollock, a retired New York importer of skiwear, died on Friday at his home on the Upper West Side. He was 97.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Pollock was born in Vienna and came to the United States in 1938 when Austria merged with Germany. He worked as a salesman in the ski department of Gimbels department store and helped others to leave Austria and take refuge in the United States.
        He eventually headed his own business, Stadium Imports, traveling extensively in Europe to spot new lines of merchandise. He sold the company and retired about 20 years ago.
        He was an amateur musician, playing the viola in a chamber-music group well into his 90's.
        Mr. Pollock is survived by his son, Gerald A. of Old Greenwich, Conn., and two granddaughters.
