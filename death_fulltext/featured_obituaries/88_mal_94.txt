        Paul Lenti, a theatrical reporter and critic who translated "Objects of Desire, Conversations With Luis Bunuel," died on Wednesday at the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Lenti, who lived in Manhattan, was 45.
        The cause was complications following heart surgery, said Thomas Brown, a friend.
        His critically acclaimed translation of the book about Mr. Bunuel, the Spanish film director, was published in 1992 by Marsilio.
        Mr. Lenti was a theatrical reporter and critic for Variety. He started as a foreign correspondent in Mexico City in 1983 and wrote extensively on Latin American theater and film. He gathered one of the largest private collections of Latin American films in the United States.
        Mr. Lenti is survived by his father, Paul Sr., of Seattle; a brother, Gregory, of Tacoma, Wash., and three sisters, Victoria Lenti of Seattle, Carolyn Anspach of Tacoma and Janice Lenti of Beaverton, Ore.

        An obituary on May 21 about Paul Lenti, a theatrical reporter and critic, described the cause of his death incompletely. A spokesman for the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, where he died, pointed out that although Mr. Lenti's death was indeed caused by complications after heart surgery, the surgery had taken place nearly two months earlier. In the interim, he was discharged from the hospital, and spent several weeks in good health before becoming ill again.
