        The Rev. Alger L. Adams, a retired Episcopal clergyman and former editor and publisher of The Westchester County Press, died on Wednesday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson. He was 82 years old.
        His family said he died of heart failure.
        Father Adams, a native of Omaha, graduated from Hobart College and from General Theological Seminary in Manhattan. He also held a master's degree from Teachers College, Columbia University, where he taught a journalism course.
        He and his wife, Jessie, bought The Westchester County Press in 1950 and operated it until they sold it in 1986. The weekly is directed toward black readers in 15 communities in the county.
        In the 1950's, Father Adams also was the editor of The Bulletin, then a publication of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. At the same time, he served as a priest at two Westchester missions, St. Francis of Assisi in Elmsford and St. Augustine's in Yonkers.
        After his retirement in 1971, he continued to help out at Episcopal congregations in the county, including those in Eastchester, Ossining, Irvington and Granite Springs.
        In addition to his wife of 55 years, the former Jessie Wells, Father Adams is survived by a daughter, Patricia Adams of Leominster, Mass., and a sister, Sylvia Williams of Fort Worth.
