        Howard Randall Staub, a retired Connecticut real-estate consultant who was director of enemy property for the United States headquarters in Japan after World War II, died on Monday at New Milford (Conn.) Hospital. He was 87 years old and lived in New Preston, Conn.
        He died of congestive heart failure, said his son John.
        Mr. Staub began his career in real estate in New York. During the Depression, when the real-estate market dried up, Mr. Staub became head of the Connecticut Home Owners Loan Association. Before World War II he was director of rent control for the State of Connecticut's Office of Price Administration and, during the war, he served with the Office of Price Administration in Washington.
        From 1947 to 1958, Mr. Staub served in Japan, initially as director of enemy property at General Douglas MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. After the Japanese peace treaty took effect, he became secretary general of the Tripartite Commission, which took over foreign-owned enemy properties in Japan and was responsible for their liquidation. In 1958, he moved to Washington, Conn., where he became a real-estate consultant until his retirement in 1965.
        He was born in Stamford, Conn., graduated from the Culver Military Academy and attended the University of Virginia.
        Mr. Staub is survived by his wife, the former Rita Bader; two sons, John H., of Litchfield, Conn., and James D., of Orinda, Calif.; 10 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.
