        Lawrence G. Chait, a pioneer of the direct marketing industry in the decades after World War II, died July 18 at his home in Croyden, N.H. He was 80. The cause of death was a heart attack, according to his daughter, Martha L. Berlin of Washington.
        Mr. Chait began his career as director of direct mail advertising for Dow Jones & Company in 1935. After serving in similar positions at Time, Life, Fortune and R. L. Polk & Company, he formed his own advertising and consulting firm, L. G. Chait & Company, in 1957.
        As the advent of credit cards began to reshape the direct-marketing industry in the 1970's, the company became increasingly influential by developing techniques for using computer lists of consumers. Mr. Chait's clients included American Airlines, the Diner's Club, Hertz Rent-a-Car, Manpower and the Spiegel catalogue.
        Since 1990, Mr. Chait had been lecturing and writing on industry trends and teaching at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H.
        Mr. Chait was married for more than 60 years to Sylvia Levine Chait, who died in September 1996. Survivors include Mrs. Berlin and another daughter, Pamela A. Chait of New York City; a son, George Chait of Croyden, N.H.; a brother, Maurice Chait of Boston, and two sisters, Florence Rubin of Scranton, Pa., and Esther Finkelstein of Vestal, N.Y.
