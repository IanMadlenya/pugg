        Mrs. Chaplin, whose original name was Lillita Louise MacMurray, changed her name to Lita Grey while trying to break into films as a teen-ager. She worked for Chaplin at his Hollywood studio when she was 12. She was 16 when she married him in 1924; Chaplin was 35 and near the height of his fame. Their three-year marriage produced two sons, Sydney and the late Charles Jr.
        Mrs. Chaplin played clubs in Europe and the United States and spent eight years with the Radio Keith Orpheum theater circuit before retiring from show business in 1947. In 1965 she wrote "My Life With Chaplin."
        Chaplin was married to Mildred Harris in 1918, to Paulette Goddard in 1933 and to Oona O'Neill in 1943. He died in 1977.
        In addition to her son, Sydney, she is survived by two grandchildren and one  great-grandchild.
