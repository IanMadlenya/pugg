        Angelus N. Cotsidas, a founder and chairman of the Table Talk Pastry Company, died on May 10, at his home in Westboro, Mass. He was 96.
        Mr. Cotsidas, a Greek immigrant, started Table Talk in 1924, with Theodore Tonna and Wilfred A. Casavant. Initially, the company sold pastries to restaurants and hotels, but it expanded into the retail trade during the 1930's.
        Table Talk introduced its junior pies, which were 4 inches in diameter, in the 1950's. The company grew from a local bakery based in Worcester, Mass., to an East Coast producer and distributor of more than a million cherry, blueberry, apple and other kinds of pies each week. At its peak, Table Talk employed 400 bakers out of 800 employees, and was responsible for transforming most of the annual blueberry crop of Prince Edward Island, Canada -- four million pounds -- into pies.
        Mr. Cotsidas retired in 1968.
        Table Talk was purchased in 1965 by Beech-Nut and was sold several times before it closed in 1984. Table Talk was revived two years later by Christos Cocaine, who left the company in 1979.
        Mr. Cotsidas is survived by his wife, Eva, of Westboro; a daughter, Valerie Pappas of Boston; a son, Nicholas Cotsidas of Solana Beach, Calif., and seven grandchildren.
