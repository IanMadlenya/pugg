        Carlos Surinach, an American composer of Spanish birth who drew freely on the rhythmic and melodic conventions of flamenco in his works, died on Wednesday at his home in New Haven. He was 82.
        Although Mr. Surinach composed prolifically for orchestra, chorus, chamber ensembles and voice, he was best known for a series of ballet scores that were enlivened by his sense of fantasy and his ear for picturesque coloration and rhythmic clarity. He wrote several ballets for Martha Graham, including ''Embattled Garden'' (1958), ''Acrobats of God'' (1960), ''Chronique'' (1974) and ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' (1978). Graham's last, unfinished work, ''The Eyes of the Goddess,'' used music from Mr. Surinach's 1962 Symphonic Variations; the fragment has been performed several times since Graham died in 1991.
        Other works by Mr. Surinach that have found a home on the ballet stage are ''Ritmo Jondo,'' written for Doris Humphrey (1953), ''Agathe's Tale,'' choreographed by Paul Taylor (1967) and ''Three Dances,'' which has been performed frequently since Pilar Rioja choreographed it in 1986. He also composed works for the Joffrey Ballet, which toured the Soviet Union with his ''Feast of Ashes'' in 1963, and the Jose Limon Company.
        Mr. Surinach was born in Barcelona in March 1915 and began his musical education at the Municipal Conservatory there. He continued his studies in piano, conducting and composition at the Robert Schumann Conservatory in Dusseldorf, the Hochschule in Cologne and the Preussiche Akademie der Kunst in Berlin. In 1944 he was appointed conductor of the Barcelona Philharmonic Orchestra and the Gran Teatro del Liceo Opera House.
        Mr. Surinach moved to Paris in 1947, and to the United States in 1951. He became an American citizen in 1959. Early on, Mr. Surinach established himself as a composer whose style mixed elements recognizably drawn from flamenco with a kind of Stravinskian Neo-Classicism. He was regarded by many as a successor to the Spanish nationalist school of Albeniz, Granados and Falla, and in 1954 he was commissioned by Albeniz's heirs to orchestrate a suite from that composer's piano work, ''Iberia.'' He also made chamber arrangements of 18th- and 19th-century Spanish dances.
        His orchestral works include the ''Sinfonietta Flamenca'' (1953), ''Fandango'' (1954), a Concertino for Piano, Strings and Cymbals (1956), ''Paeans and Dances of Heathen Iberia'' (1959) and concertos for piano (1973), harp (1978) and violin (1980).  His ''Cantata of St. John'' 1963) was commissioned for a CBS television broadcast, as was one of his ballets, ''David and Bath-Sheba'' (1960).
        His other works include ''Songs of the Soul'' (1964) and ''Celebraciones Medievales'' (1977), for chorus, and ''Flamenco Meditations'' (1965) and ''Prayers'' (1973) for solo voice.
        Mr. Surinach taught composition at Carnegie-Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, in the 1960's, and at Queens College in the 1970's.
        No immediate family members survive.
