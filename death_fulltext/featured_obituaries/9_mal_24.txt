        George D. Aranow, former chief counsel of the American Automobile Owners' Association of New York and a Long Island community leader through much of the post-World War II period, died Sunday at West Park Hospital in Philadelphia after a brief illness. He was 93 and lived in a retirement home in Philadelphia.
        After graduating from the Brooklyn Law School, Mr. Aranow became staff attorney for the automobile owners' association, a private group that provided legal services for motorists in accidents. He quickly became chief counsel, remaining in that post for 20 years.
        Although he subsequently went into private law practice, Mr. Aranow remained active in community affairs on Long Island. He lived in Rockville Centre for more than 40 years.
        In the 1940's and 1950's, he led the drive to expand South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside. For more than 35 years he was a volunteer driver for the American Red Cross, transporting blind people. Mr. Aranow served as president of Temple B'nai Shalom in Rockville Centre for eight one-year terms, more than any other president.
        He is survived by a son, Harold Aranow of Philadelphia, and three grandchildren.
