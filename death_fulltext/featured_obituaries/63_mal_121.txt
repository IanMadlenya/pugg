        John DeVries, the lyricist, designer and illustrator, died on April 17 at Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 76 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died of complications after exploratory surgery, said a friend, Hank O'Neal.
        The first of Mr. DeVries's many collaborations as a lyricist with the pianist Joe Bushkin produced the standard "Oh, Look at Me Now," which in 1941 became one of Frank Sinatra's earliest hits. A few years later, Mr. Bushkin and Mr. DeVries, then in the Army, wrote "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin," a song made popular by Glenn Miller and others.
        Mr. DeVries also frequently composed with the guitarist and impresario Eddie Condon. Their work included "Wherever There's Love," a song recorded by Lee Wiley. A Stamp on Clubs
        Mr. DeVries produced designs for some of New York's legendary jazz clubs along 52d Street, most notably the Famous Door. In the 1970's, he designed the interior of the final incarnation of Eddie Condon's on West 54th Street. He also designed interiors for the homes of many celebrated New Yorkers, and for many years he was an advertising executive with the D'Arcy-McManus agency.
        Mr. DeVries's illustrations were widely used in advertising and music and book publishing. He has been credited with creating some of the first record-album covers, in the early 1940's for the Commodore label. He was working on illustrations up to his death, including covers for compact disks for recordings by Clark Terry and Teddy Wilson. He was also working on a biography of Helen Hayes, a friend.
        There are no immediate survivors.
