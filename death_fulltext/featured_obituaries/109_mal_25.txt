        The man who served as Emperor Hirohito's closest personal aide for more than  half a century, Yoshihiro Tokugawa, died today of respiratory failure. He was 89.
        Mr. Tokugawa, a descendant of the feudal-era Tokugawa shoguns, had been in poor health since his retirement in 1988. He had been hospitalized at Tokyo University Hospital with breathing problems since December, said a spokesman for the Imperial Household Agency.
        Mr. Tokugawa became Chamberlain to Emperor Hirohito, known posthumously as the Showa Emperor, in 1936 after graduating with a degree in art history from Tokyo University and then studying for three years at the University of Berlin.
        On the morning of Aug. 15, 1945, he blocked rebellious soldiers from seizing  a recording in which the Emperor announced Japan's surrender in World War II. The soldiers, who wanted Japan to fight to the death, had broken into the palace and demanded that Mr. Tokugawa turn over the tape in an effort to prevent the surrender from being broadcast.
        Mr. Tokugawa refused to disclose the tape's location. The broadcast was made  as scheduled at noon to a population that had been taught to revere the Emperor  as a god and had never heard his voice.
        Mr. Tokugawa became Grand Chamberlain in 1985, and then resigned in late 1988, citing poor health. The Emperor died in 1989.
