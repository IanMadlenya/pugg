        Dr. Niels H. Sonne, the retired librarian of the General Theological Seminary in Manhattan, died Friday at the Medical Center of Princeton, N.J. Dr. Sonne, who lived in Rossmoor, N.J., was 86.
        The cause was internal bleeding after an infection, said his wife, Grace.
        A specialist on the Gutenberg Bible, Dr. Sonne retired as the seminary's librarian in 1976 after 26 years. He graduated from Columbia College, and received a doctorate in history from Columbia University and a master's degree in divinity from the Union Theological Seminary.
        He is survived by his wife, of Rossmoor; two daughters, Carol Wilkes of Alexandria, Va., and Jane Hadden of Greenville, N.C., and a brother, Frank, of Wantagh, L.I.
