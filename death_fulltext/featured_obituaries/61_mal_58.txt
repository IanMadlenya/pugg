        Jim Pepper, a tenor saxophonist who was best known for writing the song "Witchi-Tai-To," died last Monday at home in Portland, Ore. He was 50 years old.
        He died of lymphoma, said his mother, Floy Pepper.
        Mr. Pepper, an aggressive saxophonist with a hard, crying tone, first came to New York in the early 1960's and began work with various members of the jazz avant-garde. He was encouraged early on by the saxophonist Ornette Coleman and frequently worked with the trumpeter Don Cherry, the saxophonist Dewey Redman and the drummer Paul Motian. In 1968 the folk group Brewer and Shipley recorded "Witchi-Tai-To," a song that Mr. Pepper had written to honor his Kaw and Creek Indian background.
        In 1971 Mr. Pepper performed with the guitarist Larry Coryell, and for the next two decades he moved around, playing in San Francisco and Portland, Ore., and overseas in Vienna. In 1989, Mr. Pepper returned to the United States and performed with Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father, Gilbert, and a sister, Suzanne Henry, all of Portland.
