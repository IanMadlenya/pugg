        Hugh Hurd, a stage and screen actor who was active in the civil rights movement, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 70 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause was complications from hypertension and kidney failure, his family said.
        Mr. Hurd joined with Godfrey Cambridge and Maya Angelou in organizing one of the first benefits in New York for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an occasion memorialized in Ms. Angelou's book "The Heart of a Woman." The benefit, held at the Village Gate in the late 1950's, raised $9,000 for Dr. King's civil rights movement.
        With Mr. Cambridge, Mr. Hurd founded and led a Committee for the Employment of Negro Performers in 1962. Their efforts prompted Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of Harlem to hold hearings on racial discrimination in the entertainment industry.
        Mr. Hurd won praise in 1960 as the male lead in John Cassavetes's improvisational feature film "Shadows," which the director shot without a screenplay or written dialogue. The actor last appeared on film in 1994 in a French documentary about Cassavetes.
        When the Arena Stage in Washington sought to develop an interracial theater in 1968, Mr. Hurd took the role of Mack the Knife in "The Threepenny Opera." In a long acting career, he was seen in scores of movies and stage productions as well as in television dramas, serials and commercials.
        Mr. Hurd is survived by his wife of 34 years, Dr. Merlyn Purdy Hurd; their three daughters, Denise and Michelle Hurd of Manhattan, and Adrienne Hurd of Los Angeles; a daughter by a previous marriage, Cheryl O'Connor of Manhattan; two sisters, Beryl Banks of Sag Harbor, L.I., and Dolores Hill of Manhattan; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
