        Dr. Milton J. Horowitz, a clinical psychologist who was a founding member and former president of the Los Angeles Institute and Society for Psychoanalytic Studies, died on March 31 at his home in Beverly Hills. He was 70.
        The cause was mesothelioma, his family said.
        That disease, a kind of cancer, is commonly caused by exposure to asbestos,  and last September a jury awarded $2 million to Dr. Horowitz, who contended that asbestos in the filters of Kent cigarettes he smoked from 1952 to 1963 had caused his illness. Kent's maker, the Lorillard Tobacco Company, which says there has been no asbestos in the filters since 1956, has an appeal pending before a Federal court in San Francisco.
        Dr. Horowitz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the City College of New  York. He received his Ph.D. at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., in 1952 and became chief psychologist at the University Hospital of Western Reserve in Cleveland.
        After a time as a director at the Reiss-Davis Child Study Center in Los Angeles, he began a private practice in 1969, working with children and adolescents. He helped found the Los Angeles Institute and Society for Psychoanalytic Studies in 1973, served as its president in the late 1970's and was its dean of training programs from 1985 until his death.
        Dr. Horowitz is survived by his wife, Shirley; his mother, Tessie Weinreb of  Briarwood, N.Y.; a son, Steven, of Davis, Calif.; three daughters, Shari Epstein and Joy Horowitz, both of Santa Monica, Calif., and Peggy Horowitz of Austin, Tex.; two sisters, Cynthia Reynolds and Roberta Winograd, both of New York, and  eight grandchildren.
