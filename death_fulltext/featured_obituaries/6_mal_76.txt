        Charles J. Stewart, the first chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, died Tuesday of cardiac failure at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 89 years old and also lived in Bronxville, N.Y.
        Mr. Stewart was the president of Manufacturers Trust when it merged with Hanover Bank in 1961 to form Manufacturers Hanover Trust, then the nation's fourth largest commercial bank - and now the fifth largest. Elected chairman of the combined bank, he served in that capacity until his retirement in 1963.
        A native Texan, he graduated from Yale in 1918 and served as a second lieutenant in the Army in World War I. After a real-estate career in Dallas he joined the commercial banking department of the New York Trust Company in 1930. He became an assistant vice president, vice president and, in 1949, the president.
        Mr. Stewart was to have become president of Manufacturers Trust Company in a proposed merger in 1952 of that bank and the New York Trust Company, but New York Trust stockholders turned down the deal. Mr. Stewart resigned from New York Trust shortly afterward and became a general partner of Lazard Freres & Company, an investment banking concern.
        He left Lazard Freres in 1959 to become president of Manufacturers Trust Company, as had been proposed years before.
        He is survived by his second wife, Clothilde; a daughter, Emily Goyer of Cuernavaca, Mexico; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
