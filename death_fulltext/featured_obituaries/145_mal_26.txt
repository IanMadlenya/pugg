        Josef Meier, who brought his Passion play to the United States from Germany in 1932 and continued in the role of  Jesus for six decades, died on Jan. 31  in Spearfish, S.D. He was 94.
        Mr. Meier was the seventh generation of his family to portray Jesus in the drama, remaining in the part  until he retired in 1991 after more than 9,000 performances.
        He took the Passion play on tour before finding a permanent home for his production in Spearfish in 1939. Even after an amphitheater was constructed in Spearfish, the Passion play toured the United States and Canada, appearing in more than 650 major cities before the tours ended in 1964.
        In 1953, Mr. Meier made Lake Wales the winter home for the play, which was performed annually there until last year.
        His daughter, Johanna Meier, and son-in-law, Guido Della Vecchia, who now produce the play, are to stage it  this winter in Lakeland.
        Mr. Meier received the National Freedom Foundation Award and the Bundesverdienstkreuz, the highest civilian award given by the German Government, as well as medals of recognition from three popes.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Clare, and a brother, Wilhelm, of Luenen, Germany.
