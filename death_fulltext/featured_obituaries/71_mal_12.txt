        Paul A. Anderson, a Chicago commodity trader and a benefactor of AIDS-related projects, died Nov. 18 at his home in San Francisco. He was 43 years old and also lived in Chicago.
        Word of his death was received yesterday from Martin Delaney, a friend in San Francisco who said Mr. Anderson died from AIDS.
        Mr. Anderson, a native of Park Ridge, Ill., received a bachelor's degree from Augustana College in Rock Island, Ill., and a master's degree from Purdue University. He was a member of the Chicago Board of Trade, a former president of the Ferguson Grain Company and a trustee of Augustana College.
        In 1989 he established the Anderson Prize Foundation, which underwrites the Stonewall Awards, annual grants to people who help to improve the lives of homosexuals in the United States. The awards are named after the Stonewall Inn, the target of a New York City police raid in 1969. In addition, his Paul Anderson Foundation supports a variety of philanthropic causes in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington.
        Mr. Anderson is survived by his companion, Allen Schuh; his mother, Betty Anderson of Park Ridge, and two sisters, Karen and Deborah.
