        Cecil Collins, an English artist who painted in the mystical, romantic tradition of William Blake, died Sunday. He was 81 years old.
        The artist had attended the opening of a retrospective of his work at the Tate Gallery last month, a spokesman for the Tate said. The gallery did not report the cause of death.
        Mr. Collins was the author of ''The Vision of the Fool,'' a book in which he exalted the role of the artist. He was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Arts last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Elisabeth Ramsden.
