        Samuel Hoffman, a senior partner at the law firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, died Tuesday of cancer of the kidney at his home in San Jose, Calif. He was 80 years old. Mr. Hoffman, who specialized in corporate law, ''had tireless energy in negotiating creative acquisitions and business combinations,'' said Franklin Feldman, a senior partner at Stroock.

        He received his law degree in 1928 and became a partner at Stroock in 1945. He played a major role in building up the firm's corporate-law department. The firm currently has 300 lawyers.
        He is survived by his wife, Lillian; a daughter, Carole Mawson of Woodside, Calif.; a son, Alan, of Kirkland, Wash., and seven grandchildren.
