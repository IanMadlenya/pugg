        Jay Allen, a publicity agent who turned authors into celebrities and their books into best sellers by cultivating a mass audience, died on Wednesday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. He was 79.
        He had been hospitalized with pneumonia and heart problems, his associate, Michael Dougherty, said.
        In 1968, Mr. Allen began the publicity campaign for Jacqueline Susann's "Valley of the Dolls," building sales by concentrating on radio and television audiences. Over the years, he represented 38 publishing houses in the promotion  of 523 books written by 373 authors. At the height of his career, he was promoting no fewer than six books a month.
        Authors became devoted to him. Ms. Susann, who was his client until her death in 1974, even made Mr. Allen a character in one of her books.
        His author list included Robert Ludlum, James Clavell, Herman Wouk, Judith Krantz, Maya Angelou, Sidney Sheldon, Barbara Cartland, Tom Wolfe and David Halberstam. He also represented Lillian Hellman, Gore Vidal, Norman Mailer, Christopher Isherwood, Ingrid Bergman, Sophia Loren and Helen Hayes.
        Mr. Allen was born in Dodge City, Kan., and graduated from the University of  Kansas with a degree in journalism. He joined the news staff of The Dodge City Daily Globe, worked as a stringer for The Associated Press and took a job in radio news at KGNO in Dodge City.
        After serving in the Army during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles to work for the gossip columnist Jimmy Fidler. Later, he became an associate of the publicity agent Bev Barnett, promoting such Hollywood stars as John Wayne, Dick  Powell, Gene Autry and Johnny Cash. After Barnett's death in 1961, Mr. Allen opened his own office, specializing in show business accounts until 1968 when the "Valley of the Dolls" campaign turned him in a new direction.
