        Lee Boltin, a photographer of art objects who specialized in primitive works, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 73 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        He died of leukemia, said his wife, Caroll.
        Mr. Boltin photographed several important exhibitions and collections, including the contents of the ancient Egyptian king Tutankhamen's tomb for the book "Tutankhamen: The Tomb and Its Treasures" in 1977, and the Nelson A. Rockefeller collection, which was the subject of "Masterpieces of Primitive Art," published in 1978.
        Born in New York City in 1917, Mr. Bolton trained at the American Museum of Natural History, where his early photographs focused on pre-Columbian and Eskimo art. In 1954 he left the museum to work on his own. His photographs have appeared in museums around the United States and in Europe, as well as in art books and other publications.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Benjamin, of Peeksill, N.Y., and two daughters, Julia, of Manhattan, and Lydia Feldman of Morristown, N.J.
