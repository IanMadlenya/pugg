        Harry C. Piper Jr., a Minneapolis stockbroker who paid a $1 million ransom for the return of his kidnapped wife in 1972, died on Sunday at his home in Orono, Minn., at the age of 72. He died of bone cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Piper retired in 1972 as chairman of Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Inc., a family company that he had joined in 1946 when he returned from Army service in the Pacific in World War II.
        His wife, Virginia, to whom he was married for 45 years and who died in 1988, was kidnapped by two masked men from their Minneapolis home on July 27, 1972. She was found chained to a tree but otherwise unharmed two days later in a wooded area near Duluth, 150 miles away, after her husband delivered $1 million in $20 bills to the kidnappers.
        Two men were convicted of the kidnapping but the verdicts were reversed on appeal and they were acquitted in a retrial in 1979.
        He is survived by three sons, Addison, of Orono, who is currently chairman of Piper, Jaffray; Harry 3d of Bozeman, Mont., and David, of Minneapolis; a sister, Catherine Knoblauch of Minneapolis, and eight grandchildren.
