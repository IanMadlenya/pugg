        Serge Gainsbourg, the singer and songwriter known for his image of unshaven decadence and his songs full of provocative, sometimes tender lyrics, died late Saturday at his home here, officials said. He was 62 years old.
        Doctors said the singer apparently died of natural causes, but they did not elaborate. Mr. Gainsbourg had suffered both heart and liver illnesses.
        He was born on April 2, 1928, in Paris, the son of a pianist. He studied art and then turned to a career in nightclubs. His first album of original songs, in the 1950's, was a success.
        In 1969, Mr. Gainsbourg and his companion, the British actress Jane Birkin, recorded "Je T'Aime, Moi Non Plus," a breathy song that was forbidden in Italy after being denounced in the Vatican newspaper.
        The couple split up in 1980, but Mr. Gainsbourg continued to refer to her as his muse and helped further the career of the couple's daughter, Charlotte, who has won praise as a film actress. Mr. Gainsbourg appeared in about 20 films, including "Je Vous Aime" with Catherine Deneuve.
        Mr. Gainsbourg and his most recent companion, Bambou, had a son, Lulu, in 1986.
