        Rozz Williams, a songwriter and musician who founded the 17-year-old Gothic rock group Christian Death, died on April 1 at his home in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 34.
        The cause was suicide by hanging, said a spokesman for his record label, Triple X.
        In the 1980's, as a splinter of punk-rock was being transformed in England into slower, darker, death-obsessed Gothic rock, Mr. Williams formed, at 16, what was to be the preeminent American Gothic rock act, Christian Death. Though Mr. Williams (who was born Roger Alan Painter) always rejected the label  Gothic, the band's ambitious, brooding music and song titles like ''Death Wish'' and ''Believers of the Unpure'' only helped to cement it, earning the group a dedicated following.
        Mr. Williams, who battled alcohol and drug abuse and manic depression, left the group in the mid-80's and formed a rival Christian Death. In 1993 he briefly reunited with his former bandmates.
        Mr. Williams's career took several directions in the late 80's and 90's as he tried to move away from the Gothic trappings of Christian Death.  His projects ranged from hard rock to spoken word to instrumental to death rock to ambient electronic music.
        He had completed two unreleased albums before his death, a double album of electronic music to be released by Triple X next month and another Shadow Project record.
        He is survived by his parents, Robert and Gladys Williams, and a sister, Jan, all of Victoriaville, Calif., and two brothers.
