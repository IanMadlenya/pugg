        Frank A. Cardman, former director of security for Pan American World Airways, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. He was 75 years old and lived in Glen Head, L.I.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Dorothea, said.
        Mr. Cardman became a vice president for security at Pan American in 1969 after a number of airliner hijackings and the destruction of a Pan Am jumbo jet on the ground in Cairo. He later became chairman of the New York Airport Security Council and helped develop screening profiles to identify potential hijackers. He also headed delegations to Interpol conferences on airport security in Frankfurt and Vienna.
        Mr. Cardman joined Pan American in 1941 after earning a Master of Business Administration degree at Harvard. He had served as director of insurance for Pan Am.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by three daughters, Francine, of Somerville, Mass.; Denise, of Arlington, Va., and Michele Gilbride of Jackson Heights, Queens; two sisters, Nataline Cardman of Jackson Heights and Lee Harris of Denver; a brother, Michael, of Short Hills, N.J., and eight grandchildren.
        Correction:  February 7, 1991, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Frank A. Cardman, former director of security for Pan American World Airways, misstated the year in which a hijacked Pan Am jumbo jet was destroyed on the ground in Cairo. It was 1970.
