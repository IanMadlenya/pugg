        Nathan George Horwitt, an independent industrial designer whose Movado watch is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art, died last Wednesday at his home in Stockbridge, Mass. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Horwitt's son, Henry, said he died in his sleep of natural causes.
        Mr. Horwitt also designed the Beta chair at the Brooklyn Museum. Among his inventions were the frameless picture frame, devised to draw more attention to the picture, and a numberless clock face, which was brought out initially by the Movado Watch Corportion and later widely copied.
        In all, he held 18 United States patents on various designs.
        Mr. Horwitt, who was born in Russia, was brought to the United States as a boy. He attended City College and New York University and later studied at the Art Students League of New York.
        He served in the Army in World War I and joined E. R. Squibb & Company as an advertising copywriter, eventually becoming director of advertising.
        In the late 1920's Mr. Horwitt formed Design Engineers in Manhattan, a concern that lasted only three years. His son said he then made a threadbare living patenting ideas and trying to sell them to manufacturers.
        From the 1960's through the 1970's he was an organic farmer in Berkshire County, Mass.
        Mr. Horwitt, who was Jewish, was an advocate of the creation of a Jewish state and was a board member of the American League for a Free Palestine. In 1980, he received the Jabotinsky Centennial Medal, for those who worked for the establishment of the State of Israel, from Menachem Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister.
        Besides his son, who lives in Peekskill, N.Y., Mr. Horwitt is survived by two granddaughters.
