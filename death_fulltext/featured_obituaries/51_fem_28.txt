        Loretta U. Boyce, an educator who helped create a school for gifted and talented black and Hispanic youngsters in Brooklyn, died on Wednesday at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. She was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of heart failure, said her niece, Roslyn Bacon.
        Ms. Boyce joined the New York City public school system in the mid-1950's as a kindergarten teacher at Public School 125. She later became an acting assistant principal, assistant superintendent of schools in District 16 and deputy superintendent of schools in District 32.
        In 1976, she was named principal of Intermediate School 383, the Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented, a special school she had envisioned for minority-group children. The school's achievements in reading have consistantly ranked it among the top schools in New York City. She retired in 1989.
        She is survived by three sisters, Uldine Garrison, Gwendolyn Hurley and Una James, all of Brooklyn.
