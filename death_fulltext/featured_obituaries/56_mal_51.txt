        John Fletcher Wilson, professor emeritus of speech and theater at Lehman College in the Bronx, died Tuesday at Bellevue Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The college reported that he died from complications following the recent implantation of a cardiac pacemaker.
        Professor Wilson retired two years ago after 22 years on the faculty. He joined Lehman College as an associate professor in 1967, became a full professor four years later and was chairman of the speech and theater department for six years, starting in 1979. He also served for many years as the parliamentarian of the college's Faculty-Student Senate and was recently elected president of the Lehman College Retirees Association.
        A graduate of Wayne State University, he held a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin and taught at Cornell University for a dozen years before coming to Lehman, which is a part of the City University of New York.
        There are no immediate survivors.
