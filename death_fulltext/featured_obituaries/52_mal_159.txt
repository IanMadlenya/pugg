        Samuel O. Kaylin, an editor and teacher who specialized in the field of retailing, died on Thursday at the Mary Wade nursing home in New Haven. He was 78 years old and had lived for many years in Oceanside, L.I., before moving to Guilford, Conn.
        He died in his sleep, his family said.
        Mr. Kaylin was editor of the magazine Chain Store Age from 1939 to 1968 and was director of publications for the International Council of Shopping Centers from 1968 to 1971. He was president of the National Conference of Business Paper Editors from 1952 to 1954.
        After retiring to Florida, Mr. Kaylin joined the faculty of Nova University in Fort Lauderdale, where he directed a doctoral program for educators.
        Mr. Kaylin's wife, the former Pauline Gaffin, died in 1979. He is survived by two daughters, Terry Smith of Columbia, Md., and Stephanie Kaylin of Guilford, Conn.; four grandsons, and a great-granddaughter.
