        Dr. Morris S. Schulzinger, a physician for 61 years who became an expert on accidents and their prevention, died on Wednesday at Christ Hospital in Cincinnati, where he lived. He was 94.
        The cause was kidney and heart failure, said a daughter, Penina Frankel of Cincinnati.
        His 1956 book, "The Accident Syndrome" (Charles C. Thomas), was based on his treatment of thousands of cases as head of his own emergency clinic. In the book, he observed that although accidents were largely solitary experiences, they had a pattern that allowed predictions about when, to whom and under what conditions they were most likely to happen. His findings were presented to the American Medical Association and were used by insurance companies in statistical analyses.
        A native of Lithuania, he immigrated to the United States as a youth and received a medical degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1924. In 1929 he set up a private practice and stayed in the same neighborhood for 61 years, specializing in industrial and emergency medicine.
        He founded a local Hebrew language society and helped establish the Jewish Vocational Bureau to fight discrimination in hiring.
        Besides his daughter Penina, he is survived by his wife of 68 years, Ruth; a daughter Judy Lucas of Cincinnati; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
