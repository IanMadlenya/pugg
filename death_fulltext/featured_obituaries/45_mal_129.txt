        Prof. Boris B. Piotrovsky, the director of the Hermitage in Leningrad, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in that city on Monday, the Soviet press agency Tass reported. He was 82 years old.
        Professor Piotrovsky won fame in 1939 for his discovery of the ancient civilization of Urartu, in present-day Armenia. From 1964 until his death, he served as director of the Hermitage.
        He published more than 200 works in the Soviet Union, including ''The History and Culture of Urartu.'' His excavations at Karmir Blur in Armenia uncovered the remains of an Urartu-period town and fortress.
        From Archeology to Art
        After nearly 15 years in archeology, Professor Piotrovsky became a member of the Armenian Academy of Science in 1944. He became director of the Leningrad branch of the predecessor to the Institute of Archeology in 1953, then took over leadership of the Hermitage 11 years later, according to biographical encyclopedias.
        Professor Piotrovsky won dozens of Soviet awards, Tass said, and was an honorary member of the British, French and other foreign academies of science.
        He took part in analyzing the remains of King Tutankhamen's tomb and helped decipher dozens of rock drawings in Egypt, Tass said.
        Shifts in Cultural Freedom
        During his tenure at the Hermitage, cultural freedom in the Soviet Union expanded and contracted, and recently expanded again under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
        The Hermitage, always a focal point of world artistic attention, has taken some advantage of the openness by agreeing to show some works long hidden and letting others travel to foreign countries for exhibit.
        No successor was announced at the Hermitage.
