        Kathryn Morgan Ryan, an author and editor, died on Tuesday at the Indian River Hospital in Vero Beach, Fla. She was 68 and lived in Ridgefield, Conn., for many years before moving to Vero Beach.
        The family said that the cause was emphysema and that she had long been ill.
        Mrs. Ryan is best known for "A Private Battle" (1979), the book she wrote with her husband, Cornelius Ryan, about his four-year battle with cancer. Mr. Ryan, the World War II historian, who died in 1974, kept a secret diary and tapes about his illness, which his wife put together in what one reviewer called "the many-sided story of love."  Worked With Husband
        Throughout their 24-year marriage, Mrs. Ryan collaborated closely with her husband, helping with the research and editing his most popular works: "The Longest Day," "The Last Battle" and "A Bridge Too Far." After his death, she also wrote the screen treatment and was chief technical adviser on "A Bridge Too Far," which he completed just before his death.
        In 1972, Mrs. Ryan wrote "The Betty Tree," a novel about Midwestern attitudes and two adolescent children coping with affluent, busy parents.
        She was born in Rose Hill, Iowa. After graduating from the University of Missouri School of Journalism in 1946, she went to work for Conde Nast Publications, becoming an editor at House and Garden magazine, where she remained until 1953. She and Mr. Ryan were married in 1950.
        From 1955 to 1960, she was an associate editor with House and Home magazine. She also contributed to Alan King's "Anybody Who Owns His Own Home Deserves It" (1962), a humorous look at suburbia.
        She is survived by a daughter, Victoria Ryan Bida of Penfield, N.Y; a son, Geoffrey John Morgan Ryan of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.
