        William A. James, the chief pilot of American Airlines, died Saturday in a skiing accident in Park City, Utah. He was 52 and lived in Colleyville, Tex.
        He was killed when he veered off course, struck a tree and suffered head injuries, a company spokesman said.
        Mr. James was American's vice president of flight and chief pilot at the airline's international headquarters in Fort Worth. He was in charge of 10,000 pilots for American, the world's largest airline.
        Inspired by a ride in a small propeller plane as a youngster, Mr. James learned to fly in his early 20's while serving in the Marines from 1961 to 1965. He was a fighter pilot and reached the rank of first lieutenant.
        After leaving the military, he started his career at American as a flight engineer on DC-6 and DC-7 planes. Later he served as a first officer, captain and "check airman," or trainer, on the Boeing 727 and 707. In 1981 he was named the project manager for the Boeing 767 fleet, which began flights late the next year.
        American appointed him the director of flight training at its academy at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in 1985. In 1987 he was made the manager of flight for the southeast region, based in Raleigh-Durham, N.C. He returned to the academy in 1988 as managing director of flight training. His promotion to vice president and chief pilot came in 1991.
        A native of Bryan, Tex., Mr. James grew up in Waco, Tex. He was a 1961 graduate of Texas A&M University.
        Surviving are his wife of 32 years, the former Ann Nowlin; two sons, William Jr. of San Diego and Andrew of Dallas; a daughter, Anne Katherine of Albuquerque, N.M., and his mother, Una of Bryan.
