        Georges de Montebello, an investment banker and president of the Swiss Helvetia Fund, the first mutual fund in the United States to specialize in Swiss securities, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 62, and lived in Manhattan and Paris.
        The cause was cancer, said his younger brother Philippe, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. de Montebello, who began his banking career with Morgan Guarantee Trust in 1962, ran its Geneva office in the 1970's and remained with the company until 1981.
        He served briefly as the secretary and chief operating officer of Christie's International, the New York auction house, before joining the Hottinger Banking Group of Paris.
        He was president of the arm of the bank known as the Hottinger Capital Corporation, and created and led the Swiss Helvetia Fund, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
        Mr. de Montebello, a son of Count Roger de Montebello and the former Germaine Croisset, was born in Paris in 1934 and moved to the United States with his family in 1951.
        On his father's side, he was a descendant of Marshal Jean Lannes, the Duke of Montebello and an aide to Napoleon. On his mother's side, he was a descendant of the Marquis de Sade. Marcel Proust based the character of the Duchess of Guermantes in ''Remembrance of Things Past'' in large part on Mr. de Montebello's great-grandmother Laure de Sade.
        Mr. de Montebello, who was a Navy pilot in the mid-50's, earned a bachelor of arts degree from Harvard University in 1960.
        Besides his brother Philippe, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. de Montebello is survived by his wife of 34 years, the former Edith Decazes of Manhattan and Paris; two sons, Roger, of Venice, and Jean, of Washington; a daughter, Cecile, of Paris; his brothers Alain and Henry, both of Paris, and a granddaughter. Mr. de Montebello's eldest son, Francis, died in 1994.
