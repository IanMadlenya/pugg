        William Melville Farrell, a former reporter for The New York Times, died at a nursing home in Huntington, N.Y., on Sunday. He was 89.
        In his 47-year career at The Times, Mr. Farrell worked his way up from copy boy during his high school days to writing guest columns to covering the trial of Dr. Sam Sheppard, one of the most highly publicized murder cases of the 1950's.
        Mr. Farrell was born in New York City on May 26, 1911, to Austin A. Farrell and Elizabeth C. Cubitt. After graduating from De La Salle Institute, he attended Columbia University. He began working at The Times as a copy boy in 1929 and was soon promoted to general assignment reporter on what was then called the city desk.
        His mentor was Meyer Berger, the Pulitzer Prize-winning star reporter and columnist of The Times. When Mr. Berger went on vacation, Mr. Farrell occasionally wrote the About New York column.
        Mr. Farrell married Anne Byrne on June 3, 1969, in Manhattan.
        During World War II, Mr. Farrell served in the United States Marine Corps and was an editor for Leatherneck, the Marine Corps magazine.
        At The Times, Mr. Farrell also worked on the picture desk and the national desk. He retired in 1977.
        Mr. Farrell lived his final years in Huntington. He was predeceased by his wife. He is survived by a son, William C. Farrell, of Huntington; and three granddaughters, Amy, Ann Marie and Catherine, all of Boston.
        Correction:  October 19, 2000, Thursday  An obituary on Saturday about William M. Farrell, a former reporter for The New York Times, misstated the year of his marriage to Anne Byrne. It was 1939, not 1969.
