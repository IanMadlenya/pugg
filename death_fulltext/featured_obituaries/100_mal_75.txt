        Harold Charles Deutsch, a retired University of Minnesota historian who wrote extensively on World War II, the German military and postwar Europe, died on Sunday at his home in White Bear Township, Minn. He was 90.
        The cause was kidney failure, the university reported.
        Dr. Deutsch's familiarity with Europe went back to the 1920's and 1930's, when he studied at the University of Paris, the University of Vienna and the University of Berlin. He joined the Minnesota faculty in 1929 and retired in 1972.
        In all, he spent 10 years in Europe, becoming fluent in German and French. He served overseas in World War II as head of research for the Office of Strategic Services, a forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.
        Shortly before he died, he finished work as editor and contributor to a book, "What If: The Might-Have-Beens of World War II." The university said it was expected to be published this summer.
        Two of his many earlier books remain available from Books on Demand. One is "The Conspiracy Against Hitler in the Twilight War," a reference to the fractured opposition in the German establishment in the months before Germany launched the Western spring offensive through the Low Countries in 1940. The other is "Hitler and His Generals: The Hidden Crisis, January-June 1938."
        Born in Milwaukee, Dr. Deutsch graduated from the University of Wisconsin, where he also earned a master's in 1925. He received his doctorate from Harvard University in 1929.
        Over the years he also lectured at the University of Southern California, the National War College, the Army War College and Free University of West Berlin.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two daughters, Janet Leaf and Dorothy Thews, both of Roseville, Minn.; a son, Harold Jr., of Garrison, Minn.; 16 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. His first wife, Marie Frey Deutsch, died five years ago.
