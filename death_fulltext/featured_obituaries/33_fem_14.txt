        Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Dr. Vivian Chang misstated some aspects of her career. At her death she was both an assistant surgeon general of the United States Public Health Service and regional health administrator for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services in New York City. She moved to New York after serving as a doctor in the Peace Corps in Africa.
