        Maurice Galy, president of the Lycee Francais de New York for more than three decades, died on June 11 at his home in Massat in the Pyrenees region of southwestern France. He was 75.
        He had suffered from a long illness, said a friend of the family.
        A senior civil servant in the French Education Ministry, Mr. Galy spent most of his career in New York, where he first served in the cultural services section at the French Embassy in 1956. The following year, he was appointed president of the Lycee Francais, a post he held until he retired in 1989.
        Mr. Galy played an influential role in developing the lycee, an independent, nonprofit primary and secondary school. The lycee, chartered by the New York State Board of Regents in 1936, offers a French curriculum and is accredited by the French Government.
        Mr. Galy carefully maintained the lycee's traditions and high level of education. The school originally occupied a residential building on East 95th Street near Fifth Avenue and Mr. Galy arranged for the acquisition of three more landmark mansions, two on East 72d Street and one on East 93d Street.
        Born in Toulouse, Mr. Galy graduated from the University of Toulouse and received a degree in modern and contemporary history in 1942. He held various positions with the Education Ministry and Secretariat of Youth and Sports from 1942 to 1950 and served as assistant dean and vice dean at College de l'Europe Libre in Strasbourg from 1951 to 1956.
        The French Government made him a Commander of the Palmes Academiques, the highest French honor for educators, and a Knight of the Legion of Honor, its highest civilian commendation.
        Survivors include his wife, Paule; a daughter, Elisabeth; two sons, Jean-Pierre and Jean-Francois.
