        Joseph Cardinal Hoffner, the former head of the Roman Catholic Church in West Germany and a strong supporter of Pope John Paul II, died in a Cologne hospital on Friday. He was 80 years old.
        A church spokesman said Cardinal Hoffner, Archbishop of Cologne, died after a long illness caused by a brain tumor.
        The Cardinal asked the Pope in August to relieve him of his post after doctors said his condition was inoperable. His successor as head of the West German Catholic Church is Bishop Karl Lehmann of Mainz.
        A conservative, Cardinal Hoffner was a strong defender of traditional Catholic moral doctrine. He rejected the idea of allowing married men to become priests and opposed permitting divorced and remarried Catholics to take communion.
        He campaigned for a ban on abortion and condemned calls by the antiwar movement for civil disobedience.
        Born in December 1906 to a farming family in the staunchly Catholic Rhineland, he studied in Freiburg and at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Ordained a priest in 1932, he taught theology at Trier and Munster Universities, before becoming Bishop of Munster in 1962.
        Pope Paul VI named him Bishop of Cologne in February 1969, and two months later he became a Cardinal. He was elected head of the West German Catholic Church in 1976.
