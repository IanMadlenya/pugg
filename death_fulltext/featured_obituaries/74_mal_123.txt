        Benjamin S. Clark, a retired investment banker, died on Thursday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 85.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Mr. Clark joined the Wall Street firm of White, Weld & Company as a young man and retired as a senior partner in 1973. The firm has since been sold to Merrill Lynch.
        He was born in Englewood, N.J., and graduated from Harvard. In World War II, he served as a master sergeant with the 82d Airborne Division.
        He was a supporter of the New York City Ballet, a life governor of New York Hospital, honorary trustee of the American Museum of Natural History and a trustee of the Henry Street Settlement.
        A lifelong interest in ornithology and conservation led him to bequeath land to the Pound Ridge Conservancy and the Maine Heritage Trust for Acadia National Park. He also left books to the rare-book collection of Harvard's Houghton Library.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Charlotte Lyman; a son, Benjamin Jr., of Chatham, N.Y.; three daughters, Charlotte de Bresson of Paris, Ella Clark of West Cornwall, Conn., and Elizabeth Clark of Pound Ridge; a sister, Dorothy Ramer of Falls Church, Va., and three grandchildren.
