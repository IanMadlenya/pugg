        Toby Rowland, an American-born theatrical impresario and theater executive who was prominent in London, died on Tuesday. He was 77 and lived in Sussex, England.
        He had cancer, said The Times of London, which called him "the only American to have spent the last 40 years at the very peak of theater management" in London.
        Mr. Rowland was born in Libby, Mont., worked in the New York theater and, in the 1950's, became a producer of stage works in the West End, London's theater district.
        He also became a leading figure in Stoll Moss Theaters, a large London chain, for 25 years until he retired from it in 1984. He was president of the Society of West End Theater Managers in the 1970's.
        Cameron Mackintosh, the British producer of "Miss Saigon" and other musicals, wrote last week that when he first met Mr. Rowland, in the 1960's, he was "amazed to find that the czar of West End theaters was actually still at heart an enthusiastic theater producer.
        "He cared desperately about the quality of the shows he booked and was always on the lookout for new talent."
        Mr. Rowland also cherished the enthusiasm of American theater lovers for the London stage. "London theater is still cheap and that's why so many Americans enjoy it," he said cheerfully in an interview in 1971, while he headed the West End theater-managers' group.
        It was in 1953 that he began operating as an individual theatrical producer in London. He went on to present more than 30 productions there, many of which were highly praised. They included "The Desperate Hours" in 1955 and "Brouhaha," with Peter Sellers, in 1958.
        Later Mr. Rowland did productions with Prince Littler, an influential showman at Stoll Moss, and in the mid-1980's he founded a new company, Libby Productions.
        He is survived by his wife, Millie.
