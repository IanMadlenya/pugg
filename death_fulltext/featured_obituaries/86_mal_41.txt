        Paul A. Sergios, the author of "One Boy at War: My Life in the AIDS Underground," died on Sunday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 32.
        The cause was AIDS, said Robin Swados, his editor at Alfred A. Knopf.
        Mr. Sergios was born in Fort Lauderdale. He received a bachelor's degree in film and television production and psychobiology from the University of Southern California at Los Angeles. In 1983, while working in film production, he learned that he was HIV positive. He became part of an informal network of those interested in testing alternative medical therapies and medicines for AIDS. His experiences formed the basis for "One Boy at War," which was published last year.
        He was a frequent contributor to Forefront, a journal devoted to alternative therapies.
        He is survived by his mother, Madeline Sergios of Fort Lauderdale.
