        He died of a cerebral aneurysm, a funeral home representative said.
        A graduate of the Lingnan University Medical College in Canton, China, Dr. Lai came to the United States in 1960, did his residency at South Baltimore General Hospital and was in private practice in Baltimore. In 1977 he moved to Manhattan and formed the Chatham Medical Group in Chinatown. He was on the board of the Head Start program of Chinatown and was the host of a weekly medical call-in program on Chinese-language radio.
        He is survived by his wife, Irene Fan Lai; two sons, Francis and Gilbert, both of Watchung; and a sister, So-Sum Wong of Toronto.
