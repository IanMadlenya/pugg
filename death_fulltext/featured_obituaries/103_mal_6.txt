        Alexander Boyd Hawes, a lawyer who worked in various Federal agencies and had a private practice in Washington for many years, died yesterday at his summer home in Little Compton, R.I. He was 88 and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Hawes served in the Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, starting with the Federal Trade Commission in 1933. He eventually joined the National Labor Relations Board, but resigned in 1940 when Roosevelt replaced the chairman in a move that Mr. Hawes thought unfair.
        In 1944, as a staff member of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency, he helped negotiate relief agreements with Italy.
        After World War II, he entered private practice with a firm that became Fowler, Leva, Hawes & Symington, and he stayed until the early 1970's. One client was the international aid organization CARE, for which he was general counsel for many years.
        Mr. Hawes was born in New York City but grew up in Boston. He graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.
        His first wife, Elizabeth, died in 1975.
        He is survived by his second wife, Rosilla; four children, Alexander, of Dover, England, Harriet Hawes Savage of Pelham, N.Y., Sue Hawes of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Matthew A., of London; a sister, Mary N. Allsebrook, of Oxford, England; a stepdaughter, Lynden Breed Miller, of New York City; 10 grandchildren, 4 step-grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  August 3, 1995, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Alexander Boyd Hawes, a Washington lawyer who worked in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Administration, misstated the day of his death. It was Monday, not Tuesday. The obituary also misstated the hometown of a son, Alexander B. Hawes Jr. It is Dover, Mass., not England.
