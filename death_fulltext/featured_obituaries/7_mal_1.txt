        Mr. Arbib was the editor of American Birds, the scholarly magazine of the National Audubon Society, from 1970 to 1984. As such he ran the Society's annual Christmas Bird Count, a major event among bird watchers.
        He was the author of five books, including ''The Lord's Woods: The Passing of an American Woodland,'' which was published in 1971 and which was awarded the John Burroughs Medal for the best American nature book of 1972.
        The inspiration for the book was the once quiet countryside of Woodmere, L.I., near what is now Kennedy Airport, where he had spent most of his youth.
        Mr. Arbib graduated from Yale University in 1937 and served in the Army iin World War II. He was in the advertising business for many years before he joined the Society's magazine.
        He is survived by his wife, Renee; a son, Robert of Cummington, Mass.; two brothers, John A. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. and Richard H. of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
