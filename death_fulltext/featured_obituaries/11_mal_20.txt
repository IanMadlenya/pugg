        Jay Schulman, a sociologist who advised lawyers in the selection of jurors, died yesterday in his apartment on Central Park West. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Schulman, who suffered a heart attack two years ago, had been complaining of chills in the last week, according to his former wife, Julia Schulman. She said the exact cause of death had not yet been determined.
        Mr. Schulman was widely viewed as among the first in the field of jury consultancy, in which social scientists and market researchers help lawyers select jurors and disqualify those who might be unfavorable to their clients.
        Over the years Mr. Schulman had worked on behalf of clients as diverse as Attica inmates; Claus von Bulow; Kathy Boudin, a Weather Underground radical who was a defendant in the Brink's robbery and murder case; Gen. William C. Westmoreland in his libel case against CBS; battered women and Wall Street figures charged with insider trading. 'Great Assistance'
        One of the last cases in which he was involved was the Howard Beach murder trial, still under way in State Supreme Court in Queens.
        Yesterday, Charles J. Hynes, the special prosecutor in the Howard Beach case, said of Mr. Schulman: ''He rendered great assistance to me and my office in helping us select what has been characterized - I think correctly - as a rainbow jury in Queens County.
        ''I don't know what the result of that will be, but his contributions will not be forgotten by any of us in my office for a long time.''
        Mr. Schulman is survived by two daughters, Jana, of Reykjavik, Iceland, and Martha, of Providence, R.I.; his mother, Ann Shapiro of Miami Beach, and a brother, Robert, of Tinton Falls, N.J.
