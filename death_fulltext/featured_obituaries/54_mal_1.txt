        Abraham R. Klitzman, a lawyer who was active in Jewish affairs, died on Saturday at the Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. He was 83 years old and lived in Long Branch.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        In 1931, he founded the Asbury Park, N.J., law firm of Klitzman & Gallagher. From 1947 to 1952, he was a municipal court judge in Belmar, and from 1962 to 1965 he was chairman of Belmar's New Jersey Tercentenary Celebration.
        Active in Jewish and Zionist affairs, he was a past president of the Congregation Sons of Israel in Belmar, of which his father, the late Rev. Meyer Klitzman, was rabbi. He was vice president and a member of the executive committee of the Jewish National Fund in the New Jersey region, and a board member of the Hillel School and the Monmouth Jewish Community Center.
        In 1983 he received the Torch of Liberty Award from the Monmouth County Society of the Fellows of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith for outstanding community service.
        He was born in Lynn, Mass., and was a graduate of the New Jersey Law School, now Rutgers University Law School.
        Mr. Klitzman is survived by his wife, the former Faye Kamen; a daughter, Linda Ben-Zvi, of Fort Collins, Colo.; a son, Stephen, of Washington; three sisters, Jeanette Klitzman of Long Branch, Anne Levy of Monmouth Beach, N.J. and Barbara Mogulescu of Manhattan; two brothers, Joseph, of Huntington, L.I., and Maurice, of Bethesda, Md., and three grandchildren.
