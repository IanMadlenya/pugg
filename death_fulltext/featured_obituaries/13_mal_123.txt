        Jean Baube, a French journalist and confidant of de Gaulle who served as counselor for press relations at the French Embassy in Washington for nearly three decades, died of heart failure yesterday at Venice Hospital in Venice, Fla. He was 81 years old and had lived in Boca Grande, Fla., since his retirement in 1974.
        A native of Paris, Mr. Baube began his career in London as a staff member of Havas, the official French news agency. He was assigned to Washington in 1936 and served there as a correspondent until 1941, when he resigned to join the Free French forces under de Gaulle in London. He served on the general's personal staff until 1945, when he was asked him to return to Washington to serve as press officer at the embassy.
        In 1958, Mr. Baube returned to Paris to serve again with de Gaulle, but left soon afterward to resume his post in Washington, where he remained until his retirement. He was a member of the National Press Club in Washington and an officer in the French Legion of Honor.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lillian Whalen; a son, Ian Baube of Silver Spring, Md.; a daughter, Anne Burdick of Bethesda, Md.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
