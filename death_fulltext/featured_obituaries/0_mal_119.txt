        Mr. Katz, a life trustee of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, received the federation's Felix M. Warburg Memorial Award in recognition of 50 years of service. He was also active in the United Jewish Appeal.
        Mr. Katz was born in Vienna and came to the United States as a child. He graduated from Cooper Union College in 1912 with a degree in architecture and became an apprentice with the architectural firm of McKinley, Mead & White.

He left to co-found Kindt Katz Company, distributors of home furnishings, in 1916, and in 1921 he founded Frank M. Katz Inc. in Manhattan (the company has since moved to Harrison, N.Y.). Mr. Katz was one of the first in the home-furnishings industry to advocate the use of four-color comic and rotogravure newspaper advertisements by retail stores.

        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by two sons, Robert and Irwin, both of Mamaroneck, N.Y., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
