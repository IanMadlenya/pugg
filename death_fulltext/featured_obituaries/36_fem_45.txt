        Rachel Fitler, heiress to a rope-manufacturing fortune, died Wednesday at her home in Villanova, Pa. She was 93 years old.
        Miss Fitler, who was an equestrian, figured in news reports in 1974 and 1975 because of her friendship with Michael Wilson, a 29-year-old former bartender.
        Mr. Wilson said the two were engaged, but that has been disputed in Miss Fitler's family. At one point, retainers at her house summoned the police to eject Mr. Wilson, the son of a Welsh coal miner.
        A granddaughter of a Mayor of Philadelphia, Edwin H. Fitler, Miss Fitler graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.
        Her survivors include a niece, Margaretta Fitler Rockefeller of Pocantico Hills, N.Y., the widow of Nelson A. Rockefeller, who was Vice President from 1974 to 1977 after being Governor of New York.
