        Bob Stinson, who played lead guitar in the influential 1980's rock band the Replacements, was found dead in his Minneapolis apartment on Saturday. He was 35.
        The cause was an unintentional overdose of a substance that has not yet been identified, said his mother, Anita Stinson Kurth.
        Mr. Stinson was born in Waconia, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis. He began playing music when he was 11, after he received a guitar as a Christmas present.
        With Chris Mars on drums and his 12-year-old brother, Tommy, on bass, he formed a group called Dogbreath in 1978. After Paul Westerberg joined the band on vocals and guitar, the group performed in place of a band that failed to show up at a concert. Shortly afterward, it changed its name to the Replacements. In 1981, it released its first album, a boisterous punk exercise called "Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash."
        Over the years, on such albums as "Let It Be" and "Tim," the band started blending its punk sound with pop, blues and folk music and mixing its sloppy, sardonic songs with dark confessional ones.
        Mr. Stinson's fast-paced life eventually put him at odds with the rest of the band members, and he was dismissed in 1986. He went on to perform with several groups, including the Bleeding Hearts, Static Taxi, Sonny Vincent and Dog 994.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by a son, Joey, and two sisters, Lonnie and Lisa, all of Minneapolis, and a brother, Tommy, of Los Angeles.
