        The Rev. Dr. Robert E. Hood, director of the Center for African-American Studies at Adelphi University, died at his home in Forest Hills, Queens, on Tuesday. He was 58.
        The cause was complications after an unspecified illness, Adelphi officials said.
        Dr. Hood, an Episcopal clergyman, was a theologian and a historian of religion, race and culture. He joined the Adelphi faculty two years ago.
        He was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University, where he became the first black president of the student body. He studied at Union Theological Seminary, the University of Chicago, the Freie Universitat in Berlin and Oxford University, from which he received a Ph.D. in 1981.
        Dr. Hood was ordained a deacon and priest in 1962. He held various positions as an Episcopal curate in the United States and Europe early in his career, starting with St. Philips Church in Manhattan.
        In 1984, he was an administrative assistant to Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa. Shortly before moving to Adelphi in Garden City, L.I., he was a professor at the General Theological Seminary in New York City.
        Dr. Hood was the author of several books and articles. His most recent volume was "Begrimed and Black: Christian Traditions on Blacks and Blackness" (1994).
        He is survived by a sister, Rochelle Douglas of Louisville.
