        Arda C. Bowser, the last surviving member of the first National Football League championship team, the Canton Bulldogs, and the originator of the kicking tee died on Saturday. He was 97.
        He was born in Danville, Pa., in 1899, the son of a Baptist minister. After serving in the Navy during World War I, Mr. Bowser played for Bucknell. In 1921, he was named an all-American.
        During his senior year at Bucknell, he played professional football for two teams at three positions: fullback, linebacker and kicker. On Saturdays, he played for the Frankford Yellow Jackets, forerunner of today's Philadelphia Eagles. After the game, he would ride an overnight train for Canton, Ohio, to play for the Bulldogs on Sunday. One Thanksgiving weekend, he played 60 minutes of football -- on offense and defense -- in four consecutive games.
        His survivors include five children: Marilyn B. Siff, Nevin G. Bowser, Robert S. Bowser, Ann Murphy and Thomas A. Bowser.
