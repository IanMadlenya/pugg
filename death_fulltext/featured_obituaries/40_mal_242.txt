        Edward Louie, creator of the fortune cookie folding machine and a line of risque fortune cookies, died on Friday shortly after returning from a visit to his ancestral village in China. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Louie opened the Lotus Fortune Cookie Company in San Francisco in 1946. The entire Louie family worked there, flipping and folding thousands of cookies a day with chopsticks until Mr. Louie invented the folding machine in the late 1960's.
        The machine inserts paper fortunes into the cookies as they are folded. The original machine is still operating today, helping with the company's daily output of 90,000 cookies.
        Mr. Louie also gained notice for his giant fortune cookies, which are six inches wide and are sometimes filled with money or jewels, and for cookies containing suggestive fortunes and jokes.
        Mr. Louie, who retired three years ago, is survived by his wife, Florence; three sons, Gregory, Clarence and Paul, all of San Francisco; three grandchildren, three brothers and three sisters.
