        Edmund Morris, an actor, playwright and screenwriter whose drama ''The Wooden Dish'' was performed on Broadway and elsewhere,  died on Jan. 6 in Providence Hospital near his home in Seattle. He was 85.
        ''The Wooden Dish,'' about a Texas codger whose son and daughter-in-law try to pack him off to an old-age home, was warmly received in London in 1954. In New York, it closed after 12 performances at the Booth Theater in 1955. Channel 13 in New York chose the work for its ''Play of the Week'' series in 1961.
        Mr. Morris wrote the screenplay for the 1962 film ''Walk on the Wild Side,'' adapted from the Nelson Algren novel, as well as the screenplays for ''Savage Guns'' (1962) and ''Project X'' (1957).
        He is survived by a son, Steven; a stepdaughter, Susan Adler; two sisters, Helen Green and Isa Satlin; a brother, Eric, and five grandchildren.
