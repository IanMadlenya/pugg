        Monroe I. Katcher, former associate counsel for the New York State Liquor Authority, died of a heart attack Thursday at the New Rochelle (N.Y.) Medical Center. He was 80 years old and lived in New Rochelle.
        Mr. Katcher, a native of Brooklyn, resigned from the authority in 1944, after working 10 years in its legal department. He then fashioned a legal specialty opposing the agency, with some of his cases resulting in changes in the alcoholic beverage control laws.
        He was a graduate of Columbia College and of St. John's Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Cassie Gerstein; a son, Stephen, of White Plains; a daughter, Alice Kisch of Washington, and three grandchildren.
