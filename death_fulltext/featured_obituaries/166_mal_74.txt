        Frederick L. Jacobs, the former chief financial officer of the advertising agency Wells, Rich, Greene, died on Nov. 14 at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Gloria.
        Mr. Jacobs, a lawyer and certified public accountant, had his own practice in New York from 1954 to 1966. Mary Wells Lawrence, a founder of Wells, Rich, was one of his clients. Mr. Jacobs worked for her when she was planning the company, and he joined the agency when it opened its doors in 1966 as the vice chairman and chief financial officer. Mr. Jacobs stayed there for more than two decades, until 1987. After he retired, he worked as a consultant.
        Wells, Rich created such campaigns as ''I Love New York,'' the ''Quality Is Job 1'' series for Ford and the ''I can't believe I ate the whole thing'' commercials for Alka Seltzer.
        Mr. Jacobs directed efforts to take the agency public in October 1968 -- one of the first agencies to offer stock -- as well as a move to buy out the stockholders 10 years later and return to private ownership.
        BDDP Worldwide of Paris acquired 40 percent of Wells, Rich in 1990, and an additional 30 percent the next year. After losing several clients in the ensuing years -- including Procter & Gamble, I.B.M. and Bristol-Myers Squibb -- Wells, Rich closed in 1998.
        Mr. Jacobs graduated from City College in 1943 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and received a law degree from New York Law School in 1952. During World War II, he served with the Army Air Corps. Before Mr. Jacobs started his practice, he worked as an accountant and as a special agent for the Internal Revenue Service.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Jacobs is survived by three daughters, Nancy Jacobs, of South Orange, N.J.; Margery Johnson, of Lexington, Mass.; and Susan J. Lobel, of New York; and four grandchildren.
