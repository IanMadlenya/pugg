        Lenore Blanchard Stoughton, a New York City lawyer who specialized in trademark and copyright law for 65 years, died on Aug. 30 at a nursing home in Kingston, N.Y. She was 88.
        Her family said she had had a long illness.
        Mrs. Stoughton had lived in New York, where she was a senior partner in the firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills. For many years she was one of the few women in her profession.
        She was born in Otsego County in New York in 1905. She received her law degree at the Albany Law School of Union University and was admitted to the bar in 1927.
        When she came to New York City, she was unable to find work as a lawyer. Determined to work, she became a switchboard operator in the offices of Rogers & Ramsey. She then became secretary to the senior partner, Edward S. Rogers, who was an expert in trademark law.
        She later joined the legal staff as an associate attorney, assisting James F. Hoge. She became a partner in the successor firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills in 1947 and a senior partner in 1952. She retired in 1980 but remained counsel to the firm until its trademark practice was merged with the firm of Pennie & Edmonds in 1987.
        She was the widow of Philip Van Everen Stoughton. She is survived by a daughter, Lenore Ridgway of Kingston, N.Y., three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
