        Vincent S. Jones, a retired newspaper executive and leader in news organizations, died on Monday at Genesee Hospital in Rochester, where he lived. He was 86.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Jones was the former vice president and executive editor of the Gannett newspaper and broadcasting company and former vice president of the Gannett Foundation, now called Freedom Forum.
        He also served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, New York State Associated Press Association and New York State Society of Newspaper Editors.
        Mr. Jones directed, helped to write and edited "The Road to Integration," a Gannett series that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1964, the first Pulitzer awarded to a newspaper group. He also wrote a series on the Vietnam War and another on the Soviet Union in 1969. A Pulitzer Juror
        An advocate of photographic journalism, he frequently lectured on that topic and served eight years as a Pulitzer juror on photography. He was also a trustee of the International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House in Rochester.
        Born in Utica, N.Y., Mr. Jones was the son of William Jones, the president of Gannett's Utica Daily Press. After graduating from Hamilton College Vincent Jones started as a reporter at The Daily Press.
        He was eventually promoted to managing editor and executive editor of The Daily Press and its sister publication, The Utica Observer-Dispatch. In 1950 he went to Gannett headquarters in Rochester as director of news and editorials. His last job was at the foundation, where he worked from 1970 to 1975.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 53 years, the former Nancy Parsons; two daughters, Suzanne Chansler of Atlanta, and Margot Mabie of Riverside, Conn., and four grandchildren.
