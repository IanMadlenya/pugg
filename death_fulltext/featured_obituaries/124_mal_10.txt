        Blaine Littell, an author, former television news correspondent and retired journalism professor, died on Tuesday at the Pendleton nursing home in Mystic, Conn. He was 71 and lived in nearby Stonington.
        The cause was emphysema, his family said.
        Mr. Littell reported and produced for the news divisions of CBS, ABC and NBC from Africa, Europe and Asia between 1952 and 1973. In 1967 he won a Peabody award as the supervising field producer of a four-hour ABC documentary, ''Africa.''
        He is survived by his wife, the former Penelope Hunt Williams; a daughter, Anita Repp of Wilton, Conn.; three sons, Philip of Los Angeles, Peter of Sunderland, Mass., and Eliakim of Schenectady, N.Y.; a sister, Alisa Storrow of Stonington; two brothers, Walter of Somerville, Mass., and Philip, also of Stonington, and seven grandchildren.
