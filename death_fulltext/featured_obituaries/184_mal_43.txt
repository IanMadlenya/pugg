        John Sharnik, an award-winning television producer and news executive for CBS, died on Saturday at his home in Rowayton, Conn. He was 78.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his daughter Pamela Jones said.
        Mr. Sharnik received an Emmy for his 1972 documentary ''A Night in Jail, a Day in Court.'' He won other prizes for television documentaries, including an R.F.K. Journalism Award in 1976, the Humanitas Prize in 1977 and a Christopher Award in 1985.
        Mr. Sharnik worked at CBS from 1954 until his retirement in 1982.
        John Seymour Sharnik was born in New Haven on July 5, 1923. He worked on the Army newspaper Stars and Stripes in World War II and for other newspapers before joining CBS. He published books including ''Remembrance of Games Past'' (Macmillan, 1986), about the 1984 tennis Grand Masters Tour; and a history of the cold war.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Busse Jones; a son, John R. Sharnik of Stamford, Conn.; and two daughters, Bronwyn Dunne of Washington and Ms. Jones of Hartsdale, N.Y.
        Correction:  May 22, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on May 16 about John Sharnik, a documentary producer and vice president of CBS News, misidentified some survivors and omitted others. His widow is the former Barbara Busse, not Barbara Busse Jones. Other survivors include Bronwyn Dunne of Washington and Pamela Jones of Hartsdale, N.Y., who are his stepdaughters, not his daughters; two sisters, Katherine Hoffman and Suzy Fromm; a brother, Mort Sharnik; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. The obituary also omitted part of his work history. Before joining CBS, he was at The Hartford Times and The New York Times.
