        A trial lawyer, Mr. Daly was one of those who represented The New York Times in the landmark libel case of New York Times v. Sullivan. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held in 1964 that a public figure could not recover libel damages for criticism of his official performance unless he proved that the statement was made with actual malice or reckless disregard of the truth.
        Mr. Daly was a member of the American College of Trial Lawyers and the Guild of Catholic Lawyers. He was a former member of the Rumson Board of Education and a former trustee of the Monmouth Museum in Lincroft, N.J.
        He was a graduate of William and Mary College and the Columbia University Law School.
        He is survived by a brother, John L., of Red Bank.
