        Boleslaw Wierzbianski, a founder, publisher and former editor in chief of the Polish-language newspaper Nowy Dziennik, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 89.
        The cause was pneumonia and he died at the hospice at Cabrini Medical Center, said his wife, Barbara.
        Mr. Wierzbianski, who was born on Nov. 16, 1913, in Bachorz, Poland, graduated in 1938 from the University of Warsaw, where he studied law and economics. An advocate of democracy and a moderate leftist, he had campus confrontations with right-wing nationalists and anti-Semites. He became a radio and news agency journalist in Poland and, during World War II, in London.
        He moved to the United States in 1956, was a contributor to Radio Free Europe broadcasts and a member of the New York City Commission on Human Rights while Edward I. Koch was mayor. In 1971, he and a group of friends founded Nowy Dziennik; he became its publisher and, until 1997, its editor in chief.
        The Manhattan-based daily newspaper (www.dziennik.com) has a circulation of 25,000, with subscribers throughout the United States, in Poland and elsewhere in Europe as well as in Canada and Israel.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Wierzbianska of Berkeley, Calif., and a son, Adam, of Brooklyn.
