        Vinnie Ernst, a record-setting point guard for Providence College in the early 1960's, died on Sunday night. He was 54.
        Ernst was returning home to Lincoln, R.I., when he apparently suffered a heart attack, said his wife, Patricia. The Rhode Island State Police found his body in his car, which was pulled off the road in Hope Valley.
        Ernst, a 5-foot-8-inch guard who grew up in Jersey City, holds the Providence single-game assist record with 17 and the season mark with an 8.7 average in 1962-63. He was an honorable mention all-American in 1962-63.
        ''He was an unselfish player and people really loved to play with him,'' said J. Gerald Alaimo, Providence's senior associate athletic director. ''I could say that he was one of the top five point guards in P. C. history. He helped put P. C. on the map.''
        Ernst, who was inducted into the Providence College Hall of Fame in 1977, is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1961 National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden. With the score tied in a semifinal game against Holy Cross, Ernst missed a free throw after the game was delayed by fans who shook the basket.
        ''It was a perfect free throw,'' Ernst said at the time. ''If you look at pictures of it, the ball was actually down in the cylinder and then it popped out. I couldn't believe it.''
        Ernst atoned for the miss in overtime, scoring or assisting on every Providence point. The Friars advanced to the championship and beat Saint Louis. Ernst was named the tournament's most valuable player.
        ''He arrived with a very big high school reputation and lived up to it,'' said the former Providence coach Joe Mullaney.
        In addition to his wife, Ernst is survived by two daughters, Kimberly and Tara, and two sons, Vincent and Geoffrey.
