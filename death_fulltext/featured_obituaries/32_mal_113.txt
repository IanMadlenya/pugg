        Lord Trafford, Minister of State for Health, died on Saturday of lung cancer, the Government announced. He was 57 years old.
        The Department of Health said Lord Trafford had been ill for a short time and was hospitalized on Tuesday.
        A physician and former member of Parliament, Lord Trafford helped treat victims of the Irish Republican Army bombing of a hotel in Brighton during a Conservative Party conference in 1984.
        Born July 20, 1932, Joseph Anthony Porteous Trafford graduated from the University of London and Guy's Hospital medical school.
        He was a Fulbright Scholar in the United States in 1963 and worked for a time in the Maryland welfare department. He was elected to Parliament in 1970 but lost in the 1974 election.
        Knighted in 1985, he was made a life peer in 1987. Lord Trafford was appointed to the Health Ministry in July.
        Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said, ''Those who suffered in the bombing at Brighton in 1984 owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.''
        Energy Secretary John Wakeham, one of those severely hurt in the bombing, said that Lord Trafford visited almost every evening during four months of hospitalization for ''long political gossips'' and ''partly to keep me awake so that I didn't go to sleep too early and therefore have a bad night.''
        ''I found his depth of knowledge of many subjects, particularly history and politics, fascinating,'' Mr. Wakeham said.
        The Conservative Party chairman, Kenneth Clarke, said Lord Trafford's death was a ''loss to the Government and a loss to the public life of this country.''
        Lord Trafford is survived by his wife, Helen, and a son and a daughter.
