        Saul Mills, a former labor organizer and advertising executive, died Saturday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla., after a long illness. He was 78 years old and had moved to Florida from Great Neck, L.I., two years ago.
        Mr. Mills, a reporter for United Press in New York early in his career, was active in the American Newspaper Guild. In the 1930's he turned to public relations work for labor unions, including the Transport Workers Union.
        In 1940 he became secretary-treasurer of the newly formed Greater New York CIO Council, an affiliate of the national Congress of Industrial Organizations. The national leadership ousted the council's officers in 1948, saying their left-wing radicalism hurt the labor movement's goals.
        Mr. Mills later set up his own public relations firm, Mills Agency, on Madison Avenue, specializing in direct-marketing for mail-order and insurance companies. He led the company until about eight years ago.
        His survivors include his wife, the former Agnes Karlin, and two daughters, Karen Mills of Jakarta, Indonesia, and Margaret Mills, of Larkspur, Calif.
