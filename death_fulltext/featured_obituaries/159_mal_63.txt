        John J. Barry, a veteran trial and appellate lawyer, died on April 9 at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 and also lived in Sparta, N.J.
        His friend Alan C. Marcus said Mr. Barry had cancer.
        He was a partner in the law firm of Tompkins, McGuire, Wachenfeld & Barry, based in Newark. His practice areas included commercial litigation and white-collar criminal defense. Among his clients were Donald J. Trump, who was one of his brothers-in-law, and Eddie Antar, the electronics retail chain executive known as Crazy Eddie. Mr. Antar eventually pleaded guilty to racketeering after the chain had collapsed, he had disappeared, and it had been determined that he had spirited millions of dollars to foreign countries.
        Mr. Barry, with a law degree from New York University, had been a federal prosecutor in Newark.
        He is survived by his wife, Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal judge; a daughter, Barbara Coates, who lives in northwestern New Jersey; a stepson, Dr. David Desmond of Manhattan; two sisters, Mary Ellen Conway and Geraldine Barry; a brother, James; and three grandchildren.
