        Bernard Dubin, a former justice of the New York State Supreme Court in New York City, died on Thursday in Buffalo General Hospital. He was 88.
        A former longtime resident of Forest Hills, Queens, he lived in Delray Beach, Fla., and was visiting relatives in Buffalo.
        Justice Dubin was well connected in the State Democratic Party, and was on friendly terms with Gov. W. Averell Harriman, Mayor Robert F. Wagner and House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr..
        Bernard Dubin was born in South Orange, N.J., and earned his law degree at George Washington University. Admitted to the bar in 1935, he established a successful practice in Queens before becoming a Queens assistant district attorney and then a state assemblyman.
        Mayor Wagner introduced Justice Dubin to the judiciary in 1958 when he swore him in as a City Magistrate.  Justice Dubin was later appointed a judge of the Queens Criminal Court and in 1969 was elected a justice of the State Supreme Court, where he played a role in several well-publicized cases.
        In 1972 he declared a mistrial in the case of Black Panthers accused of slaying a member of a rival faction, whose body was found in a burning building in Queens. Two years later, he presided over the trial of a police officer, Thomas Shea, charged in the shooting death of a 10-year-old boy in a Queens lot. The officer was acquitted.
        Judge Dubin is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Bessie Moskoff; two daughters, Lana Benitovich of Buffalo, and Marylin Kaplan of East Amherst, N.Y.; a sister, Edna Beatrice, of Hauppauge, L.I.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
