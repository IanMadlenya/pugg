        Ewart G. Abner Jr., a record business executive who was president of the Vee Jay and Motown labels, died on Dec. 27 in Los Angeles. He was 74.
        Mr. Abner began his career in the record business in 1948, when he worked at a pressing plant in Chicago. Two years later he and Art Sheridan started Chance Records, which recorded two hit vocal groups, the Moonglows and the Flamingos.
        In 1954, he joined Vee Jay Records as general manager. He eventually became president of Vee Jay, and during his tenure the label released recordings by the Four Seasons, Frank Ifield, the Impressions and Jimmy Reed.
        Mr. Abner also oversaw the first American releases of recordings by the Beatles. Although the group was recording for EMI in England, EMI's American affiliate, Capitol, had turned down its first releases. Vee Jay signed the group for American distribution in January 1963, and released a handful of singles and an album, ''Introducing the Beatles.'' All the material Vee Jay released was later reissued by Capitol.
        In 1967, Mr. Abner joined Motown Records, where he managed the careers of the Supremes, the Temptations, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, the Four Tops, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and the Jackson Five. He was president of Motown from 1973 to 1975, and for a decade after he left the company, he was the personal and business manager for Mr. Wonder.
        In recent years, Mr. Abner was executive assistant to Berry Gordy, the founder of Motown. He was also executive vice president of Jobete Music and Stone Diamond Music and vice chairman of the Motown Historical Museum, in Detroit.
        He is survived by his wife, seven children and a brother.
