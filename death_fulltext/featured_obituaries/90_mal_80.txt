        Thomas Carr Howe Jr., director of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco for nearly four decades, died on Tuesday at the California Pacific Medical Center. He was 89 and lived in San Francisco.
        The cause was pneumonia, said a spokesman for the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which was formed in 1972 when the administration of the California Palace of the Legion of Honor merged with that of the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum.
        Mr. Howe was born in Kokomo, Ind., in 1904. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in art history from Harvard University. He became assistant director of the Legion of Honor in 1931 and director in 1939. He served as art commissioner for the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco, for which he organized an exhibition of the Mexican muralists. Toward the end of World War II, he was chief of the Monuments, Fine Art and Archives Section of the Army in Germany, which oversaw the effort to find and return looted artworks to their rightful owners. He wrote a book about his experiences titled "Salt Mines and Castles: The Discovery and Restitution of Looted European Art." He retired in 1968.
        He is survived by his daughter, Francesca, who lives in Florida.
