        Dr. David H. Gillespie, a genetic researcher who advanced the understanding of cancers, AIDS and other diseases, died Sunday in an auto accident near his home in Glenmore, Pa. He was 53.
        At his death, he was the Barry Ashbee Professor of Basic Research at Hahnemann University in Philadelphia. His work involved searching for viral "footprints" in human and animal cancer tumors.
        Among his accomplishments was the development of a test to analyze cancer-causing genes and monitor genetic changes in blood, bone marrow and tumor cells during treatment. A variation of the test is used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment of AIDS patients.
        At his death, Dr. Gillespie was involved in research on the role of retroviruses in the development of cancer. Writing in the journal Blood in May, he reported there was evidence of a genetic clue that could identify people at high risk for cancer.
        He had published more than 125 articles in scientific periodicals like Genetics, Nature and The Journal of Molecular Science.
        Dr. Gillespie, a native of Stoneham, Mass., was a science graduate of Tufts University and earned a Ph.D. in biology at the University of Illinois, Urbana, in 1966. From 1972 to 1974, he headed the section of nucleic acids at the Biotechnics Research Labratories in Bethesda, Md. He then worked at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda.
        He joined the Hahnemann faculty in 1980 as a professor in the department of hematology/oncology, which is now called the department of neoplastic disease. He was also an adjunct professor of virology at the University of Pennsylvania and its Veterinary School from 1980 until his death.
        Dr. Gillespie is survived by his wife of 23 years, Sally; two sons, William and Robert, both of Glenmore; his father, Edward, of Boynton Beach, Fla.; a sister, Carol Weber of Dunstable, Mass., and one grandson.
