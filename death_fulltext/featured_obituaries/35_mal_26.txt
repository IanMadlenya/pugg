        Arnold Arnstein, a music copyist who worked with Gian Carlo Menotti, Samuel Barber and other composers, died of respiratory failure on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Arnstein was considered a master in the generally obscure profession of copyist, the person who translates a composer's handwritten score into accurate, legible parts. During his long career he was the chief copyist for Mr. Menotti, and also worked for Leonard Bernstein, Virgil Thomson, William Schuman and many other American composers.
        Mr. Arnstein was born in Budapest in 1898 and came to this country at the age of 4. He was graduated from City College in 1919 as a chemist, and was an amateur violinist. Six years later he got a job as a copyist with the Paramount Publix Corporation, working on night club music and movie scores, and in 1932 he opened his own office on the West Side of Manhattan, where he worked until his death.
        There are no survivors.
