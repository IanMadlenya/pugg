        Charles H. Hoens Jr., a law partner in the firm of Lum, Hoens, Conant, Danzis & Kleinberg in Roseland, N.J., died on Monday at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J. He was 72 and lived in Basking Ridge.
        He suffered a brief illness, said a spokesman for Gallaway & Crane Funeral Home.
        Mr. Hoens was born in Roselle Park, N.J., and graduated from Cornell University and Rutgers University Law School. His education was interrupted in World War II when he served as an Army officer in Europe.
        He was an assistant United States attorney from 1953 to 1961 and was named chief of the civil division for New Jersey in the late 1950's. In 1961 he was invited to join the firm of Lum, Biunno & Tompkins, a predecessor of Lum, Hoens, then situated in Newark.
        He concentrated on fidelity and surety law, health law, life insurance law and cases involving construction contracts. He often wrote and lectured about those subjects, on which he was considered an authority.
        Mr. Hoens is survived by his wife of 42 years, Mary McLaren Hoens; three sons, Charles H. 3d, of Princeton, N.J., John M., of Basking Ridge, and Thomas W., of Westfield, N.J.; a daughter, Helen E. Hoens of Basking Ridge, and seven grandchildren.
