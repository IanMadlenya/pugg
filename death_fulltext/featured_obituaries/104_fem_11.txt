        Frances Webb Roosevelt, a portrait artist who was the mother-in-law of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, died on Monday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 78 and lived on the Roosevelt estate, Sagamore Hill, in Oyster Bay, L.I.
        Mrs. Roosevelt was the widow of President Theodore Roosevelt's grandson, Quentin Roosevelt.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, said Ilene Hoffer, a spokeswoman for Governor Weld.
        Mrs. Roosevelt was a native of Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1939. She married Quentin Roosevelt in England in April 1944, two months before her husband, an Army captain, participated in the D-Day invasion. During the war, Mrs. Roosevelt, a Red Cross worker, drew pictures of soldiers on postcards that they later sent home to their families.
        After the war, the family moved to Shanghai and lived there until Quentin Roosevelt died in a plane crash near Hong Kong in 1948. Mrs. Roosevelt then moved with her children to Sagamore Hill.
        A well-known portrait artist in Oyster Bay, Mrs. Roosevelt taught art at C. W. Post College in Brookville, L.I. During the late 1940's and early 1950's, she worked as a courtroom sketch artist for several newspapers and covered the perjury trial of Alger Hiss, the American diplomat who had been accused of spying for the Soviet Union.
        Mrs. Roosevelt is survived by three daughters, Susan Roosevelt Weld of Boston, the wife of Governor Weld; Anna Curtenius Roosevelt of Chicago, and Alexandra Dworkin of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.
