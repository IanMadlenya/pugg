        Joseph Devorkin, a retired clothing manufacturer, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 97 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Devorkin served in the Navy in World War I and then opened a men's haberdashery store in Huntington, L.I. He closed the store in 1930 and joined his brothers in Manhattan, manufacturing men's clothing under the label Philip Morris Clothes.
        He retired in 1965 and devoted himself to his avocation, studying and writing about the history of New York City, especially Greenwich Village. He wrote many articles about the farms, theaters and hotels of Manhattan and in 1987 published "Great Merchants of Early New York."
        He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
