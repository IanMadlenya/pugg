        Ali, who was known as Cassius Clay early in his boxing career, was at his home in Berrien Springs, Mich., when he learned of his father's death, said Gene Kilroy, a longtime friend of the former champion.
        Besides Ali, the senior Clay, who was an artist, is survived by his wife, Odessa, and another son, Rahaman Ali of Louisville; a sister, four brothers and 12 grandchildren.
