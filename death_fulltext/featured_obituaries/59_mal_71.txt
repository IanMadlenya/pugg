        Hyman Gelfand, a wine importer and retailer in New York City for more than 50 years, died on Sunday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of leukemia, his family said.
        He learned the wine trade in his family's importing business. In the 1930's, he operated his own retail wine and spirits business in lower Manhattan. In 1968, he joined Sherry-Lehmann Inc., a major wine and spirits store in Manhattan, and was a vice president of sales there at the time of his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, and a daughter, Harriet Cosenza, both of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Michael Gelfand of Schenectady, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
