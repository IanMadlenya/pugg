        Ayatollah Khatami was the father of Mohammed Khatami, Iran's Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
        Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini appointed Ayatollah Khatami as his personal representative and prayer leader in the central Iranian city of Yazd in July 1982, after the previous prayer leader was assassinated.
