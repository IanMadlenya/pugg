        Lynne D. Abraham, a founder of the New York Race for the Cure and the Greater New York City Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60.
        The cause was breast cancer, which she had for 12 years, her family said.
        For a decade, Ms. Abraham was on the board of the Komen Foundation's New York City branch, whose operations extend into Westchester and Rockland counties and Long Island.
        In 1990, she helped establish the Race for the Cure, a five-kilometer women's walk and run in Central Park first held in 1991. It later became an affiliate of the Komen Foundation.
        Ms. Abraham also appeared before Congressional committees and at medical conferences around the country to speak about breast cancer.
        She received the Komen Foundation's Outstanding Volunteer Lifetime Award in 2000.
        Ms. Abraham was born in Manhattan, received degrees from the University of Wisconsin and Columbia and worked as a public relations consultant from 1994 until her death.
        She was Carol Bellamy's press secretary when Ms. Bellamy was City Council president; a communications officer at Planned Parenthood of America; and the press secretary during Bella Abzug's campaign for the United States Senate.
        Surviving are two sisters, Jill Auerbach of Rye Brook, N.Y., and Pamela Ashe of Closter, N.J.; and two nieces.
