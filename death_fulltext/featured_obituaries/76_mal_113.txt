        Charles D. Hepler, a former publisher of Reader's Digest and of New Mexico magazine, died Monday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. A former resident of Stamford, Conn., he was 74.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Jon Bowman, editor of New Mexico, from which Mr. Hepler retired in January.
        When Mr. Hepler, a sales executive, was named publisher at Reader's Digest in 1968, he was the first to hold that title at the magazine, then in its 46th year. He left the Digest in March 1980.
        A native of Royal Oak, Mich., he was active in all varsity sports in college and graduated from Butler University in Indianapolis. During World War II he served as a pilot, flight leader and group leader with the 323d Bomber Group of the Ninth Air Force in Europe. He reached the rank of major and held the Distinguished Service Medal and five air medals, including the Flying Cross.
        He worked for U.S. News & World Report before joining the Digest in 1955 as Detroit advertising manager. In 1961 he rose to vice president and United States advertising director, with headquarters in Manhattan.
        While living in Stamford, he studied the problem of drug abuse in his spare time and spoke to civic groups on the subject. His chief hobby was collecting and repairing antique clocks.
        He joined New Mexico in 1989, and, Mr. Bowman said, monthly circulation rose to 130,000 from 95,000 during his tenure. He accepted a nominal salary of $7,000 a year, mostly for expenses, as his contribution to his adopted state, Mr. Bowman said. The magazine is state-owned.
        Mr. Hepler's first wife, Imogene, died several years ago. He is survived by his second wife, Sally; a son, Mark, of Nashville; and two stepchildren, Jennifer and Chris Lilly, of Fort Wayne, Ind.
