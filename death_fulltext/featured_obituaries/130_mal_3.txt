        Dr. Michael J. S. Dewar, a theoretical chemist whose predictions about the nature of unknown organic chemicals led to many drug advances, died on Oct. 10 at Columbia North Florida Regional Hospital in Gainesville, Fla., where he lived. He was 79.
        At the University of Texas, where he was the first Robert A. Welch Research Professor, Dr. Dewar used one of the most powerful supercomputers of the 1960's to merge theoretical ideas about molecules with predictions based on laboratory measurements.
        He began with theoretical pictures of molecules based on quantum mechanics. He then correlated those with actual observations of chemical structure, energy and behavior, or parameters.
        ''If you have an unknown, a new molecule, then from the theory and the parameters from known molecules, you can predict what will happen,'' said one of his former students, Dr. Nicholas Bodor, executive director of the Center for Drug Discovery at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. With 100 known molecules, he said, a researcher could predict 1,000 others, rank them, learn how they would react with others and select the best ones for a task.
        ''You could design a molecular structure, which has a potential to become a useful drug,'' he said.
        The technique was used to develop such new drugs as the protease inhibitors, used to treat infection with H.I.V., the AIDS virus.
        Born in Ahmednagar, India, Dr. Dewar received a doctorate in chemistry at Oxford University in 1942, worked for a chemical company and in 1951 held the chair in chemistry at Queen Mary College, London, at age 33. In 1959, he joined the University of Chicago. In 1963, he moved to the University of Texas. He joined the University of Florida in 1990.
        He is survived by two sons, C. E. Steuart Dewar of Morgantown, W.Va., and Dr. Robert B. K. Dewar of Manhattan, and three grandchildren. His wife, Dr. Mary Williamson Dewar, died in 1994.
