        Tom Blackburn, a retired Navy captain who commanded the Jolly Rogers fighter squadron in the Pacific in World War II, died on March 21 at his home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Mark, of San Francisco.
        In 1943 Mr. Blackburn formed VF-17, a squadron of pilots flying the new Corsair fighter, and took it to the Solomons and Marianas Islands. The pilots of the squadron, which had a skull and crossbones as an insignia, shot down 155 Japanese planes in late 1943 and early 1944. Mr. Blackburn accounted for 13 of the downings.
        Mr. Blackburn, who retired in 1962, wrote a book about the period, "The Jolly Rogers" (Orion, 1989). After the war he served in the Pentagon and as commander of the carrier Midway.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Blackburn is survived by his wife, James, of Jacksonville, and a daughter, Patricia Soggs of Utica, N.Y.
