        Donald Lorimer, who worked in several agencies combating AIDS and became a specialist in the epidemic's demographic trends, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 46 years old.
        His companion, Charles Bolds, said he died of AIDS.
        Mr. Lorimer was among the early researchers to analyze AIDS statistics to show major differences in infection rates by age, race, sex, neighborhood and drug-abuse patterns.
        The AIDS maps, charts and profiles that emerged showed which groups and areas most needed medical and social services and programs to prevent the disease from spreading further. The variations were often startling. He calculated that in a part of the Lower East Side racked by poverty and drugs, one of every 12 men was infected with H.I.V., while a few blocks away in a predominantly Asian section, the rate was only one in 273.
        Since 1989 Mr. Lorimer was the director of special projects for the Health Systems Agency of New York City. For several years he was the AIDS service coordinator for the Lower East Side. He was also on the original staff of the Office of Gay and Lesbian Health Concerns created by Mayor Edward I. Koch to help deal with AIDS and had been a coordinator of the city's AIDS hotline.
        He served on the board of Body Positive, an organization for people infected with H.I.V. He also pressed for AIDS services as a member of Community Board 3 in Manhattan.
        Surviving are his father, Robert L. Lorimer of Edina, Minn.; a brother, Lawrence T. of Manhattan, and two sisters in California.
