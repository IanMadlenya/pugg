        Justice Charles A. Loreto, who served 12 years on the Municipal Court and 15 years on the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan and the Bronx, died on Sunday at Eastland Hospital in Texas. He was 87 years old and lived in Eastland.
        Justice Loreto died of congestive heart failure, his wife said.
        He retired from the bench in 1972 to work on his memoirs, which appeared as ''In the Name of Justice - With Compassion in Judging'' (Todd & Honeywell, 1985). Cases on which he ruled included an evaluation of private property taken to build the World Trade Center and the decision on whether the major league baseball reserve clause constituted a monopoly.
        Justice Loreto, a native New Yorker, was the son of emigre parents from southern Italy. He attended city schools, graduated from Columbia College in 1923 and received a law degree from Columbia University Law School in 1925. Among his fellow alumni were Gov. Thomas E. Dewey and Justice William O. Douglas of the United States Supreme Court.
        He was active in community affairs in the Bronx and Manhattan and was for many years a board member of the New York Botanical Garden.
        Judge Loreto is survived by his wife, the former Rosalie Leslie, and two brothers, Michael, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and Arthur, of North Palm Beach, Fla.
