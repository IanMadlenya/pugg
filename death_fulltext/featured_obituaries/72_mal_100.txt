        James R. Venable, a Georgia lawyer and white supremacist who organized a major Ku Klux Klan faction in 1963 and headed it for nearly 25 years, died Monday in Lawrenceville, Ga. He was 92 and lived in a nursing home in Lawrenceville.
        He suffered from Alzheimer's disease, cancer and pneumonia, his family said.
        From 1963 to 1987, Mr. Venable was the Imperial Wizard of the National Knights of the Klan, which he organized as one of several rival Klan factions nationally.
        Mr. Venable's ancestors owned Stone Mountain near Atlanta and ran a granite quarry there. The mountain, the site of a 1915 rally that revived the nearly extinct Klan, later became a state park and memorial with a giant relief of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, and Generals Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson carved in the mountainside.
        Mr. Venable was mayor of Stone Mountain Village from 1946 to 1949 and used the mountaintop and nearby family land for annual Klan rallies.
        As a lawyer in Decatur, he sometimes represented blacks. He won acquittal for a black accused of murder and won an appeal for two Black Muslims in Louisiana convicted on charges stemming from a police raid on their mosque.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Dorothea Burns of Norcross, Ga.; two daughters, Ginger Fearria of Lawrenceville and Dorothea Wallsom of Roswell, Ga.; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
