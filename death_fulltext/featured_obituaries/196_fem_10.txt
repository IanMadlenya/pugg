        Celine G. Marcus, former executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, an East Side social services organization, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93.
        She retired in 1982 after 12 years as the association's executive director and 11 years as assistant to the director.
        She spent those 23 years helping to create a network of social services in the association's neighborhood, from 59th to 96th Streets and Fifth Avenue to the East River.
        She became the head of a staff of 255, 180 of them volunteers, and addressed problems including crime, truancy, loneliness and aging. The organization is now called the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House.
        In 1980, she was a founder of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, which works to provide shelter and other help for Manhattan's homeless.
        She was on the boards of the Yorkville Civic Center and several other groups.
        In 1983 she was one of the first five winners of the Family of New York Awards, fostered by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
        She and her co-winners were honored for helping to establish a community shelter for homeless women. They also led efforts to aid homeless men at a city-run shelter in the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 66th Street.
        Born in Brooklyn, Celine Greenebaum graduated from Barnard. Her social-services career began on the Lower East Side in the Depression and lasted more than 50 years.
        Her husband, Joshua Marcus, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Ann Marcus of Manhattan and Dorothy Marcus of the Bronx; a son, Daniel, of Washington; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Marion Epstein of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Joffe of Rochester.
