        Scott Barry, a spokesman and counselor for AIDS victims, died of complications of the disease on May 11. He was 32 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Barry, who had been an exchange student in West Germany, abandoned his medical studies in Dusseldorf in 1981 after tests showed he was infected with the AIDS virus. He remained in that country as a source of information on the disease, appearing on television talk shows and speaking to the German parliament.
        In 1986 he was awarded the German Medal of Honor. He returned to Los Angeles to form Being Alive, a support group for AIDS patients.
