        Strother MacMinn, who taught automotive design for 50 years at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., and whose students went on to become leading automotive designers in the United States, Europe and Japan, was found dead on Monday at his home in Pasadena. He was 79.
        A visiting nurse discovered Mr. MacMinn, a lifelong bachelor who lived alone. He had been in poor health, the center said in announcing his death Thursday.
        Charles Jordan, who was vice president for design at General Motors in 1986-92, said, ''Mac never designed a car, but no one influenced car design more than he did.''
        Michael Lamm of Stockton, Calif., a publisher of books about automobiles, said, ''If you are in a car today, Mac probably influenced its design.''
        Mr. MacMinn began teaching at the center in 1948. He assisted in the design of cars for General Motors, Opel and Oldsmobile and was instrumental in establishing Toyota's Calty Design Research Inc., the first automotive design satellite studio in Southern California. He also wrote about the history of automobiles for Motor Trend, Road & Track and other publications.
        Mr. MacMinn left no survivors, said Robin Goldsworthy, a spokeswoman for the college.
