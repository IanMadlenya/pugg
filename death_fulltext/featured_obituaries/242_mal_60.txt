        Morton A. Kornreich, a former national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal and chairman of the UJA-Federation of New York, died Tuesday in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 82 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his son James said.
        From 1988 to 1990, Mr. Kornreich was national chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, formed during World War II to aid Holocaust survivors. In 1985 and 1986, he was president of the United Jewish Appeal of Greater New York.
        In 1986, the U.J.A.'s New York branch merged with the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and Mr. Kornreich was soon named chairman. That body is the UJA-Federation.
        Mr. Kornreich was also a vice president of the American Jewish Committee and chairman of its Koppelman Institute on American Jewish-Israeli Relations.
        Morton Alan Kornreich was born on Dec. 4, 1924, a son of Saul and Gertrude Asinoff Kornreich. He and his twin brother, Matthew, were partners in a Manhattan insurance brokerage that their father started in 1917. Mr. Kornreich served in the Army Air Corps during World War II and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1949.
        Besides his son James, of Rye, N.Y., and his brother, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., Mr. Kornreich is survived by a daughter, Nancy Rieger of Rye; another son, Thomas, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; a sister, Norma Weinstein of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; and eight grandchildren. His wife of 50 years, the former JoAnn Colnes, died in 2001.
