        Henrik Beer, former Secretary General of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, died Saturday at his Geneva home, the league announced yesterday. He was 71 years old.
        The league, based in Geneva, said in a statement that Mr. Beer died after a long illness. It gave no cause of death.
        Mr. Beer, a Swedish national, headed the league from 1960 until his retirement in 1981, overseeing an increase in membership in the humanitarian organization from 86 to 126.
        Born in Stockholm in 1915, his first contact with the Red Cross was during World War II when he was put in charge of coordinating neutral Sweden's relief efforts for war victims. He was Secretary General of the Swedish Red Cross until his appointment to the Geneva post.
        As head of the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Mr. Beer's principal task was to organize international help in times of natural disaster. He traveled to more than 80 countries in fulfillment of that assignment.
        He also ventured into war zones in Africa and Asia, making headlines in 1969 when he enlisted Unicef, the United Nations children's relief agency, in a joint aid program in North Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam War.
        Mr. Beer is survived by his wife and three sons. A memorial service is to be be held at the Protestant St. Pierre Cathedral in Geneva today.
