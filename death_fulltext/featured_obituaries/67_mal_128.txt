        Peter S. Deriabin, described by the Central Intelligence Agency as the highest ranking Soviet intelligence officer to have defected to the West up until 1954, died on Aug. 20 in northern Virginia, the C.I.A. reported Saturday. He was 71 years old.
        The C.I.A. said that Mr. Deriabin died after suffering a stroke, and that it waited to make the announcement at the request of his family.
        Mr. Deriabin defected from the Soviet Union in 1954 after a career with the Communist Party, which included military service for the Red Army during World War II, for which he received several medals.
        He later joined the forerunner of the K.G.B. and held several high-level posts during his 10-year tenure with the agency. At one point, he served as Stalin's bodyguard.
        Shortly after Stalin's death in 1953, Mr. Deriabin was put in charge of counterintelligence in Vienna, and defected while posted there during a freight train ride through Soviet occupied territory near Vienna. At that time, he was the highest ranking Soviet intelligence officer to defect, and was sentenced to death in absentia by the Military Collegium of the Soviet Union.
        Shortly after arriving in the United States, Mr. Deriabin continued his career in intelligence, but with the C.I.A.  According to the C.I.A.'s announcement of his death, Mr. Deriabin's knowledge of K.G.B. workings was of "incalculable value to the national security" and provided a foundation for the West's knowledge of the agency.
        A graduate of Biysk Teachers College and the Institute for Marxism-Leninism, both then in the Soviet Union, Mr. Deriabin went on to do graduate work at the University of Michigan and the University of Virginia. He worked for the C.I.A. until his retirement in 1981 and was the author of three books on Soviet intelligence, as well as an autobiography.
        He is survived by his wife and a son, whose names the C.I.A. declined to make public.
