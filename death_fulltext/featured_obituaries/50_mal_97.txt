        Bob Parkinson, who helped to build one of the largest circus archives in the world, died Thursday at St. Mary's Hospital in Madison after heart surgery. He was 67 years old and lived in Baraboo, Wis.
        Mr. Parkinson oversaw the library at the Circus World Museum in Baraboo. He joined the museum in 1965 and expanded its library to include thousands of circus lithographs and a card catalogue with the names of circus performers from Colonial times to the present.
        He recently finished a book, scheduled for publication later this year, that documents all United States circuses of the last 200 years.
        Survivors include his wife, Marilyn; two sons, and a daughter.
