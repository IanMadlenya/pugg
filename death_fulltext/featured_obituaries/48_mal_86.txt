        Walter Zirpolo, a former mayor of Woodbridge, N.J., who served 15 months in prison for bribery and conspiracy in an oil-pipeline scandal, died on Tuesday at Methodist Hospital in Houston. He was 75 years old and lived in Woodbridge.
        He died of complications after surgery for an aneurysm, his family said.
        Mr. Zirpolo, a Democrat, was mayor from 1962 to 1967. He also owned a health and fitness center, the Club at Woodbridge, and started a supermarket group in central New Jersey.
        In 1969, two years after leaving office, Mr. Zirpolo was indicted on Federal charges that he took bribes to expedite construction by the Colonial Pipeline Corporation of Atlanta.
        He was convicted but the verdict was overturned on appeal. In 1973 he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two to six years in prison. He was released after 15 months.
        Nr. Zirpolo was born in Mt. Vernon, N.Y., and raised in Rahway, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Drake; two sons, Raymond and Jeffrey, both of Woodbridge Township; a daughter, Carole, also of Woodbridge Township; a brother, Gene, of Clark, N.J.; a sister, Dorothy Galle of Palm Beach, Fla., and two grandchildren.
