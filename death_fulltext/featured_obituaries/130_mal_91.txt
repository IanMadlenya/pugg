        Dr. Marvin C. Goldstein, an orthodontist and businessman who defied the segregationist sentiments of the mid-1960's by opening Atlanta's first integrated hotel, died on Saturday at his Atlanta home. He was 80.
        Dr. Goldstein's hotel, the American, opened in 1964 and became a haven for black people turned away by other establishments and for civil rights workers. Among them was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who held meetings there with his top aides even before the hotel formally opened.
        The opening of the American became a crucial part of Atlanta's acquisition of its first major professional sports franchise. The Milwaukee Braves agreed to relocate to Atlanta in 1966 only after being assured that integrated visiting baseball clubs could stay at the American.
        Soon after, the Ku Klux Klan picketed the hotel. When Dr. Goldstein was told that an integrated hotel would be required to have at least separate drinking fountains for blacks and whites, he was reported to have replied, ''Then we won't have any drinking fountains.''
        His orthodontics practice was also integrated. In addition to treating members of the King family, Dr. Goldstein treated other blacks from around the South who traveled to Atlanta for specialized treatment they could not receive elsewhere.
        He earned his dentistry degree from Emory University in Atlanta in 1938.
        He is survived by his wife, Rita Atlas Goldstein, of Atlanta; three sons, Armand and Andrew, both of Atlanta, and Adam, of Chapel Hill, N.C.; two daughters, Aleta Ellin Goldstein and Anne Strickland, both of Atlanta; three sisters, Ida Goldstein Wolf, Lena Rottersman and Janet Blum Goldberg, all of Atlanta, and 10 grandchildren.
