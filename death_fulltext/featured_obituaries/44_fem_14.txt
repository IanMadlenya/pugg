       Dr. Jane Cary Peck, an educator, author and a vice president of the National Council of Churches, died Monday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 58 years old and lived in Williamstown, Mass.
        A spokesman for the Andover Newton Theological School, where she was a professor of religion, said she had died of cancer.
        Dr. Peck was a graduate of Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., and earned her doctorate in social ethics at Boston University. She served on the governing board of the National Council of Churches for the past 12 years as a representative of the United Methodist Church. She participated in international conferences on ecumenical efforts for peace, justice and women's issues. In 1984, Westminster Press published her book ''Self and Family.''
        This year, she traveled to Nicaragua for research for the World Council of Churches' study of ''Justice, Peace and the Integrity of Creation.''
        She is survived by her husband, Robert; three sons, Robert of Seattle, James of Wellesley, Mass., and Jonathan of Williamstown; a daughter, Cary, of Williamstown; her mother, Ruth M. Chapman of Forsyth, Ga., and a sister, Ruth W. Hassler of Steinhatchee, Fla.
