        Leonore Strunsky Gershwin, the lyricist Ira Gershwin's wife of 56 years, died on Tuesday in Beverly Hills, Calif., at the age of 90. After Mr. Gershwin's death in 1981 at the age of 86, Mrs. Gershwin devoted much of her time to preserving his work and that of his brother, George, the composer. Two years ago, she set up Roxbury Recordings, which recorded two Gershwin works in their entirety: "Girl Crazy" and "Strike Up the Band," which is to be released soon. Surviving is a brother, W. English Strunsky of Manhattan.
