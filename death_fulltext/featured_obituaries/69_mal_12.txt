        Paul Jabara, a songwriter, singer and actor who won an Academy Award in 1979 for writing the disco hit "Last Dance," died on Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 44 years old.
        He died after a long illness, a spokesman for Kaleidoscope Films said.
        Mr. Jabara was born in Brooklyn and made his Broadway debut in the original cast of the rock musical "Hair." He created the role of King Herod in the original London production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" and wrote the book, music and lyrics for the Broadway musical "Rachael Lily Rosenbloom and Don't You Ever Forget It!"
        He moved to Los Angeles in the 1970's, and wrote "Last Dance," which was featured in the 1978 movie "Thank God It's Friday" and was a hit for Donna Summer. It won the Oscar for best original song, as well as a Grammy Award and went platinum and gold on the record charts.
        His other songwriting credits include "The Main Event," performed by Barbra Streisand; "Enough Is Enough," sung as a duet by Ms. Streisand and Ms. Summer; "Work That Body," by Diana Ross; "It's Raining Men," by the Weathergirls, and "Two Lovers," by Julio Iglesias. Mr. Jabara was also a producer of Ms. Streisand's Grammy Award-winning "Broadway Album."
        Among his own albums are "Shut Out," "Keeping Time," "Paul Jabara," "The Third Album," "Paul Jabara and Friends," which featured Whitney Houston, "De La Noche (The True Story)" and "Paul Jabara's Greatest Hits and Misses."
        Mr. Jabara appeared in the films "Midnight Cowboy," "The Lords of Flatbush," "The Day of the Locust," "Honky-Tonk Freeway," "Star 80," "Legal Eagles" and the recent Paul Schrader film, "Light Sleeper." His television appearances included the series "Starsky and Hutch," "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman," "The Equalizer" and the made-for-television movies "The Last Angry Man" and "Out of the Darkness."
        He is survived by two sisters, Delores Jabara of Westport, Conn., and Claudette Hadad of Brooklyn.
