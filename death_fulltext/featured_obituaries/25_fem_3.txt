        Marie Poland Fish, an oceanographer and marine biologist whose research in underwater sound detection helped the United States Navy to distinguish schools of fish from submarines, died yesterday at the Mediplex Nursing Home in Westport, Conn. She was 88 years old and had lived for many years in Kingston, R.I.
        In 1966 Dr. Fish was awarded the Navy's Distinguished Public Service Award, its highest decoration for a civilian, for her two decades of work in bioacoustics under contract to the Office of Naval Rsearch. Most of her work was conducted at the University of Rhode Island's Naragansett Marine Laboratory in Kingston, which was founded by her husband, Dr. Charles Fish.
        To enable antisubmarine vessels properly to identify enemy targets and avoid attacking whales or schools of smaller fish, she recorded and analyzed the sounds of more than 300 species of marine life, from mammals to mussels.
        A native of Paterson, N.J., she was a graduate of Smith College and received a doctorate in science from the University of Rhode Island.
        Dr. Fish, whose husband died in 1979, is survived by their daughter, Marilyn Munro of Westport; a sister, Margaret Tongue of East Orange, N.J.; three grandchldren and five great-grandchildren.
