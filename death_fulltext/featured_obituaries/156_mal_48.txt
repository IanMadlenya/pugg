        Jerome Goldstein, who built a modest business selling a homemade wood restorer into a multimillion-dollar, publicly traded company called Scott's Liquid Gold, died on Wednesday in Denver. He was 77 and lived in Denver.
        The cause of death was large-cell lymphoma, said his son, Mark Goldstein, the president and chief executive of the Denver company.
        In 1951, Mr. Goldstein's mother, Ida, bought the formula for Scott's Liquid Gold, a type of furniture polish, from a door-to-door salesman for $350; the salesman had acquired it from a chemist, Lee Scott, who developed it early in the century.
        Mr. Goldstein and his two brothers began mixing and bottling the liquid in a small garage in East Denver and sold it door to door. A year later, Mr. Goldstein took the company public, and since then it has expanded and developed new products like air fresheners and cosmetics.
        For several years, the company also owned the Aquafilter Corporation, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cigarette filters.
        He stepped down as president and chief executive of Scott's in 1990 but retained the title of chairman.
        Mr. Goldstein was born on Sept. 23, 1922, in Denver and attended the University of Denver.
        His first wife, Goldie, died in 1998. Besides his son, Mr. Goldstein is survived by his second wife, Shirley Francis Goldstein; two daughters, Leslee Brooks, of Encino, Calif., and Teri Owen, of Manhattan; two brothers, Ivan Goldstein and Max Goldstein, both of Jerusalem, and five grandchildren.
