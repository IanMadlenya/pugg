        Walter Stone, the chief writer for the original ''Honeymooners'' television series starring Jackie Gleason, died on Wednesday in Miami Beach. He was 79 and lived on Bay Harbor Island, Fla.
        Mr. Stone began his career as a writer for the Robert Q. Lewis radio show on CBS. He also wrote for the ABC show ''Stop the Music.'' In the early 1950's he went to work for Jackie Gleason, and in 1955 he and Marvin Marx wrote a full season of half-hour episodes, 39 in all, that were filmed before a live audience. He also wrote many television specials related to the show, including the 25th ''Honeymooners'' reunion.  Mr. Stone also wrote for ''That's Life,'' an ABC comedy with Robert Morse.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, a brother and two sisters.
