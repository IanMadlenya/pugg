        Elizabeth Snapp, a publicity agent who worked primarily with composers and new-music ensembles, died on Friday at North Shore Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. She was 50 and lived in Glen Cove.
        The cause was cancer, said Carol Yaple, a friend.
        Ms. Snapp began her career in the 1970's at the music publishing company G. Schirmer. In 1980 she formed her own company, E. Snapp, Inc. Her early clients included John Corigliano, William Schuman and Morton Gould. She also worked for Novello, the English publishing company, from 1980 to 1993, and was responsible for promoting the music of Richard Rodney Bennett, Aulis Sallinen, John McCabe and Tristan Keuris.
        In the early 1990's her company expanded into the world of performance, with an emphasis on new music. One of her responsibilities was the Bang on a Can festival, which she assisted in its transition from a fringe group performing in East Village churches to a polished but still adventurous series at Lincoln Center. She also represented the American Youth Orchestra, the Pulse Percussion Ensemble, the American Composers Orchestra and composers including Hugo Weisgall, David Lang, Irwin Bazelon, Michael Gordon, John Luther Adams and Michael Nyman.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert Pryor; two children, Shannon and Ben; a sister, Shannon Snapp Natale of Boston, and her mother, Auntrenette Snapp of Roanoke, Va.
