        Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known sopranos in the 1960's and 1970's, died of cancer on Friday, her family said. She was 52 years old.  Miss Harwood, who died at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London, specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and in the music of Mozart.
        Her mother, a professional soprano, gave her singing lessons when she was a child, and she later studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music.
        She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in ''Die Zauberflote'' by Mozart at Glyndebourne in southern England. In 1963 she scored her first major success, as Countess Adele in Rossini's ''Count Ory.'' In 1960, she won Britain's prized Kathleen Ferrier memorial award for singing, and in 1965 was a winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto in Italy.
        Miss Harwood first appeared at the annual music festival in Salzburg, Austria, in 1970, singing the role of Constanze in Mozart's ''Abduction From the Seraglio'' and that of Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'' Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new production of Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan. He continued to invite her to Salzburg for several years.
        In the late 1970's Miss Harwood's health declined. Her last performance was in November 1989 at the Bath Festival in western England. She married Julian Royle, a businessman, in 1966. The couple had one son.
