        Otto Allen Will Jr., a psychoanalyst and the former medical director of the Austen Riggs Center, a psychiatric hospital in Stockbridge, Mass., died on Wednesday at his home in Richmond, Calif. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Dr. Beulah Parker.
        Dr. Will was one of a small number of psychoanalysts who devoted their careers to trying to understand psychotic patients through long, intensive, therapeutic relationships with them. He wrote more than 85 articles examining how to transform psychotics' thought processes using only psychotherapy.
        Born in Caldwell, Kan., in 1910, Dr. Will received both his bachelor's degree and a medical degree from Stanford University.
        After serving in the Navy during World War II as a lieutenant commander in the Medical Corps, he attended the Washington School of Psychiatry and the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute.
        Before joining Austen Riggs in 1967, he worked for 20 years at Chestnut Lodge, a hospital in Rockville, Md., where he rose to become director of the psychotherapy program. He retired in 1978 as medical director at Austen Riggs but continued on the hospital's board until his death.
        His first marriage, to Gwen Tudor, ended in divorce.
        In addition to his wife, also a psychoanalyst, Dr. Will is survived by a son, Patrick Terrence, of Solvang, Calif.; a daughter, Deirdre Gwen Vinyard, of Reno, and two grandchildren.
