        Howard C. Westwood, a lawyer with the Washington firm of Covington & Burling and a specialist in airline law, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 84.
        The cause was emphysema, said a spokeswoman for the firm.
        Mr. Westwood joined Covington & Burling in 1934. He represented several airlines and was involved in the development of government regulation of the industry. He also championed legal representation for the poor and worked for the creation of the Legal Aid Society and the National Legal Aid Association. He retired in 1979.
        He contributed more than 30 articles about the Civil War to historical journals. He wrote "Black Troops, White Commanders and Freedmen During the Civil War," published in 1992.
        He was a graduate of Swarthmore College and in 1933 received a law degree from Columbia University. He served in the Marine Corps in World War II.
        His wife, Jessica, died 10 years ago.  He is survived by a daughter, Natalie Lombard of Irvington, N.Y., and two sisters, Emily Gardner of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Virginia Kendricks of Albuquerque, N.M.
