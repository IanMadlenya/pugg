        Dr. Harry B. Loomer, a psychiatrist whose pioneering research into drug treatment for depression was recognized after court litigation, died on Thursday at Columbia Memorial Hospital in Hudson, N.Y. He was 86 and lived in Taghkanic, N.Y.
        As a senior psychiatrist at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Orangeburg, N.Y., in 1957, he and a colleague, Dr. John C. Saunders, described the successful use of iproniazid as a "psychic energizer" for 17 chronic hospital patients. When the research resulted in a $10,000 scientific prize for their superior, Dr. Nathan S. Kline, the two men separately filed suits. Although Dr. Loomer dropped out of the litigation, a jury ruled compensation was due and the New York State Court of Appeals upheld the decision in 1981.
        Dr. Loomer was on the staffs of Montefiore Hospital and Gracie Square Hospital while in private practice in Manhattan. He retired in the 1970's and worked as a consultant to the Columbia County Department of Mental Health.
        Dr. Loomer was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from City College in 1932 and received his medical degree from the University of Vienna in 1938. He later studied at the University of Berlin and at the Jung Institute in Zurich, Switzerland.
        He is survived by his wife, Bo Williams Loomer; a son, Jeffrey, of Tucson, Ariz.; a daughter, Valerie Capeille of Grignan, France; two stepsons, Joshua Williams of Knoxville, Tenn., and Daniel Williams of Rego Park, Queens, and nine grandchildren.
