        Gary Cordial, a dancer with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and a former member of American Ballet Theater, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said Deborah Allton, his companion.
        Mr. Cordial trained at the Ballet Theater school in Manhattan and at Indiana University at Bloomington. He joined Ballet Theater in 1975, dancing most notably in Antony Tudor's "Lilac Garden" and "The Leaves are Fading," and in lead roles in "Voluntaries" and "Contra Dances," both choreographed by Glen Tetley. Mr. Cordial left Ballet Theater in 1981 and joined the Metropolitan company, where he danced through the 1991-92 season. He was seen in principal roles in operas that included "La Gioconda," "Turandot" and "Parade."
        He is survived by his parents, James and Dorothy Cordial of Missoula, Mont.; two brothers, Tim, of Missoula, and Craig, of Los Angeles, and two sisters, Deborah, of Missoula, and Jamie, of Buckley, Wash.
