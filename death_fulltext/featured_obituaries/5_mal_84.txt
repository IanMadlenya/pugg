        John E. F. Wood, a senior partner in the Manhattan law firm of Dewey, Ballentine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, died Monday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y., after a long illness. He was 83 years old.
        The firm, one of the nation's largest, was founded in 1909 by Elihu Root Jr., son of President Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of State. Mr. Wood was briefly associated with the firm in 1929 and returned to it in 1933, becoming a partner in 1940. For many years, he was its senior litigator, handling antitrust cases.
        When Mr. Root retired in 1954, Mr. Wood's name replaced his in the firm's name. At the end of that year, Gov. Thomas E. Dewey left office and joined the firm, giving it its present title.
        Mr. Wood, who became counsel to Dewey, Ballantine in 1983, was born in Staunton, Va., and graduated from Denison University, where he later became a trustee and served as board chairman from 1965 to 1972. After receiving his law degree from the University of West Virginia in 1927, he spent two years as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, from which he also graduated.
        He served as a trustee of the village of Scarsdale from 1952 to 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Manning Wood; three sons, John Jr., of Towaco, N.J., Robert, of Athens, Ga., and Stephen, of Milwaukee, and seven grandchildren.
        A memorial service is to be held tomorrow at 2 P.M. at the Scarsdale Community Baptist Church.
