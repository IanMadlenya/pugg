        Dr. Adler was Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He began teaching there in 1949, shortly after earning a doctor of science degree. Last September he was named co-director of the Microsystems Technology Laboratories at M.I.T.
        In the 1960's he established the Semiconductor Electronics Education Committee, a group of 30 international leaders in industry and education. As technical director, he helped to produce material that revamped undergraduate engineering education. He was honored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the Royal Aeronautical Society.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and three sons, Gordon of Thun, Switzerland, Nicholas of Newport Beach, Calif., and Lucas of Burlington, Vt.
