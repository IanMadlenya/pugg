        Bruce Williamson, a longtime film critic and contributing editor at Playboy magazine, died on Oct. 6 at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 71.
        The cause was bladder cancer, the magazine said in a statement.
        Mr. Williamson began writing film criticism for Time magazine in the 1960's, worked briefly for Life magazine and then joined Playboy in 1968. He was the magazine's film critic until his retirement in June.
        In addition to reviewing, Mr. Williamson interviewed actors and contributed articles on other movie-related subjects. During the 1980's and 90's he wrote a movie column for New Woman magazine.
        Born in Cadillac, Mich., Mr. Williamson came to New York in 1949 and had a brief career as an actor, appearing in several productions Off Broadway and on television.
        He also began to write and eventually joined Julius Monk's cabaret group, ''Upstairs at the Downstairs,'' for which he wrote topical humor pieces.
        He is survived by his companion, Shirley Sealy; a daughter, Stephanie, from his only marriage; two sisters, Alberta Van Brunt of Owasso, Mich., and Janette Van Rhee of Middleville, Mich., and two grandchildren.
