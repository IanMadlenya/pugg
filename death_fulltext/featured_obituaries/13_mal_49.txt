        Mayor Richard Flickinger, who guided the passage of what may have been the nation's first municipal ban on pistols, died at his home Monday after a long illness. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Flickinger was elected Mayor of this Chicago suburb in April 1977 after serving 12 years as a village trustee.
        As Mayor, he pushed for passage of the law banning possession or use of pistols in Morton Grove. The measure was approved by the village board in 1981.
        He is survived by his brother, his wife, a grown son and daughter, four grown step-children, and four grandchildren.
