        The Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, died today near his home in Scotland, his estate manager said. He was 59 years old.
        The manager, Philip Ord, said the Earl, Fergus Michael Claude Bowes-Lyon, was walking near his Glamis Castle home with his son, Lord Glamis, and a friend when he collapsed.
        ''He just collapsed with a heart attack,'' Mr. Ord said. ''It came as a complete shock and surprise as he was very fit and had no health problems.''
        A Royal Air Force helicopter took the Earl to a hospital in Dundee, about 10 miles to the north, but he was dead on arrival, Mr. Ord said.
        The Earl was a nephew of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who grew up at Glamis Castle.
        He acquired his title in 1972 when a cousin, Timothy Bowes-Lyon, died without childen. The Earl had been a member of the Edinburgh Stock Exchange since 1963.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary, a son and two daughters.
        Mr. Ord said a private funeral would be conducted at the castle's chapel Saturday. Burial will be at the family cemetery on the castle grounds.
