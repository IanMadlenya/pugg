        Thomas Peck, the founder and director of the St. Louis Symphony Chorus and the Grant Park Symphony Chorus of Chicago, died on Wednesday at his home in St. Louis. He was 56.
        The cause was AIDS, said a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.
        Mr. Peck was born in Chicago and studied choral directing there with Margaret Hillis, eventually becoming Ms. Hillis's assistant at the Chicago Symphony Chorus. In the mid-1950's, he directed the Thomas Peck Singers, also in Chicago. He was chorus director at the Cincinnati May Festival from 1975 to 1978, and he started the St. Louis Symphony Chorus in 1977.
        No immediate family members survive.
