        Clark Jones, a director from the earliest days of television, died on March 28 at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 81.
        Mr. Jones directed many of television's first large-scale live arts programs, including a 1952 broadcast of ''Carmen'' from the Metropolitan Opera, ''Peter Pan'' with Mary Martin in 1955, the Royal Ballet's ''Cinderella'' in 1957 and nearly 20 years of the Tony Awards from their first television broadcast in 1967.
        ''Carmen'' was broadcast via a closed circuit to about 70,000 viewers in movie theaters in 27 cities. The technique had been used for prizefights before, but never for a major cultural event. The broadcast was considered a successful experiment.
        Mr. Jones specialized in big cultural telecasts. In 1953 he directed the two-hour 50th-anniversary tribute to the Ford Motor Company, broadcast live on NBC and CBS.
        He also directed an early television soap opera, ''One Man's Family,'' in 1949, and many series, including ''Caesar's Hour'' with Sid Caesar, ''The Perry Como Show'' and ''The Carol Burnett Show.''
        He began his career in 1941 at WRBG in Schenectady, N.Y., an experimental station founded by the General Electric Company. He served in the Army Signal Corps during World War II, and in 1947 moved to New York to join WPIX and later NBC.
        He retired in 1987 after directing his 19th Tony Awards show.
        He is survived by his partner, Paul Daniel, and his sister, Mavis Little of Slingerlands, N.Y.
