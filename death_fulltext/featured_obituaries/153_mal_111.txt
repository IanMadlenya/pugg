        George J. Hill 3d, a co-founder of the Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos advertising agency in Boston, died Friday at his home in Dedham, Mass. He was 66.
        The cause was prostate cancer, according to a statement from his wife, Virginia Hill.
        Mr. Hill, who was known as Jay, started the agency in 1968 with three associates: Alan Holliday, Jack Connors and Steve Cosmopulos; each contributed $1,500. Thirty years later, the firm was sold to the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York for $100 million.
        Primarily a copywriter, he worked on campaigns for Fidelity Investments, as well as for politicians, like Mayor Kevin H. White of Boston and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas.
        George Jackson Hill 3d, who retired in 1996 as chairman of the agency, was born in Cambridge, Mass., on Nov. 22, 1932.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Hill is survived by three sons, David Hill of Berkeley, Calif., John Hill of Bluemont, Va., and Peter Hill of Brooklyn; and two sisters, Stacie Barta of Southampton, N.Y., and Elizabeth Pitney of Durham, N.C., and three grandchildren.
