       Julius Seligson, the national intercollegiate men's singles tennis champion in 1928 and winner of 65 straight college matches, died yesterday of a malignant melanoma at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 77 years old. Mr. Seligson's streak for Lehigh University ran from 1928 until his final match in 1930, when he was defeated by Cliff Sutter, a sophomore from Tulane, to fail in his bid for an undefeated undergraduate tennis career.
