        For more than 20 years, Mr. Drake broadcast his homespun philosophy and observations, aimed mainly at housewives. He began to be a household name in the mid-1940's with ABC, moving to CBS and then WOR. In 1957, he switched to ABC television with the ''This Is Galen Drake'' show but two years later was back at WOR.
        He is survived by a daughter, Linda Drake-McCleve, and a son Galen Spencer Drake, both of Phoenix.
