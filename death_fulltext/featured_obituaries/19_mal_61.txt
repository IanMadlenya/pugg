        Jimmie Fidler, the last of a generation of Hollywood gossip columnists that included Louella Parsons, Hedda Hopper and Walter Winchell, died Tuesday at Westlake Community Hospital. He was 89 years old.
        His radio show, often acerbic, featured a trademark sign-off: ''Good night to you, and you, and I do mean you!''
        At his peak in 1950, Mr. Fidler was earning more than $250,000 a year. He was heard over 486 radio stations each week by 40 million people, and his gossip column appeared in 360 newspapers. He began to cut back his broadcasts in the 1960's but did not retire from the air until 1983.
        Mr. Fidler credited a network of studio spies to give him the bits of gossip that often infuriated members of the Hollywood community.
        A high school dropout and a one-time movie extra, he worked in publicity for Famous Players-Lasky, the forerunner of Paramount, and was assigned to Cecil B. DeMille.
        He gained widespread attention, and reportedly increased profits for DeMille films, by telling reporters that Mr. DeMille had loaded his yacht with rifles and was taking it to Mexico to hunt cannibals.
        Survivors include his wife, Kay, three daughters and four grandchildren.
