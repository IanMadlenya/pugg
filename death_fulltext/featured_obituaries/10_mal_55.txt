        The Rev. Channing E. Phillips, a civil rights leader and the first black to be placed in nomination for the Presidency of the United States by a major political party, died of cancer yesterday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Phillips had been minister of planning and coordination of the Riverside Church in Manhattan since 1982.
        He headed Robert F. Kennedy's Presidential campaign in the District of Columbia in 1968. At the Democratic convention in Chicago, he allowed his name to be placed in nomination as a favorite-son candidate because Senator Kennedy had been assassinated in Los Angeles earlier that year.

        Mr. Phillips, who received 67 1/2 votes, said his candidacy was meant to show ''the Negro vote must not be taken for granted.''
        At that time, Mr. Phillips also served as president of the Housing Development Corporation, a Government-backed housing venture in the nation's capital. He also served for seven years as the pastor of Lincoln Temple, United Church of Christ, in Washington.
        He favored full home rule for the District of Columbia.
        Mr. Phillips was born in Brooklyn, the son of a Baptist minister.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane; two sons, Channing D., of Washington, and John E., of Manhattan, and three daughters, Sheilah P. Peterson and Tracy J. Phillips of Manhattan, and Jill C. Phillips, of Oakland, Calif.
        The funeral will be held Saturday at 10 A.M. at Riverside Church. A memorial service will be held in Washington at a later date.
