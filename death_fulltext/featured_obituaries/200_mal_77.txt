        Bennett Lenson Robinson, a designer of annual reports for companies like H. J. Heinz, died on Wednesday while on vacation in Vienna. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Robinson died of injuries from a traffic accident, his family said.
        Mr. Robinson began his career in promotional design at Charm magazine, later moving to Mademoiselle. In 1977, he was a co-founder of Corporate Graphics International, where he began working on annual reports for Heinz, a client of his ever since. After a British company acquired Corporate Graphics, Mr. Robinson and his wife, Sondra Kurtin Robinson, founded Robinson Kurtin Communications in 1993.
        In 1984, before many companies were trying to make their reports entertaining or visually engaging, Mr. Robinson produced one for Heinz that was illustrated with renderings of a tomato by painters, sculptors and other artists recruited from around the world. Other clients included Harrah's Entertainment and Knight Ridder.
        Mr. Robinson was born Nov. 24, 1928, and graduated from Syracuse University.
        He is survived by his wife; two sons, Andrew of Orlando, Fla., and Joshua of Tampa, Fla.; a stepson, Abner Kurtin, of Boston; a stepdaughter, Sarah Kurtin Levy, of Atlanta; and seven grandchildren.
