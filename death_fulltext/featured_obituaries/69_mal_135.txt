        Scott Newhall, the editor of The San Francisco Chronicle from 1952 to 1971, died Monday at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital in Valencia, Calif. He was 78 years old and had homes in Piru, Calif., and San Francisco.
        He was a member of a pioneering California family and the great-grandson of Henry Mayo Newhall, after whom the hospital was named. His son Skip said he died of pancreatitis.
        Mr. Newhall, who had a reputation for flamboyance, transformed The Chronicle from a sedate daily into a paper that aggressively pursued stories. He joined the paper in 1935 at the age of 21 as a photographer and worked his way up to become Sunday editor, operations manager and, finally, executive editor.
        In 1963, he bought The Newhall Signal, a small paper in the community of Newhall. Newhall, now part of Santa Clarita, was founded by his great-grandfather during the California gold rush. He sold the paper in 1978 to a Georgia-based chain but remained the editor until four years ago when he resigned in a disagreement with the new owners, the Morris Newspaper Company of Savannah, Ga.
        Mr. Newhall served on the board of the Newhall Land and Farming Company, founded by Henry Newhall's five sons. He ran for mayor of San Francisco in 1971 but finished fifth.
        As a founder and trustee of the San Francisco Maritime Museum, he bought and refitted an side-wheeler tugboat he found marooned on a mud flat in England. He took the helm for a steam-driven six-month crossing to the museum in 1970.
        Mr. Newhall is survived by his wife, Ruth; three sons, Skip, of Valencia, Jon, of Oakland and Tony, of San Francisco; five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
