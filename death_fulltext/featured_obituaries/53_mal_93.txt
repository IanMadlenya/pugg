        Carl E. Ring, a lawyer and electrical engineer, died on Tuesday at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken, N.J. He was 89 years old and lived in Union City, N.J.
        He died of heart failure, his son, Carl Jr., said.
        Mr. Ring, a graduate of the University of Maine and Harvard Law School, had a law practice in Union City. From 1945 to 1980, he was also president of Electrical Engineers Inc., an electrical equipment maintenance company.
        He competed in the 1928 Olympic Games in the high hurdles. He also participated in politics, including waging an unsuccessful race for the United States Senate in the 1952 Republican primary.
        In the late 1940's, he drew national attention with a Federal suit against the Dramatists Guild of the Authors League of America challenging a contract he had signed to produce "Stovepipe Hat," a play about Abraham Lincoln. He sought to make changes in the play, but the authors refused, citing a contract provision that any changes required the author's approval.
        He repudiated the contract and closed the play, thus losing his standing with the Dramatists Guild. A jury ruled that the agreement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act but did not award damages, saying he had forfeited his right to relief by repudiating the contract and closing the play. In 1951, the United States Supreme Court refused to hear further arguments in the case.
        He is survived by two sons, Carl Jr., of Glen Ridge, N.J., and John, of Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., and four grandchildren.
