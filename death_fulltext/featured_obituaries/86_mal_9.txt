        Tom Ruud, a dancer and choreographer with the San Francisco Ballet, died on Monday at his home in San Francisco. He was 50.
        The cause was AIDS, said Pam Lord, a public-relations associate for the ballet company.
        Mr. Ruud performed for 10 years with William Christensen's Ballet West in Salt Lake City before joining the San Francisco Ballet in 1975. He was made a principal dancer by the San Francisco company in 1986. One of his most popular roles was that of Drosselmeyer, the elderly uncle in "The Nutcracker." Six of Mr. Ruud's ballets are in the company repertory, including "Mobile," the subject of a short film, "Balances," which was released in 1981.
        Mr. Ruud was born in Pasadena, Calif., and raised in Afton, Wyo. He received his dance training at the University of Utah, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees. He performed as a guest artist with the National Ballet of Canada, Pacific Northwest Ballet and the Oakland Ballet among other companies.
        Mr. Ruud is survived by a son, Christopher, of San Francisco; his mother, Gladys Papworth; a brother, Jack, and a half-sister, April McMurdo, all of Afton, and a brother, Michael, of Salt Lake City.
