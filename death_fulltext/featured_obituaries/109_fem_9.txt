        Isabel Kambert, an opera singer who escaped Nazi Germany with liverwurst sandwiches stuffed with folded 10,000-mark notes, and who later in New York became known as Mme. Isabel after creating the fashion for decorated cashmere sweaters, died on Wednesday at the home of a niece, Eva Ballantine, in Kingston, N.Y.
        Mrs. Kambert was 103.
        She was well known in German and Paris opera houses in the 1930's until, unwilling to join the Nazi party, she was banned from performing. She left Germany in 1938 on an overnight train to Paris, carrying one small bag and a box of tiny sandwiches.
        She often told friends that at the border, flirtatious guards asked if they could have one of her sandwiches, and when they persisted, she fended them off with: "Oh, no, you wouldn't want one of these. They're kosher." The sandwiches apparently lost their appeal.
        When she reached New York shortly after, suitable opera roles were in short supply and she took a job for a time decorating cashmere sweaters, using embroidery, beading or ribbons as embellishment. The shop was run by three Russian emigres: Karinska, who later became known for her ballet costumes; Princess Natasha Paley, and Baron Nicholas de Gunzberg, who went on to senior editorial positions at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue magazines.
        Mrs. Kambert later opened her own business as part of the custom house of Chez Ninon and, for a brief period, was associated with Saks Fifth Avenue. In the 1960's, she operated independently in the Lombardy Hotel.
        Her customers included Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who bought a sweater during a visit to New York, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, Doris Duke, the Duchess of Windsor and Greta Garbo.
        One of eight children of Hugo Heermann, a German violinist who was discovered by Rossini at age 9 and who introduced several Brahms compositions, Mrs. Kambert was born in Frankfurt in 1892. She was married and widowed four times.
