        Maximilien Cardinal de Furstenberg, former head of the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Eastern Churches, has died in a clinic in his native Belgium, the Vatican reported today. He was 83 years old.
        Cardinal de Furstenberg, elevated to Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1967, died Thursday, the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano said. No cause of death was given. As Prefect of the Congregation for the Eastern Churches, the Cardinal was involved in a dispute between the Vatican and Ukrainian Rite Catholics, who protested what they called second-class treatment by the Vatican. In 1971, the Vatican declined to grant patriarchal status to the Ukrainian Catholic Church; the Cardinal had earlier declared invalid a synod at which Ukrainian bishops voted for a patriarchal form of church administration.
        In the late 1960's, as Pope Paul VI instituted changes to reform the Roman Curia, the church's central administration, the Cardinal was given the responsibility, along with two other Cardinals, of supervising the huge but undisclosed assets and income of the Vatican. At the time, he was often rumored to be the Pope's likely choice for Vatican Secretary of State.
        Before his appointment as Cardinal, he was in the Vatican's diplomatic corps, serving as the Pope's envoy in Portugal and Japan.
        Pope John Paul II sent a telegram of condolence to Belgium's Roman Catholic bishops.
        The death leaves the number of cardinals at 156, 119 of whom are under 80 and thus eligible to vote in a conclave for the election of a Pope.
