        Joe Sewell, the sharp-eyed batter who struck out only 114 times in a 14-year major league career, died on Tuesday at his home in Mobile, Ala. Mr. Sewell, who was elected to the Hall of Fame by the veterans committee in 1977, was 91 years old and lived with his son, Dr. James W. Sewell.
        Over 11 seasons with the Cleveland Indians and three with the Yankees from 1920 to 1933, Joseph Wheeler Sewell, who struck out only three times in two seasons and only four times in three others, earned such an awesome reputation for his ability to hit anything within the strike zone that it was said even umpires deferred to his judgment. If he didn't swing at a pitch, they reasoned, it couldn't have been a strike.
        Mr. Sewell, who developed his batting skills as a youngster in rural Alabama by repeatedly tossing rocks and lumps of coal into the air and slamming them with a broomstick, said that his eyesight was so sharp that he could pick out the spiraling seams on a ball speeding toward the plate.
        Broke in at 21
        Few American League pitchers could dispute him. No one in major league history who played as much struck out less, and Mr. Sewell played a lot.
        His first game came as a nervous 21-year-old replacement for Ray Chapman, the Indian shortstop who became the only major leaguer to die in a game when he was struck in the head by a pitch thrown by Carl Mays of the Yankees. That was on Sept. 7, 1920, and from then until May 2, 1930, when he was kept in bed with a high fever, he played in 1,103 consecutive games. At the time, it was a major league record for a player with a single team and even now it is the fifth-longest streak.
        At 5 feet 6 1/2 inches and 155 pounds, Mr. Sewell, who had a career batting average of .312, including a high of .353 in 1923 and nine other .300 seasons, was never a power hitter, but only, perhaps, because he lacked proper inspiration during his years as a shortstop and third baseman with the generally lackluster Indians. Playing with the Yankees during the shank of his career, Mr. Sewell, who had never hit more than 7 home runs in a season, hit 11 homers over 124 games in 1932.
        Most Hits Were Singles
        Although most of his 2,226 career hits were singles, none was of the broken-bat variety. Aside from his record of 115 straight games without striking out in 1929 and his average of about one strikeout every 16 games, the most compelling evidence of Mr. Sewell's uncanny ability to get the wood solidly onto the ball was that he used only one bat during his entire major league career. It was a 35-inch, 40-ounce Ty Cobb model Louisville Slugger he kept in condition by seasoning it with chewing tobacco and stroking it with a Coke bottle.
        Mr. Sewell, who was born on Oct. 9, 1898, in Titus, Ala., was a star football and baseball player for the University of Alabama. He led the school baseball team to four conference titles before joining the minor league New Orleans Pelicans in 1920. Before that summer ended, he was on a World Series championship team as Cleveland beat the Brooklyn Dodgers.
        His only other championship season was in 1932, when the Yankees swept the Cubs in four games and he batted .333.
        Worked in Public Relations
        After his retirement, Mr. Sewell worked as a public relations man for a dairy and was a major league scout. In 1964, at the age of 66, he became the Alabama baseball coach, achieving a 114-99 record in seven seasons.
        Mr. Sewell's two younger brothers also played in the majors: Tommy played in one game with the Chicago Cubs in 1927, and Luke played for four teams over 20 years and, as manager of the St. Louis Browns, led the team to its only pennant in 1944.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Sewell, whose brothers are both dead, is survived by a daughter, L. C. Parnell of Birmingham, Ala., 10 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.
