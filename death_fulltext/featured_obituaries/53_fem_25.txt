        Kate Hall, a soprano who appeared in several Broadway productions, including the original "Porgy and Bess" in 1935, died on Friday at St. Clare's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of complications from diabetes, said Alan Eichler, a friend.
        Miss Hall's other Broadway credits include several editions of "Lew Leslie's Blackbirds," the 1942 revival of "Porgy and Bess" and the 1946 revival of "Show Boat," which was recorded by Columbia Records. She also recorded for Decca, RCA and Brunswick.
        Miss Hall was a soloist with the Hall Johnson Choir, the Cecil Mack Choir and the Eva Jessye Choir in New York City.
        She leaves no immediate survivors.
        A funeral service is scheduled at 10 A.M. tomorrow at the Convent Avenue Baptist Church, 420 West 145th Street, Manhattan.
