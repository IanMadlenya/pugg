        Harold Pierson, a dancer, actor and educator, died on Aug. 1 in Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said  Joan Myers Brown, the founder and artistic director of the Philadelphia Dance Company.
        Mr. Pierson was the former artistic director of the Philadelphia company, also known as Philadanco; he was a choreographer and teacher for the troupe.
        He directed and helped to write the video script for ''On the Shoulders of Our Ancestors,'' a multimedia work presented by Philadanco in June at the Joyce Theater in Chelsea.
        Mr. Pierson trained in dance with Robert Joffrey and Valentina Pereyaslavec and in acting with Louis Gossett Jr. and Sanford Meisner.
        He played a quiet but important role in the development of many black modern-dance choreographers' careers from the 1950's on, performing with the companies of Alvin Ailey, Syvilla Fort, Geoffrey Holder, Louis Johnson, Matt Mattox, Donald McKayle and Olatunji. He danced in the premiere of Mr. McKayle's classic ''Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder'' in 1959.
        Mr. Pierson also performed in the Broadway and touring casts of musicals, including ''Golden Boy,'' ''Sweet Charity,'' ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' and ''Purlie.''
        He was the artistic director for the Black Dance America Festival presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1983. He also held a visiting professorship at Howard University in the College of Fine Arts and Sciences.
        Mr. Pierson is survived by his sisters, Dorothy Johnson and Agnes Hamilton, both of St. Albans, Queens, and his brother, Benjamin.
