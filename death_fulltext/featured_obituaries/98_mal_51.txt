        William E. Steckler, a Federal district judge in Indiana who was in his 45th year on the Federal bench, died on Wednesday at his home in Indianapolis. He was 81.
        The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said his secretary at the Southern District of Indiana, Patricia Springman.
        Judge Steckler was second in seniority among all Federal judges. He was appointed, at the age of 36, by President Harry S. Truman in February 1950. He was one of the youngest members of the Federal judiciary ever and the first Democrat on the bench in his district in 108 years.
        At the time of his appointment, the Southern District covered 60 counties in the lower two-thirds of Indiana. In his first year, Judge Steckler disposed of about 860 cases, making him one of the busiest Federal judges in the country.
        He rendered decisions involving reapportionment that affected the makeup of local, county and state governments. He also broadened voting rights in several cases.
        For 28 years he served as chief judge of the Southern District, a position in which administrative duties took up a good part of his working days. Yet he maintained a caseload equal to those of his colleagues.
        He took senior status in 1986, reducing his number of cases. The only Federal judge with longer service is Senior Judge Seybourn H. Lynn in Birmingham, Ala., who was appointed in 1946.
        William Elwood Steckler was born in Mount Vernon, Ind., and earned a law degree at the Indiana University Law School in 1936. He received his doctorate in law the next year and went into private practice.
        He became active in the Democratic Party and campaigned for Truman in 1948.
        Judge Steckler is survived by two sons, William R., of Indianapolis, and David A., of Wilton, Conn., and four grandchildren. His wife of 51 years, Vitallis Alting Steckler, died in 1989.
