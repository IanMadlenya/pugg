        Miss Novak, who was born in St. Louis, came to Hollywood as a teen-ager. She worked in slapstick comedies and was a bathing beauty for Mack Sennett. Among her films as leading lady for Tom Mix were ''Sky High'' and ''Trailin'.'' She also was the leading lady in three films for William S. Hart.
        In 1921 she married William Reed, a director and stuntman, and the couple went to Australia in the late 1920's to make a series of westerns there.
        She returned to the United States in the 1930's and appeared in a number of films directed by John Ford, an old friend, who cast her in such classics as ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' ''Stagecoach'' and ''Fort Apache.'' She also played a nun in ''The Bells of St. Mary's.''
        Miss Novak is survived by her sister, Jane, 2 daughters, 10 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.
