        Sylvan H. Meyer, a newspaper editor and outspoken white supporter of civil rights in Georgia in the 1950's and 60's, died on April 8 at his home in Dahlonega, Ga. He was 79.
        Mr. Meyer, who was chairman of the Georgia advisory committee to the United States Civil Rights Commission from 1958 to 1965, advocated peaceful integration, a stand that led to death threats against him and his family.
        He was editor of The Times of Gainesville, a daily newspaper in the North Georgia mountains, from 1950 to 1969 and editor of The Miami News in Florida from 1969 to 1973. He was also on the American Civil Liberties Union's national advisory counsel.
        Born in Atlanta, Mr. Meyer graduated from the University of North Carolina.
        His survivors include his wife, Alice Heineman Meyer; a daughter, Erica Rauzin of Miami Beach; two sons, David N., II, of Manhattan and Jason, of Pennington, N.J.; five grandchildren; and a brother, Leonard, of Atlanta.
        Correction:  April 24, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the Georgia newspaper editor Sylvan H. Meyer on Saturday misstated the given name of his wife, who survives him. She is Anne Heineman Meyer, not Alice.
