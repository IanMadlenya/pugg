        Manville J. Mayfield, an engineer at the Department of Energy who helped develop fuel cells, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. He was 68 and lived in Morgantown, W.Va.
        Mr. Mayfield was the engineering project manager of the fuel cells research and development program at the Energy Technology Center in Morgantown. He was on his way home from an energy conference in Chicago when the plane crashed, said Michael Gauldin, a spokesman for the Energy Department.
        Fuel cells, which were first developed in the 1960's for the space program, convert the energy of a fuel directly into electricity and heat without combustion. They give off few emissions and work quietly because they contain no moving parts.
        Mr. Mayfield was a graduate of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before joining the Energy Department, he worked as a technical director for a 3M research laboratory in Chattanooga, Tenn., and as a division chief at the Tennessee Valley Authority. He also served as chairman of the Clean Coal Conference.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce; two sons, Stephen, of Charleston, S.C., and Jefferson, of Eagleville, Tenn.; two daughters, Nancy Mayfield, of Morgantown, and Laura Mayfield Viar, of Summerville, S.C., and a brother, George, of Kingsport, Tenn.
