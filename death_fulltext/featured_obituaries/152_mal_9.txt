        Milton Jack Mirman, an authority on United States stamps who was once a major dealer, died last Friday at a hospital in Drexel Hill, Pa. He was 84.
        Mr. Mirman, a longtime resident of Baldwin, N.Y., had moved to an elder-care community in Media, Pa., last year.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Born in Manhattan, Mr. Mirman started attending auctions as an amateur stamp dealer when he was 14. He graduated from New York University and, in 1935, from its law school, and practiced law for about 10 years before going into business in the garment district of Manhattan.
        In 1955, he decided to turn his hobby into an occupation with his own dealership. Within a year he had bought Stanley Gibbons Inc., an American offshoot of Stanley Gibbons Ltd. of London.
        The New York company was one of the leading traders for serious collectors in the United States, with a catalogue that served as a pricing guide for American stamps. Mr. Mirman headed the company until he sold it to the Intergovernmental Philatelic Corporation in 1979.
        He managed the business into the 1980's, when the British company bought it and integrated it into the London original. Mr. Mirman remained with Intergovernmental as an appraiser and manager of its American operations until his retirement in 1997.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Sally Roth Mirman; a son, Steven J., of Philadelphia; a daughter, Marilyn Marte Mirman of Baltimore, and two sisters, Lucille Schulman of Cranbury, N.J., and Ruth Pomeranz of Boynton Beach, Fla.
