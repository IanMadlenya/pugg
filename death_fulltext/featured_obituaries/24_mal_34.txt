        Irvin Shapiro, a film importer and distributor who introduced many notable foreign movies to the United States, died of complications from Parkinson's disease on Sunday at his home in New York. He was 82 years old.
        During more than 50 years in film distribution, Mr. Shapiro brought such movies as Robert Wiene's ''Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion,'' Claude Chabrol's ''Cousins'' and Jean-Luc Godard's ''Breathless'' to American audiences, principally through his company, Films Around the World. He also re-released many early films and was the first to distribute works by such American directors as Stanley Kubrick, Sidney J. Furie and George Romero.
        Mr. Shapiro's film career began in the early 1920's, when he wrote movie reviews and managed a theater in his native Washington. In 1932, after brief stints with RKO Pictures and the Little Carnegie Theater in Manhattan, he formed World Pictures, a film-distribution company that also helped develop specialized theaters for foreign movies. He not only introduced many French, British and Italian movies but also helped end a post-World War II American boycott of German films.
        Mr. Shapiro formed another company, Film Classics, that acquired distribution rights to 39 British movies and many films by Selznick International, Samuel Goldwyn and Hal Roach. He produced several movies and was one of the first to enter the lucrative market in licensing movies to television in the 1950's.
        Mr. Shapiro is survived by his wife, Diana, of Manhattan; a sister, Ray Firestone, of Washington, and two brothers, Harry, of Washington, and Hyman, of Bedford, Va.
