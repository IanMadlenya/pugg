        Raymond J. Broderick, a former federal judge who closed a Pennsylvania institution for the retarded and disabled and ruled that Philadelphia should not have paid for a platform for a visiting pope, died on Aug. 6 in a retirement community in Gladwyne, Pa. He was 86.
        He stepped down from the United States District Court in Philadelphia  on June 5. A Republican, he was appointed in 1971 by President Richard M. Nixon after serving as Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor and running unsuccessfully for governor.
        The Pennhurst Center for the Mentally Retarded in Spring City, Pa., had over 10,000 residents when Judge Broderick ordered it closed in 1977. He ruled that keeping the retarded in such large institutions violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution by denying them the education and training that could be provided in smaller, community-based units.
        The judge ruled in 1979 that the City of Philadelphia violated the separation of church and state when it built a platform for an appearance by Pope John Paul II. He ordered the archdiocese to reimburse the city $204,569 for the cost.
        The judge was born in Philadelphia and earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
        Surviving are his wife, Marjorie; three sons; two daughters and 10 grandchildren.
