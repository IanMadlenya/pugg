        Mr. Simpson was the originator and author of the travel guide ''Country Inns and Back Roads,'' published in 1966 by his fledgling company, the Berkshire Traveller Press, and it became the forerunner of an entire cottage industry. With each new edition, the book grew in size and scope. Today it is published by Harper & Row and is one of a number in the fast-growing field.
        More recently, Mr. Simpson wrote books about Britain, Ireland and the Continent. In 1981, he researched and wrote ''Bed & Breakfast, American Style.''
        His wife, the former Nancy Brown, died in 1972.
        He is survived by two sons, Geoffrey A., of Hope, R.I., and Keith H., of Wolfeboro, N.H., and three grandchildren.
