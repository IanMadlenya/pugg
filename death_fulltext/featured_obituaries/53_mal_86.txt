        Harry Smoler, a Brooklyn Democrat who was elected to the New York State Assembly when he was 67 years old, died yesterday at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of heart disease, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Smoler was born in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn in 1911 and was the first of his family to enter college. He dropped out and went to work in the family candy store. Later he became a real-estate broker and insurance agent and invested in the stock market.
        In 1965, he returned to college, earning a degree in business and accounting from Baruch College of the City University of New York.
        His successful bid for the Assembly in 1978 was his fourth attempt at elective office. He was elected to a second term in 1980 but lost in the 1982 primary when redistricting pitted him against another incumbent Democrat. He was a member of Community School Board 22 in Brooklyn for more than 16 years and was active in many Jewish causes.
        He is survived by his wife, Hilda, two daughters, Marian Silverstein of Leonia, N.J. and Sheila Lerner of West Windsor, N.J.; and four grandchildren.
