        Richard G. Green, a lawyer who defended First Amendment freedoms, died on Sept. 3 at his home in Manhattan. He was 87.
        Mr. Green was the defense lawyer in a celebrated Vietnam War-era case involving Stephen Radich, owner of the Radich Gallery at 818 Madison Avenue. Mr. Radich was tried in 1967 for exhibiting a show in which the artist Marc Morrel used the American flag in a way that the authorities said was illegal.
        The show included sculptures and fabric constructions that protested American engagement in the Vietnam War. It contained a piece in which the flag formed a figure in a hangman's noose and another in which it was draped in chains.
        In May 1967, Mr. Radich was convicted of violating a state law forbidding defilement or mutilation of the American flag.
        Mr. Green and the New York Civil Liberties Union unsuccessfully appealed to the State Court of Appeals in Albany in 1970. Likewise, the United States Supreme Court, in a tie vote, upheld the conviction in 1971. In January 1973, however, the court ruled that Mr. Radich could appeal, citing another case in which it decided that criminal defendants whose convictions are affirmed by a tie vote could appeal again. In 1974, a federal judge overturned the conviction.
        Mr. Green was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College and Brooklyn Law School. A sole practitioner for much of his career, he retired last year.
        He was married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce. Surviving are his wife of 47 years, Ruth Davis Green; a son, Richard Jr., of Chevy Chase, Md.; three stepdaughters, Anna Hobbs of Barcelona, Spain, Jennifer McVeigh of Portland, Me., and Nancy Hobbs of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
