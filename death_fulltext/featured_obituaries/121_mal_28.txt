        Dr. Wilcomb E. Washburn, a historian and longtime executive of the Smithsonian Institution who was an authority on North American Indians, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 72 and also had a home in Princess Anne, Md.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Kathryn.
        Dr. Washburn retired from the Smithsonian on Jan. 1 after three decades as director of its American studies program. Earlier, he had posts at Smithsonian museums.
        He was one of two editors of ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas: North America'' (1996, Cambridge University Press). His ''The Indian in  America'' (1975) was praised in The New York Times as a ''masterly''  Indian political and social history.
        He was a former president of the American Society for Ethnohistory, the American Studies Association, the Society for the History of Discoveries and the Columbia Historical Society (now the Historical Society of Washington).
        Dr. Washburn was born in Ottawa, Kan., graduated summa cum laude from Dartmouth in 1948 and received his doctorate in history from Harvard in 1955. He taught full time at the College of William and Mary  until 1958 and part time, in later years, at American University, the University of Maryland and George Washington University.
        His marriage to Lelia Kanavarioti, in 1951, ended in divorce in 1981.
        Surviving, in addition to his second  wife, are a son, Alexandros, of Manhattan; a brother, John, of Baltimore, and two granddaughters.
