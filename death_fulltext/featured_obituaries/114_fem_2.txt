        Sarah Powell Huntington, who spent her life in social service, dealing with mental health issues and, particularly, the fate of women released from prison,  died on June 23 at her home in St. James, L.I. She was 89.
        Upholding the Quaker tradition of her family, she was a mainstay of the Women's Prison Association and Home on Manhattan's Lower East Side for almost 70 years.
        Two ancestors, Isaac T. Hopper and his daughter, Abigail Hopper Gibbons, founded the association in 1844; she was president from 1957 to 1967.
        Mrs. Huntington had been on the board of the association since 1925 and remained active until recently. For her initiation, she escorted women from the  prison's door to the association's Hopper Home, a halfway house offering shelter and food and a guiding hand in the search for a job and a new life.
        One of Mrs. Huntington's legacies was Sarah Powell Huntington House on 10th Street and Avenue B. It met a longstanding goal to reunite families in the face  of statistics that show three quarters of women prisoners to be mothers and at least a third to be homeless.
        A new addition, opened three years ago, provided help for former convicts who otherwise would not have had their children restored to them. It sheltered them, 28 at a time, in a drug-free, supervised environment.
        Mrs. Huntington, a native of Manhattan, was a past chairman of the Suffolk County Mental Health Board.
        She also worked with related local and state agencies, including the State Association of Community Mental Health Boards, of which she was a former president.
        Her husband of more than 50 years, Prescott Butler Huntington, a former state assemblyman, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Francis C. and Lawrence  S., both of Manhattan; two daughters, Sarah H. Fletcher of Locust Valley, L.I.,  and Susan H. Fisher of Greenwich, Conn.; 12 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
