        Jean Goldwurm, a film distributor who imported such neorealist classics as "Open City," "Forbidden Games" and "Two Cents Worth of Hope" from Europe after World War II, died in Lenox Hill Hospital yesterday. He was 97 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Gordon Oppenheimer, a lawyer and family spokesman, said the cause of death was natural causes.
        Mr. Goldwurm's company, Times Film, was involved in two suits -- Times Film vs. Chicago and Times Film vs. Maryland -- over attempts to bar the showing of some films. A ruling by the United States Supreme Court in 1965 made such prior censorhip impractical.
        Mr. Goldwurm brought many art films to the United States, including "To Live in Peace," "One Summer of Happiness" and "The Bicycle Thief."
        In 1951, Mr. Goldwurm acquired the Little Carnegie Theater, closed and renovated it, and reopened with the Japanese classic "Rashomon." He had also owned the World Theater on West 49th Street.
        He is survived by his wife, Iva.
