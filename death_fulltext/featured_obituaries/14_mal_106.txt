        In the heyday of the miniskirt, Mr. Tiffeau was one of its liveliest proponents. From 1956 to 1971, the spirited clothes he designed under the Tiffeau & Busch label brought him success and fame as one of the first of the celebrity designers.
        At the same time, he was designing for Monte Sano & Pruzan, a manufacturer of coats and suits house, where he had started in 1952 as a pattern maker. He and Beverly Busch formed their company to produce a less expensive collection that young women could afford.
        In those years he won numerous design awards, including the prestigious Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1960 and 1964.
        He had a reputation for being fiercely independent and opinionated. He once said women should not trust him, or anyone else, to tell them how to dress. Women's Wear Daily, which labeled him with the epithet ''sauvage,'' once quoted him as saying he took clothes seriously, but not fashion. He called fashion a serious business, not an art.
        His inspiration seemed to wane when hemlines fell in the 1970's, and he returned to France, where he worked for the Rive Gauche division of Yves Saint Laurent until 1975. He briefly came back to New York the following year to design coats for Originala.
        In recent years, he taught fashion design at the Institut de la Mode in Paris and divided his time between an apartment in Paris and a farm in Chenvelles, in the Loire Valley, where he was born on Oct. 11, 1928.
