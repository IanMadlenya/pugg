        Dale Long, who set a major league record with home runs in eight consecutive games while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1956, died Sunday. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Long had suffered from cancer, according to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minor leagues, for whom he had worked.
        A first baseman, he spent 11 years in the major leagues, with the Pirates, the Chicago Cubs, the Washington Senators and the Yankees.
        Mr. Long's record was tied by Don Mattingly of the Yankees in 1987.
        Mr. Long is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two sons, Dale Jr. and Jonny.
