        Allan Temko, a former architecture critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, who won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism in 1990 and wrote a definitive profile of the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, died on Wednesday in Orinda, Calif. He was 81.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Temko was the architecture critic for The Chronicle from 1961 to 1993. His book ''Notre Dame of Paris'' (Viking, 1955) was most recently issued in paperback by Textbook Publishers in 2003.
        Raised in Weehawken, N.J., Allan Bernard Temko served as a Navy officer in World War II and graduated from Columbia with the class of 1947. He continued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and at the Sorbonne.
        He taught city planning and social sciences at Berkeley and was a professor at California State University, Hayward, from 1971 to 1980. He left The Chronicle briefly in the 1970's to teach and write for magazines.
        Mr. Temko is survived by a daughter, Susannah Temko of Berkeley; a son, Alexander, of Pittsburgh; a brother, Stanley, of Washington; and two grandchildren.
