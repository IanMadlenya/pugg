        Dr. W. Wallace Lozier, a physicist who helped the Union Carbide Corporation win an Oscar in the 1950's with his work on lighting techniques, died on Oct. 9 at a nursing home in Bay Village, Ohio. He was 87 and, until last year, lived in Rocky River, Ohio.
        The cause was a series of strokes, said his son, Dr. John W. Lozier.
        The elder Dr. Lozier helped to develop the lights that made color films possible in the 1940's and 1950's. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences paid formal tribute to those efforts in 1955 with an Oscar for his contribution to color photography.
        Born in Humboldt, a farm village in Illinois, he graduated from DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He received a Ph.D. in 1931 at the University of Minnesota,
        Dr. Lozier continued his research at Princeton, taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and worked on mass spectrograph design under Harold Urey and Edward Condon at Columbia University. Finding academic salaries during the Depression too scanty to raise a family, he went to work for Union Carbide in 1936 and devoted his career to the field of high-intensity light and arc physics.
        He worked at company laboratories in Ohio and played an important role in putting the results to scientific and commercial use. His many publications and patents described improved lighting for movie projection, the measurement of brightness, temperature and color spectrum of carbon arcs, among other things.
        Dr. Lozier formally retired in 1971 but continued to work for another decade finishing research projects and publishing the result.
        Besides his son, a resident of Bethany, W.Va., he is survived by two grandsons.
