        Philip Price, retired senior partner of Dechert Price & Rhoades, a Philadelphia law firm, died in his sleep May 9 at his home in Chestnut Hill, Pa. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Price, who specialized in litigation, practiced law with his father initially. In 1928 he joined the law firm of Barnes, Brinton & Biddle. The successor to that firm merged with Dechert, Smith & Clark and later became Dechert Price & Rhoades. Mr. Price was a senior partner from 1942 until he retired in 1970.
        One of his most celebrated cases was an antitrust suit brought by Noerr Motor Freight, a trucking company, against almost all of the railroads in the eastern United States. Mr. Price tried the case for the railroads and argued it successfully before the Supreme Court.
        He was born in Philadelphia and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and its law school.
        Mr. Price is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Meade Harrison; three daughters, Sarah Parker of Rye, N.Y., Evelyn Scott of Wilmington, Del., and Nancy Hiestand of Villanova, Pa.; two sons, John S. of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Philip Jr. of Philadelphia; 17 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.
