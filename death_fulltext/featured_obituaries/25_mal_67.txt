        Roy Peratrovich, a leader in battling discrimination against Alaskan natives, died Tuesday. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Peratrovich, whose father was of Yugoslav descent and whose mother was a Tlingit Indian, worked as a fisherman, boat captain and trapper in his hometown of Klawock.
        In 1940 he was elected grand president of the Alaska Native Brotherhood. He moved to Juneau with his wife, Elizabeth, who was grand president of the Alaska Native Sisterhood. The couple, seeing businesses with signs banning natives in Juneau, helped to win passage of an antidiscrimination bill by Alaska's Territorial Legislature in 1945.
        Mr. Peratrovich later joined the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, becoming superintendent of the Anchorage office.
