        From 1969 to 1980 he worked for Goldman, Sachs & Company, where he was a general partner and vice president of corporate finance. He began his career in 1964 at Morgan Guaranty Trust, where he became an assistant treasurer. He was also a director on the boards of 10 companies.
        His marriage to the former Marion Beardsley ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his mother, Valerie, of Jupiter, Fla.; his wife, the former Andrea Henderson; two daughters, Lisa, of Manhattan and Jenny, of Chicago, and a brother, Richard of Southport, Conn.
