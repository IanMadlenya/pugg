        Wilfred Lewis Warren, a British expert on King John of England, the widely opposed ruler who was forced in 1215 to sign Magna Carta, the best-known document in British constitutional history, died on July 9 near Belfast, Northern Ireland. He was 64.
        The cause was cancer, The Times of London said.
        Professor Warren, a longtime teacher at Queen's University in Belfast, wrote the 1961 biography "King John," which has been praised as wise and penetrating.
        It was after King John's barons rose against him that he was obliged to issue Magna Carta, a charter that limited the powers of the king and established citizens' rights under the law.
        Professor Warren's view was that King John was less diabolical than he has been portrayed and "had the mental abilities of a great king but the inclinations of a petty tyrant."
