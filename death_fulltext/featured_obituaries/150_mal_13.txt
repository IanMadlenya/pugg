        Dennis Brown, a popular and prolific Jamaican reggae singer, died on Thursday at University Hospital in Kingston, Jamaica. He was 42.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said a spokesman for Heartbeat Records, which has released several of Mr. Brown's albums.
        Born in Kingston, Mr. Brown had already perfected his sweet singing style and had his first reggae hit by the time he was 12, with the single ''No Man Is an Island,'' recorded at Studio One. He soon began branching out, working with producers like Winston (Niney) Holness and Joe Gibbs, with whom he recorded many of his most popular songs.
        Known for his gentle, beseeching voice -- one of the best of his generation -- he mixed soulful love songs with universal pleas calling for peace and harmony. As reggae trends changed from lovers' rock to dance-hall to digital music, Mr. Brown floated easily into each new style. His many hits included ''Westbound Train,'' ''Baby Don't Do It,'' ''Ghetto Girl'' and ''The Look of Love.''
        He had several hits in Britain, including ''Money in My Pocket,'' and in the early 1980's signed with A & M Records and lived for several years in London. Nicknamed ''Emmanuel, the Crown Prince of Reggae,'' Mr. Brown recorded more than 50 albums. This year alone he had already released three records, with a fourth on the way, each one for a different independent label. He was nominated for a Grammy Award for his album ''Light My Fire,'' released in 1994.
        ''I was once young and now I'm old,'' he sings on one of his albums from this year, ''Bless Me Jah.'' ''And through all the changes in life, mankind has grown cold/Where is the love and happiness that we ought to share?''
        He is survived by his wife, Yvonne, and 13 children, according to Radio Jamaica.
