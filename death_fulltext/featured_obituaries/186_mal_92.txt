        India's vice president, Krishan Kant, who fought against both British rule and Indira Gandhi's suspension of democracy, in 1975, died today, just short of the end of his term. He was 75.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said a spokesman for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, where Mr. Kant was pronounced dead.
        A scientist by training and a Socialist by bent, Mr. Kant was known as a champion of civil liberties. In the 1940's, he was jailed, along with his father and grandfather, during the Quit India movement. In the 1970's, he was ejected from the governing Congress Party after challenging the state of emergency imposed by Mrs. Gandhi.
        Mr. Kant was born in Punjab on Feb. 28, 1927, to parents who were active in fighting British rule. He worked as a scientist before entering the upper house of Parliament in 1966. He became part of a group of vocal young Congress members who tried to steer the party to the left.
        He was an advocate of land reform and an early critic of corruption in politics. He spent 30 years pushing for electoral reform.
        After leaving the Congress Party, he joined the Janata Party and was elected to Parliament in 1977.
        He later served for nine years as governor of the state of Andhra Pradesh, where he and his wife, Suman Kant, a social worker and an activist, fought for antiliquor laws in the state. She survives him, as do two sons, a daughter, and his mother.
        Mr. Kant, whose term as vice president was scheduled to end next month, was a staunch proponent of India's development of nuclear weapons. He had been among the governing coalition's top choices for the presidency last month, but was ultimately passed over in favor of another champion of nuclear weapons, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
        Mr. Kalam was sworn in as president on Thursday, with Mr. Kant reading the Hindi translation of his speech.
