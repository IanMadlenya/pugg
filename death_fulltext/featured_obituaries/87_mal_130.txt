        Lorenzo Bianco Schlick, a dancer whose stage name was Larry Bianco, died on March 16 at his home in Brooklyn. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Schlick studied ballet in New York City and made Russian and character dancing his specialty. He performed in the original Broadway production of "Fiddler on the Roof" with Zero Mostel, and in the movie version and the 1980 Broadway revival. He also danced with the International Dance Ensemble, the Volga Ensemble and other companies.
        Mr. Schlick is survived by his wife, Nancy Reisner Schlick; his mother, Pamela Bianco of Manhattan; and three stepchildren, Carla Schiffmann of Houston, Robert Schiffmann Jr. of Brooklyn and Erica Payne of Stroudsburg, Pa.
