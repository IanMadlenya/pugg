        Lee Adrien Lescaze, the weekend editor of The Wall Street Journal and a former assistant managing editor of The Washington Post, died Friday night at his home in Greenwich Village. He was 57.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Lynn Darling, a senior writer at Esquire magazine.
        Mr. Lescaze was born in Manhattan and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University.
        He joined The Washington Post as a copyboy in 1963 and went on to be a reporter and an editor on the foreign desk. He was The Post's foreign editor in  1973 and 1974 and its national editor from 1975 to 1977. After reporting from New York and then the White House, he was The Post's assistant managing editor in charge of its Style section.
        In 1983 he joined The Wall Street Journal and became foreign editor in 1989 and weekend editor in 1994.
        His 1967 marriage to Rebecca Giraud Hughes ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Darling, he is survived by three daughters, Alexandra Lescaze of Chapel Hill, N.C., Miranda Lescaze of Burlington, Vt., and Zoe Eliza Lescaze of Manhattan.
