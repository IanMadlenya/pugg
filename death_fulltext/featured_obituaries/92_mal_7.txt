        Dr. Samuel Aaron Hale, a family physician practicing in the Bronx for more than 40 years, died on Aug. 13 in St. Luke's Hospital. He was 83 and lived on the Upper West Side in Manhattan.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Dr. Hale was a native of Brooklyn.  He graduated from Long Island University and earned his medical degree in Scotland, where he studied in Edinburgh and Glasgow. He interned at St. Peter's Hospital in Brooklyn.
        In World War II, he was a captain in the United States Army Medical Corps and worked at field hospitals in Europe.
        After the war he opened a general practice on Westchester Avenue and tended to the poor as that section of the southeast Bronx deteriorated. He retired about four years ago.
        Dr. Hale is survived by his wife of 46 years, Jeanne Hermann Hale; a daughter, Stephanie A. Hale-Weiss of Silver Spring, Md., and two grandchildren.
