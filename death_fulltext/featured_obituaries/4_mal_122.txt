        Alvin C. Eurich, an educator who was the first president of the State University of New York, died Wednesday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 84 years old.
        He was the founder and chairman, until his death, of the Academy for Educational Development, a nonprofit organization that undertakes projects in education, health and other fields here and abroad. Since its founding in 1961, its projects have ranged from combating infant dehydration in rural populations overseas to trying to lower New York City's school dropout rate.
        Dr. Eurich was executive director of the Ford Foundation's educational division from 1958 to 1964.
        As the first president of the State University, in 1949, he was assigned to bring together 32 state-supported colleges under a single state university system. He left after two years, when the job of vice president of the Ford Fund for the Advancement of Education was offered.
        Dr. Eurich was born in Bay City, Mich., and studied psychology at North Central College, the University of Maine and the University of Minnesota, where he earned his doctorate in 1929.
        He became a vice president at Stanford University in 1944 and was named acting president in 1948.
        Dr. Eurich was president of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies from 1963 to 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, Nell; a daughter, Juliet McDonough of Baltimore, and a son, Donald, of Marlborough, Conn.
