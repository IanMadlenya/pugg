        A native of Winston-Salem, N.C., Mr. Pratt started his dancing career in Detroit before coming to New York to work with the troupes of Eleo Pomare, Rod Rodgers and others. In addition, he won critical acclaim as a principal dancer and choreographer of his own group, the Alpha-Omega 1-7 Theatrical Dance Company.
        Over the years, he also took part in government-sponsored projects to show modern-dance programs to the residents of Harlem, with the Dancemobile, and to prison inmates.
        Mr. Pratt is survived by his mother, Sarah Collier, and stepfather, William Collier, of Detroit; a sister, Wilhelmenia Collier, and three brothers, Anthony Collier, George Allen and Frank Pratt, all of Detroit.
