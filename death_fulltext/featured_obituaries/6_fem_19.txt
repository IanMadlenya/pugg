        Natalie Hinderas, one of the first black artists to establish an important career in classical music and a pianist who played with most of the major American orchestras, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 60 years old. Ms. Hinderas was born in Oberlin, Ohio, and studied with Olga Samaroff at the Juilliard School and with Edward Steuermann at the Philadelphia Conservatory. About her New York debut in 1951, The New York Times reviewer stated ''she has imagination and personality, obviously a fine musical background, and a technique in good functioning order.''
        Ms. Hinderas went on to tour Europe and Africa on trips sponsored by the State Department; she appeared on television - she was once a guest on ''What's My Line?'' - and gave concerts throughout the United States. Her last performance was a recital in Philadelphia on May 10.
        At her death she was making plans for an concert at the Aldeburgh Festival in Britain. Upcoming dates included appearances with the New York Philharmonic in December and with the Cleveland Orchestra.
        Throughout her career, Ms. Hinderas promoted black performers and composers, among them R. Nathaniel Dett, William Grant Still, John W. Work and George Walker, whose works she recorded.
        Ms. Hinderas is survived by her mother, Leota Palmer; her husband, Lionel Monagas, and a daughter, Michele.
