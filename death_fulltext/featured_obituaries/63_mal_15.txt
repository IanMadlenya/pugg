        John J. Feketie, the executive in charge of labor relations for the construction and operation of the Meadowlands racetrack and stadium, died on March 25 at his home in South Orange, N.J. He was 67 years old.
        He died after suffering a heart attack, his family said.
        Before working at the Meadowlands, Mr. Feketie served 23 years as the employee relations director of Cerro Corporation, an international mining company based in Manhattan.
        He joined the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority in 1975 as the director of personnel and labor relations during the three-year construction and continued working there after the complex opened until his retirement in 1990. He was credited with helping keep labor peace with the many unions working there.
        After leaving the Meadowlands, he worked as a lobbyist for the New Jersey and New York State Laborers Political Action Committee.
        Born in Newark, he served as a sergeant with the U.S. Marines in the South Pacific during World War II, and after the war, in 1948, he graduated from Seton Hall College.
        Surviving are his wife of nearly 43 years, the former Mary Garneau; four daughters, Mary F. Preston of Basking Ridge, N.J., Cynthia A. Feketie of South Orange, Susan F. Smith of Djursholm, Sweden, and Kathryn F. Freeman of Haddonfield, N.J.; a son, J. Peter, of Plymouth, Minn.; his mother, Mary C., of Plainfield, N.J.; a brother, Michael J., of Rahway, N.J.; a sister, Mary F. Watson of Islip, L.I., and seven grandchildren.
