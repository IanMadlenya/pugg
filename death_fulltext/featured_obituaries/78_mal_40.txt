        Thomas D. Clareson, a scholar of science fiction who recently retired as a professor of English at the College of Wooster, died on Tuesday at Wooster Community Hospital in Ohio. He was 66 and lived in Wooster.
        The cause has not been determined, said Wes Tree, a spokesman for the college.
        Mr. Clareson was the author of "Science Fiction in America, 1870's-1930's: An Annotated Bibliography of Primary Sources" (Greenwood Press, 1984), a standard reference in the field. It was included on the list of outstanding books for 1984 compiled by Choice magazine, a publication of the Association of College and Research Libraries.
        At the time, Mr. Clareson said, "For years I've tried to show that science fiction is a form of American popular literature which has a long tradition and, as a kind of fantasy, has an importance equal to that of the realistic social novel." Award for Book
        In 1987, he received the Eaton Award from the University of California at Riverside for his book, "Some Kind of Paradise: The Emergence of American Science Fiction" (Greenwood Press, 1986).
        At Wooster's commencement ceremony in May, when his retirement was announced, Mr. Clareson was recognized for 38 years of teaching. He joined the faculty in 1955. Besides science fiction, he specialized in 19th century American literature and the English and American novel.
        He was born in Austin, Minn., and graduated from the University of Minnesota. He received his master's degree from Indiana University in 1949 and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1956.
        Surviving are his wife, Alice, and a son, Thomas, of Richardson, Tex.
