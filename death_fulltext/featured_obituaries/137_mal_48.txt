        Rear Adm. Russell Randolph Waesche Jr., a retired Coast Guard commander and transportation executive in the Midwest, died on May 28 at his home in Leawood, Kan. He was 84.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Admiral Waesche was born in Thurmont, Md., the son of a future Commandant of the Coast Guard. It was in 1936, the same year that Admiral Waesche graduated from the Coast Guard Academy at New London, Conn., that his father became Commandant, a position that he held until 1945.
        The son served in the Pacific and on convoy duty in the Atlantic in World War II. He later commanded Coast Guard stations in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Washington, Seattle, New Orleans and St. Louis.
        After retiring from the service in 1971 he was the regional representative of the Department of Transportation for Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska for six years. He retired in 1988 as executive director of the Missouri and Kansas Public Transit Associations.
        Admiral Waesche's wife of 60 years, Janet Thorn Waesche, died last summer. He is survived by three daughters, Judith Romero of Arlington, Tex., Marilla Pivonka of Mill Valley, Calif., and Jillian Seaton of Wichita, Kan.; a son, Russell R. 3d of Williamsburg, Ky; four grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
