        Temple Hoyne Buell, an architect, developer and philanthropist, died Friday at his home in Denver. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Buell, a graduate of the University of Illinois, began his career with the Chicago architectural firm of Marshall and Fox, which designed many of the city's major hotels. He then joined Rapp and Rapp, which built theaters and vaudeville houses.
        He formed Buell and Company, one of whose major projects was the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. Mr. Buell bought the site, which was swampland and garbage fill, and transformed it in 1949 into what was then the new concept of a regional shopping center.
        Among his major gifts to universities was a $25 million endowment trust to Colorado Women's College in Denver in 1966 and $5 million to Columbia University in New York in 1983 to establish a center for American architecture.
        He is survived by a son, Temple Jr., of Santa Barbara, Calif; three daughters, Beverly Moore of Denver, Callae Gilman of Denver and Marjorie Groos of Santa Fe, N.M., and 11 grandchildren.

        An obituary by The Associated Press on Tuesday about Temple H. Buell, a Denver architect and developer, referred incompletely to a philanthropic venture. In the 1960's Mr. Buell announced a $25 million donation to Colorado Women's College, which renamed itself Temple Buell College. The money was to be presented posthumously, but other donors, apparently unaware of this, stopped contributions. The trustees decided to refuse the gift and resumed the old name. The college was eventually dissolved because of financial problems.
