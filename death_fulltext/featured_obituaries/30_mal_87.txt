        Jacques Marsal, who as a boy discovered the prehistoric paintings of the Lascaux cave with three friends and became the cave's guardian for life, died Saturday after a long illness. He was 63 years old.
        On Sept. 12, 1940, the 14-year-old boy and his friends were playing in an oak forest outside the village of Lascaux in southwestern France when their dog disappeared in a hole. The boys explored the hole the next day and found a vast cave, its walls decorated with colorful paintings of leaping stags, buffalo and prehistoric horses. Archeologists said the paintings dated to about 14,000 B.C.
