        What began as a treat for neighborhood children in 1949 turned into a big business, with Mr. Baden shipping millions of cinnamon toothpicks around the world.
        Mr. Baden closed his drugstore, the Cozy Corner, in 1962 but continued producing cinnamon toothpicks at a plant in Independence until his retirement eight years ago.
