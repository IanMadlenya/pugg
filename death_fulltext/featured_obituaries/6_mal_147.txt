        A 38-year-old man who suffered from AIDS died less than a week after he was flown back to the United States from China in an Air Force jet, a hospital spokesman said today.
        The man, Brent Anderson, died of cardio-pulmonary arrest Saturday, according to the spokesman, David Crawford.
        Mr. Anderson had been brought to the hospital July 19 after he was diagnosed in China as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome. His family asked the United States Government for help in transporting him home after commercial airlines refused to take him. The Air Force flew Mr. Anderson to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
        He was brought to Columbus at the request of his family in the suburb of Upper Arlington.
