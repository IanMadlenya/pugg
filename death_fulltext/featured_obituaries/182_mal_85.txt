        Dause L. Bibby, an executive who spent more than 40 years in the emerging fields of electronics and technology, died March 14 at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 90.
        The cause was complications after pneumonia, his son, Douglas, said. Mr. Bibby held posts at companies like Stromberg-Carlson, a telecommunications equipment maker; Sperry Rand, an early commercial computer developer; and I.B.M.
        He joined Stromberg-Carlson in Rochester in 1964, then a division of the General Dynamics Corporation, as president and became chairman and chief executive in 1973. He retired as chairman in 1976.
        Before working at Stromberg-Carlson, Mr. Bibby worked at Sperry Rand in New York, which later merged with the Burroughs Corporation to form the Unisys Corporation. He joined the Remington Rand division of Sperry Rand in 1959 and served as executive vice president and then president before serving as vice president and director of Sperry Rand.
        Mr. Bibby began his career at I.B.M., which he joined in 1934; he was a vice president from 1949 to 1956. During World War II, he served as a lieutenant in the Navy. After leaving I.B.M., he spent about four years at Daystrom Inc., which made build-it-yourself electronics kits.
        Dause Leveridge Bibby was born June 7, 1911, in Cisco, Tex. He graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 1933 with a degree in business administration.
        In addition to his son, of Bethesda, Md., Mr. Bibby, is survived by two daughters, Carolyn Schwartz of Palo Alto, Calif., and Martha Miles of Elkton, Md.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren; as well as his stepdaughter, Nancy Bean, of Birmingham, Ala., her two sons and her five grandchildren.
