        Carlisle H. Humelsine, former chairman of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, died of heart disease Wednesday at Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. He was 73 years old and lived in Williamsburg.
        Mr. Humelsine, who from 1973 to 1980 was also chairman of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, went to Williamsburg after seven years at the State Department, where he served as either deputy under secretary or assistant secretary to four Secretaries of State: James F. Byrnes, George C. Marshall, Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles. He had served in World War II as an assistant to General Marshall, who was then Army Chief of Staff.
        He resigned from the State Department in 1953 and joined Colonial Williamsburg, the restoration of the capital of colonial Virginia, as executive vice president. He became president of the foundation in 1958 and chairman in 1977, and retired in 1985. Under his leadership, Colonial Williamsburg increased attendance and widened the support it receives from philanthropies.
        Mr. Humelsine, born in Hagerstown, Md., graduated from the University of Maryland. Among posts he held at various times were chairman of the Virginia Department of Conservation, president of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, vice president and trustee of the National Gallery of Art, trustee of the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., director of the National Geographic Society and chairman of the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission.
        Surviving are his wife, Mary; two daughters, Mary Norment of Williamsburg and Barbara Humelsine of Roswell, Ga., and four grandchildren.
