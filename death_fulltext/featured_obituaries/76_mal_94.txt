        Dr. James Wilkinson Miller, a professor of philosophy and former dean of the College of William and Mary, died Wednesday at the Pines Convalescent Center in Williamsburg, Va. He was 91 and had lived at the center.
        A spokeswoman for the Pines said the cause was heart failure.
        Dr. Miller joined the faculty of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, in 1935 as a professor of philosophy and was chairman of the department of philosophy and humanities until he resigned in 1955. He served briefly as acting president of the college in 1951.
        As faculty dean from 1938 to 1946, he recruited prominent teachers and introduced topical majors, like journalism, contemporary culture and the nature and development of scientific thought. He also oversaw the college's World War II effort, including the training of Navy chaplains and the reception of European refugees.
        After leaving William and Mary, Dr. Miller was appointed MacDonald Professor of Philosophy at McGill University in Montreal, where he taught until he retired in 1970. He was chairman of the philosophy department there from 1960 to 1964.
        A native of Marquette, Mich., he was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Michigan and earned a Ph.D.  from Harvard in 1927.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Mary Cairns Miller; two sons, Elliott, of West Hartford, Conn., and David, of Sacramento, Calif, and five grandchildren.
