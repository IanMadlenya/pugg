        George M. Skurla, a former president of the Grumman Corporation who led a unit that put the finishing touches on six small spacecraft that carried the astronauts from the Apollo capsule to the moon landings, died on Sunday at Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, Fla. He lived in Satellite Beach, Fla. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from pneumonia, said his son George Jr.
        Mr. Skurla was director of operations in charge of 1,600 Grumman employees at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida from 1965 to 1970. They were responsible for assembling and testing the lunar modules used by Apollo astronauts. The Apollo 13 crew rode in a lunar module to extend its oxygen supply on the way back to Earth in 1970, after an explosion in the main spacecraft.
        An aeronautical engineer who rose through the ranks in 42 years at Grumman, Mr. Skurla joined the company in 1944 after graduating from the University of Michigan. He led the aerospace unit for 11 years until February 1985, when he became president and chief operating officer of the parent company. He retired at 65 in 1986.
        After the moon landings in the late 1960's, he returned to Grumman's headquarters in Bethpage, N.Y., as vice president for product engineering at the aerospace unit. In 1973, he became general manager of the assembly and test center at Calverton, N.Y., which produced military planes. Grumman was acquired by the Northrop Corporation in 1994.
        Mr. Skurla was born in Newark. He attended public schools there and in West Orange, N.J.
        Besides George Jr. of Woodbury, N.Y., he is survived by his wife of 51 years, Marie; and sons Thomas, James and Martin, all of Satellite Beach.
