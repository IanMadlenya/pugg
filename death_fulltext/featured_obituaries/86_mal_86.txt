        Joseph A. Barry, an American writer, journalist and critic of French culture and history, died Tuesday in Paris. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer said his son, John Christopher Barry.

        Mr. Barry worked in the Paris office of Newsweek for several years, and for several more contributed criticism and reviews to the Sunday edition of The New York Times.
        He was the executive editor of House Beautiful magazine in New York in the 1950's, and returned to Paris in 1958 to become European correspondent for the New York Post, until 1965. In recent years he also was a consultant to the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organization.
        Mr. Barry graduated from the University of Michigan.
