        Samuel O. Miller, a professor at Columbia University's School of Social Work and an author of recent studies on AIDS, died Feb. 5 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 63.
        The cause was liver disease, the university said.
        Mr. Miller, who had a private social service practice for many years, studied the delivery of social services to minority groups and was a leader in efforts to recruit students from minority groups into the profession.
        He was the co-author, with Barbara Dane, of the 1993 study "AIDS: Intervening with Hidden Grievers," which examined counseling family members and other survivors of AIDS victims. In recent years he also published articles on the disease in journals.
        He graduated from Dakota Wesleyan University and in 1959 earned a master's degree in social work from Boston University. He received his doctorate from the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration in 1970. He joined the Columbia faculty three years later and was appointed a full professor in 1992.
        Mr. Miller, director of education services at the Council on Social Work from 1979 to 1980, was a board member of the National Association of Social Workers and in 1980 received the National Institutes of Mental Health National Research Service Award.
        He is survived by a daughter, Larisa, of Austin, Tex.; a son, Mark, and a brother, Egerton, both of Brooklyn; two sisters, Ruth Springer, also of Brooklyn, and Mildred White of Balboa, Panama.
