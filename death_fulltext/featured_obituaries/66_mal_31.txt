        Arnold J. Bai, a founding member and senior partner of the Bridgeport law firm of Bai Pollock & Dunnigan, died on Friday while on vacation in Manchester, Vt. He was 61 years old and lived in Trumbull, Conn.
        Mr. Bai died of a heart attack, said his son Matthew.
        Mr. Bai's clients included the Aetna Life & Casualty and the Hartford Insurance Group, and he specialized in defending doctors in medical malpractice suits. But he was also involved in some of the most publicized events in recent Connecticut history.
        Mr. Bai was a defense lawyer for the state in lawsuits stemming from the June 28, 1983, collapse of the Mianus River Bridge on I-95 in Greenwich, Conn. He was also a defense counsel in litigation over the collapse in April 1987 of L'Ambiance Plaza, an unfinished 13-story Bridgeport apartment building, in which 28 construction workers were killed.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Bai was raised in Bridgeport and graduated from Yale University in 1953 and from Yale Law School in 1956. He was with the Bridgeport law firm of Goldstein & Peck until 1973, when he opened his own firm.
        Mr. Bai is survived by his wife, Rhea; two daughters, Carrie, of North White Plains, and Dina, of Charlottesville, Va.; a son, Matthew, of Manhattan, and a sister, Ellen Rievman, of Vail, Colo.
