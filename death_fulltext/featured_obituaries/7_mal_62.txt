        Charles Camp Cotton, a judge in the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, died Wednesday at the Greenbriar East Nursing Home here. He was 83 years old and lived in Woodbury, N.J.
        An attorney for almost 60 years, he was chairman of the Democratic Party in Gloucester County from 1933 to 1945 and served as the county prosecutor from 1940 to 1945. His son Harris Y. Cotton filled the prosecutor's post from 1975 to 1980.
        He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and Temple University Law School.
        Mr. Cotton served as a judge for Civil and Criminal Affairs at the Nuremberg trials in Germany after World War II. One of his biggest cases involved Alfred Krupp, the owner of a munitions factory who was convicted of using slave labor from the Soviet Union.
        In addition to his son Harris, he is survived by two other sons, Paul, of Milwaukee and Charles, of Woodbury; and a daughter, Mary Gail Stacey of New London, Conn.
