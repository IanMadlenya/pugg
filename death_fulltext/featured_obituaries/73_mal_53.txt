        Marvin Rushkoff, a health-care consultant and former hospital administrator, died on Thursday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 63. The cause of death was cancer, said his son, Bennett.
        Mr. Rushkoff was chief financial officer of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan from 1971 to 1989 and also its senior vice president for business and finance from 1984 to 1989.
        During his tenure at Mount Sinai, he negotiated more than $700 million worth of financing for the hospital, including the first tax-exempt variable rate bond authorized in New York.
        Mr. Rushkoff, an expert in the field of hospital financial management, wrote extensively on the subject.
        From 1989 to 1992, he was chairman of American Healthcare Management Inc., a company that operates sixteen hospitals in nine states.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Rushkoff earned a B.S. at New York University and an M.B.A. from the Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York. He later taught courses in financial management in health care at Baruch.
        Besides his son, Bennett, of Washington, Mr. Rushkoff is survived by his wife, Sheila; his mother, Sabina, of Boca Raton, Fla., and another son, Douglas, of New York City.
