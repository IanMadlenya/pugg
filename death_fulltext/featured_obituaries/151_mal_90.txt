        Harry Kahn, a retired New York investment adviser, art collector and philanthropist, died on Aug. 20 at Lenox Hill Hospital. A resident of Manhattan's Upper East Side and Truro, Mass., he was 82.
        The causes were pneumonia and congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Kahn retired in 1990 as a partner in the brokerage firm of Neuberger & Berman. He joined the firm in 1963 after 10 years as a researcher and partner in Bache & Company.
        Long a supporter of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, he served on its board until 1997. He was a founder of its Contemporary Arts Council and, at his death, was a member of the Acquisitions Committee.
        As an art collector in his own right he was widely known for the self-portraits by 20th-century American artists he gathered with his companion, Ruth Bowman, an art historian.
        Born in Manhattan, Harry Kahn graduated from Harvard College in 1937 and earned a master's in public administration from Harvard University in 1948. In between, he served in the Army and held posts in the Treasury Department and the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, he was on the staff of the Marshall Plan Administration in Washington.
        Besides Ms. Bowman, a resident of Manhattan, Mr. Kahn is survived by a daughter, Dr. Jenny Elizabeth Kaufmann of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Susan and Evelyn London of Cambridge, Mass.; and two granddaughters. His wife, Margery Guiterman Kahn, died several years ago.
