        Bill Nicholson, an outfielder with the Chicago Cubs and the Philadelphia Phillies from 1939-53 who twice led the National League in home runs and runs batted in, died last Friday of a heart attack in his home. He was 81.
        In 1943, Nicholson hit 29 home runs and drove in 128 runs while hitting .309  for the Cubs. The following year, he hit .287 and again led the league with 33 homers and 122 runs batted in. Both years, he also led the league in strikeouts, earning the nickname Swish.
        Nicholson, who finished his career with 235 homers and a .268 batting average, is survived by five stepdaughters, a stepson and three grandchildren.
