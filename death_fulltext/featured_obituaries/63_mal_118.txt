        William T. Gardner, the producing director of the Pittsburgh Public Theater for the last eight years, died on Friday at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 57 years old.
        Mr. Gardner died of a heart attack, said Rob Zellers, a spokesman for the theater.
        Mr. Gardner brought to the stage in Pittsburgh such contemporary dramas as Marsha Norman's " 'night, Mother" and John Guare's "Gardenia." He also produced the Pittsburgh premieres of two plays by the city's native son, August Wilson: "Fences" and "Joe Turner's Come and Gone." He made his own directorial debut in February with a production of Chekhov's "Three Sisters.'
        His last production, a revival of Eugene O'Neill's "A Moon for the Misbegotten," began previews last Thursday. Mr. Gardner's previous revival of this show, in Lake Forest, Ill., in 1973, starred Colleen Dewhurst and Jason Robards and went on to win four Tony Awards on Broadway.
        Before his tenure in Pittsburgh, Mr. Gardner worked with several theaters in the New York and Chicago areas, including the Adelphi Festival Theater on Long Island and the McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J.
        He is survived by a sister, Marion, of Troy, N.Y.
