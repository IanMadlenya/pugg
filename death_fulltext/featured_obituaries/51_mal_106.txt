        Owen M. Kupferschmid, a lawyer who was legal director of the Debt-for-Development Foundation in Washington, died on Tuesday at a New York Health and Racquet Club gymnasium on East 45th Street. He was 33 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        A long-distance runner, he died of a heart attack while exercising on a treadmill, his family said.
        Mr. Kupferschmid recently returned from Bolivia, where he was negotiating to obtain funds for a child-welfare project through the foundation, a group that arranges for nonprofit organizations to buy up debts of third world countries at discounted prices and channel the money into worthwhile endeavors.
        He was born in Buenos Aires and reared in Newton, Mass. He was a graduate of Amherst College, where he was co-captain of the cross-country running team, and held degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and the Boston College Law School. Active in Jewish causes, he was a board member of the American Jewish World Service.
        Mr. Kupferschmid is survived by his wife, Ruti Teitel, a professor at the New York Law School; his mother and father, Gene and Bernard, of Newton, and two brothers, David, of Berkeley, Calif., and Seth, of Manhattan.
