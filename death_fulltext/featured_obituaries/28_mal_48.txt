        U Thakin Soe, one of Burma's most prominent Communist leaders, died on Thursday after a long illness, reports said today. He was 83 years old.
        Mr. Soe was the only surviving founding member of the Communist Party in Burma, formed in 1937. He spent most of his life underground and for a time led the Red Flag, or Trotskyite, branch of the party. He was captured by Government forces in 1970 but released in a 1974 amnesty by the military Government of U Ne Win.
        After student demonstrations last year, the military Government of U Saw Maung allowed political parties and Mr. Soe became the patron of the Unity and Peace Party, which hopes to contest voting promised for next year.
