        Chung Ping Tom, a leader of the Chinatown community and a restaurateur and theater owner, died of pneumonia Thursday after surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Tom, who was born in Canton and graduated from the University of Canton, taught economics there until 1949, when he left for Macao as the Communist regime defeated the forces of Chiang Kai-Shek. He came to New York in the early 1950's and opened a restaurant, the Lotus Garden, on 14th Street. He later operated the Music Palace, a Chinese-language theater, on the Bowery.
        Mr. Tom served two separate terms as president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in the 1960's and 1970's, speaking out frequently on issues in Chinatown. He was board chairman of the Chinese Public School of New York and was an editor of China Times Weekly.
        He is survived by two sons, Judge Peter Tom of New York Civil Court, who lives in Manhattan, and John Tom of Pompton Plains, N.J.; two daughters, Mariana Chin of Paramus, N.J., and Linda Brown of Cherry Hill, N.J.; a sister, Ngun Hoy Yee of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.
