        Dr. Alfred Frazer, a specialist on the architecture of Mediterranean civilizations and a professor at Columbia University for 28 years, died on Monday at his home in Larchmont. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, said a colleague, Richard Brilliant.
        Dr. Frazer, who was a registered architect, specialized in the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome as well as the early Christian and Byzantine societies. He began his teaching career at Vassar College in 1958, joined the Columbia faculty in 1966 and served as department chairman of art history and archeology from 1972 to 1978.
        Dr. Frazer was a co-director of New York University's excavations at Samothrace, Greece, and wrote a book about the project, "Samothrace: The Propylon of Ptolemy II" (Princeton University Press, 1990). He was the co-author of "The Key Monuments of the History of Architecture" (1965).
        In 1977 Dr. Frazer was a curator of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, "Age of Spirituality: Late Antique and Early Christian Art, Third to Seventh Century."
        Over the years he also was an official of the Society of Architectural Historians and the College Art Association.
        He received a bachelor of architecture degree from Alabama Polytechnic Institute and a doctorate in architecture from New York University. He served in Italy with the United States Army from 1950 to 1952.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret Frazer, a curator emeritus at the Metropolitan Museum, and two daughters, Martha and Zoe, and a son, Andrew, all of Larchmont.
