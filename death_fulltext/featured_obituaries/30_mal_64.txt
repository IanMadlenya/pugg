        Tommy Tucker, a big-band leader of the 1940's, died Tuesday. He was 86 years old and lived in Sarasota.
        Mr. Tucker and his orchestra recorded hundreds of records and toured widely from 1936 to 1958. The orchestra's biggest hit was ''I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire.''
        Mr. Tucker, who played the piano, trumpet and trombone, was familiar to radio listeners as the host of ''Sing for Your Supper With Tommy Tucker'' and ''30 Minutes in Hollywood.'' Among his television appearances were those on Kate Smith's show and on ''Strike It Rich.''
        When the popularity of big bands began to fade, Mr. Tucker turned to a career in education. He spent 20 years teaching music at Monmouth College in West Long Branch, N.J., and he retired to Florida in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia Dare Tucker; a daughter, Trudy Dare Thomson, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and two sons, Lewis Wiley, of Boston, and Thomas Randall, of New York City.
