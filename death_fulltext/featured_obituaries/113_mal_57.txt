        Gen. Tito Okello, who briefly ruled Uganda after seizing power in a military  coup in 1985 before being toppled himself, has died, the radio reported. He was  82.
        The privately run Capital Radio station said General Okello died last Monday  night at a Roman Catholic mission hospital near Kampala. The general was hospitalized in March, but doctors have declined to disclose his illness.
        He fought with British forces in World War II and was the commander of the Ugandan Army when he ousted President Milton Obote in July 1985. Six months later, he was overthrown by Yoweri Museveni, who had waged a five-year bush war  against Mr. Obote.
        General Okello fled to the southern Sudan with the remnants of his army. He returned home in 1993 under an amnesty granted by Mr. Museveni.
