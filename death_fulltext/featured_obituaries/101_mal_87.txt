        Frank E. Beube, a philanthropist and periodontist who conducted pioneering research into the bone and tissue that hold teeth in place, died on Wednesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 90 and lived in New Rochelle, N.Y.
        A professor emeritus of dentistry at Columbia University since 1984, he helped provide funds to expand research and support facilities at the School of Dental and Oral Surgery there. In 1993, a conference room and library were dedicated to Dr. Beube and his late wife, Edith, for their work at the school.
        He joined the dental school and attending staff of the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 1930, just two years after the center opened. Over the next six decades, he taught generations of dental students, maintained a clinical practice and oversaw experiments on rebuilding lost periodontal support in the jaw.
        Beginning in 1934, he began to investigate ways to restore the alveolar bone that anchors the tooth and the periodontal ligament that holds the tooth to the bone. Through experiments on animals and clinical trials on humans, he developed substitutes for the lost alveolar bone.
        Dr. Beube was born in Kingston, Ontario. He received a degree in dentistry from the University of Toronto in 1930. He spent his entire career as a researcher, clinician and teacher at Columbia, giving lectures until last year. He was chairman of the department of periodontology from 1946 to 1969.
        He wrote the textbook "Periodontology: Diagnosis and Treatment" (Macmillian, 1952), in addition to many articles.
        Dr. Beube is survived by a son, Eric.
