        Judah Leon Stampfer, an educator, poet, novelist and translator, died on Oct. 4 at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        At his death, Mr. Stampfer was a professor of English, teaching Shakespeare and rabbinical studies at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. An ordained rabbi, he was one of the few remaining members of the original Stony Brook faculty, having joined it as an assistant professor 36 years ago.
        As a poet, he made his mark with his award-winning ''Jerusalem Has Many Faces'' (1950). It was essentially an autobiography in verse of an American who goes to Israel to help fight its Arab foes and returns to New York with a new vision of his country and himself.
        ''Saul Myers,'' his first novel, was noted for its passages of emotional power, vaudeville corn and Hasidic wisdom, all mixed together.
        Mr. Stampfer was born in Jerusalem, the son of a rabbi, and graduated from the University of Chicago. He held a master's degree in education from Columbia University, was ordained at Yeshiva University in 1947, and received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1959.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris Lanier Stampfer; a daughter, Dr. Diane Lanier Stampfer of Manhattan; a son, Louis Lanier Stampfer, also of Manhattan; and a brother, Rabbi Joshua Stampfer of Portland, Ore.
