        Jimmy Griffin, a founder of the soft-rock group Bread who helped write the Oscar-winning song ''For All We Know,'' died on Tuesday at his home in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tenn. He was 61.
        The cause was complications of cancer, family members told Country Music Television.
        James Arthur Griffin was born in Cincinnati but raised in Memphis. Dorsey and Johnny Burnette, brothers who both had pop hits in 1960 and 1961, were his neighbors and idols. The Burnettes had moved to Los Angeles when Mr. Griffin visited them in 1962, and he quickly secured a recording contract of his own with Frank Sinatra's Reprise Records.
        In 1963 he released an album of cover tunes, ''Summer Holiday,'' and in 1965 he played Private Dexter in the film ''None but the Brave,'' which Sinatra directed.
        Bread was originally a trio with David Gates, Robb Royer and Mr. Griffin. Mike Botts joined for the second album, which included the No.1 Billboard single ''Make It With You'' (1970). Mr. Griffin and Mr. Royer teamed with Fred Karlin to write ''For All We Know'' for the film ''Lovers and Other Strangers.'' It won the 1970 Academy Award for best song.
        Despite 10 Top 20 hits, tensions in Bread led to a first breakup in 1973 and a final, litigious dissolution in 1978. Mr. Griffin later worked in the trios Black Tie and the Remingtons.
        He is survived by his wife, Marti; a daughter, Alexis; and a son, Jacob.
