        Dr. Vance Lewis Sailor, a nuclear physicist and expert in reactor safety who retired from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, died on May 11 on the way to Stony Brook University Hospital. He was 76 and lived in East Patchogue, N.Y.
        The cause was an aneurysm that he suffered while working on his sailboat, said his daughter, Nancy Gottlieb of Hartsdale, N.Y.
        Dr. Sailor joined the Brookhaven staff in 1949, the year he received his Ph.D. in physics from Yale University. He retired as a senior physicist in 1985 but remained a consultant on nuclear power plant safety until two years ago.
        A native of Springfield, Mo., he graduated from DePauw University and received a certificate in meteorology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was commissioned into the Army Air Force in World War II, serving as a meteorologist in Africa and the Middle East.
        He was a member of the team that started the laboratory's graphite research reactor in 1950 and was an adviser on nuclear projects for the United Nations. As his final official contribution at Brookhaven, he helped write a report, ''Cost-Benefit Considerations in Regulatory Analysis,'' which the laboratory submitted to the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1995.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Marguerite Erdman Sailor; two sons, Richard W., of Belmont, Mass., and John K., of Wayland, Mass.; a sister, Mary Lou Walbridge of Gladstone, Mich., and three grandchildren.
