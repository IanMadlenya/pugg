        Stan Szelest, a rock pianist who toured with Neil Young, Jackson Browne and Graham Nash, died on Sunday. He was 48 years old.
        Mr. Szelest was in Woodstock recording an album with Levon Helm, Rick Danko and Garth Hudson when he had a heart attack.
        He played for more than 30 years in Stan and the Ravens, a band popular in western New York, perfecting a blues-based style that he worked to pass on to several aspiring musicians.
        After forming Stan and the Ravens in 1958, Mr. Szelest took time out to work with Lonnie Mack and the Hawks. The Hawks later backed Bob Dylan and became famous as the Band. Mr. Szelest recorded with Roy Buchanan, Mack, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jesse Ed Davis, Delbert McClinton and Northern Lights.
