        Carl W. A. Schurmann, a former Dutch representative at the United Nations and Ambassador to Washington, died on Friday at his home in Geneva. He was 91.
        A latecomer to diplomacy, Mr. Schurmann showed a talent for reconciling conflicting opinions while fostering an atmosphere of congeniality.
        Working quietly but persuasively in small, informal groups, he played a crucial role in United Nations resolutions on nuclear disarmament and in a 1962 agreement to transfer Netherlands New Guinea to Indonesia.
        He headed the Dutch mission to the United Nations from 1955 to 1964, then served as Ambassador to the United States until 1969. He returned to Manhattan to direct the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control for a few years before retiring in Geneva. Born in Rotterdam
        Carl Willem Alwin was born in Rotterdam in 1903. He was educated in The Hague and Sweden and studied law in Leiden and London and joined his father's practice in Rotterdam in 1924.
        In the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in World War II, he worked in London as a representative of a Dutch court trying offenses committed at sea. He also volunteered as an air-raid warden during the Blitz.
        He became a bona fide diplomat in 1946, when he was named counselor in the Dutch Embassy in Warsaw. After postings in Thailand and Indonesia, he returned home to head the Indonesian desk in the Foreign Ministry. In 1955 he arrived in New York as the Dutch representative at the United Nations.
        As his influence widened he presided over the organization's Economic and Social Council and was elected chairman of its political committee, where he became the confidant of prominent delegates from every continent.
        Mr. Schurmann is survived by his wife of over 50 years, Brook Pack Schurmann; a daughter, Wendela Schurmann of Fernay, France; three sons, Eric of Dully, Switzerland, Steven of Geneva, and David of Toronto; and one grandson.
