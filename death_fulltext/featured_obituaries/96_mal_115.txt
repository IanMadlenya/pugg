        J. Edgar Joseph, the head of the costume department at New York City Opera for 35 years, died on Jan. 12 at Sharp-Cabrillo Hospital in San Diego. He was 81 and lived in San Diego.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said Susan Woelzl, the publicity director at the New York City Opera.
        Mr. Joseph was born in New Jersey and began his career in 1943 in the wardrobe department of the Shubert Organization in New York City. He became head of costumes at City Opera in 1955 and kept that title until his retirement in 1980. During that time, he supervised the creation of costumes for many of the company's most famous productions, including "Giulio Cesare," with Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle; "Don Rodrigo," with Placido Domingo; "Roberto Devereux"; "Maria Stuarda," and "Anna Bolena."
        He was a founder of the New York City Opera Alumni Association and an organizer of the company's 50th-anniversary alumni celebration in 1994.
        He is survived by a sister, Camilla M. Joseph of Carbondale, Ill.
