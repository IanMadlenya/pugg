        Edwin E. Hartrich, a journalist and author who wrote about West Germany's economic recovery after World War II, died last Friday at Hines Hospital in Maywood, Ill., near Chicago. He was 82.
        Mr. Hartrich, who lived in Orland Park, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, suffered a long illness, his family said.
        A Chicago native, Mr. Hartrich was a White House reporter for The Chicago News in President Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term, and spent much of the next three decades reporting for newspapers and radio in Europe and the Far East. He returned to Chicago in 1967 and wrote two books published by Macmillan.
        In "The Fourth and Richest Reich" (1980), he traced West Germany's postwar rise to become Europe's strongest economic power. In "The American Opportunity" (1983), he argued that economic strength, not military might, would be the foundation of a nation's international influence.
        Mr. Hartrich was a reporter and editor for the Paris edition of The New York Herald Tribune in the late 1930's. He also worked for CBS radio and was a Far East correspondent for NBC and a correspondent in Germany for The Wall Street Journal.
        He is survived by his wife, Loretta McLaughlin Hartrich; four sons, Timothy and Anthony, both of Seattle, Peter, of Fort Gordon, Ga., and Michael, of Santa Cruz, Calif.; a daughter, Maria T. Hartrich of Chicago; a brother, Nelson, also of Chicago, and a granddaughter.
