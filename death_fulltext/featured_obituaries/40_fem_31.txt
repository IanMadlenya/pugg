        Betti S. Whaley, president of the Washington Urban League and a former commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development, died of the effects of diabetes and septicemia on Sunday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 60 years old and lived in Washington.
        Mrs. Whaley, also a former deputy assistant secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, had been head of the Washington Urban League since 1983.
        From 1974 to 1976 she was commissioner of the Agency for Child Development. Her tenure was stormy, marked by accusations of fiscal mismanagement that led to her resignation.
        Mrs. Whaley was born in Baltimore and received bachelor's and master's degrees in social work from Ohio State University.
        Long Association With League
        In 1953 she became associate executive director of the Columbus (Ohio) Urban League, beginning an association that spanned 37 years.
        After serving as director of community development programs at the New York headquarters of the nonpartisan civil-rights organization, Mrs. Whaley was appointed to the Agency for Child Development post.
        She moved to Washington in the late 1970's and was a Congressional aide before taking the H.U.D. post. Afterward she returned to the Urban League as the first woman to head its Washington branch.
        In Washington she was active in many civic groups, including the District of Columbia Committee on Public Education, the district's Apprenticeship Council, its Baseball Commission and its Commission on Budget and Financial Priorities.
        She is survived by her husband, A. Jackson Whaley.
