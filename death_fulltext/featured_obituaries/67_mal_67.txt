        Richard Francis Walsh, a former president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, which he led for 33 years, died on Thursday at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Freeport, L.I. He lived in Baldwin, L.I. and was 92 years old.
        The union, which reported his death on Friday, said it came after a brief illness.
        Mr. Walsh, who set out in 1917 as an apprentice electrician at the Fifth Avenue Theater in Brooklyn, was elected the international president of the union in 1941 and was re-elected to represent its approximately 50,000 members through 1974. For part of that period, starting in 1955, he also served as a member of the executive council of the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        He was elected president of I.A.T.S.E. Stage Employes Local No. 4 Brooklyn in 1925 and remained in that post through 1959.
        He was a past president of the Inter-American Federation of Entertainment Workers, board chairman of the Will Rogers Memorial Hospital, and a director of the Union Labor Life Insurance Company and the Council of Motion Picture Organizations.
        Mr. Walsh is survived by two sisters, Gertrude Lindquist, also of Baldwin, and Katherine Malloy, a resident of Pennsylvania.
