        Herb Scharfman, a sports photographer for International News Photos and Sports Illustrated, died last Saturday in Scottsdale (Ariz.) Memorial Hospital. He was 86.
        Mr. Scharfman, a native of Chicago, was a motorcycle messenger for International News Photos in New York and took pictures for fun with a Speed Graphic camera. In 1939, when a photo editor asked him if he owned a suit, he quickly dressed up, went to Ebbets Field for a game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies, and began a 44-year career.
        Over the years, he befriended such baseball players as Jackie Robinson, Joe DiMaggio, Sandy Koufax and Ralph Branca. He took a memorable photograph of Rocky Marciano landing the punch that ended Jersey Joe Walcott's boxing career.
        When International News Photos went out of business, he joined Sports Illustrated, trading his Speed Graphic for a new 35-millimeter camera.
        Mr. Scharfman, a member of the New York Sports Fall of Fame, retired from Sports Illustrated in 1983 and moved to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and, a year ago, to Scottsdale.
        He is survived by his wife, Hannah; two daughters, Loretta Kamito of Scottsdale and Rebecca Salup of Roslyn, N.Y.; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
