        Thomas James Prisco, a former metal worker and union chief who turned to social work to help children with handicaps as well as drug and alcohol abusers, died on Jan. 3 in St. Vincent's Hospital in West Brighton, S.I. He was 77 and lived in Dongan Hills, S.I.
        The cause was heart failure after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Prisco, who was born in Rosebank, S.I., worked in the metal trades and was president of a metalworkers' local when he became associated with Harry Van Arsdale, president of the Central Labor Council of New York. He dealt with employers to promote the chances of handicapped workers.
        Mr. Prisco's own life turned as a son, Thomas, born in 1950 with Down syndrome, grew to boyhood. Mr. Prisco founded the Exceptional Children's Social Club, a nonprofit organization based in Staten Island for retarded youths and adults.
        He also started a 28-year association with the Central Labor Rehabilitation Council, a 1968 offshoot of the larger labor group. He became its director of outreach programs for drug abusers and alcoholics and remained director until last year.
        He was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Mental Retardation for the State of New York and the city's Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Service Committee.
        In addition to Thomas, of Willowbrook, S.I., Mr. Prisco is survived by another son, Philip, of West Brighton; five sisters, Bridget Gagliardi of Grasmere, S.I., and Ann Rumolo, Anna DePalma, Theresa Scaramuzzo and Mildred Allotta of Rosebank, and two grandsons.
