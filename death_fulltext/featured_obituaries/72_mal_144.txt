        Walter Carlson, a retired New York public-relations executive and former journalist, died on Saturday in San Antonio. He was 64 and a resident of Manhattan.
        His family said he died of cancer and had gone to Texas for therapy.
        Mr. Carlson, a native of Brooklyn, served in the Navy in World War II and in the Korean War and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1952. In the same year, he began a 14-year career at The New York Times.
        He became a reporter and editor both in New York and Los Angeles. Returning to New York, he wrote the paper's daily advertising column for two years before joining Ted Bates & Company in 1966 to take charge of that agency's public relations.
        In 1971, he was a co-founder of the public-relations firm of Whipple & Carlson Associates, later Carlson Associates. In the 1980's, he was senior vice president and public-relations director at Omnicom Group, the advertising conglomerate on Madison Avenue. His last full-time position was public affairs officer for the Partnership for a Drug-Free America in 1988 and 1989.
        He continued to work as a freelance consultant and writer. At the time of his death, he was working on a history of McCann-Erickson, the advertising concern.
        Mr. Carlson is survived by his sister, Mabel Meier of Port Washington, L.I.
