        George W. Dudley Jr., an artist who founded a greeting card company and was active in gay and AIDS causes, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 41 and resided in Manhattan.
        He died of complications of AIDS, said Norbert Sinski, his companion.
        Mr. Dudley was a photographer and water-color painter whose works reflected his Southern roots as well as urban themes and were exhibited in several commercial galleries and museums.
        He founded and was president of the American Postcard Company, which makes nostalgic and humorous cards that are sold internationally. Some of the cards stirred controversy for their political satire.
        Mr. Dudley helped organize and became the director of the Leslie-Loman Gay Art Foundation in Manhattan and also founded the Night of 1,000 Gowns, an annual fund-raising event for AIDS organizations.
        Mr. Dudley was born in Hobbs, N.M., and grew up in Columbus, Ga.
        Besides Mr. Sinski, his survivors include his parents, George and Wilda Dudley, of Columbus, and two sisters, Nancy Gordy of Columbus and Anne Lee of Birmingham, Ala.
