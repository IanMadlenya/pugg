        Born Charles Bruce Gould in Luana, Iowa, Mr. Gould was a graduate of the University of Iowa. In World War I he served in the Navy Flying Corps.
        Mr. Gould came to New York in the early 1920's hoping to become a playwright but instead found work in journalism, working as a newspaper reporter for The Sun, literary and aviation editor of The New York Post and drama editor of The Wall Street News. He married Beatrice Blackmar in 1923 while she was on the staff of The New York World.

        He also wrote two books on aviation, ''Sky Larking: the Romantic Adventure of Flying,'' published by Liveright in 1929, and ''The Flying Dutchman: the Life of Anthony Fokker,'' published by Holt in 1931. Both were written with Mr. Fokker. Mr. and Mrs. Gould also wrote an autobiography, ''American Story,'' published in 1968 by Harper.
        Mr. Gould is survived by a daughter, Sesaly Krafft of Federalsburg, Md.; a sister, Ruth Heisey of Des Moines; five grandchildren, and three great-granddaughters.
