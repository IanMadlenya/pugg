        Willie Wells, a shortstop who batted .358 over his career in the Negro leagues from 1924-45 but never played in the major leagues, died last Sunday. He was 82 years old.
        Nicknamed Devil because of his relentless style, he played during the period before 1947, when blacks were not allowed in the major leagues. He is credited with helping coach such future black major leaguers as Jackie Robinson, Monte Irvin, Larry Doby, Don Newcombe and Ernie Banks.
        Mr. Wells was not among the 11 players from the Negro leagues who have been inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mr. Irvin once called him the ''greatest living shortshop not in the Hall of Fame.''
        He hit 111 career home runs, including 27 in the 88-game season in 1926, a Negro leagues record at the time. That season, in response to pitchers throwing close to his head, he batted with a miner's hard hat with the gas jet removed, a forerunner of today's batting helmet.
        He is survived by a son, Willie Jr.; a daughter, Stella, and a brother, Nathaniel Wells, of San Mateo, Calif.
