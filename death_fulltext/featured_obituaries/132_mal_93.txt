        Jack Amsterdam, a manufacturer of electrical equipment and a philanthropist, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 91 and had residences in Ossining, N.Y., and Manhattan.
        At his death, Mr. Amsterdam was the board chairman of Leviton Manufacturing, based in Little Neck, N.Y., which he helped build into a leading maker of wiring devices. He began his career with the company in 1933 and became chairman in 1965 after the death of his father-in-law, the company's founder, Isidor Leviton.
        He was born in Brooklyn and received undergraduate and law degrees from St. John's University. He was married to Mimi Leviton in 1933, just before he joined her father's small business, which then sold components for lamps, fixtures and appliances.
        Beneficiaries of Mr. Amsterdam's philanthropy included UJA-Federation of New York, Mount Sinai, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Jewish Guild for the Blind and St. John's.
        Mr. Amsterdam's wife died 20 years ago. He is survived by a daughter, Dasha Epstein, of Manhattan; a sister, Jean Ross, of North Miami, and two grandchildren.
