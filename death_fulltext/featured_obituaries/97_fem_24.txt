        Ida Gertrude Krebs, whose lifelong interest in children with learning disabilities led her to found a school where she could implement a highly individual approach to such problems, died on Feb. 11 at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. She was 86 and had lived in Lexington, Mass., until about three years ago.
        The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Roy R. Krebs Jr. of Alexandria.
        Born in Fort Worth, a grand-niece of President Woodrow Wilson, she first offered help to the disadvantaged when, as a teen-ager, she tutored a neighbor who had been dismissed from school because of a learning disability. In 1968, she founded the Krebs School in Lexington, Mass., where more than 100 children with learning disabilities studied in classes of no more than eight pupils.
        She employed unusual techniques to capture the children's interest. The school's pet dog was brought to class so students would learn to count by monitoring the wags of its tail. Division was taught with visits to the kitchen to slice carrots.
        She was a member of the President's Council on Handicapped Children for more than 20 years and worked as a consultant to Governments in Canada, Colombia and Venezuela.
        Trained as a nurse, she counseled veterans returning from World War II who had suffered battle trauma. After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Boston University, she tutored extensively in Cambridge, Mass., and then in Arlington, Mass., before establishing her own school.
        Upon her retirement in 1986, the Krebs School was merged into the Cotting School, which offered a more comprehensive curriculum.
        Her husband, Roy R. Krebs, died in the mid-1940's. In addition to her son, Roy Jr., she is survived by two sisters, Elizabeth Quinlan of San Clemente, Calif., and Dr. Ruth Briles of Sycamore, Ill.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
