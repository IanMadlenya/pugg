        Paul Singer, a psychiatrist who became a leading collector of Asian art, died on Jan. 19 at the Glenside Nursing Home in New Providence, N.J. He was 92.
        The art objects amassed by Dr. Singer were displayed in museums and galleries around the country. He was the curator of two shows at the China Institute in America, which showed some of his collection. His art was also in the exhibition ''Relics of Ancient China'' at Asia House in 1965. Part of the Singer collection was shown at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in 1990. The gallery also held a symposium in honor of Dr. Singer's 85th birthday.
        He served as senior consultant to the Far Eastern Department at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He was the author of several books on Asian art, including ''Early Chinese Gold and Silver'' (1971) and ''Early Chinese Miniatures'' (1977). He also published scholarly papers in such journals as Archives of Asian Art and Oriental Art.
        Dr. Singer was born in Vienna, fled the country in 1938 and, after a brief stay in London, came to the United States. He retired in the late 1980's.
        No immediate family members survive.
