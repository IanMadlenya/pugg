        McMahon, who was born in Brooklyn, had been working as an instructional coach and scout with the Dodgers and pitched batting practice before most home games.
        He began his baseball career with the Milwaukee Braves in 1957 and pitched for Houston, Cleveland, Boston, the Chicago White Sox, Detroit and San Francisco. His career record was 90-68, with an earned-run average of 2.96 and 153 saves.
        He is survived by his wife, Darlene, and six children.
