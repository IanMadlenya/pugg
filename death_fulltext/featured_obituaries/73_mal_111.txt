        Lee Polk, a television producer, director and writer who specialized largely in programs for children, died on Friday at New York University Medical Center. He was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        His daughter Joanne Polk said the cause was leukemia.
        At his death, Mr. Polk was the president of Polk Communications, an independent television production company based in Manhattan.
        He was the director of children's television programming at ABC from 1972 to 1976, and at National Educational Television from 1970 to 1972. He later wrote that "in both instances the point was to create television that would supplement a child's reading, not replace it."
        Mr. Polk was for some time the executive producer of "Wonderworks," a public television series for younger audiences that began the 1984-85 season with "Booker," a dramatization of the childhood of Booker T. Washington, the black educator and author who was born a slave in Virginia. An Emmy Award Winner
        In 1986, Mr. Polk won an Emmy Award for another production in the Wonderworks series, "Anne of Green Gables."
        He held numerous other executive posts in broadcasting over the years and was a former president of the New York chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
        He was born in Brooklyn, grew up there and went on to attend New York University.
        His wife, the former Lois Steinhauer, whom he married in 1949, died in 1979.
        In addition to his daughter Joanne, of Manhattan, he is survived by another daughter, Bonnie Thomas of Bergenfield, N.J.; a son, David, of Valhalla, N.Y.; a grandson, and a sister, Ethel Polk of Chicago.
