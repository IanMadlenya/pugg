        Daniel McLain, who called himself Country Dick Montana as the drummer and singer for the Beat Farmers, a country-rock band, died on Nov. 8 after collapsing onstage at the Longhorn Saloon in Whistler, B. C. He was 40 and lived in San Diego.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said a spokeswoman for Bar None Records.
        Mr. McLain was born in 1955 in Carmel, Calif., and became an important figure in San Diego rock in the 1970's. He ran a record store featuring underground rock, and in the late 1970's started the Crawdaddys, a British Invasion-style garage-rock band that made two albums. In 1983, after a short time with another band, the Penetrators, Mr. McLain became Country Dick Montana  and helped start the Beat Farmers, a band that mixed punk-rock drive with rowdy  rockabilly and country music. It was the epitome of California cow-punk, boisterous yet genuinely steeped in country music. With his deep voice and bawdy humor, Mr. McLain was at the center of the band's shows.
        The Beat Farmers made their first album in 1985, and toured constantly for a  decade. The group recorded for Rhino Records, Curb/ MCA Records and, most recently, for Sector 2 Records, which is distributed by Bar None. Its albums mixed straightforward rock and country songs with raucous parodies like "Are You Drinkin' With Me, Jesus?" Mr. McLain also performed with the Pleasure Barons, a  loose group of California country-rockers, and recently finished his own album,  "The Devil Lied to Me," which is to be released next year.
