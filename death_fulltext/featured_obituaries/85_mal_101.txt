        Irving Newhouse, a newspaper and magazine production specialist in the New York area for 30 years, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 70.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Carole.
        Mr. Newhouse was a photographer for The Staten Island Advance and The Star-Ledger in Newark before becoming the production manager of The Long Island Press. He was later the production manager for Conde Nast in Manhattan, retiring in 1984. He was a nephew of the late Samuel I. Newhouse, a communications entrepreneur.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Edward, both of Manhattan, and a daughter, Meg Sealove of Sands Point, L.I.
