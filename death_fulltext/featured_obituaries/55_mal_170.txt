        Michael Korn, the founder and artistic director of the Philadelphia Singers, the city's only all-professional chorus, died on Thursday in Pennsylvania Hospital. He was 44 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said a spokesman for the chorus.
        Mr. Korn was born in Harrisburg, Pa., and moved to Philadelphia in 1966. He had been an organist since the age of 11, and began conducting at the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied opera and orchestral conducting. He founded the Philadelphia Singers in 1971. At the time of his death he was artistic director and conductor of the chorus and also chorus master for the Opera Company of Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his mother and his stepfather, Mary and Charles Noll, of West Palm Beach, Fla.
