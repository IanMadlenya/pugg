        David S. Berry, a financial analyst who helped explain the complexities of banking and finance to the public,  died on Sept. 11 at the World Trade Center. He was 43 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Mr. Berry was executive vice president and director for research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage firm that specializes in banking and financial services. It had offices on the 89th floor of 2 World Trade Center, the south tower.
        In the moments after a hijacked airliner hit 1 World Trade Center, Mr. Berry called his mother, his father and his wife to tell them that he had not been hurt, said his mother, Nancy M. Berry. Then a hijacked jetliner hit his building. He was not heard from again.
        As an expert in banking and finance, Mr. Berry was often called upon by news organizations, which relied on him for pithy assessments of market trends and developments that were free of the jargon and arcana of the business world.
        In an article in The New York Times in October on the dot-com shakeout, he was quoted as saying that profitable businesses would emerge from the burst bubble of the new economy. ''The technology is real,'' he said, ''and it is having a real impact -- but whether it will be wielded by start-ups with funny names is another question.''
        David Shelby Berry was born on May 31, 1958, in Oklahoma City and graduated cum laude from Yale University in 1980 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and physics. He also studied at the London School of Economics. Since joining Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in 1986, he rose to become a director and a member of the operating committee.
        In addition to his mother, Nancy, of New York, Mr. Berry is survived by his wife, Paula Grant, an executive of Scholastic Inc.; three sons, Nile Philip, Reed Nicholas and Alexander Ashton; a father, Charles N. Berry Jr. of Oklahoma City; and two brothers, C. Nelson Berry III of Seattle and Michaels C. Berry of Bainbridge, Wash.
