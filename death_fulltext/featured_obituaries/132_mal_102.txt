        The Rev. Samuel Austin, pastor of Brown Memorial Baptist Church of Brooklyn and a leader in his 8.5-million member denomination, the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., died last Friday in Los Angeles. He was 62 and lived in Brooklyn.
        He had attended the midwinter board meeting of the convention, the nation's largest black denomination, and collapsed with a heart attack while checking out of his hotel to return home, according to the National Baptist Congress of Christian Education, of which Mr. Austin became president in 1994.
        He died on the way to the hospital, it said.
        Mr. Austin was pastor of the 3,000-member congregation in Clinton Hill for the last 24 years. At his death he was also president of the Empire State Missionary Baptist Convention, comprising some 500 local congregations throughout New York.
        Mr. Austin, a native of Montgomery, Ala., came to preaching early, at  19, at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Buffalo, where he grew up. He graduated from Buffalo University, studied at Canisius College and Buffalo College of the Bible, and was ordained at Pilgrim Baptist in 1957.
        He became active in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, marching for civil rights with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy. In 1964 he was elected pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, N.Y., his pulpit until his move to Brooklyn.
        In Brooklyn he founded and administered a shelter for young transients in Bedford-Stuyvesant. For the last 38 years he also taught in the Pastors' Division of the National Baptist Convention, which trained and certified thousands of preachers, and traveled on preaching missions to Cuba, Asia and Africa.
        Mr. Austin's survivors include his wife, Naomi Brown Austin; a son, Samuel Jr., of Buffalo, and a sister, Ira Lee Tatum.
