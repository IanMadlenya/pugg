        Robert D. Cross, a historian who was briefly president of Hunter College and Swarthmore College, died on Saturday in Charlottesville, Va., where he lived. He was 79.
        The cause was a head injury suffered in a fall, the University of Virginia said in announcing his death.
        Professor Cross taught at Virginia from 1972 until he retired in 1994.
        He was Hunter's president from 1967 to 1969, Swarthmore's from 1969 to 1972 and dean of Virginia's Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1972 to 1974. He resigned in 1969 as Hunter's president to become Swarthmore's. When he resigned as Swarthmore's president, his resignation letter said he had decided that being a president was ''not my forte.''
        A native of Grinnell, Iowa, Robert Dougherty Cross was an Army Air Forces pilot in World War II and rose to major. He received bachelor's and master's degrees in history and literature from Harvard and a doctorate in the history of American civilization from Harvard.
        He taught history from 1952 to 1959 at Swarthmore and from 1959 to 1967 at Columbia.
        He married Barbara E. Myers in 1951. She died in 1967.
        Professor Cross is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Cunningham; a son, Frederick, of Manhattan; a daughter, Pamela Guthrie of Boulder, Colo.; two stepdaughters, Prudence Brown of Manhattan and Paula Tyack of Hanover, Mass.; a stepson, William Brown of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren and stepgrandchildren; and a brother, Rowland, of Arlington, Va.
