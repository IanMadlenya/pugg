        Saul Rogovin, a Brooklyn-born pitcher who spent eight years in the major leagues and 12 as a high school teacher in New York City, died on Monday. He was 71.
        He had been suffering from cancer, his wife, Evelyn, said.
        Rogovin was a right-hander from Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn who signed with a minor league team as an infielder in 1941 because he wanted to play every day. He pitched for the Detroit Tigers, the Chicago White Sox, the Baltimore Orioles and the Philadelphia Phillies in a career that began as a 26-year-old rookie in 1949 and was ended by a sore arm in 1957.
        His career record of 48-48 with a 4.06 earned run average included two outstanding seasons: 1951, when he was 12-8 for the Tigers and the White Sox and led the American League with a 2.78 e.r.a., and 1952, when he was 14-9 for a .609 winning percentage, tops on the White Sox staff.
        After retiring from baseball, Mr. Rogovin became a liquor salesman for several years, then decided to resume the college studies he had begun more than 30 years earlier. He was 51 years old when he started working toward a degree in education at Manhattan Community College.
        After graduation from City College, he began teaching English and literature in the New York City high schools at age 56. He spent the last eight years of his teaching career at Eastern District High School in Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife.
