        Dr. Julius W. Bell, an ear, nose and throat specialist who practiced and taught in Manhattan for 56 years, died on Sept. 8 at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood, Fla. He was 91 years old and had moved to Hollywood from Manhattan when he retired eight years ago.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Aside from his private practice and extensive writings on his specialty, Dr. Bell was long associated with the former Polyclinic Hospital in Manhattan and the Polyclinic Post-Graduate Medical School, where he was a professor of otolaryngology, department head and director of the residency program in otolaryngology.
        He was a 1927 graduate of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, where he was also a champion wrestler. In World War II, he served in the Navy with the rank of commander.
        Dr. Bell is survived by his wife, Paula; a son, Dr. Herbert S. Bell of Cleveland; a daughter, Susan Alcott of Larchmont, N.Y.; eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
