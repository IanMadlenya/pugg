        Leonard S. Kandell, a developer and investor in Manhattan real estate for more than half a century, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 85 years old.
        His death was caused primarily by cancer and Parkinson's disease, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Kandell began his career as a builder in the Bronx, where he was born and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School. He was a 1924 graduate of Columbia College.
        He had been a longtime committee head of the Commerce and Industry Association, a director of the Real Estate Board of New York, a member of several mayors' advisory committees on real estate, a trustee of the Bank Street College of Education and a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        Surviving are his wife, Florence; two daughters, Leslie Friedberg and Alice Kandell, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
