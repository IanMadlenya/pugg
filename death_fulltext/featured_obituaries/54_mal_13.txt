        Ephraim E. Urbach, a rabbi and scholar who helped convert ancient Hebrew into a modern language and published works on Jewish history, died today. He was 79 years old.
        The cause of his death was not made public. He died at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem after a long illness.
        Mr. Urbach was ordained a rabbi in his native Poland in 1934 before emigrating to Palestine in 1938.
        He served as a chaplain in the British Army in World War II. Later he was a high school teacher, then a professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
        Mr. Urbach published four books of Jewish history and religious law. He was active in trying to bridge differences between the nonreligious majority and observant Jews, by melding Jewish tradition with modern culture.
        As a member of the Hebrew Language Academy, Mr. Urbach was involved in efforts to make Hebrew a modern-day langauge. He was also a former president of Israel's Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
        Mr. Urbach is survived by a wife, Hannah, three daughters, a son and grandchildren.
