        Ronald Alexander, the author of the Broadway comedies "Nobody Loves an Albatross" and "Time Out for Ginger," died on April 24 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 78.
        The cause was cancer, said John Springer, a press agent.
        Mr. Alexander, whose original name was Ronald George Alexander Ungerer, was born in West New York, N.J. After dropping out of school, he worked in a factory, sang with a band and was a boxer, then organized Broadway performers for a unit of United Service Organizations run by his sister. He also appeared on Broadway in small roles in "The Patriots," "Light Up the Sky" and "The Closing Door."
        As a playwright, his greatest successes were "Time Out for Ginger" (1952), which starred Melvyn Douglas as a tyrannical father with three daughters, and "Nobody Loves an Albatross" (1963), a satire of the television industry, which starred Robert Preston. His plays "The Grand Prize" (1955) and "Holiday for Lovers" (1957) were also produced on Broadway.
        Mr. Alexander wrote the screenplays for "Return to Peyton Place" (1961) and "Billie" (1965), the film version of "Time Out for Ginger."
        He is survived by three daughters, Cathy, Diane and Brooke, all of Los Angeles.
