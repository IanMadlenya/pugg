        Dr. Monica Healea, physics professor emeritus and former chairman of the physics department at Vassar College, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 93.
        Dr. Healea, who was born in Uhrichsville, Ohio, was a resident of Pleasant Valley, N.Y., until nine years ago. She earned her B.A. and M.A. degrees at Bryn Mawr College and held a Ph.D. from Harvard University. She joined the Vassar faculty in 1933 and retired in 1962.
        Dr. Healea published research papers on the interaction of beams of electrons with metal surfaces. During World War II, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she helped develop the magnetron into a power source for an aerial navigation system. Later, she worked at Brookhaven National Laboratory as it was being readied for work on nuclear physics.
        After reaching emeritus status at Vassar, she spent several years at Harvard with a group studying the atomic physics of the upper atmosphere.
        In retirement she became an artist who exhibited her abstract canvases in Dutchess County and in New York City.  In her 80's, she worked with acrylic paints to explore the interplay of color and design. She was a member of the Dutchess County Art Association and the Mill Street Loft, an arts-education center in Poughkeepsie.
        Dr. Healea is survived by a sister, Edith Everett, and a niece, Mildred Barnett, both of Fresno, Calif.
