        Toby Lelyveld, a teacher of literature who specialized in the stage history of Shakespeare's plays, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.
        Her book, ''Shylock on the Stage'' (Western Reserve University, 1960), traced the way the moneylender in ''The Merchant of Venice'' was played by great actors, including Charles Macklin in 1741, Edmund Kean in 1814, Edwin Booth in 1861 and Henry Irving in 1879.
        Noting that Shylock appeared in only 5 of the 20 scenes and had only 30 major speeches, she called the role ''a comparatively scanty part'' -- one that, perhaps more than any other in Shakespeare, was at the mercy of the actor. For that reason, she said, the character's evolution in the 19th and 20th centuries mirrored shifts in social attitudes toward Jews in Britain and the United States.
        Mrs. Lelyveld, the former Toby Bookholtz, received her bachelor's degree in 1933 and her master's degree in 1943, both from Teachers College of Columbia University. She received her doctorate in English literature from Columbia in 1951.
        She taught at Teachers College, the University of Omaha, Western Reserve University, the Columbia University School of the Arts and the Juilliard School.
        From 1948 to 1956, she was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation at Hunter College.
        In the 1960's and 1970's, she edited program notes for the Theater Recording Society, Caedmon Records and Spoken Arts Recordings.
        Her marriage to Rabbi Arthur J. Lelyveld of Cleveland ended in divorce in 1964.
        They had three sons: Joseph, executive editor of The New York Times; David, of Manhattan and Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael, of Lexington, Mass. She is also survived by two sisters, Mildred Rosenbaum and Roslyn Klibanoff, both of Florence, Ala., and five grandchildren.
