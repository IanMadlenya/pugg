        Vincent Philip Carosso, a leading expert on American business and economic history, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 71.
        New York University, where he was Kenan Professor of History emeritus, said the cause of death was lung cancer.
        Professor Carosso, a prodigious author, chronicled the emergence of big corporations and the families that made them big. And he wrote histories of the country's economy at large.
        He edited a series of multivolume works on American business and finance, many of them for the United States Congress, which drew on his knowledge of his field. A Native of San Francisco
        He was a native of San Francisco and earned B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California at Berkeley. He taught at San Jose State College and Carnegie-Mellon University before moving to New York in 1957 to accept dual appointments at both Columbia and New York Universities.
        Having gained tenure at N.Y.U. two years later, he gave it his sole allegiance. He became a full professor of history in 1962 and was named William R. Kenan Jr. Professor in 1976. He retired three years ago.
        He was the author or co-author of "The California Wine Industry: A Study of the Formative Years" (University of California Press, 1951/1976), "American Economic History" (Holt, 1957), "Timber and Men: The Weyerhaeuser Story" (Macmillan, 1961) and "Recent America: A History" (Crowell, 1963).
        Also, "Investment Banking in America: A History" (Harvard University Press, 1970/1979), "More Than a Century of Investment Banking: The Story of Kidder, Peabody & Co. Inc." (McGraw Hill, 1979) and "The Morgans: Private International Bankers, 1954-1913" (Harvard, 1987).
        Professor Carosso is survived by a son, Steven B., of Ridgewood, N.J., and a grandchild.
