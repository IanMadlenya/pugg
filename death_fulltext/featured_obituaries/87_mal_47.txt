        Don Simonelli, a designer of women's clothing who also operated a catering business at one time, died on Friday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. Mr. Simonelli, who lived in Manhattan and South Salem, N.Y., was 56.
        The cause was complications of asthma, said a friend, Liz Rittersporn.
        Starting in 1965, Mr. Simonelli designed for Anne Klein, Modelia and Herbert Grossman. From 1985 to 1990 he operated Food Concepts, a catering company in South Salem.
        Later, in partnership with his wife, Caroline, he designed for Diane Gilman and Maribel Garcia. In 1992 the Simonellis formed their own dress firm.
        Mr. Simonelli was a graduate of the Parsons School of Design. In 1965 he won the Coty Young Designer Award.
        In addition to his wife, who lives in Manhattan, Mr. Simonelli is survived by two daughters, Maggie and Caggie, both also of Manhattan.
