        Hubert Potter Earle, a Philadelphia lawyer and former general counsel of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, died on Saturday in Bryn Mawr Hospital. A resident of Bryn Mawr, he was 75.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        A graduate of Harvard College, class of 1941, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Mr. Earle was in practice from 1948 until recently. He was also an administrative judge, dealing largely with Public Utility Commission cases. From 1965 to 1987 he was president of the Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Company. He formerly also represented Austria in Philadelphia as an honorary consul.
        He was a son of George H. Earle 3d, Pennsylvania Governor from 1934 to 1938. As an undergraduate at Harvard he spent the summer of 1939 working as a clerk for William C. Bullitt, the American Ambassador in Paris. The experience led to the publication of a book by Mr. Earle later that year, "Blackout: The Human Side of Europe's March to War."
        After the United States entered World War II, he served in the Navy and was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant.
        Mr. Earle is survived by his wife of 53 years, Elizabeth Wright Earle; a son, Hubert P. Jr., of Darien, Conn., and two grandchildren.
