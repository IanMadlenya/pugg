        Terry Drinkwater, the senior correspondent in the Los Angeles bureau of CBS News, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Malibu, Calif. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Drinkwater, a CBS correspondent for 25 years, reported primarily from the Western states, specializing in energy and environmental issues and also often covering space missions and politics. His overseas assignments included events in Japan, South Korea, Britain and Latin America.
        In 1983 he broadcast a CBS ''Evening News'' series on advanced cancer treatments that included his own battle with the disease. The series won him an Alfred I. du Pont-Columbia University Award. His other honors included three Emmy Awards and a George Foster Peabody Award. He filed his last CBS News report in August of last year.
        In a statement yesterday, Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, praised Mr. Drinkwater's series on cancer as ''devoid of self-pity and characteristically written with elegance and flair.''
        Mr. Drinkwater began his broadcasting career in 1960, helped found two FM radio stations, WBAI in New York and KPFK in Los Angeles, honed his craft at two Los Angeles television stations, KCBS and KTLA, joined CBS News in 1963 and began producing network news segments in 1966.
        He was a native of Denver and earned a bachelor's degree at Pomona College and a master's degree at the University of California at Berkeley. He served in the United States Army infantry in 1958 and 1959.
        He is survived by a son, Croft; a daughter, Angela, both of Los Angeles; his mother, Helen, of Los Angeles, and a sister, Dorsey Stevenson, of Santa Monica, Calif.
