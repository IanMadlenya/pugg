        Yozo Hamaguchi, a Japanese-born artist known for his work in mezzotint engraving, a technique he was introduced to by the poet E. E. Cummings, died in Tokyo on Dec. 25. He was 91.
        Mr. Hamaguchi trained as an artist in Japan and at 21 moved to Paris, where he mingled with the international group of artists and writers who enlivened the city in the 1920's and 30's. There he became friends with Cummings, who gave him tools for making mezzotints, engravings widely used in the 18th century to reproduce paintings but made all but obsolete by the advent of photography. Mr. Hamaguchi used the medium to produce a series of colored prints, the ''E. E. Cummings Suite.'' His work was collected by museums internationally.
        He is survived by his wife, Keiko Minami, also an artist.
