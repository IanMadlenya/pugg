        Breaking a tradition of secrecy, the Israeli press has identified the designated new head of the Shin Bet security service as well as his predecessor, who is stepping down.
        In extensive coverage today and on Wednesday, newspapers have published the name and pictures of Ami Ayalon, a decorated former Navy commander who has been  nominated as the new Shin Bet chief. Mr. Ayalon, 50, was reported tonight to be  considering the appointment.
        Israeli censorship rules forbid publication of the name of the Shin Bet head, but because Mr. Ayalon is the first nominee from outside the service and has yet to take office, newspapers went ahead and disclosed his name. Other leading candidates are well-known senior army and police officers, so regardless of who is chosen, the next Shin Bet chief is unlikely to be anonymous.
        The publication of Mr. Ayalon's name was a further erosion of the secrecy surrounding the Shin Bet, which has come under increasing public scrutiny in recent years.
        Tonight, Israel television broadcast the name and showed thinly disguised footage of Karmi Gilon, the Shin Bet chief who resigned on Monday under fire for the service's failure to prevent the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 4.
        The report was careful to cite the name from an article in The Washington Post, but it left no doubt that Mr. Gilon was the man who, under Israeli censorship regulations, was known until now only as "K."
        "America knows, and now the citizens of Israel also know," said Haim Yavin, anchoring the evening television news.
        Parliament members across the political spectrum urged this week that the name of the Shin Bet chief be officially announced, arguing that the secrecy had become an anachronism in an age of global communications that are accessible to  Israel's enemies. Naming the Shin Bet head, they said, would make the powerful service more accountable to the Israeli public.
