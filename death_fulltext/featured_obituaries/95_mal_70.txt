        Randy Barcelo, a costume and set designer on and off Broadway, died on Dec. 6 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said his mother, Ondina Lopez.
        Mr. Barcelo began his career as a dancer and choreographer in summer stock. His professional break came when he met the director Tom O'Horgan at La Mama Experimental Theater while working on costume designs for a play by Julie Bovasso. He joined forces with Mr. O'Horgan and designed costumes for several of his shows, including "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Lenny." He also traveled to Vienna with Mr. O'Horgan to design costumes for the Berlioz opera "Les Troyens" and then went to Paris to do the costumes for the musical "Starmania."
        His designs for the Broadway musical "Ain't Misbehavin' " brought him a Tony nomination. He also designed costumes for "The Magic Show," "A Midsummer Night's Dream" directed by James Lapine for the New York Shakespeare Festival, and Leonard Bernstein's "Mass" in Washington. He also designed for Intar and the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater. His last costume designs were for a Ballet Hispanico production, "Si Senor! Es Mi Son!," performed at the Joyce Theater this month.
        Mr. Barcelo's play, "Songs From the Jukebox," was produced off Off Broadway.
        In addition to his mother, of Manhattan, he is survived by a sister, Alina Alfonso of San Juan, P.R.
