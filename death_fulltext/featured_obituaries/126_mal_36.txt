He also assisted with the  Government's initial response to the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980's. After his retirement two years ago, he remained active as a volunteer with the institutes' AIDS clinic.
        Dr. Hill, a native of Manila, Ark., near Memphis, graduated from Arkansas State University and earned  a doctorate in microbiology at the University of Arkansas.
        He then became an assistant professor of microbiology at San Francisco State University, served as a researcher at the Naval Medical Research Institute and began his career at the National Institutes of Health in 1974.
        There he served as deputy director of allergy and infectious diseases from 1987 until his retirement in 1995.
        He is survived by his mother, Della Castleton, and his stepfather, Clell Castleton, both of Manila, Ark.
