        Dr. Francois Mergen, professor emeritus and former dean of Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, died of liver failure Monday at Seven Rivers Community Hospital in Crystal Rivers, Fla. He was 64 years old and lived in Homosassa, Fla.
        His liver had been weakened when he contracted hepatitis in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II.
        Dr. Mergen joined the Yale faculty in 1954 and was dean of the forestry school from 1965 to 1975. In this period the school shifted its focus toward broad environmental issues. Dr. Mergen became professor emeritus in May.
        He received many professional awards, including the Barrington Moore Memorial Award from the Society of American Foresters for outstanding achievement in biological research.
        In World War II Dr. Mergen was involved with the underground during the Nazi occupation of Luxembourg, his birthplace. The Nazis captured him and interned him, but he escaped from the prison camp and later became a liaison officer at Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters in England.
        Dr. Mergen was a graduate of the University of New Brunswick in Canada and received a master's degree and a doctorate from Yale University.
        He is survived by his wife, Andree, and a son, John Francis of Baltimore.
