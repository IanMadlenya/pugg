        Reginald Ely Zelnik, a historian who focused on Russian labor and social studies, died May 17 in an accident at the University of California, Berkeley. He was 68.
        He was killed when a delivery truck accidentally backed into him as he was walking on campus, the university said.
        A faculty member at the university since 1964, Dr. Zelnik was a popular professor of history and a former department chairman. As a newcomer there in the 1960's he played a role in the Free Speech Movement that roiled Berkeley and the country by advocating students' rights. He went on to become a mentor to a generation of students of Russian history.
        Dr. Zelnik was the author of several influential books. He wrote ''Labor and Society in Tsarist Russia: The Factory Workers of St. Petersburg, 1855 to 1870'' (Stanford University, 1971). His ''Law and Disorder on the Narova River: The Kreenholm Strike of 1872'' (University of California, 1995), which remains in print, used that strike to analyze Russian social history in general and the life stories of Russian workers in particular.
        Also in print is ''Workers and Intelligentsia in Late Imperial Russia: Realities, Representations, Reflections'' (University of California, 1999). He continued to write and research until his death.
        A New York City native, Reginald Zelnik graduated from Princeton in 1956. After two years in the Navy, he enrolled at Stanford, where he received a master's degree in 1961, and a Ph.D. in history in 1966.
        At Berkeley, he was promoted to full professor in 1976 and served as a chairman of the Center for Slavic and East European Studies from 1977 to 1980, and as chairman of the history department from 1994 to 1997.
        While still an assistant professor, he belonged to the Committee of 200, a faculty group that supported students seeking broader rights of free speech. It was opposed by many senior faculty members, administrators and university trustees.
        In 2002, he and Robert Cohen of N.Y.U. edited a collection of essays, ''The Free Speech Movement: Reflections on Berkeley in the 1960's'' (University of California). It included Dr. Zelnik's thoughts about the Berkeley faculty of the time and the story of his own friendship with Mario Savio, one of the student leaders, who died in 1996.
        Dr. Zelnik is survived by his wife of 48 years, Elaine; a daughter, Pamela Zelnik; a son, Michael; a brother, Martin; and a grandson.
