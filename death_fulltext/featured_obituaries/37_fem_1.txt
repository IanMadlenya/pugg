        Ann Straube, who survived the sinking of the Titanic, died Tuesday at the age of 92, relatives said Wednesday. She lived in Chicago.
        Mrs. Straube moved from Scranton, Pa., with her parents to their homeland of Ireland at an early age. As a teen-ager she boarded the Titanic with an aunt to come to the United States, said Mary Kapolnek, one of Mrs. Straube's daughters.
        The British liner struck an iceberg and went down on the night of April 14, 1912, with a loss of 1,500 lives, including that of Mrs. Straube's aunt.
        Mrs. Straube, who was rescued and brought to New York, later moved to Chicago, where she married and had three daughters.
        Mrs. Straube is survived by two daughters, 11 grandchildren, 26 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren.
