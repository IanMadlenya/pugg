        Harry Bennett Frank, the State Supreme Court justice and ardent New York Giants fan who ruefully decided that the owners of that baseball team were within their rights to leave the Polo Grounds and seek greener turf in San Francisco, died on May 5 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 91.
        Justice Frank was on the bench from 1955 until he reached the statutory retirement age of 70 in 1975. Most of the cases that came before him tended to be routine matters like nursing home standards or fraud.
        But the least routine court day for him must have been April 3, 1958, when he found it his duty to throw out an action brought by a fellow Giants rooter that might have prevented the team from leaving.
        The plaintiff, a shareholder, contended that the move would injure him financially. But the judge, putting the law above his feelings, noted that the move to San Francisco would actually profit the shareholder.
        "The court," he held, "as distinguished from Justice Frank the fan, must find that the plaintiff's contentions, while sentimentally four-baggers, are legally  outs."
        Justice Frank was born in New York City and graduated from New York University and its law school. He was elected to the State Supreme Court in 1965 after seven years as an acting Supreme Court justice.
        Justice Frank is survived by his daughter, Norma Frankel of Great Neck, L.I.; his companion, Florence Gelfand; 7 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. His wife of 55 years, Helen Leef Frank, died in 1986.
