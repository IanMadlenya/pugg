        Dr. John Robert Philip, one of Australia's foremost environmental scientists, died on June 26 in Amsterdam while on a professional visit. He was 72 and lived in Campbell, near Canberra.
        He was killed when a car struck him, said the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, the Government institution where Dr. Philip worked until 1992, when he retired as its first fellow emeritus.
        Dr. Philip, a physicist and mathematician, was recognized for his work on the movement of water, energy and gases. He was co-creator of the Philip-deVries theory of thermally induced moisture movement in porous materials.
        Born in Ballarat, Victoria, he was educated at Scotch College in Melbourne and the University of Melbourne, where he received a doctorate in physics in 1960. He started his career as a design engineer with the Queensland Irrigation Commission in 1948 and joined the Commonwealth center staff in 1951.
        Surviving are his wife, Frances Long Philip; two sons, Peregrine and Julian; a daughter, Candida; a brother, Graeme, and four grandchildren.
