        Mr. Brody was born Jan. 1, 1907, in London and lived in Paris from 1912 to 1921, when he came to the United States and attended schools for still photography and film.
        Mr. Brody, a lifelong Socialist, helped produce many films for organized labor. Some of his early still photos and films were shot at labor strikes, one a textile strike in Passaic, N.J., in 1926 and another in 1929 in Gastonia, N.C. He was also a cameraman for documentaries about national hunger marches on Washington in 1931 and 1932.
        After World War II, he worked as a film laboratory technician in Hollywood and New York City.
        He is survived by his wife, Sondra Brody, of Old Saybrook; three sons, David, of Brooklyn; Julian, of Japan, and Hartley Neel, of Vermont; a daughter, Mady McCoy of Fairfax, Va., and a brother, Louis, of Los Angeles.
