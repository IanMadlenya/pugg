        A 1931 graduate of City College, he began his career on the staff of the Business Men's Council of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. In the late 1930's, he helped organize the fund-raising operations of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. In 1941, he was named executive director of fund raising for the Joint Defense Appeal sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League.
        Later in the 1940's, he worked to coordinate fund-raising efforts of the United Jewish Appeal and the Joint Defense Appeal in metropolitan New York and Chicago. In 1949 he joined the staff of the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
        Mr. Chasin started a long association with the Israel Bond Campaign in 1951 when he organized a New York welcome for Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion of Israel. Mr. Chasin, a widower, is survived by his son, Mark, of Short Hills, N.J., and three grandsons.
