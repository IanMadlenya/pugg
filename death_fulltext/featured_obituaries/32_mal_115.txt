He was 91 years old. Mr. Tugend's long, prolific career in the entertainment industry began around 1930, when he wrote sketches for ''Ziegfeld Follies'' and Fred Allen's radio show. He went to Hollywood with Allen to make ''Thanks a Million,'' and during the subsequent three decades, his 39 film credits included ''The Road to Bali,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' and ''Pocketful of Miracles.'' In 1933, with a group of other writers, Mr. Tugend founded the Screen Writers Guild, which became the Writers Guild of America in the 1950's. Mr. Tugend was an executive with Paramount Pictures during the 1940's, but left the studio to be a freelance writer and producer. He produced many television shows during the 1950's and 1960's, including ''The Ray Milland Show'' and ''The General Electric Theater,'' and wrote a play, ''The Wayward Stork,'' which was produced on Broadway in 1966. He is survived by a son, James, of Los Angeles, and two granddaughters.
