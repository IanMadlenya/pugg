        Andrew G. Donaldson, a former school superintendent of District 9 in the Bronx, died of heart failure Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old. Mr. Donaldson, who entered the school system as a teacher shortly after graduating from the City College of New York in 1950, headed District 9 in the South Bronx, from 1970 to 1973.
        His tenure was marked by disputes with city and state officials and the United Federation of Teachers over his management. When union-backed candidates won a majority on the district board, Mr. Donaldson was replaced.
        During the Carter Administration, Mr. Donaldson was named by the President to the National Advisory Council on Adult Education. He was elected chairman by the 15-member board and served from 1978 to 1980.
        He is survived by a sister, Clarice Donaldson of Roosevelt, L.I., and a brother, Charles, of San Francisco.
