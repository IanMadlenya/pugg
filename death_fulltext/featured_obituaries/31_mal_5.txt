        Bettis Alston Garside, a relief executive and educator, died yesterday in the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan after a long illness. He was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Garside, a native of Stringtown, Okla., spent from 1922 through 1926 in China as a Presbyterian missionary.
        After his return to New York, he became executive director of Associated Boards for Christian Colleges in China, and in 1941 he was one of the organizers of United China Relief, which later became United Service to China. The organization raised $50 million in aid for the Chinese people.
        In 1951, Mr. Garside became executive director of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, retiring in 1979. He was also executive director of Aid Refugee Chinese Intellectuals. In 1959, with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas, he helped organize the American Emergency Committee for Tibetan Refugees.
        He was the author of two books, a 1948 biography of Henry Winters Luce, a missionary and the father of Henry R. Luce, the late publisher of Time magazine (Fleming H. Revell Company) and, in 1985, his memoirs, ''Within the Four Seas'' (Frederic C. Beil).
        A widower, he is survived by a daughter, Jean Barth of Manhattan.
