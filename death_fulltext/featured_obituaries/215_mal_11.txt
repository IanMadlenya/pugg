        Harry Danning, an All-Star catcher for the New York Giants who played on three pennant-winning teams in the 1930's, died last Monday at a hospice in Valparaiso, Ind. He was 93.
        His death was announced by his daughter, Viktoria Voller. Playing for 10 seasons with the Giants, Danning was a .300 hitter in three consecutive years. He caught the screwballs delivered by Carl Hubbell and he was a teammate of Mel Ott, Bill Terry and Travis Jackson, four Hall of Famers.
        Danning, known as Harry the Horse, for Damon Runyon's Broadway character, was named to the National League All-Star team from 1938 to 1941. His best years at the plate were 1938 to 1940, when he batted .306, .313 and .300.
        Danning was a backup catcher for the 1933 Giants team, which defeated the Washington Senators for the World Series championship, and he appeared for pennant-winning clubs in 1936 and 1937 that were beaten by the Yankees in the World Series.
        Playing for the Giants from 1933 to 1942, Danning had a career batting average of .285. After retiring as a player, he was a minor league coach and worked as a car dealer, a newspaper and magazine distributor and an insurance executive.
        In addition to his daughter, of Valparaiso, Danning is survived by his brother Curtis Ben Danning, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Leah Serlin, of Santa Clarita, Calif.; and three grandchildren. His wife, Diane, died in 1978. His brother Ike Danning, who caught briefly for the St. Louis Browns, died in 1983.
