        The cause of death was complications from cancer, his family said.
        For almost a decade Mr. Kriss was one of two executive editors at Time. His was the third-highest editing position.

        After becoming a senior editor in 1969, he supervised Time's coverage of the first moon landings and was in charge of foreign news and later all breaking news. He coordinated special issues and special reports, including those commemorating the anniversaries of the beginning of World War II, D-Day, the dawn of the atomic age and the fall of Saigon.
        For two years in the early 1970's, he left Time to serve as the executive editor of Saturday Review magazine.
        Mr. Kriss was a native of Brooklyn. While studying at Harvard, where he was accepted when he was 16, he wrote for The Boston Globe.
        From 1954 to 1956, he served in the United States Army in Korea, then earned a master's degree in journalism from Columbia. After serving as a correspondent for United Press International in Tokyo and working for The Daily News in New York City, he joined Time as a writer in 1961.
        His marriage to Lorna Smith ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of six years, Suzanne Richie; a son, Erik, of Delmar, N.Y.; a daughter, Evan Kriss of Manhattan; a sister, Jacqueline Mastrandrea of West Islip, L.I., and two grandchildren.
