        Dr. Nils R. Ringertz, who helped create a substantial Internet presence for the Nobel Foundation by transforming its outdated Web site into an online museum that includes recorded oral histories, died in his sleep on June 8 at his home in Stockholm. He was 69.
        The cause of death had not yet been determined, said his son.
        In 1996, Dr. Ringertz, a member of the Nobel Foundation's board, created the online museum concept to replace a site that had been used mainly to announce Nobel Prize winners.
        The revamped site, www.nobel.se, was completed in 2001 in time for the foundation's 100th anniversary.
        It is equipped with advanced features like live footage of Nobel Prize events, expanded interviews with Nobel laureates and demonstrations of how discoveries in medicine and biology were turned into practical applications.
        Online visitors can hear authors and scientists read from their works in recordings that date from 1907.
        ''Ringertz was a man driven to bring the work of the Nobel Foundation to a greater world audience,'' said Dr. Michael Barnett of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.
        ''He wanted students and adults to understand how the prizes were chosen, what was the science or culture behind them and something of the men and women who won,'' Dr. Barnett said.
        Dr. Ringertz was an editor of the journal Experimental Cell Research from 1963 to 1993, and from 1976 to 1999 was chairman of the Nobel committee that picks the winner in medicine or physiology.
        He was also a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
        Nils Robert Ringertz was born in Tarnaby, Sweden. He earned his medical degree and doctorate at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where he later taught genetics.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne Marie, of Stockholm; a son, Ulf, of Stockholm; a daughter, Eva Ringertz of Cambridge, England; and three grandchildren.
