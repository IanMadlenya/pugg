        Raymond Johnson, a dancer and choreographer, died Thursday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn of complications after a stroke. He was 40 years old.
        Born in Harlem, Mr. Johnson was a graduate of Queens College. He trained in dance at the Henry Street Settlement House and performed with the Nikolais Dance Theater and Murray Louis Dance Company during the 1960's.
        A dancer who was both sensuous and impish, Mr. Johnson was best known for his interpretations of dances by James Waring, especially for ''Feathers,'' Mr. Waring's homage to Barbette, a celebrated acrobat and female impersonator of the 1930's. He choreographed his first dance, ''Suite,'' in 1969 and collaborated with the composer George Rochberg on several dances, most notably the 1975 ''Chamber.''
        Mr. Johnson was also known for a solo program he began performing in 1970 that consisted of works by Mr. Waring, Rudy Perez and himself. He founded the Raymond Johnson Dance Company in 1974. The group disbanded in 1980, when a back injury forced Mr. Johnson to retire from performing and choreographing. He served as fiscal officer for the New York Foundation from 1981 until his death.
        Mr. Johnson is survived by his mother, Vivian Johnson; his sister, Beverly, and two brothers, Calvin and Clarence, all of Cocoa Beach, Fla.
