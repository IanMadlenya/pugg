        Former Representative Omar Burleson, who served in Congress for 32 years, died Tuesday night at Hendrick Hospital Medical Center in Abilene. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Burleson, a conservative Democrat, was first elected in 1946 from the 17th Congressional District, which includes the cattle and oil country of West Texas.
        His major interests included foreign policy, health care and budgetary matters. At his retirement in 1979, he was chairman of the House Administration Committee, a post he had held for many years.
        He was born on his family's farm near Anson in 1906, but had lived in Abilene since retiring.
        He is survived by several nieces and nephews.
