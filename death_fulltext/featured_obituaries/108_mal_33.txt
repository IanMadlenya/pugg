        Nello Celio, a member of Switzerland's Italian-speaking minority who had been his country's Finance Minister and in 1972 its President, died on Dec. 29 in a clinic in Bern, the Swiss capital. He was 81..
        The cause was pneumonia, the Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung reported on Thursday.
        Mr. Celio was born into a family of modest means in a village in the mostly  Italian-speaking canton of Ticino, which is in southern Switzerland and borders  on Italy.
        He became a multilingual lawyer active in the Radical Democratic Party in his native canton and in the cantonal administration. He went on to become a prominent member of the Federal Council, Switzerland's chief executive body. Its members are elected by the Federal Assembly and include the President.
        In 1966, as a member of the Federal Council, he became the country's minister in charge of military affairs, and a year and a half later he was made Minister  of Finance.
        In that post, he played a key role in the formulating of countercyclical measures whose goals included cutting back Government expenditures, which had been increasing greatly.
        In late 1971, when he was still Finance Minister, he was elected to serve concurrently as President for the year 1972, under the traditional rotation of that post among the council members. In 1973, he left the Government, and later  served on corporate boards.
