        Horace A. Hildreth, whose career as lawyer, broadcast executive, college president and two-term Governor of Maine was capped with four years' service as an Ambassador, died Thursday. He was 85 years old. He suffered a heart attack while at Maine Medical Center undergoing an examination for a blood pressure problem, said his son, Horace Hildreth Jr. In 1953, President Eisenhower named Mr. Hildreth Ambassador to Pakistan. At that time Mr. Hildreth had been president of Bucknell University for four years.
        He was Governor from 1945 to 1949. In 1948 he ran for the Senate, finishing second to Margaret Chase Smith in a four-way Republican primary contest.
        Mr. Hildreth, a Gardiner native, was a graduate of Bowdoin College and the Harvard Law School. He practiced law in Portland and began his Hildreth Network of Maine radio and television stations before entering politics.
        Besides his son, Mr. Hildreth is survived by his wife, Katherine, and three daughters.
