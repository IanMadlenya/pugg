        Charles Bruck, a conductor and teacher, died on Sunday in Hancock, Me. He was 84.
        The cause was liver cancer, said Nancie Monteux-Barendse, the president of the Pierre Monteux Memorial Foundation.
        Mr. Bruck, who lived in Les Baux-de-Provence, France, was in Hancock in his 27th season as the music director of the Pierre Monteux School for Conductors and Orchestra Musicians.
        He was born in Timisoara, Hungary (now Romania), in 1911. He became a French citizen and was active in the Resistance, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.
        After courses at the Vienna Conservatory and studies in piano and composition (as well as law) in Paris, he studied conducting under Monteux in 1934 and was appointed associate conductor of the Paris Symphony Orchestra in 1936. He went on to direct the Netherlands Opera, the Strasbourg Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Paris Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, making many guest appearances and recordings and championing many 20th-century composers.
        As a teacher, he was known as a taskmaster. His students included the American conductor Hugh Wolff.
        Mr. Bruck's body was flown to Jerusalem for interment. He is survived by his wife, Gaby, and his sister, Anni Heidingsfeld of Israel.
