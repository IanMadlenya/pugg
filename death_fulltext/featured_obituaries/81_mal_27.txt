        Tom Bristol Coughran, a banking executive who was an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Eisenhower Administration, died on Saturday at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. He was 87 and lived in Falls Church, Va.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Coughran was Assistant Secretary for International Affairs from 1957 to 1958, and also served as the United States executive director of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.
        He began his career at the Bank of America in Exeter, Calif., after graduating from Stanford University in 1927. In the next 30 years, he rose from branch manager to vice president and manager of the bank's international banking department in San Francisco.
        After his stint at the Treasury Department, he returned to the Bank of America in New York, becoming executive vice president, vice chairman and chief executive officer of the Bank of America International in New York.
        He retired from the bank in 1971 and was one of the founders of the Wobaco Holding Corporation of Luxembourg. He served as Wobaco's chairman before retiring in 1975.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Florence, and a daughter, Jane, of Alexandria.
