        Chris Short, a left-handed pitcher who won 135 games in 15 major league seasons, spending almost all of his career with the Philadelphia Phillies, died today in a convalescent home. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Short suffered a ruptured aneurysm and lapsed into a coma in October 1988. He never regained consciousness.
        He won 17 or more games four times in a five-year period starting in 1964 and was 20-10 in 1966, the first Phillie left-hander to win 20 games in a half-century.
        His biggest disappointment in baseball came in 1964 when the Phillies failed to win the National League pennant after leading by 6 games with 10 to play. He and the right-hander Jim Bunning pitched out of turn to bolster a short-handed staff in those last 10 games.
        Mr. Short is survived by his wife, Pat, and three sons, Rhawn of Newark, Del., and Nicky and Eric of Dunedin, Fla.
