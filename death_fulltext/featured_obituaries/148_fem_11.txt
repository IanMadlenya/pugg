        Rosemary Valaire, a ballet teacher and a director of the Westside Ballet of Santa Monica, Calif., and a former dancer with the Royal Ballet of England, died on May 7 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 68.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said Jim Brunet, director of public relations at the Westside Ballet.
        Ms. Valaire, whose original surname was Feuerheerd, joined the Royal Ballet in 1946 and performed with the company on its first tour in the United States in 1949. She moved to Los Angeles soon afterward.
        In 1967 she began to teach at the Westside School of Ballet in Santa Monica and became co-director of Westside Ballet with Yvonne Mounsey, its founder. Ms. Valaire's students included Monique Meunier and Jock Soto, principal dancers with the New York City Ballet.
        Ms. Valaire was also known for reconstructions of ballet classics. She worked with Mary Skeaping on American Ballet Theater's 1976 production of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' which she also staged for several other companies in the United States and abroad. Other reconstructions by Ms. Valaire included ''Swan Lake,'' ''Coppelia'' and ''Les Sylphides.''
        Ms. Valaire's marriage to Stephen Weiss ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Claudia Petursson of Kirkland, Wash., and Alison Tunney of Santa Monica; a son, Andrew Weiss of Los Angeles; a sister, Patricia Troop of London, and six grandchildren.
