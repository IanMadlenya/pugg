        Charles A. Walburg Jr., an obstetrician and gynecologist who practiced medicine in Harlem for more than 60 years, died Oct. 1 at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 87 and lived in Harlem.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his daughter Judith A. Walburg of New York City.
        Dr. Walburg, whose office was at Convent Avenue and 141st Street, was a former chief resident in his specialty at Harlem Hospital Center.
        He also helped to organize or was active as a volunteer in a number of community health organizations, including the Harlem unit of the American Cancer Society.
        A native of Brunswick, Ga., he received an undergraduate degree from Lincoln University in Lincoln, Pa., in 1929, and a medical degree from Howard University in 1934.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife of 33 years, Marie; a second daughter, Jean Walburg Humphrey of Greensboro, N.C.; a stepdaughter, Barbara Harris of Manhattan; a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.
