        Thomas D. Duane, an authority on ophthalmology who discovered the cause of the blackouts suffered by wartime pilots, died Sunday at a nursing home in Newtown, Pa. He was 75 and lived in Bedminster, Pa.
        The cause of death was complications of Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Duane twice received the Howe Medal, ophthalmology's highest award. He retired in 1981 as the head of ophthalmology at Jefferson Medical College and Wills Eye Hospital, both in Philadelphia.
        He was a former chairman of the American Medical Association's ophthalmology section and edited two standard reference works, "Clinical Ophthalmology" and "The Biomedical Foundations of Ophthalmology."
        As a Navy flight surgeon during the Korean War, he investigated the vision problems suffered by pilots when they were dive bombing. A general lack of blood circulation to the brain was suspected as the cause of these blackouts and less severe "grayouts," when color fades and vision narrows. But Dr. Duane found that the specific cause was a reduction in the blood supply to the retina.
        In 1972 he was among the first to describe valsalva hemorrhages in the eye, caused by unusual chest pressure. He also did research on diabetes, Cushing's syndrome, pituitary tumors and glaucoma.
        Dr. Duane, the son of an ophthalmologist, was born in Peoria, Ill. He earned his bachelor's degree at Harvard University, a medical degree and a master's in physiology at Northwestern University, and a doctorate in physiology at the University of Iowa.
        Surviving are his wife of 49 years, the former Julia McElhinney, a pediatrician; two sons, Joseph M., of Newtown Square, Pa., and Andrew T., of Coral Springs, Fla.; two daughters, Alexa D. Bresnan of Norwell, Mass., and Rachel D. Lee of Athens in Bradford County, Pa., and nine grandchildren.
