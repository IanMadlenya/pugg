        William I. Kaufman, a food and wine connoisseur and former television producer and director who wrote some 150 books about those and other subjects, died on Sunday in Livingston, Mont. He was 73 and lived in Eugene, Ore.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Michael Thoele, a family friend. Mr. Kaufman was in Montana researching children's rodeos.
        Mr. Kaufman signed up with the fledgling NBC network in 1947 and worked for 15 years in the new medium as a director, producer, casting director and sales director.
        He also began editing books advising aspiring directors, writers and announcers on careers in television.  His first epicurean work was "Cooking With the Experts" (Random House, 1955), a collection of 400 recipes from television cooks.
        After leaving NBC in 1963, he worked as a freelance writer, editor and photographer and began to write more frequently about food, including ethnic cuisines and dietary and natural-foods cooking.
        A native of Manhattan, he moved to California in 1979 and began writing extensively about its wines, a subject on which he became an often-quoted authority. He settled in Oregon five years ago.
        Mr. Kaufman is survived by his wife, Jacqueline; three sons, Lazarus, of Miami, Scott Nagel, of Belle Harbor, Queens, and Jeff Nagel, of Buffalo Grove, N.Y.; four daughters, Iva Kaufman, of Manhattan, Stephanie Nagel, of Washington, Deborah Weissman, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Marsha Weissman, of Syracuse, and 10 grandchildren.
