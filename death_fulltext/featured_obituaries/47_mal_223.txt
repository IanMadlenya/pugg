        William F. Pederson, an architect, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Mitchellville, Md. He was 82 years old and lived in New Caanan, Conn.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, a grandson, Mark Pedersen, said.
        Mr. Pedersen was the senior partner in William F. Pedersen & Associates, which he founded after World War II. It had offices in Manhattan and New Haven.
        In 1960, the firm won a competition for a memorial to honor President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A cluster of perpendicular tablets carrying famous words of the President was to stand on a 27-acre site between the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials connected to each by footpaths. Congress voted to reserve the site for the memorial and to provide $150,000 for holding the competition. Money for the memorial was to be raised by private subscription, but the project was never completed because of financial difficulties.
        The firm also designed the Hall of Minerals and Gems at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan.
        Mr. Pedersen retired in 1989, and the firm was dissolved.
        He was a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects and belonged to the Century Association and the Harvard Club of New York.
        Mr. Pedersen was born in Stamford, Conn., and graduated from Harvard College in 1931. He also received a degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.
        During World War II, he served in Naval intelligence.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Priscilla Auchincloss; a son, William F. Jr., of Washington; two daughters, K. Priscilla, of Manhattan, and Anne B., of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Helen McLaughlin, of Orleans, Mass.; a brother, Edward, of Stamford, Conn.; and four grandchildren.
