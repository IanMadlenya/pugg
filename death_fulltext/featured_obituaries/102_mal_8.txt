        Frederick M. Supper, the former chairman and owner of the Alexander Proudfoot Company, a management consulting firm in West Palm Beach, Fla., died on Sunday at his home in Palm Beach. He was 78 and had suffered from emphysema, family members said.
        Mr. Supper joined Alexander Proudfoot in 1949, when it was in Chicago and had only 10 employees. He bought the firm in 1970 from the founder's estate, and built it into a worldwide organization, with offices in Europe, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. By 1987, when Mr. Supper sold the firm to British investors, it had more than 1,000 employees and $150 million in annual revenues.
        Mr. Supper, who was born in Port Washington, Wis., graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1917.
        An avid croquet player, he was a co-founder and past president of the Croquet Foundation of America, and is in the Croquet Hall of Fame. He established the Croquet Hall of Fame Gallery in Newport, R.I.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Patricia McKeon; a daughter, Susan Madison of Everett, Wash.; two step-daughters, Kathleen Chace Larzelere of Bedford, N.Y., and Cynthia Chace Gray of Greenwich, Conn., and five grandchildren.
