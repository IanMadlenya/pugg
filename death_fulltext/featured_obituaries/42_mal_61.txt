        Dick Turpin, the first black fighter to win a British boxing title, died recently in Leamington Spa, English newspapers reported today. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Turpin was the eldest of three brothers in boxing, but he did not achieve the fame of Randolph Turpin, who beat Sugar Ray Robinson in 1951 for the world middleweight title. Jackie Turpin was a successful featherweight.
        The ability and popularity of the brothers ''made it impossible for the British Boxing Board of Control to sustain its iniquitous color bar,'' the obituary in The Times of London said.
        Mr. Turpin won the British Commonwealth title on May 10, 1948, knocking out Bos Murphy of New Zealand. On June 28, 1948, he beat Vince Hawkins for the British middleweight title.
