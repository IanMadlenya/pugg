        Mr. Andrews was a prolific writer and editor who specialized in art and architecture, but also produced several major biographical works and frequent critical essays.
        Among his most prominent works were a study of American architecture, ''Architecture, Ambition and Americans,'' published in 1955, and portraits of the Vanderbilt family, in 1941, Madame de Stael, in 1963, and Voltaire, in 1981. Early in his career, he also wrote surrealist fiction under the pseudonym Montagu O'Reilly.
        Mr. Andrews, who was born in Kenilworth, Ill., graduated from Harvard College in 1936. He worked as a banker before earning a Ph.D. in American history from Columbia University in 1956. He worked as curator of manuscripts at the New-York Historical Society from 1948 to 1956, and then as an editor for Charles Scribner's Sons before accepting a teaching position at Wayne State in 1964. He remained at Wayne State until his retirement in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth A., and a daughter, Elizabeth W. Andrews of Manhattan.
