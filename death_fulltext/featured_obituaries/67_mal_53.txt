        Herbert Stiefel, a retired New York advertising executive, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Portland, Ore. A former resident of Manhattan and Greenwich, Conn., he moved to Sunriver, Ore., since retiring five years ago. He was 75 years old.
        His family said he died after a brief illness.
        Mr. Stiefel worked for several Manhattan agencies before becoming president and chairman of his own agency, Stiefel/Raymond Advertising Inc., about 1960. He was a former board member of the American Theater Wing, the Tony selection committee and Marble Collegiate Church and a past president of Rotary of New York. Among his honors were the Horatio Alger Award and the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany.
        Mr. Stiefel is survived by his wife, Ginger; his son, Philip Stevens of Portland; his daughter, Gail Mitchell of Sunriver; five grandchildren; and two stepdaughters, Hillary McAllister and Jennifer Cole, both of New York.
        Correction:  August 13, 1992, Thursday
        An obituary headline yesterday about a retired New York advertising executive rendered his surname incorrectly. He was Herbert J. Stiefel. The obituary also referred incorrectly to his wife and to another survivor. His wife was the late Lucy Hillary Stiefel. The other survivor, Ginger Stiefel, was Mr. Stiefel's daughter-in-law.
