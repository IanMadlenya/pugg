        Herman Russell Branson, a physicist and former university president who helped to broaden the financing of black colleges in the 1970's and 1980's, died on Wednesday at Washington Hospital Center. He was 80 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, Herman E. Branson.
        A physicist at Howard University in Washington for 27 years, Dr. Branson became president of Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, in 1968 and three years later became the 10th president of Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, the nation's oldest black liberal arts college. He helped to found the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education in 1969.
        In 1970 he led a group of educators who visited the White House and told President Richard M. Nixon of the growing disparity in financing for higher education. Within six months the Nixon Administration had announced plans to raise Federal aid by some $30 million.
        He began his career in physics at Dillard University, shortly after earning a Ph.D. from the University of Cincinnati in 1939. From 1941 to 1968, he led the physics department at Howard, where he conducted research on sickle cell anemia.
        While a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology in 1948 under the direction of the scientist Linus Pauling, Dr. Branson developed a mathematical analysis of alpha helix, the primary structure of protein. Although Dr. Branson co-wrote a paper on the discovery the following year, it was commonly referred to by 1968 as among the scientific achievements of Dr. Pauling.
        Dr. Branson led in expanding Lincoln's financial resources by establishing ties with Pennsylvania's state colleges and universities. He retired in 1985.
        Besides his son, of Silver Spring, he is survived by his wife, Corolynne; a daughter, Corolynne Gertrude Branson of Washington; a sister, Margaret Southall of Washington, and a granddaughter.
