        Johnny Neun, one of only nine major league players to execute an unassisted triple play, died of pancreatic cancer Wednesday at Union Memorial Hospital. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Neun played first base for four years with the Detroit Tigers and two with the Boston Braves before he retired in 1931. He managed the Yankees temporarily in 1946 and managed the Cincinnati Reds in 1947 and 1948.
        His game-ending triple play came on May 31, 1927, in Detroit against Cleveland. The first two Cleveland batters -Glenn Myatt and Charlie Jamieson -reached base in the ninth inning. Homer Summa hit a line drive that Neun caught. Then he tagged Jamieson between first and second base and tagged second base for the putout on Myatt.
        Mr. Neun is survived by several nieces and nephews.
