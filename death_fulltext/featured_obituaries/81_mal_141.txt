        Julio Francisco Sorzano, a retired businessman who helped provide entertainment for American troops in World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Water Mill, L.I. He was 96.
        He had had a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Sorzano, a native of Brooklyn, had a lifelong interest in the theater. He distilled it to a collection of books about the American stage that grew to some 1,000 volumes, many of them rare.
        He donated the collection to the Southampton College Library of Long Island University. There it will form the nucleus of the Dorothy Dayton Sorzano Theater Library, named in memory of his wife and fellow devotee.
        Mr. Sorzano began his career as an export manager. After the attack on Pearl Harbor he concentrated on organizing and operating Camp Shows, a forerunner of the U.S.O. The organization grew into a vast enterprise that sent well-known entertainers to military bases in the United States and overseas.
        After the war he worked in the fields of executive search and corporate consultancy.
        He was a life member of the Players club. Together with his wife, he restored an 18th-century farmhouse in Water Mill in 1950 and used it as a retreat until retiring there in 1970.
        He is survived by his daughter, Dorothy Gene Obre of West Cornwall, Conn., and two sisters, Isabel Sorzano Ince of Garden City, L.I., and Francisca Sorzano of Far Rockaway, Queens.
