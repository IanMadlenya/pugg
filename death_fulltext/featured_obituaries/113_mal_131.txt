        Robert C. Meade, a retired State Supreme Court Justice on Long Island, who issued the state's first living will decision and oversaw the care of the artist Willem de Kooning, died last Sunday at his home in Great Neck. He was 88.
        Mr. Meade practiced law for five decades, mostly in public service. Following wartime service in the Army Counter-Intelligence Corps, he worked for the Nassau District Attorney's Office for 11 years.
        Elected to the State Supreme Court in 1971, he served until his retirement six years ago. In 1979, he ordered the respirator disconnected from Brother Joseph Charles Fox, 83, of Mineola, who had been in a coma for 66 days. He based his ruling on a "common-law right to bodily self-determination," the patient having clearly and repeatedly stated that he would not want to be kept alive by  artificial means.
        The case involving Willem de Kooning, a leading member of the Abstract Expressionist school, arose after the artist was stricken with Alzheimer's disease. Though continuing to paint in East Hampton, he was declared incapable in court of looking after his affairs, including an immense collection of paintings valued at at least $50 million.
        In complex preceedings before him in 1969, Judge Meade sorted out the claims  of various parties. He oversaw agreements reached among them as well as the appointment of a guardian and two conservators.
        Mr. Meade was born in Great Neck and graduated from St. Michael's College in  Vermont. He received a law degree from Fordham University Law School in 1939, after which he practiced law privately.
        He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Nancy King Meade; five sons, Robert C. Jr., of Brooklyn, Dennis, of Glen Head, L.I., Stephen, of Great Neck, Brian,  of Raymond, Me., and Philip, of Port Washington, L.I.; a daughter, Mary Jo Wenig, of Manhattan; a brother, Henry, of Great Neck; a sister, Anna Brown of Torrance, Calif., and three grandchildren.
