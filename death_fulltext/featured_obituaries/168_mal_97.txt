        John Francis Vorisek, who had a long career in movie production in New York, died on Jan. 8 at his home in Matawan, N.J. He was 75.
        Mr. Vorisek was a founding partner and president of Trans/Audio Inc., a postproduction sound studio in Manhattan. He and his partners started the company in 1973.
        He was a native of the Bronx and served in the Army Air Forces in World II. He was a licensed private pilot.
        He began his career at the original Reeves Sound Studios in New York. He worked as a technician, dealing with all phases of sound recording, before entering the administrative side.
        He became president of the studios in the 1960's and was elected a vice president of the parent company, Reeves Broadcasting.
        He left Reeves in 1971 and in 1973 joined his brother, Richard, to form Trans/Audio. The company was sold in 1987 to the California-based Todd-AO Corporation, but Mr. Vorisek remained a consultant and director of Todd-AO for several years while helping to develop its new postproduction studios in Manhattan.
        For 25 years he also operated his own consulting company, Sound Enterprises. He retired eight years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Marie Stringfield Vorisek, and a son, John R., of Pound Ridge, N.Y.
