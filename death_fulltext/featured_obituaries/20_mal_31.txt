        Werner Felfe, a member of East Germany's ruling Politburo and the nation's Agriculture Minister, died after suffering a heart attack today, the state press agency reported. He was 60 years old.
        It was not clear where his death occurred.
        Mr. Felfe was widely considered by diplomats to be a possible successor to Erich Honecker, the East German Communist Party leader, who is 76.
        Mr. Felfe was one of the youngest members of the 22-member Politburo.
        ''The party and our people have lost an outstanding party functionary and statesman,'' the press agency said.
        It said Mr. Felfe had ''worked tirelessly to help develop the socialist society in the German Democratic Republic in the interests of the working people.''
        Mr. Felfe was born on Jan. 4, 1928, in Grossrohrsdorf, about 12 miles northeast of Dresden in what is now East Germany.
        He joined the German Communist Party at the age of 17 and became a member of East Germany's Communist Party, the Socialist Unity Party, when the nation was formed after World War II.
        Mr. Felfe, a stocky man with silver hair, had recently spoken in favor of the programs for economic and political change instituted by the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and told Western visitors that East Germany needed similar changes.
        Western diplomats said Mr. Felfe had indicated that he believed East Germany should institute such programs only after personnel changes in the Politburo.
