        Vadim Valery Filatov, an eye doctor who directed a half-dozen centers for laser-assisted surgery in the New York region, died last Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 39 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        The cause was liver disease, his family said.
        Dr. Filatov, a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, was brought to this country at age 14. He graduated from Amherst College and received his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1990. He completed his residency in ophthalmology at Yale Medical School in 1994, and a fellowship in refractive surgery at Harvard a year later.
        He then joined a practice in Greenwich performing lasik surgery, which uses laser beams to correct a patient's vision. Setting out on his own in 1996, he directed clinics called Diamond Vision and, since 2001, Filatov Eye Institute, at locations in Greenwich, Westport and Glastonbury, Conn.; Garden City, N.Y.; Paramus, N.J.; and Manhattan.
        Dr. Filatov is survived by his wife, the former Isabelle Grunberg; his mother, Lillian Filatov of Greenwich; and three sons, Pierre, 8, Armand, 6, and Alexander, 1.
