        Salvatore Aiello, director of the North Carolina Dance Theater, died on Saturday at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, N.C. He was 51 and lived in Charlotte.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Peggy Howard, the company's press director.
        Mr. Aiello, who was born in Herkimer, N.Y., began his professional career in 1963 as a dancer with the Joffrey Ballet, and became a charter member of the Harkness Ballet the following year. From 1971 to 1979 he was a member of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, serving as a principal dancer, a ballet master and an associate director. He also danced with the Eglevsky Ballet and the Hamburg State Opera in the 1970's.
        Mr. Aiello choreographed for the Winnipeg, Eglevsky and Hamburg companies and for the Eddie Toussaint Dance Company, a Canadian jazz troupe. He also served as an assistant to Andre Eglevsky, the founder and director of the Eglevsky Ballet. Mr. Aiello's marriage to Marina Eglevsky, Mr. Eglevsky's daughter, ended in divorce.
        Mr. Aiello joined the North Carolina Dance Theater in 1978 as a resident choreographer and associate director and was named its artistic director in 1985. Among the ballets he created for the company was "Echoes of Presence/Les Sylphides," a reinterpretation of Michel Fokine's "Chopiniana."
        He is survived by his parents, of Herkimer.
