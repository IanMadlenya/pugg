        Alfred W. DiTolla, the president of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, died on Tuesday at his home in Glen Rock, N.J. He was 68.
        The cause was cancer, said his son Biff.
        Mr. DiTolla was the union's international president from 1986 until illness forced him to resign this month. During his tenure, membership rose to 76,000 from 60,000. He was previously an international representative of the union and an assistant to the president.
        He was born in Jackson Heights, Queens, and attended Fordham University and New York Law School. He began his career as a charter member of the Broadcasting Studio Employees Local 782, which he later merged into Radio and Television Sound Effects/Broadcasting Studio Employees Local 844. In 1980 he organized and became a charter member of Casino Hotel Employees Local 917 in Atlantic City.
        In addition to his son, of Barstow, Pa., he is survived by his wife, Kathleen Corcoran DiTolla; three daughters, Lourdes Fritz of Columbia, Md., Kathleen McCarty of Ridgewood, N.J., and Andrea Marshall of Chester, N.Y.; another son, Daniel, of Goshen, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.
