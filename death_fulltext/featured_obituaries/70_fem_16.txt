        Hadassah, a pioneer of Israeli and Indian dancing in America, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of cancer, said her husband, Milton Epstein.
        Hadassah, who was born in Jerusalem and whose original name was Hadassah Spira, became interested in Indian dancing at an early age. She studied dance in the United States and abroad, learning a wide range of Indian styles along with Javanese court dance, Japanese dance and modern dance. Her teachers included Ram Gopal and Jack Cole.
        Hadassah, a performer of special eloquence, made her professional debut in 1945 and continued to perform Indian, Israeli, Javanese and Balinese dance through the mid-1970's. She appeared at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., four times in the 1950's and 60's and toured India in 1959-60.
        Among Hadassah's best-known works was "Shuvi Nafshi" ("Return, Oh My Soul"), based on Psalm 116. Her "Tagore Suite," commissioned by the Tagore Centenary Committee, was performed for the first time in 1961.
        Hadassah was also a popular teacher, known for her great warmth, who taught Israeli and Indian dance across the United States and abroad. She was a faculty member, board member and chairwoman of the ethnic division at the New Dance Group Studio in Manhattan and continued teaching through the mid-1980's.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Harriet Silverstein of San Diego, and three brothers, Simon, also of San Diego, Israel, of Delray Beach, Fla., and Abraham, of Yardley, Pa.
