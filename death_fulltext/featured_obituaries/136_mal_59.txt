        James Carlton Tucker, a national sailing champion in multihulls, died last Thursday at the Fort Walton Beach Medical Center in Florida. He was 38.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his father, James.
        Tucker, who was known as Carlton, managed the Boat, a marina in his hometown of Fort Walton Beach that he and his father owned. From 1983 through 1993, he won five national championships in three classes of Hobie catamarans.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Alice; two children, James and Kaye; his parents, James and Lorraine, and a sister, Charlotte Hardy.
