        Dr. Robert Lincoln Leslie, a physician, printer and graphic artist who inspired generations of graphic artists, died Wednesday at the Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn after a brief illness. He was 101 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        In 1965, Dr. Leslie founded the Heritage of the Graphic Arts, a lecture series that brought hundreds of illustrious graphic artists, printers, typographers, designers, printing historians and bibliophiles to New York to talk about their work.
        In his 100th year, as president of the ''Typophiles,'' an organization of book lovers, he continued to handle its correspondence and arrange speakers for the monthly luncheon meetings.
        Dr. Leslie was born in Manhattan. He earned a medical degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1912.
        In 1920 he became the first industrial physician at McGraw-Hill's printing plant in Manhattan. There he met a Linotype technician named Sol Cantor with whom he opened a type-setting shop called ''The Composing Room.'' With it came a succession of related enterprises, including Gallery 303, one of the first galleries devoted to graphic arts, and PM/AD Magazine, a journal for production managers.
        His wife, Dr. Sarah Greenberg, a pediatrician, died in 1972.
        He is survived by a brother, Samuel, of the Bronx.
