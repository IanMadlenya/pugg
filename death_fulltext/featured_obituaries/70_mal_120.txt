        Prof. Julian Rachele, who helped in the research that led to the development of penicillin, died on Monday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and lived in Queens.
        He died of heart failure, said his wife, Anne.
        Professor Rachele, who was born in Brooklyn, earned three degrees from New York University: a bachelor's in 1934, a master's in 1935, and a doctorate in 1939.
        He was a former professor and dean at Cornell University Medical College.  He had joined the faculty there as a research assistant in the department of biochemistry in 1938. He was part of the team of researchers, led by Vincent Du Vigneaud, that produced the first laboratory synthesis of penicillin. Dr. Du Vigneaud won the Nobel Prize in 1955 for his research on penicillin.
        He held numerous administrative posts at Cornell Medical during his career, and was dean of the Graduate School of Medical Sciences there from 1978 to 1982.
        In addition to his wife of 53 years, Anne, Professor Rachele is survived by a daughter, Linda Burke, of South Salem, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
