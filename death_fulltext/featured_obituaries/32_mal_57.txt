        Mr. Sendzimir was a native of Lvov, Poland, where he studied at the Technical University. When World War I ended, he went to Shanghai, where he founded the first wire and nail manufacturing concern in China. He then developed the galvanizing process named for him that is now patented and used around the world.
        His inventions brought him many honors, including the Brinell Gold Medal that was presented to him in 1974 by King Gustav of Sweden, the 20th Century Pilgrims Award presented in 1976 by Gov. Ella T. Grasso of Connecticut and the Liberty Award presented in 1986 by Mayor Edward I. Koch.
        Mr. Sendzimir was a member of the board of trustees of the Kosciuszko Foundation of New York, for which he established a fund for research, cultural and scholarly exchanges between the United States and Poland.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Berthe Bernoda; three sons, Michael, of Woodbury, Conn., Stanley, of Paris, and Jan Peter, of Jupiter; a daughter, Wanda, of Boston; two sisters, Aniela Kecka and Terenia Nechay, both of Lvov; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
