        He died of hypercalcemia, a blood disease, a spokeswoman for the university said.
        Dr. Baumer was educated at Yale and joined the faculty in 1942 after teaching at New York University. He was named a full professor in 1954 and Randolph W. Townsend Jr. Professor of History in 1963. He also contributed extensively to scholarly journals and was the author of four books on the history of intellectual thought: ''Main Currents of Western Thought,'' ''Religion and the Rise of Skepticism,'' ''Modern European Thought'' and ''The Early Tudor Theory of Kingship.''
        He is survived by his wife, Bodil; a daughter, Joanna Permut of Guilford, Conn., and a grandchild.
