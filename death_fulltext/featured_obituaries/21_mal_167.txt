        Luther (Wimpy) Lassiter, who won six world billiards championships, died Tuesday. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Lassiter, who was considered by many to be one of the greatest nine-ball players of all time, was found by a nephew in his home in Elizabeth City, the town in which he was raised.
        Mr. Lassiter, who had been in failing health, apparently collapsed a few hours before, not far from the pool table where he still played every day, according to James Todd, a family friend.
        ''I know he played yesterday and probably this morning because I went in and there were still seven balls and a cue ball and his cue stick on the table,'' Mr. Todd said. ''Pool meant everything to him. He told me once that if he couldn't play pool, he didn't know what he would do.'' Praise From Mosconi
        Willie Mosconi, a 15-time world champion, said Mr. Lassiter ''thrived on the game of pool.''
        ''That was his life,'' Mr. Mosconi said from his home in Haddon Heights, N.J. ''Half the time he didn't eat a good meal. He was a very good player, one of those quiet sort of guys hanging around pool halls.''
        Mr. Lassiter was given his nickname for his habit of devouring hot dogs in high school much like the Wimpy character in the Popeye comic strip ate hamburgers. Mr. Lassiter dropped out of school at 16 and began hustling pool games.
        In the 1940's and 50's, Mr. Lassiter played in pool halls throughout the country. He once listed his biggest payoffs as $15,000 in a week, $11,000 in a single night.
        He is survived by two brothers and three sisters.
