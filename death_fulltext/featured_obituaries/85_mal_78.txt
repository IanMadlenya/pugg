        Dr. Dante V. Bizzarri, a physician and an inventor who helped make anesthesiology a major medical specialty, died on Feb. 1 at his home in New Rochelle, N.Y. He was 80.
        The cause was cancer, said Wilfried Schmid, his son-in-law.
        Dr. Bizzarri helped prevent aspiration pneumonia, the leading cause of death during anesthesia in the 1950's. In this type of pneumonia, contents of the stomach are drawn into the lungs. To protect against this, Dr. Bizzarri co-invented a laryngoscope blade, which manipulates the tongue and facilitates the correct placement of an oxygen tube.
        He also advanced the use of an esophageal obturator, a balloon-like device that widens the trachea and forms a seal between the trachea and the oxygen tube.
        He graduated from New York Medical College in 1942. He was one of the early certified specialists of the American Board of Anesthesiology. He is credited with advancing techniques for continuous spinal anesthesia and leading the trend toward the use of regional anesthesia instead of general anesthesia.
        Dr. Bizzarri was chief of service at Metropolitan Hospital and chairman of the Department of Anesthesia at New York Medical College. He retired as chairman in 1985 and received the school's Distinguished Service Award that year. He continued to teach until last year.
        He is survived by his wife, Rosalie, and his sister, Nancy Gilhooly, both of New Rochelle; three daughters, Alida Naederof New Rochelle, Dr. Leonora Bizzarri of Southampton, L.I., and Dr. Marina Bizzarri-Schmid of Lincoln, Mass., and four grandchildren.
