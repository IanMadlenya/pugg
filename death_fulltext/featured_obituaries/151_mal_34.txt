        Robert Marshall Viles, a former dean and president of Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, N.H., died on Monday in a swimming accident while on vacation in France. He was 60 and lived in Concord.
        The law center said Mr. Viles drowned off the coast of Brittany when he was pulled under by strong ocean currents.
        Mr. Viles came to Concord in 1973 to help start the law center as its associate dean and to help guide the school toward independence from Franklin Pierce College three years later. Since then, he helped to build the center's national reputation in the field of intellectual property law.
        He became dean in 1976, president in 1992, and last month, vice chairman of the board of trustees.
        Mr. Viles was born June 12, 1939, in Skowhegan, Me., and graduated magna cum laude from Bates College in Lewiston, Me., in 1961. He earned a Bachelor of Laws as a Root-Tilden Scholar at New York University Law School in 1964 and a Master of Laws at Yale University in 1965.
        He then taught at the University of Kentucky College of Law until he became research director for the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States in 1972 and 1973. He was a member of the National Bankruptcy Conference.
        Besides his wife of 30 years, Bruce Earman Viles, he leaves no immediate survivors.
