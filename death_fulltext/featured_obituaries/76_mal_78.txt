        Edmund Burke Jr., a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, died on Thursday in Buffalo, his family said.
        He was 88 and died of pneumonia.
        Mr. Burke also worked as a lawyer for Texaco Inc. for 16 years, and was active in the community of Greenwich, Conn., where he lived from 1954 to 1983.
        Mr. Burke, who was born in New York City, attended Princeton University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated from Princeton when he was 19. He finished Harvard Law School at the age of 21, and then worked for six years at the firm Cotton & Franklin in New York City.
        In 1933, after Roosevelt was inaugurated President, Mr. Burke joined the Public Works Administration as a lawyer. He later moved to the Securities and Exchange Commission, where he was the principal author of the Trust Indenture Act of 1938.
        In 1940, when he was 35, Mr. Burke was named a commissioner of the S.E.C., at the time the youngest commissioner ever appointed. The same year, he married Marian McDonagh, who remained his wife until her death in 1984.
        Mr. Burke resigned from the S.E.C. in 1943 and entered private law practice. He joined Texaco in 1954, where he worked on legal matters affecting Texaco's interest in the Middle East.
        He is survived by five children: Edmund 3d, of Santa Cruz, Calif.; Joseph, of Washington; Gregory, of Bayside, Queens; Nancy B. Ross, of Buffalo, and Sally Glew, of Seattle. A third daughter, Jane B. Doyle, died in 1986.
