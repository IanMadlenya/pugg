        David Dolgenos, a lawyer and real estate investor who set aside much of his own office in SoHo as a contemporary art gallery, died on Tuesday in a taxi on his way to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, said Jeffrey Newman, a partner in the firm of Dolgenos Newman & Cronin.
        Mr. Dolgenos was born in Brooklyn and was a graduate of City College and Yale Law School. He was a partner at Marshall, Bratter, Greene, Allison & Tucker, where his clients included John Lennon.
        In 1982, he was a founder of Dolgenos Bergen & Newman. In its former office on Wooster Street and its current office at 96 Spring Street, near Broadway, the firm has included a gallery called the Work Space.
        Mr. Dolgenos is survived by his wife, Nancy Dunbar; two daughters, Carolyn Padulli of Manhattan and Peggy Neklason of Santa Cruz, Calif.; two sons, Peter, of Manhattan and Tom, of Philadelphia; two step-children, Gabriel Portnof and Jennie Portnof, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
