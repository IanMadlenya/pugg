        Arthur Steig, the founder of an art-supply manufacturing firm whose products are widely used by artists and graphic designers, died of a heart attack Monday at his home in Lakewood, N.J. He was 74 years old.
        An artist, a poet, an inventor and a businessman, Mr. Steig developed dozens of art supplies over the years, including Luma Colors, a line of brilliant watercolors, and calligraphic inks that would not clog technical pens.
        Mr. Steig occasionally exhibited drawings - mainly still lifes and figures - in galleries in the Northeast, and published poetry in a variety of magazines and journals.
        He is survived by his wife, Aurora; a brother, the cartoonist William Steig, of Kent, Conn.; two daughters, Laurie, of Newton, Mass., and Susanna, of Pleasantville, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
