        Joseph Konzal, a sculptor, died on Nov. 29 at his home in New York City. He was 80.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Teresa.
        Mr. Konzal used a variety of materials in his abstract sculptures, working in cast metals, wood and found objects. In New York, he had shows at the Bertha Schaefer and Andre Zarre galleries. His work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington and the Tate Gallery in London.
        Mr. Konzal, who was born in Milwaukee, also taught sculpture at a number of schools and cultural institutions, among them the Brooklyn Museum Art School, Queens College, Adelphi University and Kent State University.
