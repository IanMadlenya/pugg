        John Kenyon, a scholar of Stuart England and a prolific author on its history, died on Jan. 6 at a hospital near his home in Dereham, Norfolk, England. He was 68.
        Citing his health after a cancer operation, he retired in 1994 after seven years as the first Joyce and Elizabeth Hall Distinguished Professor of Early Modern British History at the University of Kansas in Lawrence. He specialized in 17th-century British history from the Stuart kings to the Cromwell era and the English civil wars.
        Professor Kenyon was part of a "brain drain" from British universities that  benefited American schools during the years of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's budget cuts. He left the Highlands of Scotland, where he was professor of modern history at the University of St. Andrews, for the flatlands  of Kansas and larger salaries and research grants.
        He was known for a scholarly attention to detail and an ability to extract every nuance from his sources. He distrusted fads and was skeptical of theories  not fully backed by historical fact.
        His first book, "Robert Spencer, Earl of Southerland" (1958), grew from his doctoral thesis. Others included "The Stuarts" (1959), "The Popish Plot" (1972), "The History Men: The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance" (1984) and "The Civil Wars of England" (1988).
        John Philipps Kenyon was born in Sheffield, England. He received his B.A. at  the University of Sheffield in 1948, was an officer in the Royal Air Force and earned his Ph.D. in 1954 at Cambridge University.
        He started his academic career at Cambridge, advanced to professor of history at the University of Hull and joined the faculty at St. Andrews in 1981. Over the years he also lectured at Columbia University, the University of Chicago and Oxford University.
        He is survived by his wife of 33 years, Angela Ewart Kenyon; a son, and two daughters.
