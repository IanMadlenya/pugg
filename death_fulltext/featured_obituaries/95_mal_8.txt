        Ralph Stein, a writer, cartoonist and illustrator whose works appeared in dozens of publications, died on Sunday at the Saybrook Convalescent Hospital in Old Saybrook, Conn. He was 85 and lived in Westbrook, Conn.
        He died after a long illness, said his wife, Muriel.
        Mr. Stein was born in New York City and began his career as a photographer and illustrator at The World-Telegram. During World War II he was the staff cartoon editor for Yank, the Army weekly, where he was also a writer and photographer. He was co-author, with Harry Brown, of "It's a Cinch, Private Finch," a humorous book about Army life, and many of his cartoons from Yank were compiled into a book called "What Am I Laughing At?" After the war, he drew and wrote the "Popeye" comic strip for five years and illustrated "Here's How" for King Features.
        An authority on cars, Mr. Stein was the author of "Treasury of the Automobile" and "Sports Cars of the World." His other books include "The Pinup From 1852 to Now" and "The Great Inventions."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, David, of Essex, Conn., and Jonathan, of Waterbury, Conn.; a daughter, Elizabeth Turcoof Gloucester, Mass., and three grandchildren.
