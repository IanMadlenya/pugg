        Eric Louis McKitrick, a Columbia University historian who chronicled the evolution of the American republic, died on April 24 at Amsterdam House, a home for the elderly, in Manhattan. A resident of the Upper West Side, he was 82.
        Dr. McKitrick was best known for his ''Andrew Jackson and Reconstruction'' (1960), reissued by Oxford University Press in 1988. He was the co-author, with Stanley Elkins, of ''The Age of Federalism: The Early American Republic, 1788-1800'' (Oxford University Press, 1995). Both remain in print.
        Other subjects of his writing included slavery and the Old South, as well as the development of the American party system.
        Born in Battle Creek, Mich., he graduated in 1949 from Columbia, where he also received an M.A. in 1951 and a Ph.D. in 1959. He taught at the University of Chicago and at Rutgers University's Douglass College in the 1950's before joining the history faculty at Columbia in 1960. He retired as an emeritus professor of history in 1989.
        Dr. McKitrick is survived by his wife of 55 years, Edyth Stevenson McKitrick; two sons, Frederick L. II of Long Branch, N.J., and Charles K. of Norwell, Mass.; two daughters, Enid L. McKitrick of Gaithersburg, Md., and Mary C. McKitrick of Northampton, Mass.; a brother, Keith G. of New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; and nine grandchildren.
