        Edwin G. Roberts, a retired retailing executive who headed large store chains from New York to Chicago and Los Angeles, died Tuesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 73 years old.
        He apparently died of a heart attack, said his son Brian.
        Mr. Roberts was a native of Chicago. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin and earned a master's degree at the Harvard School of Business. With a background in fashion marketing, he began and ended his career in Los Angeles, starting there at Bullock's-Westwood.
        In 1957, he joined Peck & Peck in New York as vice president and general merchandise manager. Six years later, he became president of Franklin Simon department stores and a vice president of its parent, the City Stores Company.
        Mr. Roberts moved to Chicago in 1972 to become president of the J. L. Hudson Company one of the nation's largest retailers and part of what is now the Dayton Hudson Company of Minneapolis. He returned to Los Angeles in 1978 as president of the May Company, a chain operated by the May Department Stores Company of St. Louis. He retired from May 10 years ago.
        In addition to his son Brian, a resident of Los Angeles, Mr. Roberts is survived by another son, Jean-Marc of Paris; a daughter, Linda Roberts of Santa Barbara, Calif., and three grandchildren.
