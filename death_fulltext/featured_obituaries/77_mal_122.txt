        Raymond Thuilier, the chef who founded the Oustau de Baumaniere, one of the fine restaurants of France, died on Sunday at his home in Carita, near Les Baux-de-Provence. He was 96.
        Mr. Thuilier opened his luxury hotel-restaurant in a converted sheep farm at Les Baux in 1946 and ran it until 1990, when he was succeeded by his grandson, Jean-Andre Charial. Mr. Thuilier was known for his classic French cuisine, with multiple courses and distinct sauces, while his grandson has tried to lighten and streamline the cuisine.
        In 1954, Mr. Thuilier's Baumaniere won Michelin's three-star rating, which it kept for 35 years. Although Mr. Charial had worked with his grandfather as executive chef since 1971, the restaurant was demoted to two stars in 1990, after Mr. Thuilier relinquished the reins.
        "It is not only what is on the plate that matters," Mr. Thuilier said in 1990. "It is the environment, the welcome. A grand Bordeaux in a bad glass is no longer a grand Bordeaux."
        Since 1971, Mr. Thuilier served as Mayor of Les Baux, a hilltop village of 450 inhabitants, which has become a tourist attraction in southern France.
        He was born in Chambery, Savoie, and studied law at Lyons. After many years as a civil servant, he began his restaurant career at Les Baux.
        A renowned chef, he took part in many gastronomic events in France and abroad and was the author of several books and many articles. He was a Commander of the Legion of Honor.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jeanine Charial of Paris, and his grandson, Mr. Charial, of Carita.
