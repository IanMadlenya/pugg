        Giulio Carlo Argan, a leading art historian of Italy and an expert on the modern and Baroque periods, died on Thursday. He was 83 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Argan achieved political prominence as the first Communist Mayor of Rome, a position he held for three years from 1976, and as a Senator in the Italian Parliament from 1983 until this year.
        Mr. Argan was born in Turin, Italy, on May 17, 1909. His intellectual development was shaped by the heady cultural activity in the city in the early 1930's, where he studied the works of Karl Marx and Antonio Gramsci and molded his subsequent politics.
        It was as an art history professor at the University of Rome from 1959 to 1979, however, that he achieved widespread recognition for his deeply personal interpretation of subjects ranging from the Romanesque architecture of the 11th century to the Minimalists of the late 1960's.
        He was a prolific writer, and his best-known works include studies of Francesco Borromini, the 17th-century Italian Baroque architect, and the Bauhaus architect Walter Gropius.
        His highly complex history of art, published from 1968 to 1970 and comprising the three-volume "Storia dell'Arte" and the single-volume "Storia Moderna dell'Arte," is regarded as a core work for all Italian students of art.
        He is survived by a daughter, Paola.
