        C. Scoby Stroman, a drummer and jazz dancer, died on March 28 at Fort Hamilton Veterans' Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 64 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said Jo Ann Cheatham, a friend.
        Mr. Stroman was born in Brooklyn. He began performing as a tap dancer when he was 5 and soon after began playing the drums. As an adult he became known as  a master sand dancer and an innovative leading performer of scat dancing, a softshoe rhythm-dance that involves the upper body as well as the feet and legs and draws on American popular dancing and African and Brazilian ethnic styles.
        Mr. Stroman was even better known for his drumming. John S. Wilson described  him as "a brilliantly vital and imaginative drummer" in a 1970 review in The New York Times. Mr. Stroman also performed what he called "drummetry," a combination of poetry and drumming. He appeared in concerts, documentary films, and music and dance festivals throughout the country and in Canada, Europe and Africa. He  performed live and in recordings with many music and dance artists, among them Max Roach, his primary teacher, Randy Weston, Barry Harris, Baba Olatunji, Ed Stout, Roland Alexander, Mickey Davidson and Dianne McIntyre. He also performed  with Langston Hughes.
        He is survived by a half-sister, Carrie Mae Benning, of North Carolina.
