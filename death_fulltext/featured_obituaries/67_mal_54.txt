        Leslie Tillett, a painter, author and textile designer, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77 years old.
        Mr. Tillett died of lymphoma, said a son, Seth.
        For nearly four decades, Mr. Tillett and his wife, D. D., combined an artist-craftsman approach to textile design with mass-production techniques.
        The Tilletts operated their own business in Manhattan since the early 1950's, producing designs for individual clients and companies.
        They were consultants for Peru, Lesotho and China, which were trying to build their own design industries. And they were advisers to Americans seeking to use the designs of local people to establish textile-manufacturing businesses. Their projects included the Design Works of Bedford-Stuyvesant Inc. in Brooklyn and the Cloth Company of Nantucket, Mass.
        Mr. Tillett devoted himself to painting for the last 15 years. He is survived by his wife; two sons, Dek, of Monterey, Mass., and Seth of Manhattan, and a daughter, Linnaea, of Manhattan.
