        Edwin J. Kenney Jr., a professor of English at Colby College in Waterville, Me., died on Tuesday at the Mid-Maine Medical Center in Waterville. He was 50 years old and lived in China, Me.
        He died of cancer, said Mary Ellen Matava, a college spokeswoman.
        Professor Kenney, a native of Hackensack, N.J., graduated from Hamilton College in 1963 and earned master's and doctoral degrees from Cornell University. He joined the Colby faculty in 1968.
        He became an associate professor in 1974 and a full professor in 1982. Last year, at the age of 49, he was named the college's first Distinguished Teaching Professor of Humanities, a post he recently relinquished because of his illness.
        He was the author of "Elizabeth Bowen," a biography of the Irish novelist, which was published in 1975 by the Bucknell University Press, and wrote many critical essays on English and American novelists of the 19th and 20th centuries. His essay and memoir "Waves" is to be published this winter by Epoch, a literary magazine.
        Professor Kenney is survived by his wife, the novelist Susan Kenney; two children, James and Anne, both of China, Me.; his father, Edwin Sr., of Shark River Hills, N.J., and two sisters, Joyce Kenney of Shark River Hills and Virginia Kenney, of Packanack Lake, N.J.
