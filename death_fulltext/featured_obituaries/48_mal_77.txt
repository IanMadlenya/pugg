        William (Bill) Byrd, whose 115 victories gained from 1932 to 1949 for the Columbus Blue Birds and the Elite Giants of Nashville, Washington and Baltimore were the fourth highest total by a pitcher in Negro leagues baseball history, died of cancer on Friday at the Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He was 83 years old.
        Pitching statistics, incompletely documented for games in the Negro leagues because of negligible coverage by newspapers and irregular scheduling, list Byrd, who lost 72 games, fourth in total victories behind Bill Foster, 137; Satchel Paige, 123, and Andy Cooper, 118.
        Mr. Byrd is survived by his wife, Hazel; a son, Ronald, and three daughters, Sylvia Johnson, Dr. Ruth McArtis, and Barbara Rooths of Washington.
