        Francis E. Brennan, a retired art director and a cartoonist, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82 and lived in Queens.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Brennan helped plan Sports Illustrated, redesigned Newsweek's logo and proposed "Life's Picture History of World War II," a precursor to Time-Life Books. He also helped oversee the design of the Time-Life Buildings in London and Manhattan.
        Starting at Conde Nast in 1933, Mr. Brennan became art director of British Vogue and House and Garden. Joining Life in 1937, he then became art director of Fortune and from 1947 to 1961 was art adviser to the editor in chief of Time, Life and Fortune. He later was a vice president of McCann-Erickson and a freelance consultant. He was an assistant to McCall's president from 1966 to 1968 and then a Newsweek design consultant until 1975.
        In later years he turned to cartooning. His work was published in several magazines and shown at galleries.
        Mr. Brennan studied at the University of Wisconsin and the Chicago Art Institute. In World War II, he served in the Army and held Government posts as chief of visual presentation for strategic planning and graphics chief for military publications and propaganda.
        His first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Frances M. Myers, an artist; two sons, Richard, of Brooklyn, and Christopher, of Philadelphia; two daughters, Elizabeth Greenhaw of Crosbyton, Tex., and Julia Babb of Pemaquid, Me.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
