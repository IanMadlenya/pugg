        Dr. David Shainberg, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, died on Dec. 5 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He was 61 and had homes in Manhattan and Wellfleet, Mass.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Dr. Shainberg was a native of Memphis and a graduate of Columbia College and the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. He trained at the American Institute for Psychoanalysis, served with the Navy Medical Corps as a lieutenant commander and had been in private practice in New York since 1967.
        He was the author of many papers and a book, "The Transforming Self" (1973). A friend of Jiddu Krishnamurti, the late Indian religious philosopher, he arranged for a dialogue between him and psychoanalysts in New York in 1975. Videotaped discussions with Krishnamurti and David Bohm, a physicist, in 1976, entitled "The Power of Illusions," were published as a book, "The Wholeness of Life," in 1979.
        Dr. Shainberg withdrew from full-time practice in 1981 to devote more time to painting in an abstract expressionist style. His work was shown in galleries in Manhattan, Wellfleet and Provincetown, Mass.
        Dr. Shainberg is survived by his wife, Catherine De Segonzac; two sons, Steven of Los Angeles and Sam of Manhattan; a daughter, Nancy Shainberg, also of Manhattan; his mother, Dorothy, of Memphis; and a brother, Lawrence, of Manhattan.
