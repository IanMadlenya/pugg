        Paul W. Briggs, who was Superintendent of Schools in Cleveland when a Federal judge ordered busing for desegregation 11 years ago, died of a brain hemorrhage Friday. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Briggs, most recently a visiting professor at Arizona State University here, served as Schools Superintendent in the Cleveland suburb of Parma from 1957 until 1964. He then became Superintendent in Cleveland and held the job for 14 years, leading a building program that produced 40 new schools.
        His tenure included a stormy period during which Judge Frank Battisti, finding that many of the new schools had been built in a geographic pattern that fostered segregation, ordered the crosstown busing of students.
        Mr. Briggs resigned in 1978, a week after Judge Battisti had ordered the school board to hire an administrative team that would operate independently of the Superintendent in carrying out the busing.
        Under Mr. Briggs, the Cleveland schools were the first in the country to provide federally financed breakfasts for poor children. He promoted blacks to administrative positions, opened vocational schools to more blacks and created schools for handicapped children.
        He is survived by his wife, Arvilla; a son, James Briggs of Tempe; a daughter, Betty Ann Washburn of Delaware, Ohio, and five grandchildren.
