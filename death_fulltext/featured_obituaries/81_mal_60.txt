        Dr. Henry H. Perlman, a pioneer in pediatric dermatology, died on Sunday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 97 and lived in Philadelphia, where he practiced medicine for more than 70 years.
        Dr. Perlman was honorary clinical professor in both pediatrics and dermatology at the Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. He wrote a textbook, "Pediatric Dermatology," published in 1960, which helped establish the field as a recognized subspecialty in medicine.
        He was born in Philadelphia and began his career as a pharmacist after graduating from the Philadephia College of Pharmacy and Science in 1913. He graduated from the Jefferson Medical College in 1918 and joined the Philadelphia Children's Hospital in 1926. He began lecturing on pediatric dermatology and in the 1940's established the nation's first complete dermatology clinic for children, at the Skin and Cancer Hospital in Philadelphia.
        In his private practice, he said, he preferred to prescribe drugs that had long been in use, so their effects were known. In many instances, he said in the 1980's, he preferred to mix his own medicines, tailoring them to the individual needs of patients.
        In 1976, when the Society of Pediatric Dermatology was founded, he was voted its only honorary member.
        He is survived by his wife, Ann; a sister, Sara Price, of Philadelphia; a stepson, Dr. William Marcus, of Silver Spring, Md., and five stepgrandchildren.
