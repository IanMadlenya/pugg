        Arthur Seelen, a former actor who with his wife, Rozanne, owned the Drama Book Shop in Manhattan, the oldest performing-arts bookstore in the United States, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 76.
        In 1958 Mr. Seelen bought the store from Marjorie Seligman, who founded it in 1923. Mr. Seelen and his wife, who survives him, were married in 1980 and ran the business together.
        The store, which has 40,000 titles, including plays, biographies and theatrical histories, ranging from the popular to the academic and esoteric, is a meeting ground for actors, playwrights, directors and others. On a bulletin board at the entrance aspiring performers can find out about work opportunities in and out of the theater.
        Born Arthur Seelenfreund in Brooklyn, Mr. Seelen graduated from City College of New York. While working as a chemical engineer in Columbus, Ohio, he acted in plays and then continued his theater career in New York. He appeared in children's theater and on Broadway, as an understudy, in ''The Wall,'' Millard Lampell's 1960 adaptation of the John Hersey novel.
        Mr. Seelen, who took pride in the variety of the books in his store, said that his motto was, ''If we don't have something here, we want to know why.''
