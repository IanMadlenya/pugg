        Dr. Robert Malcolm Ellsworth, an ophthalmologist who specialized in eye cancer, died on Sunday at Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. He was 65 and lived in Englewood.
        The cause was cancer, said Dr. D. Jackson Coleman, chief of the Department of Ophthalmology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
        At his death, Dr. Ellsworth was professor of ophthalmology and department vice chairman at the twin institutions. He also served as director of the Oncology Center. His skill in treating tumors earned him an international reputation and attracted students from around the world.
        "Dr. Ellsworth was the world's leading authority on tumors of the eye," Dr. Coleman said, "particularly retinoblastoma, a rare eye tumor in childen."
        The disease is a usually inherited condition growing from germ cells in the eyes of infants and children. Moving rapidly, it can spread through the optic nerve to the brain and requires early diagnosis for treatment. 40 Years of Study
        Dr. Ellsworth made it a central part of his nearly 40 years of studying and played an important role in bringing the cure rate from 10 percent to better than 90 percent during that period.
        He was born in eastern Pennsylvania, the son of a physician, and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton University in 1949. He then trained at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Early in his career he studied under Dr. Algernon Reese at the Edward S. Harkness Eye Institute at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center where he then worked in his specialty. He went to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1979.
        Dr. Ellsworth's wife, the former Grace Foster, died in 1985. He is survived by a son, Robert Jr., of Springhill, La.; a daughter, Laura Ellsworth of Pittsburgh, and his companion, Wendie Daly.
