        Leonard Lesser, a lawyer, advocate for the poor and union official who worked in Washington for almost 50 years, died on Wednesday at the home of his daughter in Washington.  He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter, Susan Leighton.
        Mr. Lesser began his career in Washington in 1939 as a lawyer with the Federal Security Agency, a forerunner of what today is the Department of Health and Human Services. He transferred to the Department of Labor during World War II.
        In 1949 Mr. Lesser moved to Detroit to serve as a lawyer with the United Automobile Workers union, and in 1955 he returned to Washington to become general counsel to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        In 1968 Mr. Lesser left the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and helped found the Center for Community Change, a national philanthropic organization that provides support and advocacy for low-income neighborhoods. He remained as an official of the group until his death.
        During his career Mr. Lesser made contributions to legislation affecting expanded pension and unemployment benefits, health insurance programs and welfare.
        Mr. Lesser was a graduate of City College of New York and Harvard Law School.
        His wife, Muriel, died in 1974. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, Thomas, of Conway, Mass.; his companion, Joan Aron of Washington, and three grandchildren.
