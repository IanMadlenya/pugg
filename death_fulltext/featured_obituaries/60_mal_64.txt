        Stephen B. Judelson, a retired Wall Street executive and a pioneer in the high-yield "junk bond" business, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan.
        Mr. Judelson, who was 56 years old and had a second residence in Quogue, L.I., died of cancer, his family said.
        "He was one of the senior people in junk bonds, a leader," said Damon Mezzacappa, who worked with him and is now a general partner at Lazard Freres & Company. "He was seen as the Mike Milken -- without the negatives -- of the East Coast," he said.
        Mr. Judelson retired last year as a managing director of Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment banking firm. He previously held the same title at L. F. Rothschild, an investment banking firm and brokerage. Brooklyn Native
        He was born in Brooklyn, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1956 and from the Columbia School of Business in 1957 and then served in the Army.
        In his career in finance, he worked his way up from an analyst to salesman and trader. He was a portfolio fund manager for Channing mutual funds and also worked at F. S. Smithers, a stock and bond trading company. In 1973 he joined Morgan Stanley, where he helped develop its fledgling corporate bond department.
        Moving to Rothschild in 1976, he flourished in the new field of junk bonds. Rejoining Morgan Stanley in 1985, he became a managing director the next year and guided the development of its entry into the high-yield bond business.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Carol Reinisch; a daughter, Diana W., of Manhattan; a son, Andrew R., of Weston, Conn., and a sister, Lila Berger of North Hollywood, Calif.
