        Joseph Porrello, a tenor who performed opera, musical theater and cabaret music and also taught, died on Monday at the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in Manhattan. He was 56 years old and lived in Greenwich Village.
        He died of AIDS, said Joseph Porter, a friend.
        Mr. Porrello appeared with several opera companies, including the Metropolitan Opera and the Washington Opera. He was a frequent recitalist, and in 1971 gave the premiere of four songs by Gian Carlo Menotti, at Merkin Concert Hall.
        Mr. Porrello was born in Bayville, L.I., and held degrees from the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music. He performed in the road companies of several Broadway musicals, including "Zorba," and taught voice at the Actors Institute and cabaret performing at the New School.
        He is survived by four sisters: Mary, of New York City; Gilda, of Bayville, L.I.; Ellen, of Westbury, L.I., and Lily Saffold of Los Angeles, and three brothers: Ben, of E. Islip, L.I.; Lou, of Bellmore, L.I., and Sal, of Eustis, Fla.
