        Frank Morelli, the president of New York City's largest public employees' coalition, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 59 and lived in Bohemia, L.I.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, his office said.
        Since 1983 Mr. Morelli was president of District Council 37 of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. As such he presided over the A.F.S.C.M.E.'s executive board and the Delegate Assembly, the council's governing body.
        District Council 37 claims more than 130,000 members in 56 locals. Mr. Morelli had also been president of Local 983 of the Motor Vehicle Operators Union since 1974.
        "Frank's passing is a tremendous loss for the union and the humanrights movement," said Stanley Hill, executive director of District 37. "Frank was a committed and loyal trade unionist who saw the union movement as A. Philip Randolph saw it -- as a way to uplift society."
        Mr. Morelli was active in many civil rights organizations, including the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, and he was a founding member of the Italo-American Coalition. He played a role in a 1962 strike that resulted in the first welfare fund for non-uniformed city employees.
        A native of Corona, Queens, he became a city employee and rose through the ranks of Local 983. He was elected a vice president of District Council 37 in 1975 and a vice president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. in 1987.
        Mr. Morelli is survived by his wife, Paula; a son, Joseph; two daughters, Dolores Gates and Dana Schmitt; a sister, Constance Marigliano, and five grandchildren.
