He was 74 years old. Professor Zebot, a graduate of the University of Ljubljana, came to the United States in 1947 and taught at Duquesne University before joining the Georgetown faculty in 1958. He retired in 1978 but continued to write and lecture until his final illness.
        His latest book, a political history of the Slovenian nation addressed to the young people of the region, was published last month in Austria. According to colleagues, it is being distributed surreptitiously in the Slovenian republic.
