        Bill Branche, a former copy editor at The New York Times and editorial page editor of The Niagara Gazette in Niagara Falls, died on Sunday in Cape Vincent, N.Y., where he had recently moved. He was 67.
        The cause of death was lung cancer, his family said.
        He graduated from Syracuse University in 1949 and became a reporter at The Watertown (N.Y.) Daily Times in 1957. From 1960 to 1965, he was with The Niagara Gazette.
        After working for a movie company as a writer-producer and the New York State Local Government Improvement Commission, he returned to The Gazette in 1970. In 1982, he joined The New York Times as a copy editor, working on the cultural, national and style news desks. He retired in 1993.
        He is survived by two brothers, the Rev. John, of South Deerfield, Mass., and M. Thomas, of Newport, N.C.; three sisters, Jeanne Thompson of Cape Vincent, Mary Lou Cornaire of Bath, N.Y., and Patricia Krause of Euless, Tex.
