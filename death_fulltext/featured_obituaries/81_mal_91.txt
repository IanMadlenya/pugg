        Reeve Schley Jr., a lawyer, banker and thoroughbred horse breeder, died on Monday at his home in Whitehouse, N.J., after a long illness. He was 85.
        Until three years ago, he was chairman of the Somerset Trust Company, where his father, Reeve Schley Sr., preceded him as chairman.
        After graduating from Yale University and the Columbia University Law School, Mr. Schley was a lawyer with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett until World War II, when he transfered from the Army cavalry to the Office of Strategic Services. He was parachuted behind German lines in France to help French resistance forces. He helped liberate the town of Vichy and later was awarded the Bronze Star and the French Croix de Guerre.
        After the war, Mr. Schley managed his family's Island Stock Farm in Whitehouse. He also was a founding member of the board of trustees of Hunterdon Medical Center, a rural hospital that pioneered in the training of family practice physicians.
        In 1960, he turned to thoroughbred horses. He was named chairman of the Monmouth Park Race Track in 1977, and in 1978 his horse, Queen Lib, was named horse of the year by the New Jersey Thoroughbred Breeders' Association.
        Mr. Schley was director of the Thoroughbred Racing Association and president of the New Jersey Historical Association. He also was chairman of the Readington Township Planning Board, where he was a strong conservationist.
        A funeral service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Saturday at Lamington Presbyterian Church in Lamington Station, N.J.
        Mr. Schley's niece is Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey. Her mother, Eleanor Todd, Mr. Schley's sister, died in 1991.
        Mr. Schley is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, Reeve and John, both of Whitehouse, and two grandchildren.
