        John (Jocko) Conlan, a National League umpire for 24 years and a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, died today. He was 89 years old. The cause of death was not announced.
        Mr. Conlan, known as one of the feistier umpires of his day, was just 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed 160 pounds. Despite his small size, he was an impressive umpire, and in 1974 he became the fifth umpire inducted into the Hall of Fame.
        ''You've got to have a thick skin and a strong heart,'' Mr. Conlan once said of umpiring. ''You've got to have and command respect. Without them, you're nothing.''
        Mr. Conlan, who was born in Chicago, umpired in five World Series and six All-Star Games before retiring after the 1964 season. Before umpiring, he was a player for 14 seasons, but he made it up to the major leagues for only two years, playing the outfield for the Chicago White Sox in 1934 and 1935. He batted .249 in his first season and .286 in his second and played in a total of 128 games.
