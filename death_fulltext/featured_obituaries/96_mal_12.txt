        Tino Perutz, a retired international trader whose company was one of the first to export American plastics, died on Friday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. A resident of Great Neck, he was 88.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Perutz, who was born in Vienna, first came to the United States as a boy and became a citizen, but he was living in Prague when Hitler closed in on Czechoslovakia. He returned to the United States in 1938 and was a co-founder of the Omni Products Corporation in Manhattan.
        This plastics company traded in both raw materials and machinery, and by the 1950's, Omni had affiliates in South America, Europe and Asia. He was invited to take part in the 1959 United States Exhibition in Moscow, where Vice President Richard M. Nixon and the Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev had their "kitchen debate."
        Omni's commercial exhibit was a machine that spat out a plastic Dixie cup every five seconds. Mr. Perutz also signed an agreement for shipping a whole American-made factory to produce about 10,000 tons of plastic irrigation pipe yearly in the Soviet Union.
        He sold Omni in the 1970's to the Tenant International Trading Company but continued to manage its Omni Division and remained a business consultant into his 80's.
        In the 1970's, he advised the United States Commerce Department on East-West trade. A supporter of music and the arts, he served as a board member of the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont.
        In 1954, Mr. Perutz and his wife, Dolly Hellman Perutz, a sculptor and graphic artist, moved into one of Long Island's oldest buildings, a six-bedroom home built around 1640 at Kings Point. He sold it in 1979, after Mrs. Perutz died.
        He is survived by their daughter, Kathrin Perutz of Great Neck, and a grandson.
