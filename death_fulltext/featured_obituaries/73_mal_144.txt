        Thomas F. X. Mullarkey, a partner at Lazard Freres & Company, former chairman of the board of Fordham University and a philanthropist, died yesterday at his home in Locust Valley, L.I. He was 59.
        The cause of death was brain cancer, said Thomas Wise, a spokesman for Lazard Freres.
        Mr. Mullarkey joined Lazard Freres in 1967. At the age of 36, he became a partner and rose to the position of chief financial and legal officer of the Wall Street investment banking firm.
        In 1987 Mr. Mullarkey suffered a severe stroke, but he returned to work within a few months and accelerated his philanthropic efforts.
        Mr. Mullarkey was closely associated with Fordham, serving as a trustee from 1980 and chairman from 1986 to 1989. Most recently he was chairman of the Fordham capital campaign. Scholarship at Wellesley
        Earlier he established a scholarship at Wellesley, where his wife, the former Theresa Mall, was a graduate and sits on the board.
        A collector of works by Mozart, Mr. Mullarkey was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra and the Tilles Center at Long Island University.
        Besides his wife of 32 years, he is survived by three sons: Robert, of Muttontown, N.Y., Roger, of Greenwich, Conn., and Thomas Jr., of Manhattan; two sisters, Doreen O'Hara of Northfield, Ill., and Auleen Gardner of Bay Shore, L.I., and two grandchildren.
