        Harry E. Wedeck, a linguist, scholar of the classics and observer of spheres  beyond the norm, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 102  and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Some of his excursions into the unusual remain available in reprint editions. They include "Dictionary of Astrology," "A Dictionary of Aphrodisiacs," "A Treasury of Witchcraft" and "Triumph of Satan." They were originally written near the end of Mr. Wedeck's career, when he was steeped in the classics as an educator in the New York City school and college system.
        A native of Sheffield, England, Mr. Wedeck was chairman of the department of classical languages at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn from 1935 to 1950 and then taught the classics at Brooklyn College until 1968. Afterward he lectured on medieval studies at the New School for Social Research, until 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose Slata Wedeck; two sons, David, of Teaneck, N.J., and Edmond, of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.
