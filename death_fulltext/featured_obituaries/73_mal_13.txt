        John H. LaMarre, an art historian and appraiser of fine arts and antiques, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. LaMarre, a native of Boston, graduated from Columbia University and New York University. He retired two years ago after four decades as a professor of art and antiques at the New York School of Interior Design in Manhattan.
        Mr. LaMarre is survived by his wife, Mildred H.; a daughter, Vivienne Kisco, and a son, Jean P., both of St. Petersburg, Fla.; a brother, Robert, of Shenandoah, Va.; a stepdaughter, Lisa Morton of Potomac, Md.; three stepsons, Robert S. Understein of Long Boat Key, Fla., Norman Understein of Potomac, and Gary Understein of Denver, and 10 step-grandchildren.
