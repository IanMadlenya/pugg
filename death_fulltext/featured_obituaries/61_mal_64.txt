        Lord Fieldhouse, commander of the British battle fleet that sailed to retake the Falkland Islands from Argentine forces, died in a hospital today at the age of 63, the Defense Ministry said.
        As Adm. Sir John Fieldhouse, he was commander in chief of the battle fleet during the 1982 Falkland war.
        He earlier commanded Britain's first nuclear submarine, Dreadnought, and eventually rose to become Chief of the Defense Staff.
        Margaret Thatcher, who was Prime Minister during the Falkland war, paid tribute to Lord Fieldhouse as "a great leader."
        She added, "The country owes a very great deal to him for the way in which the recovery of the Falklands was conducted."
