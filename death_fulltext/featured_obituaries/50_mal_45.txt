        Gene Hill Sagan, resident choreographer of the Philadelphia Dance Company, died on Friday at Einstein Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 59 years old.
        He died of respiratory failure after a long illness, said Joan Myers Brown, the director of the modern dance company.
        Mr. Sagan also created dances for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Batsheva and Bat D'or dance companies of Israel, where he lived and worked for 15 years, and for troupes throughout the United States and Europe. His work drew on ballet, modern and jazz dance, with an emphasis on slightly obscure themes and sensuous, swirling movement that made dancers look good.
        Mr. Sagan was named Arthur Eugene Hill when he was born in Emporia, Va. He grew up in Philadelphia and trained in dance at the Ballet Theater school and with teachers who included Michel Panaieff and Nina Vyroubova.
        He made his debut in 1959, dancing with the First Negro Classical Ballet, and went on to perform with Louis Johnson, Carmen de Lavallade and Geoffrey Holder, and in companies in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Paris and Cologne, Germany. He created his first dance in 1963 for his own Munich-based group. He began to choreograph for the Philadelphia Dance Company in 1976.
        Mr. Sagan is survived by his mother, Virginia Matthews; a sister, Katherine Williams, and a brother, James Hill, all of Philadelphia.
