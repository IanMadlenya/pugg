        Louis Kaufman, a violinist who made the first complete domestic recording of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," died on Wednesday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 88.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, said his wife, Annette, a pianist who was also his accompanist.
        In a career spanning nearly seven decades, Mr. Kaufman made more than 125 recordings on 30 different labels. His recording of the original version of Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" for the Concert Hall Society won the 1950 Grand Prix du Disque and helped spark a renewed interest in the composer's music. He was also the concertmaster for more than 400 movie soundtracks from 1938 to 1948, including "Gone With the Wind," "Wuthering Heights" and "Cleopatra."
        Mr. Kaufman was born in Portland, Ore. He came to New York in 1918 to study at the Institute of Musical Art (now the Juilliard School), where he graduated with honors.
        He is survived by his wife.
