        Edward F. Conley, a longtime correspondent and bureau chief for the Voice of America, died on Thursday in George Washington University Hospital in Washington. He was 60 and lived in Tokyo.
        The cause was a brain tumor, his family said.
        In his 32 years at the Voice of America, Mr. Conley was in charge of its European and Middle East bureau in London and of its East Asia and Pacific bureau in Hong Kong as well as Tokyo bureau chief, his last post.
        He also covered the White House, Congress, the State Department and the United Nations. He headed the Presidential campaign coverage in 1984 and was the host of the hourlong nightly World Report from 1986 to 1989.
        Mr. Conley was born in Springfield, Mass. After graduating from Boston University in 1954, he worked at WHEB radio in Portsmouth, N.H.; WDBJ television and radio in Roanoke, Va., and WWLP television in Springfield, Mass.
        His survivors include his wife of 26 years, the former Joyce Cooke; four daughters, Mary-Joyce Conley of Bethesda, Md., and Lucy, Dorcas and Gillian Conley, all of Tokyo.
