        Brandee Erlanger, a volunteer and fund-raiser for the United Nations for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 64 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of a stroke, her husband, Jack, said.
        Mrs. Erlanger, a native New Yorker, first became active at the United Nations in Volunteer Services, now known as Staff Activities. She was an officer and past president of the United Nations Hospitality Committee and often headed its fund-raising galas.
        Besides her husband, Mrs. Erlanger is survived by a daughter, Peri, of Manhattan; two sisters, Lillian Picoult of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Rose Finkelstein of Ellenville, N.Y., and four brothers, Ruby Mayer of Lakewood, N.J., Harvey and Murray, both of Fort Lauderdale, and Leonard, of Hauppauge, L.I.
