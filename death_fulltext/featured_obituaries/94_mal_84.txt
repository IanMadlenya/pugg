        Norville Morgan Downie, a former psychology professor whose lifelong hobby of collecting beetles resulted in an extensive contribution to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, died on Nov. 9 at the Home Hospital in Lafayette, Ind., where he lived. He was 83.
        He died of cancer, said his son, J. Paul Downie of Fort Wayne, Ind.
        Dr. Downie, who was educated as a psychologist and specialized in statistics, taught at Purdue University from 1951 to 1975 and wrote a number of books on statistical measurements in psychology. One of his books, "Basic Statistical Methods," was used as a textbook in the United States and Mexico.
        He gathered beetles for more than 50 years, eventually assembling a collection of some 90,000 specimens, or nearly half the known species in North America. His gift of nearly 100,000 beetles in 1992 became part of a collection maintained by the Field Museum for research.
        In conjunction with Ross Arnett, he edited "The Beetles of Northeastern North America, Vol. 1," which was published this year. They were working on two more volumes when Dr. Downie died.
        He was born in Troy, N.Y., received an undergraduate degree from St. Lawrence University in Canton, N.Y., and a doctorate from Syracuse University.
        Besides his son, Dr. Downie is survived by his wife of 52 years, Johanna Munson Downie; a daughter, Elizabeth M. Weiss of Iowa City, and five grandchildren.
