        Able Abel, Mr. Moore's trainer, said that Mr. Moore slipped on the wet ground while trying to stop the runaway vehicle. Mr. Moore was then dragged downhill under the vehicle, Mr. Abel said.
        The Holmdel police said Mr. Moore's wife, Quadria, summoned them to the couple's home at 7:45 P.M. Officers and emergency medical technicians found Mr. Moore pinned under the midsection of the vehicle and exhibiting no vital signs.
        Born in the Bronx, Mr. Moore won five Golden Gloves titles in New York and made the 1980 United States Olympic team. The team did not compete in Moscow because of a United States boycott of the Games.
        Mr. Moore turned pro after the Olympics and won the W.B.A. junior-middleweight title in his ninth fight by stopping Tadashi Mihara of Japan in the sixth round of a 1982 bout in Tokyo. He retained his title three times before losing it to Roberto Duran on June 16, 1983 when he was stopped in the eighth round. His last bout was on April 30. In addition to his wife, Mr. Moore is survived by two children, Deidi, 6, and Davey Jr., 3.
