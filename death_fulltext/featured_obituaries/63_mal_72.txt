        Dr. Martin W. Donner, a leader in radiology and in swallowing disorders, died on Monday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 71 years old and lived in Ruxton, Md.
        He died of complications after a heart transplant, his family said.
        Dr. Donner headed the radiology department at Johns Hopkins University for 16 years. During his tenure, Johns Hopkins opened the nation's largest combined clinical and research magnetic resonance imaging center.
        From his work on gastrointestinal cases, he began focusing on swallowing disorders. In 1981 he created the world's first center for that subspecialty at Johns Hopkins and became its director. He also founded a journal on the subject, Dysphagia.
        The Society of Gastrointestinal Radiologists awarded him a medal for his career work.
        Born in Leipzig, Germany, Dr. Donner earned his medical degree from the University of Leipzig and came to this country in 1954. He joined Johns Hopkins in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Adelheid Wimmer; two daughters, Cornelia and Stephanie, and a son, Thomas, all of Baltimore; a brother, Arndt of Hamburg, Germany, and one grandson.
