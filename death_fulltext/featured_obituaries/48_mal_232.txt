        Berl Frymer, a leader in labor and Zionist groups in Europe, Israel and the United States for several decades, died on Jan. 19 at St. Luke's Hospital. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of a heart attack after a long bout with Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Frymer, who received a doctorate in law from the University of Liege in Belgium and a doctorate in political science from the Ecole des Sciences Politiques in Paris, was born in Sarny, Poland. He was secretary-general of the Zionist Youth Organizations in Western Europe before World War II.
        He came to the United States in 1940 as an emissary for the Polish Government in Exile on behalf of war refugees, and he became general secretary of the Labor Zionist Organization. In 1952 he went to Israel as educational director of Histadrut, the general labor federation there, and was a member of the Labor Party's central committee until he retired in 1977.
        Dr. Frymer returned to New York to work with the Farband, a labor Zionist organization, on Jewish educational and cultural activities. His column, "News From the Jewish World," was syndicated in Jewish newspapers around the world.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elyse Hirschberg; two daughters, Hanita Blumfield, professor of anthropology at Mount Vernon College in Washington, and Tikva Frymer-Kensky, professor of biblical studies at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.
