        Dr. Aaron Kahan, a rabbi long active in community affairs, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. He was 76 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Jerusalem.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        A native of Romania, Dr. Kahan was ordained in Brooklyn in 1938 and served congregations in the New York metropolitan region before and after World War II. During the war, he was a chaplain with the 7th Army in France and Germany, rising to the rank of major and winning a Bronze Star.
        In the early 1950's, he began a 25-year association with the Israel Bond Organization. A good part of his time was devoted to bond drives in South America, the Netherlands, France and Toronto and then in Miami in the 1960's. From the mid-1970's he devoted himself to social causes and to writing, becoming a contributor to The Jerusalem Post, among other publications.
        Dr. Kahan is survived by two sons, Martin, of Manhattan, and Sheldon, of Los Angeles; a brother, Rabbi Lazar Kahanow, of Brooklyn, and a sister, Rebbetzin Helen Kanarek, of Peekskill, N.Y.
