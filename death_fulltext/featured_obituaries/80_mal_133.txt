        William P. Grayson, former executive vice president of Johnson Publishing Company and associate publisher of Ebony and Jet magazines, died on Sunday at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. He was 79 and had lived in Los Angeles since he retired in 1973.
        The cause of death was bone cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Grayson, who started at the Johnson Publishing in Chicago in 1947 as an advertising sales manager, helped build the company into the country's most successful black publishing company and the second-largest black-owned company in the country.
        He began his publishing career in 1937 selling advertising for The Baltimore Afro-American, a newspaper. He joined John H. Johnson's company five years after Mr. Johnson had founded it in Chicago with a $500 loan secured by his mother's furniture. The company, which now also owns several radio stations and a line of cosmetics, had sales in 1989 of $241 million.
        Mr. Grayson worked in New York for most of his life, managing the company's East Coast advertising. He chose to stay in New York after he was named vice president of the company in 1957 and executive vice president in 1968. He was named associate publisher of Ebony and Jet in 1972. He retired a year later after suffering a stroke.
        For several years, Mr. Grayson lectured on publishing and advertising at the School of Retail at New York University.
        He is survived by two daughters, a son, a brother and two grandchildren. His wife, Hattie, from whom he was legally separated in 1972, lives in Manhattan.
