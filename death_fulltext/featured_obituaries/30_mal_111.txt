        A graduate of St. Joseph's Seminary, Monsignor Scanlon was ordained in 1936 and served for 47 years in churches in Harlem. He was at St. Benedict the Moor and at St. Aloysius Church before being named pastor of St. Augustine Church in the Bronx in 1956. Elevated to monsignor in 1958, he returned to Harlem as pastor of St. Charles Borromeo in 1962. He became pastor of St. Aloysius in 1968. In 1973, he became the first white Roman Catholic priest to be installed as president of the Ministerial Interfaith Association of Harlem, an interfaith group composed largely of black Protestants. He retired in 1979.
        He is survived by four sisters, Sister Mary Sheila, Aileen Brandon and Margaret Grange, all of Yonkers, and Mona Weber, of Sayville, L.I.
