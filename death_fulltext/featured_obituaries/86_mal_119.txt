        Malcolm R. Hobbs, a newspaperman who for almost 40 years was editor and publisher of The Cape Codder in Orleans, Mass., died on March 15 at his home. He was 77 and lived in Orleans.
        The cause was complications of bone disease, said his wife, Gwendolyn.
        Mr. Hobbs bought The Cape Codder in 1951 and sold the newspaper, which is published twice a week, in 1990. He previously had worked as a Latin American correspondent for Business Week and in Washington for the Congressional Quarterly and the Overseas News Agency.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hobbs is survived by two sons, Steven, of Orleans and Christopher, of Jamaica Plain, Mass.; two daughters, Jane Bahler of Manhattan, and Lynn Vardakis of Brooklyn; two sisters, Louise Bierkan of East Orleans, Mass., and Shirley Heiden of Pacifica, Calif., and five grandchildren.
