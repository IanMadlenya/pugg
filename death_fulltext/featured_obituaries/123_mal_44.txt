        Judge Jerry Pacht, a retired Los Angeles Superior Court judge who served for many years on the California Commission on Judicial Qualifications, which reviews judicial conduct, died on April 1 at St. John's Medical Center in Santa Monica. He was 75.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        Judge Pacht said he had ruled with the interests of ''people who had limited power or resources, the little people.''
        One notable case came in 1969, when he struck down a policy of the University of California barring Communists from employment.
        The decision reversed the Board of Regents' ouster of Angela Davis, a black radical, as an assistant professor of philosophy because she was a member of the Communist Party. Later, a move to have Judge Pacht recalled never gained enough petition signatures to put it on the ballot.
        In 1977, he ruled that Californians had the right to sue for damages if they found that their credit-card company had sold their names and addresses for use on other companies' mail-order lists.
        He sat on the Commission on Judicial Qualifications in 1977 when it undertook a public examination of how the California Supreme Court conducted its business.
        The son of a judge, Jerry Pacht was born in Los Angeles and graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Southern California Law School. He was appointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court by Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr. and quickly advanced to the Superior Court. After retiring, he worked as a private arbitrator and contributed book reviews on judicial subjects to The Los Angeles Times.
        Judge Pacht is survived by his wife, Judith; a daughter, Jane Monson; two sons, Robert, and Jonathan Siegel; a brother, Rudolph; a sister, Patricia Snitzer, and one granddaughter.
