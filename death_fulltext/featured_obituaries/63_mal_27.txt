        Bedford Cook, a retired professor of French, died Thursday at his home in Westport Point, Mass. He was 68 years old.
        His family said he died after a long illness.
        A 1945 graduate of Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., with a doctoral degree from Yale University, Professor Cook taught at Haverford College in Haverford, Pa., until his retirement in 1984. He previously was on the faculties of the University of California at Riverside, Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, and Smith College in Northampton, Mass.
        Professor Cook is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Holmes; a son, Stephen B. of Appleton, Wis.; two daughters, Susan C. Baily of Wallingford, Pa., and Alissa C. Jarvis of Framingham, Mass.; a brother, Robert, of Rome; a sister, Janet Krache of Piscataway, N.J., and seven grandchildren.

        An obituary on Tuesday of a retired professor of French at Haverford College misstated his first name. He was Bradford Cook.
