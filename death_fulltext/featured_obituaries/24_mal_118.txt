        John Loder, an actor whose tenure of more than 30 years in British and American movies was credited largely to his good looks and his imposing physique, has died in England. He was 90 years old and had homes in London and Buenos Aires.
        Mr. Loder, who died in late December, was born John Muir Lowe, in York, England. He was educated at Eton and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, England, and at Eton College. In World War I, he served with the 15th Hussars in North Africa, France and Gallipoli, Turkey. He was taken prisoner in early 1918. His 1977 autobiography was titled ''Hollywood Hussar.'' Started as an Extra
        His first film appearance was as an extra in a 1926 German feature, ''Madame Wants No Children,'' which starred Marlene Dietrich.
        Mr. Loder left Europe for Hollywood and had roles in Paramount's first talking picture, ''The Doctor's Secret,'' in 1929. He was also in Rin-Tin-Tin's first sound picture, in 1930.
        Among the scores of British and American films he performed in were the 1937 British version of ''King Solomon's Mines,'' with Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Paul Robeson, Roland Young and Anna Lee, Alfred Hitchcock's ''Sabotage'' (1936), ''Eagle Squadron'' (1942), ''Passage to Marseilles'' (1944) and ''Lorna Doone'' (1935), considered his best British movie. His last films included ''Gideon's Day'' (1958), ''Esquiu'' (1965) and ''The Firechasers'' (1970). Although he had a variety of roles, his specialty seemed to be the jilted husband. Noted Portrayals
        Critics considered his best portrayals to be Ianto, the eldest son in ''How Green Was My Valley'' (1941), and Elliott Livingston, opposite Bette Davis, in ''Now, Voyager'' (1942).
        Another significant Loder film was ''Dishonored Lady'' (1947), in which he appeared with Hedy Lamarr, who became his third wife in 1943 and from whom he was divorced when they made the movie together. They had a son and daughter.
        His other wives were Sophie Kabel, with whom he had a son; Micheline Cheirel, with whom he had a daughter; Evelyn Carolyn Auffmordt, and Alba Julia Lagomarsino, whom he married in 1958.
