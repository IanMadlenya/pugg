        Peter T. Schneck, an American architect based in Italy for the last quarter-century and a principal designer of the Costa Smeralda resort on Sardinia, died of AIDS on Monday at his home in Rome. He was 53 years old.
        Mr. Schneck, who had been with Skidmore Owings & Merrill in New York City in the early 1960's, moved to Italy permanently and joined the architectural firm of Buziri V. When the Aga Khan acquired a huge tract on the Sardinian coast for a projected resort, Mr. Schneck was assigned to the design team.
        He was noted for designing several dramatic houses in Italy, Spain and Switzerland, including his own residence at Porto Cervo, Sardinia, which used motifs from a civilization that flourished on the island 3,000 years ago.
        He is survived by a sister, Carol Hagen of Buckingham, Pa.
