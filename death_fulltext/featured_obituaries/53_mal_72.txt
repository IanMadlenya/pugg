        Brother Francis Lonergan, who was associate director of the Capuchin Mission Association, died on Monday at St. John Friary in Manhattan, where he lived. He was 53 years old.
        The cause of death had not been determined yesterday.
        Brother Lonergan held the post at the association, which supports Capuchin Franciscan missionaries in the order's New York-New England Province of St. Mary, since 1965.
        He was a native of Yonkers and took his final vows in 1961 at Mary Immaculate Friary in Garrison, N.Y., where he served for four years.
        He is survived by three sisters, Mary Nimmo of Atlanta, Margaret Connors of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and Rita Dinan of Orangeburg, N.Y.
