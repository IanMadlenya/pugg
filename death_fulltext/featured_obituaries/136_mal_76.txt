        David Schneider, who as an executive for British Airways led the successful fight to bring the supersonic Concorde to New York, died May 1 at his home in Manhattan. He was 77.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        A native of the Bronx, Mr. Schneider was the chief executive for the Americas at El Al Israel Airlines and before that a senior marketing executive at British Airways.
        He promoted the British carrier himself in a series of unorthodox television commercials as a cigar-smoking Uncle Sam or Statue of Liberty.
        During the late 1970's, he headed the lobbying campaign to overcome local opposition to New York landing rights for the Concorde.
        The Concorde started service in 1977 after a Supreme Court ruling that allowed entry, according to John Lampl, a spokesman for British Airways.
        A year later, Mr. Schneider retired from British Airways and in 1981 was appointed chief executive for the Americas at El Al.
        After his retirement in the late 1980's, he made a new career out of his passion for Central Park, volunteering five days a week for the Central Park Conservancy.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Claire, as well as three daughters, Tina Schneider of Portland, Me.; Amy Schneider of East Andover, N.H., and Stephanie Margolis of Boca Raton, Fla., and seven grandchildren.
