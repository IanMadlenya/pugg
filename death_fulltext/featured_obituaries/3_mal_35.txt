        The body of Lawrence Kohlberg, a professor of education at Harvard University who had been missing since Jan. 17, was found Monday in Boston Harbor after it washed up at Logan Airport.
        Professor Kohlberg, 59 years old, had suffered from a tropical disease for 20 years. He left Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass., on a day pass on Jan. 17., and his car was found abandoned on a residential street in Winthrop, Mass. on Jan. 21.
        His body, found at 12:30 P.M. by a state trooper on routine patrol, was found about 1,000 yards south of where he was believed to have gone into the water, according to Lieut. Angelo A. LaMonica of the Winthrop police.
        He said state medical examiners today identified the body through dental records. He said that an autopsy indicated drowning as the cause of death, and that no foul play was suspected.
        Professor Kohlberg, a resident of Cambridge, became a professor of education and social psychology at Harvard in 1968. His book on moral development is used by teachers around the world to promote moral reasoning.
        Patricia A. Graham, dean of the Graduate School of Education at Harvard, said, ''We regret very much that we will never see him again.''
        She said his survivors include two sons, his sister and his mother.
