        Preston Cloud, a geologist who wrote extensively on the early history of the Earth and on the evolution of life, died Jan. 16 at his home in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 78 years old.
        He died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said colleagues at the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he was a professor emeritus of biogeology and environmental studies.
        In a career that spanned more than 50 years, Dr. Cloud was the author of several books and more than 200 professional papers. His interests ranged beyond traditional geology into the fields of biology, chemistry and cosmology. His most recent book, "Oasis in Space: Earth History From the Beginning," was published by Norton in 1988.
        He received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University and a doctorate from Yale University. In 1942 he joined the United States Geological Survey and helped to build its paleontology program.
        He taught at Harvard University, the University of Minnesota and the University of California at Los Angeles before joining the Santa Barbara faculty in 1968. He retired from teaching in 1974.
        Dr. Cloud is survived by his wife, the former Janice Gibson; two daughters, Karen, of Santa Barbara, and Lisa, of Los Angeles; a son, Kevin, of San Francisco, from a previous marriage, and three sisters, Pauline Padden of Rockville, Md., Beverly Richards of Lancaster, Pa., and Bonnie Deyo of Richmond, Ky.
