        Dr. Arthur Lautkin, a radiologist who practiced medicine in Manhattan for 50 years, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 82.
        The cause was cancer, said a son, Dr. Everett Lautin.
        A graduate of Columbia College and New York University Medical College, Dr. Lautkin began practice in Manhattan in 1940. After service as a commander in the Naval Medical Corps, he became a staff radiologist and faculty member at Mount Sinai Hospital in 1952. He also maintained a private practice for about 30 years. Starting in 1985, he was a radiologist at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan.
        Dr. Lautkin is survived by his wife, Fredda of Manhattan; a brother, Philip Lautkin of Scottsdale, Ariz.; four sons, Dr. Robert Lautin, Dr. Everett Lautin, Dr. Andrew Lautin and Dr. Jeffrey Lautin, all of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
