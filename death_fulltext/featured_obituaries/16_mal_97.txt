        Mr. Jobson, who was born in Lansing, Mich., was a graduate of Williams College and the University of Michigan Law School.
        He joined the family corporation in 1958. In a long career in publishing he became well known in the wine and liquor industry through Liquor Store Magazine and other Jobson publications that he helped to develop. He also founded Jobs-on-File, an executive-search firm, and after his retirement from Jobson in 1974 he became an advertising and publishing consultant and served with the Retired Executive Service Corps, counseling small businesses.
        Mr. Jobson served in the Coast Guard in World War II and was adrift at sea for several weeks before being rescued after his anti-submarine vessel capsized in the North Atlantic.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Joan Ohlrogge; a daughter, Sara, of Stamford; two sons, Mark, of Jackson, Wyo., and Christopher, of Stamford, and two sisters, Margaret Legler of Alstead, N.H., and Lucy Wierum of Demarest, N.J.
