        William Scherle, who represented southwest Iowa for four terms in Congress, died on Wednesday in Council Bluffs. He was 80.
        Mr. Scherle, a Republican, was first elected to Congress in 1966. Before that, he served in the Iowa Legislature.
        An obituary in The Omaha World-Herald reported that Mr. Scherle had been known to say that his politics were conservative on everything except agriculture, where he was always liberal.
        Mr. Scherle served in the Navy and the Coast Guard during World War II.
        Survivors include his wife, Jane; two sons, John and William, both of Iowa; a sister, Dorothy Kutzba of New York; two brothers, Robert, of Virginia, and Albert, of Council Bluffs; and six grandchildren.
