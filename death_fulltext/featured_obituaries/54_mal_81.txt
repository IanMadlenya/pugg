        Walter Bliss Terry, a retired vice president of the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, died on Saturday at his home in Peapack, N.J. He was 76 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Terry, a graduate of Yale, was with the Bank of New York before serving in the Army in World War II as a captain in the Rainbow Division in the European Theater. He was in the investment trust department at Morgan Guaranty until he retired in 1980.
        Mr. Terry's two older brothers, Wyllys and Baldwin, died in February within 48 hours of each other, Wyllys from lung cancer and Baldwin from an accident while felling a tree.
        Walter Terry is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Grace Heiskell; a daughter, Georgia Schley of Whitehouse, N.J.; a son, Walter Jr., of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.
