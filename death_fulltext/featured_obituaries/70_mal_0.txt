        Donald C. Meyer, a longtime leader in New York City's physicians' union, died on Thursday while commuting to his home in Hartsdale, N.Y. He was 62 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        For the last 14 years, Dr. Meyer was the executive director of the Doctors Council, which represents 3,300 physicians and dentists in municipal hospitals and city Health Department programs. Earlier he served 12 years as the president of the Health Department's Doctors Association, which merged with a parallel organization in city hospitals to form the council.
        Dr. Meyer, who conducted negotiations for contracts, was an advocate and critic of health programs. He opposed reductions in the city's school health services, criticized the supervision of city hospitals by medical schools and urged more money and better management for health and hospital programs.
        Dr. Meyer, who was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Manhattan. He graduated from New York University in 1950 and its School of Dentistry in 1953. In 1954 and 1955, he served as a dentist in the Air Force in Korea and reached the rank of captain.
        After military service, he started a dental practice in the Bronx. He also worked in a school health program, where he became active in the Doctors Association. He became president of the organization in 1966 during a strike, which he helped settle.
        He gave up his dental practice in 1978 to become the first full-time director of the Doctors Council.
        Dr. Meyer is survived by his wife of 39 years, the former Rita Gordon; a son, Kenneth, of Seattle; a daughter, Susan Meyer Millner, of Highland Park, N.J.; a sister, Roberta Shain, of Lexington, Ky., and two grandchildren.
