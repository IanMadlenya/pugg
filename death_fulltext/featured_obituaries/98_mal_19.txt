        C. Hart Schaaf, a former United Nations official, died on Feb. 24 at his home in Silver Spring, Md. He was 83.
        The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Hart served around the world in a variety of United Nations posts over a 28-year career that began in 1949. These ranged from director of civilian relief at the end of the Korean War to head of a mammoth hydroelectric project on the Mekong River in Southeast Asia to a variety of assignments in population control.
        He also headed the United Nations' development program in Israel, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. His final assignment was at United Nations Headquarters in New York, serving as Deputy Executive Director of Operations for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.
        Dr. Schaaf was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., and received undergraduate and doctoral degrees in administration from the University of Michigan. He served as a relief official in London at the end of World War II and taught administration at Cornell University from 1947 to 1949.
        In addition to a book on the lower Mekong River and articles about a variety of subjects, Dr. Schaaf wrote a play, "Burke's Idea," which was produced off Broadway in 1948. A reviewer in The New York Times suggested that the plot seemed to owe much to Dr. Schaaf's experiences as a relief worker in Europe.
        Dr. Schaaf is survived by his wife, Barbara, and two sons, Kip and Tom, both of whom live in California.
