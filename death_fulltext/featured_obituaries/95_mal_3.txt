        John D. Calamari, an expert on contract law who was co-author of a primary textbook on the subject, died on Nov. 24 in New Rochelle (N.Y.) Hospital. He was 73 and lived in Pelham Manor.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, said his son, Paul, of Ossining.
        As a professor of law at Fordham University, Mr. Calamari wrote, with Joseph Petrillo, "Law of Contracts" (West Publishing Company, 1970.) The textbook, in its third printing, is one of the first books law students encounter when they begin studying the nature of agreements.
        He also was a co-author, with Professor Petrillo and Helen Bender, of "Contracts Cases and Problems" (West Publishing Company, 1978). In addition, he wrote a casebook on mortgages.
        Born in Brooklyn in 1921, he received an undergraduate degree from Fordham College in 1942 and law degrees from Fordham Law School in 1947 and New York University in 1950. He joined Fordham's law faculty in 1952 and retired in 1991.
        He is also survived by his wife of 39 years, Louise, and a daughter, Cynthia, both of Pelham Manor; a brother, Joseph A. of Garden City, L.I., and two grandchildren.
