        Albert E. Schlesinger, a civic leader and founder of one of the largest automobile dealerships on the West Coast, died on Saturday at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 88 and lived in San Francisco.
        The cause was cardiac failure, said his wife, Gail.
        In 1928, Mr. Schlesinger founded S & C Motors, which became the largest Ford dealership in San Francisco. He closed the business in 1942 when he joined the Navy, serving as lieutenant commander in the South Pacific, and returned to it after the war.
        Mr. Schlesinger was chairman of the Parking Authority in the late 1950's and 1960's, and president of the Downtown Association and the Visitors and Convention Bureau. He was also on the board of St. Mary's College and a trustee of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
        Retiring from S & C Motors in 1972, Mr. Schlesinger went into development; among his projects was the Still Water Cove complex at Lake Tahoe. At that time he was also a director of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Bank in San Francisco.
        Born in Denver, Mr. Schlesinger, who was known as Speed, graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1925.
        Besides his wife, survivors include his daughter, Nan Kempner of New York City; three grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
