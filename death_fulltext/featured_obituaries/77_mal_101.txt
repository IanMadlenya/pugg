        Craig L. Rodwell, a vocal advocate of gay rights for more than 30 years and the founder and former owner of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in Greenwich Village, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. A resident of the Village, he was 52.
        Bill Offenbaker, who bought the store from him in March, said Mr. Rodwell died of stomach cancer.
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Rodwell moved to the Village in the late 1950's and quickly became a controversial figure in the New York Mattachine Society, a gay-rights organization. He pushed for gay pride and strong street actions to fight discrimination against homosexuals. He played a leading role in the 1969 Stonewall Rebellion, named for the bar in the Village where patrons resisted a police raid in what is considered the beginning of the national gay-rights movement. He rallied a crowd with shouts of "gay power" and staged follow-up actions through the Homophile Youth Movement, which he had founded in 1967.
        Mr. Rodwell opened the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop on Christopher Street in 1967 and became a mentor for others who opened similar stores in their hometowns.
        In 1970 he helped to organize the first Gay Pride Parade, which became an annual event.
        Mr. Rodwell is survived by his mother, Marion Kastman, also of Manhattan, and a brother, Jack Rodwell of Pleasantville, N.Y.
