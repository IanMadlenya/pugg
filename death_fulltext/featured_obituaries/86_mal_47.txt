        John Caspar Dreier, a retired United States diplomat and Johns Hopkins University professor of Latin American studies, died on Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 87 and lived in Cambridge and Southwest Harbor, Me.
        The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Appointed by President Harry S. Truman, Mr. Dreier served as United States Representative to the Organization of American States for 10 years, starting in 1950. In 1960 he joined the faculty at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore. He retired from full-time teaching in 1972, moved to Maine and devoted himself to the cause of conservation.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Harvard College in 1928.
        He joined the State Department's Latin American Division in 1941, becoming director of the Office of Regional American Affairs. He represented the United States at international conferences, both before and after his appointment to the O.A.S.
        He was the author of two books, "The Organization of American States and the Hemisphere Crisis" and "The Alliance for Progress -- Policies & Perspectives," both published in 1962.
        In Maine, he played a prominent role in efforts to protect the coastline and save elm trees threatened by disease.
        Mr. Dreier is survived by his wife of 51 years, Louisa Cabot Richardson Dreier; two sons, John S., of Hopewell Junction, N.Y., and Alexander R., of Belchertown, Mass.; a daughter, Susan Dreier of Newton, Mass.; a brother, Theodore, of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and four grandchildren.
