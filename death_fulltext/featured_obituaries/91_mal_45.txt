        William M. Landau, a leading New York accounting executive, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 67 and had homes in Scarsdale, N.Y., and Manhattan.
        The cause was melanoma, his family said.
        Born in Washington Heights, Mr. Landau graduated from Lehigh University, received a law degree from New York Law School and was certified as a public accountant.
        He joined Fred Landau & Company, the accounting firm founded by his father in 1926. He became its managing partner in the late 1960's and led it during 20 years of national and international growth. He oversaw its merger into the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche in 1990. He remained as a consultant to Deloitte.
        Mr. Landau was a longtime supporter of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. He served as an officer and created the U.J.A.-Federation's Landau Family Fund to assist Jewish elderly, homeless and battered women. He continued the family's contributions to the Riverdale Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. and its Fred and Anna Landau building, endowed by his father.
        He is survived by his wife of 43 years, Edith Landow Landau; two daughters, Debbie, of Manhattan, and Maggi, of Scarsdale; a brother, Edward, of Harrison, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
