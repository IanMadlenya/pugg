        John J. Casey, an executive of commercial and military aviation for more than 50 years who headed both Braniff International Airways and Pan American World Services, died on Tuesday at his home in Port Washington, L.I. He was 75.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Dawn Bryan.
        Mr. Casey joined Braniff in 1968 and became chairman and chief executive officer in 1981. In 1982 he went to Pan American World Airways as executive vice president, moving to its subsidiary in 1986. He retired in 1988 to form an airline management consulting firm that he headed at the time of his death.
        He was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied aeronautical engineering at Cornell University. He worked as an engineer for the Curtiss-Wright Corporation before becoming a test pilot for the Army Air Force during World War II.
        His assignments included command of the transport squadron of the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. In 1962 he became a senior vice president for Seaboard World Airlines.
        Mr. Casey is survived by his wife, of Manhattan; two sons, John Jr. of San Antonio, Tex., and David of Dallas; two daughters, Janet Todrys of South Huntington, L.I., and Mary Casey of Washington; a brother, Albert, of Dallas, and two sisters, Eva Marie Carey of Naples, Fla., and Norine Casey of Arlington, Mass.
