Last year, the Pofcher Company also represented VNU in its $220 million purchase of BPI Communications L.P., the publisher of Billboard magazine and The Hollywood Reporter, from a group of investors made up of BPI management, Boston Ventures and The New York Times Company.
        Mr. Pofcher graduated from New York University, and in 1948, from Harvard Law School.
        Before founding the Pofcher Company, he worked on project finance for several uranium mining and nuclear energy companies and for the Atomic Energy Commission, and served as president of RAI Inc. In 1969, he was named vice president of finance and administration of Grosset & Dunlap, a New York publisher.
        Mr. Pofcher is survived by his wife of 33 years, the former Greta Rystedt; his mother, Sylvia Markson of Deerfield, Fla.; a daughter, Janet Johnson of Chicago, and a son, Scott Pofcher of Manhattan.
