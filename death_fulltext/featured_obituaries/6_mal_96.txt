        Charles J. Hasbrouck, who directed the city's landmarks survey and was preparing guidelines for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, died July 14 at Lenox Hill Hospital after a brief illness. He was 35 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hasbrouck had been a staff member at the city's landmarks commission for eight years. He was at one time director of the Urban Cultural Resources Survey, which identifies buildings throughout the city that are potential landmarks.
        In June 1986, he took charge of developing guidelines for the landmarks commission that would serve as a standard for alteration or replacement of windows in designated buildings. Applications to perform such work, now considered case by case, consume a great deal of the commissioners' and property owners' time.
        Mr. Hasbrouck, a native of Kingston, N.Y., graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., and studied preservation at Columbia University. His preservation interests extended beyond New York City and he was a member of the Huguenot Historic Society of New Paltz, N.Y.
        He is survived by his parents, Alice Jackson and Kenneth E. Hasbrouck Sr., of New Paltz, and a brother Kenneth E. Jr., also of New Paltz. Mr. Hasbrouck was buried Friday in New Paltz Rural Cemetery. A memorial service will be held in the city but has not yet been scheduled.
