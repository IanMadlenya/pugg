        Robert H. Levi, the former chairman and president of the Hecht chain of department stores in the Washington-Baltimore area, died on Friday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Mr. Levi, who lived in Lutherville, Md., was 79.
        The cause of death was heart failure, his son Richard said.
        Mr. Levi joined Hecht's in 1942 and rose through the executive ranks of the company founded by his wife's parents. He became president in 1955.
        He led the company into an expansion program and in 1958 negotiated a merger with the May Department Stores Company. He remained a vice president of the May Company and chairman of its Hecht division until he retired in 1967.
        Then he joined the Mercantile Safe Deposit and Trust Company, a Baltimore bank, where he served as chairman of the executive committee, retiring in 1985.
        Robert Levi was born in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1936.
        He was active in Baltimore and Washington in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, among them Johns Hopkins Hospital and John Hopkins University, the Greater Baltimore Committee, Goucher College, Associated Jewish Charities, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and the National Capital Downtown Committee.
        Besides his son Richard, of Washington, Mr. Levi is survived by his wife, the former Ryda Hecht; his daughter, Sandra Levi Gerstung of Baltimore; his son Alexander Hecht Levi of Manhattan; a brother, Dr. J. Elliot Levi of Baltimore, and five grandchildren.
