        Harry W. Baehr, the former chief editorial writer for The New York Herald Tribune, died of an apparent heart attack Wednesday in his apartment in Brooklyn Heights. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Baehr was The Herald Tribune's chief editorial writer from 1956 until the newspaper closed in 1966. Afterward, he joined The World Journal Tribune, but when that New York newspaper closed the next year, he became an editorial writer for The International Herald Tribune.
        He wrote his editorials in New York City and dispatched them regularly to the newspaper's offices in Paris until 1979, when he retired from editorial writing. More recently, friends said, he was a consultant to the Whitney Communications Corporation, updating a history of The Herald Tribune.
        He got his first job with The Herald Tribune as a feature writer in 1937, a year after his book, ''The New York Tribune Since the Civil War,'' was published. It was based on his dissertation for a doctorate he had just received from Columbia University. He became an editorial writer in 1940.
        Mr. Baehr's wives from his two marriages are both deceased. He had no immediate survivors.
