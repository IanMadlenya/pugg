        Carlos Orta, a longtime leading dancer and teacher with the José Limón Dance Company and a choreographer, died suddenly on May 15 outside the Limón studios on Broadway and Houston Street in Manhattan. Mr. Orta was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
        He is believed to have had a heart attack prior to falling and suffering a concussion, said Carla Maxwell, who directs the Limón Company.
        Mr. Orta was a dancer of exceptional dramatic intensity, with something of the charisma of Limón in his performing. Born in Caracas, Venezuela, Mr. Orta trained in dance at the Scola Cantorum in Paris and at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen, Germany, where he studied with Pina Bausch. He joined the Limón company in 1979, dancing Othello in Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' and lead roles in much of the Limón repertory, and in works by Susanne Linke and Donald McKayle.
        His own choreography often drew from rich dramatic Venezuelan folk themes. In a review of Mr. Orta's ''El Ultimo Canto,'' Josie Neal of Dance Magazine wrote in 1985 that he ''takes aspects of the culture and rituals of the natives of Venezuela which have been lost to modern civilization'' in dance that ''is alive with scenes and sounds of the people and the city, with the sorrows and joys of people who love life and work for it.''
        Mr. Orta's dances were performed by the Limón, the Netherlands Dance Theater and companies in Germany, Colombia and Venezuela. He also choreographed for the Ice Theater of New York. He founded and was the director of a troupe called Corearte Dance Company of Venezuela in Caracas. He taught at colleges including Long Island University and Manhattanville College.
        His choreography won him awards in the mid-1970's at the International Academy of Dance in Cologne, and in 1985 he received the Prize of Dance from the Venezuelan government.
        Mr. Orta is survived by three brothers and three sisters, all of Caracas.
