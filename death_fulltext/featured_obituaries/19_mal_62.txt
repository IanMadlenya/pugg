        Mr. Carter, who was born in New York City, performed frequently with the Metropolitan Opera in the years after he won the company's 1937-1938 Auditions of the Air. He also gave solo recitals throughout the country in the 1940's and 1950's. Mr. Carter succeeded Nelson Eddy on NBC Radio's ''Chase and Sanborn Hour'' in the late 1930's, and later served as the host of a classical-music radio show.
        He is survived by three sisters and a brother.
