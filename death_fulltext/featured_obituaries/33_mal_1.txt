        Mr. Fox came to Omaha with his family from Russia in 1908. In 1912, he graduated from the Creighton University College of Pharmacy and opened a pharmacy in Omaha.
        He founded the F&F Laboratories in 1928, going into full-time manufacturing of F&F cough drops in 1933. He moved the company to Chicago in 1936. F&F Laboratories still makes F&F cough drops, and today also manufactures the Smith Brothers brand.
