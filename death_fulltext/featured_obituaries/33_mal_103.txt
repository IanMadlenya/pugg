        James C. Kirby Jr., a law professor who taught at five schools and an expert on legal ethics, died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in Nashville. He was 61 years old.  For the last 11 years he had been on the faculty at the University of Tennessee Law School in Knoxville, where he served as acting dean in 1980 and 1981. He retired last July.
        From 1974 to 1979 he was vice president, general counsel and secretary of New York University, and from 1968 to 1970 he was a professor at N.Y.U. Law School. He was also director of the university's appellate judge seminars. From 1970 to 1974 he was dean of the Ohio State University Law School at Columbus.
        When Wally Butts, the former football coach and athletic director at the University of Georgia, sued The Saturday Evening Post in 1963 for libel, Professor Kirby was hired by the Southeastern Athletic Conference to investigate the magazine's charges that Mr. Butts had given information to a rival coach. Mr. Butts eventually won his suit.
        Professor Kirby believed that ethics should be taught in law schools by specific examples and that the profession insist that lawyers refuse clients' demands for improper behavior. ''The main evil,'' he said in an interview about the Watergate scandal in 1973, was ''one which is prevalent throughout our legal system. Clients expect lawyers to do anything to win their cases and often lawyers don't say no.''
        He helped write the 25th Amendment to the Constitution on Presidential and Vice Presidential vacancies, disability, and succession. He also served on panels of the American Arbitration Association and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
        He was a graduate of Vanderbilt University in 1950 and earned his law degree at New York University in 1954. After several years in private practice, he became chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on constitutional amendments, serving from 1961 to 1963. He was a professor of law at Northwestern University from 1965 to 1968 and at Vanderbilt Law School from 1962 to 1965.
        Professor Kirby is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Eggleston.
