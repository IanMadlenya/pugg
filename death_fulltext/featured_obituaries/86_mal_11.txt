        Aldyn McKean, a singer and actor who was an advocate for gay rights and the rights of people with AIDS, was found dead on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He apparently died during the weekend. He was 45.
        The cause was AIDS-related complications, said Denny Lee, a spokesman for the AIDS protest group Act Up.
        For the last five years Mr. McKean was a frequent spokesman for Act Up, representing that organization at international AIDS conferences and on national television.
        He also pressed for more and better studies of long-term survivors with the virus that leads to AIDS.
        He appeared in the film "Voices From the Front" and performed in the Broadway production and national tour of "The Robber Bridegroom."
        Born John Baldwin McKean, he was raised in Lewiston, Idaho. He came to New York to do graduate studies at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and completed his studies in 1975.
        He was a member of the Harvard University class of 1970 and served a tour of duty in Vietnam.
        He is survived by his parents, Herbert and Nancy McKean of Lewiston, Idaho, and two brothers, Scott and Arthur.
