        Gerald Jacobs, a New York businessman and investor, died of a massive heart attack on Saturday a few blocks from his Manhattan office in a taxi en route to Beth Israel Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        In 1949, Mr. Jacobs, known as Jerry, founded the Boston Tea Company, which he still owned, to manufacture flavored and specialty teas.
        In Manhattan, he was chairman of MPO Videotronics, a diversified film company, and the Miller Harness Company, a business dealing in equestrian wear and products. He also had an interest in Bedford Barn Inc., a department store in Westchester. His former restaurant investments included Top of the Park and Rusty's.
        Mr. Jacobs was a past director of Roosevelt Raceway and helped organize the short-lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football League in the 1960's. His work for charities included the March of Dimes and Hope for Youth.
        He served as an Army Air Force navigator in World War II.
        Mr. Jacobs's first wife, the former Sally Goldfeder, died in 1985.
        He then married Arlene Starkand, who survives. He is also survived by two sons, Steven, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Andrew, of Upper Saddle River, N.J., and seven grandchildren.
