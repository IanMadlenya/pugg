        Bayard Stockton Clark, a former specialist in adult education at the Department of Education and a canon at the National Cathedral in Washington, died on Oct. 21 at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. He was 75 and lived in Harwich Port, Mass.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son B. Stockton Clark Jr. of Schenectady, N.Y.
        During his 15-year career with the Department of Education, from 1967 until his retirement in 1982, he helped to establish programs intended to lift reading capabilities of American Indians, Haitian refugees and others. He also helped to establish the first Navajo community college in Chinle, Ariz.
        Mr. Clark was a member of the administrative staff of the National Cathedral from 1960 to 1965, helping to organize its collection of old and rare books and to raise the money to establish its Rare Book Library.
        He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 and the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Va., in 1945.
        In addition to his son B. Stockton, he is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Charlotte Cushwa; four other sons, W. Tucker, of Westport, Conn., Franklin T., of Charlottesville, Va., G. Rockwood, of West Harwich, Mass., and N. Brooks, of Knoxville, Tenn.; a daughter, Katherine C. Lord of Houston; a brother, Frederick W., of Leesburg, Fla., and 14 grandchildren.
