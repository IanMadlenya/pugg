        Dr. Robert J. Lapham, an authority on international demographics, died of brain cancer Saturday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 58 years old.
        At his death, Dr. Lapham was director of demographic and health surveys at the Institute for Resource Development, a unit of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, where he assisted with population and health surveys throughout the world.
        Dr. Lapham was born in Brooklyn and was a 1954 graduate of the University of Michigan. He and his wife, the former E. Virginia Sheppard, who is director of social work at Georgetown University Medical Center, spent seven years in the Middle East with Church World Service, doing relief work among Palestinian refugees.
        In 1965, while obtaining his doctorate from Michigan, Dr. Lapham was awarded a Ford fellowship for study in Morocco, after which he joined the Population Council and was assigned to Tunisia. Four years later he returned to work for the council in New York. In the following decade he also taught demographics at New York University and Brooklyn College.
        He became study director of the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Population and Demography in 1977. In 1984 he joined the Westinghouse institute in Columbia, Md.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by four sons, David, of Bronxville, N.Y., and Fred, Thomas and Timothy, all of Arlington; a daughter, Susan, also of Arlington; a brother, Harold, of Hyattsville, Md., and two sisters, Evelyn Clock of Bay Shore, L.I., and Gwendolyn Efird of Little Rock, Ark.
