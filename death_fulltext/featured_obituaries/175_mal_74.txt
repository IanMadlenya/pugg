        Edward Rice, an adventuresome American writer who wrote a best-selling 1990 biography of the 19th-century British explorer Richard Francis Burton, died on Saturday in a hospital in Southampton, N.Y. He was 82 and lived in Sagaponack, N.Y.
        Mr. Rice, who was also a photographer, was almost decapitated by a shotgun wielded by a maharajah on a peacock hunt in India. He was stoned by peasants in Bangladesh. He traveled through Asia and Africa, writing and doing photographic medical reports for the United Nations. ''Everything I did was a preparation for Burton,'' he said in a 1990 interview.
        Mr. Rice's biography was called ''Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton: The Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama Sutra, and Brought the Arabian Nights to the West.'' In a front-page review in The New York Times Book Review, the British novelist Anthony Burgess wrote, ''Mr. Rice's telling of the tale -- an odyssey really, of the travail and travels'' of Burton ''and of the unquenchable urge to get at the truth of life that rode above the tale -- is first-class.''
        Mr. Rice founded a magazine for Catholic laymen, Jubilee. His many writings include a score of books, about topics like the Ganges River, ancient Babylon and Margaret Mead. He was the author of ''The Man in the Sycamore Tree,'' a biography of Thomas Merton, a friend.
        Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Rice attended Columbia University. His first marriage, to Margery Hawkinson Rice, ended in divorce. His second wife, Susanna Franklin, died in 1993.
        He is survived by two sons, Edward III, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Christopher, of Princeton, N.J.; two grandchildren; a brother, Donald, of Ridge, N.Y., and a sister, Carol McCormack, of Hellertown, Pa.
