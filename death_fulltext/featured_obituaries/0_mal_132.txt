        Pedro W. Wygodzinsky, curator of entomology at the American Museum of Natural History, died of Parkinson's disease Tuesday at a nursing home in Middletown, N.Y. He was 70 years old.
        Dr. Wygodzinsky, a world authority on a family of insects called ''assassin bugs,'' some of which are carriers of the parasite that causes Chagas' disease in millions of people and wild animals in South America, joined the museum staff in 1962 as an associate curator. He was promoted to curator in 1966.
        There are no immediate survivors.
