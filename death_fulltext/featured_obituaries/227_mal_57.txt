        Jim Ostendarp, who coached at Amherst for 33 years and once held the record for most coaching victories in the history of New England small-college football, died Dec. 15 at the Soldier's Home in Holyoke, Mass. He was 82.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, his family said.
        Ostendarp became head football coach at Amherst in 1959 and he was later a professor of athletics. He retired in 1992 with a career record of 168-91-5. At a college more noted for academic excellence, he turned out undefeated teams in 1964 and 1984, won 13 Little Three (Amherst, Williams and Wesleyan) championships and sent four players to the National Football League.
        He never forgot Amherst's mission. In 1985, when ESPN wanted to televise the 100th annual game against Williams, he declined, saying, ''We're in the education business, not the entertainment business.''
        Ostendarp's record for coaching victories was surpassed by Don Miller, a former assistant to him at Amherst, who posted a record of 174-77-5 at Trinity from 1967 to 1998.
        James Elmore Ostendarp, a native of Baltimore, served in the paratroopers during World War II, then enrolled at Bucknell, where in 1949 he set a team rushing record (6.9 yards a carry) that still stands.
        In 1950 and 1951, Ostendarp played tailback for the Giants with teams that relied on the running of Kyle Rote, Eddie Price and Choo Choo Roberts. He returned punts and kickoffs, but seldom carried the ball. In 1952, he played for the Montreal Alouettes in Canada. Then he was an assistant coach at Bucknell (1953-54), Williams (1955-57) and Cornell (1958).
        He earned a bachelor's degree in education from Bucknell in 1952 and a master's in counseling from Columbia in 1956.
        After his first season at Amherst, he drew up elementary playbooks to help his players understand his football system. He called them pamphlets. An article in The New York Times said: ''Pamphlets? Some players called them treatises. They were 150 pages long.''
        The players received the pamphlets in June. When they returned to college in September, Ostendarp surprised them with a 25-question quiz. As he proudly told it, ''They all got A's.''
        After he retired, he helped coach the junior varsity teams in football and lacrosse at Deerfield (Mass.) Academy. In 1982, he served as president of the American Football Coaches Association.
        He and his wife, the former Shirley Reidinger, were married in 1953 and lived in Sunderland, Mass. He is also survived by three sons, Jim, of South Deerfield, Mass.; Jan, of West Roxbury, Mass.; and Carl, of Ithaca, N.Y.; four daughters, Teresa Tan of Marshfield, Mass.; Anne, of Hanover, N.H.; Beth Aparicio of Darien, Conn.; Heidi, of Bethel, Conn.; and four grandchildren.
        He considered coaching at Amherst as a high calling. When a reporter once asked if he would like to coach at a bigger college, he said, ''Where would you go after Amherst?''
