He then became a vice president of United States Lines from 1967 to 1969 and a vice president of Global Terminal & Container Services Inc. of Bayonne, N.J., until his second retirement in 1976.
        He was a native of Manhattan and a graduate of the General Staff College and the Army War College. In World War II, he was captured by Japanese forces in the Philippines and was a prisoner until 1945.
        His later assignments were mainly in transportation and included posts in West Germany and at the Pentagon. His awards included the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, three Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts.
        Surviving are his wife, Willa; a daughter, Sy, of Hancock, N.H., and a sister, Marjorie Kelly, of Chatsworth, Calif.
