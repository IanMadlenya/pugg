        Sam Woodyard, one of three major drummers who played in Duke Ellington's orchestra, died of cancer Tuesday in a Paris hospital, friends reported. He was 63 years old and had lived in Paris since 1975.
        Mr. Woodyard was hospitalized three weeks ago. In 1985 he had surgery for a tumor, and subsequently Bertrand Tavernier, who directed the jazz film '' 'Round Midnight,'' and others formed the Association of Friends of Sam Woodyard to help him.
        Mr. Woodyard played with the Ellington orchestra from 1955 to 1968. He succeeded Louis Bellson, who followed William (Sonny) Greer. Mr. Woodyard used two bass drums, as did Mr. Bellson, giving the band a characteristic sound. Later, rock groups adopted the practice. Earlier, Mr. Woodyard worked with bands led by Paul Gayten, Roy Eldridge and Milt Buckner.
        Duke Ellington once termed Mr. Woodyard his best drummer since Mr. Bellson. ''When he plays,'' said Ellington, ''he lives a love affair with his drums.''
