        Justice Amos E. Bowman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Justice Bowman, who graduated from Howard University and its law school simultaneously in 1941, had been a Supreme Court justice since 1969. Before that, from 1959, he was a Civil Court judge. The 14-year term to which he was re-elected in 1982 was to have expired at the end of next year because of a constitutional age limit.
        Justice Bowman and his daughter, Janice Bowman Windham, were believed to be the first black father and daughter in the nation to be judges at the same time, when she became a Housing Court judge in 1985.
        Justice Bowman, a Democrat who was earlier legal counsel of the New York chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, entered public life with his appointment to assistant United States attorney in Manhattan in 1951. From 1954 to his election to Civil Court, he was an assistant deputy comptroller for the city.
        Besides his daughter, Justice Bowman is survived by his wife, the former Ethel Burke, and a brother, William, of White Plains.
