        Anton Furst, the Oscar-winning production designer who created the Batmobile and the haunting sets for the 1989 film "Batman," leaped to his death on Sunday, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said Monday. He was 47 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Furst died of multiple injuries after jumping from about the eighth floor of a car-park structure at 4 P.M. on Sunday, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office. Detective Sgt. E. D. Toles said that there was a witness and that the police have ruled out foul play.
        An article in The Hollywood Reporter today said that Mr. Furst had been undergoing treatment for alcohol and drug abuse at a rehabilitation center in Los Angeles.
        As a production designer, Mr. Furst worked on "Company of Wolves" "Full Metal Jacket" and "Awakenings" in addition to "Batman." He and the set decorator Peter Young shared the Academy Award for art direction on "Batman."
        Mr. Furst also designed Planet Hollywood, the $15 million Manhattan restaurant owned by the actors Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis. Did Lights for the Who
        Anthony Francis Furst was born in England. He studied at Brighton College and graduated from the Royal College of Arts in 1969. After graduation, he developed and designed "The Light Fantastic," a holography show that became the touring light show for the rock group the Who in the mid-1970's.
        Mr. Furst, who was one of the early designers of laser special effects, owned the London-based Holoco, a special-effects company that worked on "Star Wars," "Superman," "Alien" and "'Moonraker," among other films.
        In an interview before the opening of "Batman," Mr. Furst characterized film making as "the perfect marriage of all my interests."
        He is survived by a daughter, Vanessa King; a son, Nicholas Sergei Furst; his mother, Pamela Furst, and a sister, Jane Wearne.
