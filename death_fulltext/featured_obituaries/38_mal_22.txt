        Gerard Blitz, founder of the Club Mediterranee empire of vacation villages billed as an ''antidote to civilization,'' has died, company officials said today. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Blitz died on Saturday night at Cochin Hospital in Paris after a serious illness, the officials said. The cause of death was not disclosed.
        A diamond cutter by trade, the Belgian-born Mr. Blitz created Club Med in 1950 as a nonprofit association and led the first group of vacationers to a tent village in the Balearic Islands of Spain.
        Club Med villages progressed from tents to straw huts to modern hotels, prospering with a formula of prepaid, no-tipping vacations in which clients pay with colored beads for the few extras like souvenirs or bar drinks.
        With its image of sun, sand and relaxation, Club Med grew into one of the world's largest tourism groups, with more than 87,000 beds in its resorts.
        Much of the credit for the growth went to Gilbert Trigano, who supplied tents for Club Med in the early years, joined the company in 1954 and succeeded Mr. Blitz as president in 1963. Mr. Blitz remained honorary president until his death.
        ''He was an extraordinary man who had an immense understanding of life,'' Mr. Trigano said today. ''He was a man of happiness.''
        Mr. Blitz, who was born on Feb. 28, 1912, was married twice, first to Denise Libbrecht and then to Claudine Coindeau. He had four sons and a daughter.
