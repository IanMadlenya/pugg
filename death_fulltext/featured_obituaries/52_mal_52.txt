        Chucky Mullins, the University of Mississippi football player who was paralyzed after making a tackle in a game two years ago, died today. He was 21 years old.
        Mr. Mullins, who after his accident became an inspiration for his team, his university and the state of Mississippi, died of complications from a blood clot in his lungs, said Michael Calhoun, a representative of Baptist Memorial Hospital.
        While dressing for class last Wednesday at the university in Oxford, Miss., Mullins passed out and stopped breathing. He was moved to the hospital in Memphis on Friday.
        A defensive back, Mr. Mullins was paralyzed from the neck down after making a tackle in a game against Vanderbil on Oct. 28, 1989. Support of the black football player, from students, fans, other Mississippians and people around the country, transcended race.
        Today, Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi said: "Chucky Mullins brought out the best in Mississippi, and he taught us all just how precious life is."
        After the accident, more than $1 million was raised for Mr. Mullins.
        The University of Mississippi sports information office said Mullins is survived by a brother and his father, but they could not provide names or where they lived.
