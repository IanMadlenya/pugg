        Mr. Jardine underwent a heart-transplant operation on June 16 after it was determined that he suffered from a weakening of the heart muscle. He was readmitted to the hospital Wednesday after complaining of shortness of breath.
        His Wisconsin teams had a 37-47-3 record, with his best season being 7-4 in 1974.
