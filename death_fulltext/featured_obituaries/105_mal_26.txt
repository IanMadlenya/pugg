        Wim Swaan, who as a photographer illustrated more than 18 books on art history, architecture and antiquities, and as an architect worked on many of New York City's largest hospitals, died on Sunday in Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 68 and lived in Riverdale in the Bronx.
        His firm said the cause was pulmonary fibrosis.
        Mr. Swaan retired last year as director of design at Architecture for Health, Science and Commerce, a firm in Tarrytown, N.Y. His most recent projects included a major renovation of the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan and the Capital District Psychiatric Center in Albany.
        Earlier projects included Presbyterian Hospital, Mount Sinai Medical Center,  North General Hospital, Kings County Hospital Center and Methodist Hospital. His colleagues said his primary specialty was the exterior design of structures and  the esthetics of facades and public space.
        But Mr. Swaan was more widely known as a photographer and art historian. The  subjects of his books included Japanese lanterns, Gothic cathedrals and places like Spain, Morocco, Tibet, Istanbul and India. His most recent book of photographs was "Oxford and Cambridge" (1988), for Cambridge University Press.
        Mr. Swaan was born in South Africa and earned two degrees in architecture at  the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, where he practiced architecture for two years. He later graduated from the Yale School of Organization and Management and the Harvard University Graduate School of Design.
        In 1966 he became a United States citizen.
        He was a member of the American Institute of Architects and the Royal Institute of British Architects. There are no survivors.
