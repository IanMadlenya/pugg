        Claude Gallimard, who headed his family's publishing company, Editions Gallimard, until 1988, died on Monday in Paris, the company announced. He was 77 years old.
        No cause of death was given, but he was known to have Alzheimer's disease.
        Editions Gallimard has long been France's largest and most prestigious independent publishing house. It was founded in 1911 by Claude Gallimard's father, Gaston, who built its reputation around publishing literary giants like Sartre, Proust and Camus.
        Claude Gallimard ran the company from 1976 to 1988, when he retired for health reasons.
        A much-publicized family feud flared when he forced out his older son, Christian, and named his younger son, Antoine, as his successor.
        Mr. Gallimard was born Jan. 10, 1914, in Paris. He studied law and joined the family firm in 1937.
        In addition to his two sons, he is survived by two daughters, Francoise and Isabelle.
