        John Scoville Hall, an astronomer who also helped develop radar systems in World War II, died Tuesday at his home in Sedona, Ariz. He was 83 years old.
        Dr. Hall died of heart failure, his family said.
        During the war, Dr. Hall led the effort at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop radar equipment for use on aircraft carriers. He later edited "Radar Aids to Navigation" (McGraw-Hill, 1947).
        Born in Old Lyme, Conn., he was a graduate of Amherst College and earned a doctorate in astronomy from Yale University. Early in his career, he taught at Swarthmore and Amherst.
        In his research, Dr. Hall pioneered in photoelectric photometry of stars in the infrared portion of the spectrum and was also a co-discoverer of interstellar polarization in the Milky Way.
        For a decade he was an official at the Naval Observatory in Washington. His interest in the photometry of star nebulae prompted him to help establish the Naval Observatory's station at Flagstaff, Ariz.
        In 1958 Dr. Hill became director of the privately financed Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, a post he held until his retirement in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth Chandler Hall; a son, Richard, of Flagstaff; a daughter, Carolyn Smith of Claremont, Calif., and four grandchildren.
