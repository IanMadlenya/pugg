        The Rev. Paul Newton Poling, a Presbyterian clergyman who helped direct his church's agenda on peace and social issues in the years immediately after World War II, died on Jan. 19 at the White Acres Retirement Center in El Paso, where he lived. He was 92.
        The cause was complications from a series of strokes, said a son, the Rev. David Poling of Albuquerque, N.M.
        As secretary of the Division of Social Education and Action of the Presbyterian Church, U.S.A., from 1946 to 1952, Mr. Poling mobilized support for the United Nations and spoke out against the efforts to establish a permanent national conscription law.
        His leadership was part of a national movement that argued that the best opportunity for peace was in strengthening the United Nations, not making military training mandatory.
        Born to parents who were missionaries in Oregon, Mr. Poling graduated from Willamette University and was ordained by the Oregon Conference of the Evangelical Church in 1922.
        He served as a pastor in the New Jersey towns of Belmar and Bound Brook, El Paso, and Salem, Ore. For the 19 years before his retirement in 1982, he was a chaplain in El Paso.
        Besides his son David, Mr. Poling is survived by his wife of 69 years, Olive Tomlinson Poling; and two other sons, also ordained Presbyterian ministers, the Rev. Charles Poling of Newport, Ore., and the Rev. John Clark Poling of Las Cruces, N.M.
