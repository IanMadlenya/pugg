        Ruth K. Friedlich, a writer whose articles were published in several magazines, including Reader's Digest and Better Homes and Gardens, and who helped write some of the earliest television commercials, died on Wednesday at the Stamford Hospital in Stamford, Conn.
        Mrs. Friedlich, who was 97, lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was complications after a fall and surgery, her family said.
        She is survived by a daughter, Kate Witkin, of Harrison, N.Y.; two sons, Dr. Allan Friedlich of Belmont, Mass., and Bruce Friedlich of New York, eight grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
