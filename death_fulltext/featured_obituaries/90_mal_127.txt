        Erwin Ringel, a prominent Austrian social critic and the author of a best-selling book on anti-Semitism, died on Thursday. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack. Dr. Ringel used a wheelchair in later life because he had multiple sclerosis.
        Dr. Ringel, a psychiatrist, drew attention as an opponent of Kurt Waldheim,  who was elected President of Austria in 1986 despite criticism of his record as  a German Army officer in the Balkans during World War II.
        "In Erwin Ringel, Austria has lost a particularly important voice of its conscience," said Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a friend.
        Born on April 27, 1921, in Timisoara, Romania, Erwin Ringel was taken to Austria as a baby. In his youth, he was active in Roman Catholic groups that opposed Hitler's rising Nazi movement. He was briefly detained by the Gestapo in 1939, a year after Hitler annexed Austria, and was drafted into the army.
        In 1943, he publicly called Hitler a "psychopath." A doctor working with the resistance movement helped him avoid persecution, and had the army discharge him by claiming he had a thyroid problem.
        After the war, he became a psychiatrist, focusing on the study of suicide. His 1984 book "The Austrian Soul," which included a controversial analysis of anti-Semitism, became a best-seller.
        He is survived by his wife, Angela.
