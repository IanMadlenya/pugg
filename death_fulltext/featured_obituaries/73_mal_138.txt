        William H. Kammerer, a physician and professor who was an expert in rheumatology, died on Feb. 17 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Indianapolis. He was 80 and lived in Culver, Ind.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Kammerer, who practiced internal medicine for 50 years in Manhattan, served as chief of the arthritis clinic at the Hospital for Special Surgery from 1970 to 1989 and was named a master by the American College of Rheumatology, its highest honor.

        Dr. Kammerer taught at the Cornell University Medical College and was an attending physician at New York Hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center and Doctors' Hospital.
        After he retired from his practice in 1989, he worked as a volunteer physician at Indian reservations in Montana, South Dakota and Iowa.
        He was born in Logansport, Ind., and graduated from the University of Notre Dame and the Indiana University Medical School. During World War II he served as a lieutenant colonel with the United States Army Medical Corps in field hospitals in the Philippines and New Guinea.
