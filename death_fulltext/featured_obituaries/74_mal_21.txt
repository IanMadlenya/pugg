        Prof. Chaim Leib Pekeris, a mathematician and founder of the mathematics department at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, died on Feb. 25 at Kaplan Hospital there. He was 84 and lived in Rehovot.
        He had suffered a stroke, the institute said.
        Professor Pekeris, who was born in Lithuania, came to the United States in 1925 and received a doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1934. Specializing in applied mathematics and geophysics, he worked at M.I.T., Columbia University and the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton before going to Israel in 1948.
        That year, he organized the Weizmann Institute's mathematics department. Professor Pekeris headed it until retiring in 1973 but an institute spokesman said yesterday that he had continued to write scientific papers and do research there until the day he died.
        His wife, the former Leah Kaplan, died in 1973.
