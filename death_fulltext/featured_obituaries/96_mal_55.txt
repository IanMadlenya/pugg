        M. Allen Pond, who was an Assistant Surgeon General of the United States in the 1960's and later the dean of the School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh, died last Wednesday at his home in Cranberry Township, Pa. He was 82.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Madeleine.
        In his Government career, Mr. Pond worked as a special assistant to the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, helping to develop Federal health care policies that culminated in the enactment of Medicare in 1965.
        Upon his retirement in 1968, he became a professor of public health at Pittsburgh and was appointed dean in 1981, a post he held until he retired in 1985.
        Born in Ansonia, Conn., Mr. Pond earned a bachelor's degree in civil engineering and a master's in public health at Yale University. He began his career teaching at the Yale Medical School and went into the Public Health Service at the outbreak of World War II. In 1978 he received the Sedgwick Memorial Award, the health service's highest.
        In addition to his wife of 56 years, he is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of Boston, and Roger, of Richmond; a daughter, Sarah Williams of San Diego, and seven grandchildren.
