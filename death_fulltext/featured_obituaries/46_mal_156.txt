        Theodore A. Kelly, a senior justice of the New York State Supreme Court, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital. He was 70 years old and lived in Pearl River, N.Y.
        He died of liver failure, his daughter Gail Gaylord of Westport, Conn., said.
        Justice Kelly had served on the Supreme Court bench in Rockland County since 1973. Before that, he was a Rockland County judge from 1969 to 1973 and a town justice in Orangetown, N.Y., from 1961 to 1969.
        A 1948 graduate of St. John's Law School, he was in private practice for 20 years before going on the county court bench.
        In addition to his daughter Gail, he is survived by his wife, the former Jean Carleton; two sons, Christopher, of Nyack, and Theodore Jr., of Vernon, Vt.; another daughter, Alison Kelly of Nyack; and six grandchildren.
