        Dr. Frederic Kavaler, a physiologist whose study of the contraction of heart cells opened the way for research on ways to treat heart disease, died on Jan. 4 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 71 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was stomach cancer, family members said.
        Dr. Kavaler, a professor of physiology at the State University of New York Health Sciences Center in Brooklyn, was one of the first researchers to find ways to study individual heart cells to find out what affected their contractions. His work in the 1960's and 70's on frog heart muscle pointed the way toward drugs that could treat failing hearts, said Dr. Olaf Andersen, a professor of physiology at Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan.
        ''To everyone's surprise, he showed that the contractions could be controlled by changes in the extracellular calcium,'' Dr. Andersen said. ''He was leading the field at the time.''
        Dr. Kavaler was president of the New York Heart Association from 1983 to 1985. He was born in the Bronx and received his B.A. from Columbia University in 1947 and his M.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1951. He worked at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn, at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island and at the Cornell University Medical College before joining Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Rebecca Kavaler; two sons, Joshua Kavaler of San Diego and Matt Kavaler of Toronto, and a brother, Arthur Kavaler of Manhattan.
