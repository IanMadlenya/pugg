        Bibb Falk, who replaced Shoeless Joe Jackson after that Chicago White Sox outfielder was banished from baseball in 1920 for his part in fixing the 1919 World Series, died Thursday night after a long illness. He was 90 years old.
        Mr. Falk, who coached the University of Texas to 2 national baseball championships and 20 Southwest Conference titles, was the last survivor of the 1920 White Sox team that was rebuilt after the scandal that led to the banning of eight of Chicago's players for life.
        He was runner-up to Babe Ruth for the American League batting title in 1924 when he hit .352. In 12 seasons with the White Sox and Cleveland Indians he had a .315 career batting average.
        Mr. Falk's 1949 and 1950 Texas teams won national championships and his 25-year record with the Longhorns was 470 victories and 176 defeats. He retired in 1967 and was succeeded by Cliff Gustafson, the current Longhorns coach.
        Survivors include a sister-in-law and six nieces and nephews.
