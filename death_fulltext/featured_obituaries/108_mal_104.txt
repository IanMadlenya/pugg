        Frank Dorsa, who invented the frozen waffle and teamed up with his brothers to found what became Eggo Food Products, died on Wednesday here. He was 88.
        Mr. Dorsa started a food company in 1932 with his brothers, Sam and Anthony,  in the basement of their parents' home. Using first mayonnaise and then waffle batter, they developed a dry mixture to which cooks had only to add milk.
        After the brothers bought a San Jose potato chip plant in 1938, Mr. Dorsa invented an automatic, continuous potato peeler.
        In the 1950's he invented a carousel-like machine that could make thousands of waffles an hour. In 1966 he and his brothers sold their company, and it later became part of the Kellogg Company.
        "My dad liked gadgets," said his son Frank Jr. "He was always tinkering."
        Mr. Dorsa did not stop inventing after the family business was sold. A fryer  he invented that does not curl bacon was used in local restaurants. He also experimented with frozen pancakes but could not come up with a satisfactory recipe.
