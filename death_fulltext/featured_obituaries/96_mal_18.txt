        Melvin Williams Searls Jr., a business executive who left the oil industry to become the first commercial counselor in Beijing in 1982 after the United States re-established ties with China, died last Wednesday in his home in Arlington, Va. He was 59 and also resided in Vail, Colo.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his wife, Aurel Brown Searls.
        After a career with the Exxon Corporation that included posts in southeast Asia as well as Switzerland and South Africa, he joined the Department of Commerce in 1981 and served in Beijing until 1985 when he returned to Washington to become Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for East Asia Affairs.
        Born in White Plains, he graduated from Williams College in 1957 and received a master's degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University in 1963. In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Neil Prophet Searls of Lake Forest, Ill., Mark Denison Searls of Wayzata, Minn., and Paul Murphy Searls of Arlington, Va.; and a sister, Ann S. Lanyi of Whispering Pines, N.C.
