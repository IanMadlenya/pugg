        Philip Young, an authority on Ernest Hemingway and a professor emeritus of English at Pennsylvania State University, died on Friday at Center Community Hospital in State College, Pa. He was 73 years old and lived in State College.
        He died of respiratory failure, said his wife, Katherine.
        Among his several books was "Ernest Hemingway" (1952), which was revised in 1966 as "Ernest Hemingway: A Reconsideration," and published by the Pennsylvania State University Press. A new book, "The Private Melville," is to be published by Penn State Press.
        Professor Young was born in Boston, received a B.A. from Amherst College in 1940, attended Harvard University and received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa in 1948. From 1942 to 1946 he was a United States Army artillery officer in Europe.
        He was a Fulbright Scholar and a fellow of the Institute for the Arts and Humanistic Studies.
        He taught at New York University and Kansas State University before joining the Penn State faculty in 1959. He was named Evan Pugh Professor of English at Penn State in 1981.
        Surviving, in addition to his wife, are his daughter, Rosalie, of State College; two stepsons, Stanton B. Garner Jr. of Knoxville, Tenn., and George F. Garner of Arlington, Tex., and a sister, Janet Young Richardson of Farmington, Conn.
