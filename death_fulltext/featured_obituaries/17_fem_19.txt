        Evelyn D. Seide Walter, personal secretary and companion to Helen Keller for 37 years, died Thursday at a hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., after a long illness. She was 88 years old and lived in Pompano Beach, Fla.
        Mrs. Walter was 20 when she went to work as a secretary for the American Foundation for the Blind in Manhattan. She met Miss Keller there a short time later and became secretary to the blind and deaf woman who surmounted her physical limitations to become an author, educator and champion for the handicapped.
        After the death of Miss Keller's companion of many years, Polly Thompson, Mrs. Walter became her ''eyes,'' running the Keller home in Westport, Conn., and managing her finances until Miss Keller's death in 1968.
        ''She loved Helen Keller dearly,'' said Mrs. Walter's daughter, Evelyn D. Tonner of Margate, Fla. She added that her mother had promised Miss Keller and Polly Thompson that she would never write a book about her experiences as a companion, a promise she honored.
        In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Walter is survived by her husband, Fred, and six grandchildren.
