        Aida Anthony Whedon, an artist and a teacher to generations of children, died yesterday at her home in Port Washington, L.I. She was 78.
        Her New Orleans accent unaltered despite half a century in New York, Mrs. Whedon was a bustling mother hen for thousands of children at the Whedon School of Art, which she and her husband, Daniel Whedon, a sculptor, operated.
        Mrs. Whedon's works are in many collections, including the North Shore Unitarian Church of Plandome, L.I., the universities of Maine, Chicago and Rutgers, and many banks and corporations. After her first show at the Walker Gallery in New York in 1937, she had one-person shows at the South Street Museum, the Graphic Eye Gallery in Port Washington, and galleries in England, Maine, New York and Long Island.
        She is survived by her husband; two children, Roger Anthony Whedon and Susan Whedon, and two grandchildren, Arie Daniel Whedon and Amelia Whedon.
