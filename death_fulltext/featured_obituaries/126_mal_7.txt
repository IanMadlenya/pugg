        Michael E. Cohen, executive vice president of the Hudson News Company, a large wholesale distributor and retailer of magazines, died on Wednesday at his home in Englewood, N.J. He was 41.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Cohen, a native of Englewood, joined Hudson News, his family's business, in 1978, the year he graduated from Boston University. He was named executive vice president of the company, which is based in North Bergen, N.J., in 1993.
        He served as a director of Worldwide Media Services, an exporter of American magazines headquartered in Jersey City. He had been a trustee of Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, Marla Diamond Cohen; a son, Michael S.; his parents, Robert and Harriet Cohen of Englewood; his brother, James, of Alpine, N.J., and his sister, Claudia Cohen of Manhattan.
