        Miranda Reeves, a slave's daughter who was believed to be 113 years old, died Thursday at a convalescent home here.
        Her oldest grandddaughter, Ruby Fletcher, 57 years old, said her grandmother, a native of Camden, S.C., moved to Connecticut in the 1940's.
        Mrs. Fletcher said survivors included two daughters, Cathron Harris and Thelma Ford, both of Colchester; 9 grandchildren; 39 great-grandchildren; 40 great-great-grandchildren and 1 great-great-great-grandchild.
        Her exact age could never be officially verified. At her last birthday, Mary Ellen Klinck, State Commissioner on Aging, said that if she were indeed 113 she would be Connecticut's oldest resident.
