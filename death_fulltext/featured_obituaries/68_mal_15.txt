        Dr. Norman N. Frenkiel, an authority on geriatrics, died on Saturday at the Hebrew Home at Riverdale in the Bronx. He was 87 years old and had lived at the home since 1989.
        Dr. Frenkiel died of heart and lung failure, said Angela Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the home.
        Dr. Frenkiel was medical director of the home from 1953 to 1982. During that time, the number of its residents increased to nearly 2,000, from 122. Under his direction the home became prominent for its treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and for its community-care and special programs for the frail.
        Born in Vilnius, Lithuania, Dr. Frenkiel received a degree from the School of Tropical Medicine in Brussels. He earned a medical degree from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland in 1936. He was chief physician of the Jewish Committee in Marseilles from 1940 to 1943. From 1943 to 1949 Dr. Frenkiel was associate chief physician of the Administration of Refugees in Zurich and later chief of the tuberculosis section of the World Health Organization. He emigrated to the United States in 1949.
        He is survived by his wife, Geraldine, and two sons, Alan of Positano, Italy, and Andrew, who lives in the Bronx.
