        Victor Aloysius Meyers, a band leader and comedian who turned politician and won five terms as Washington State's Lieutenant Governor and two terms as its Secretary of State, died Monday at the Mount St. Vincent Nursing Center. He was 93 years old.
        Mr. Meyers first gained fame during Prohibition as a big-band leader and comedian. He began his political career in 1932, when he ran for Mayor of Seattle as a prank. He campaigned in top hat, wheeled through the city in a beer wagon, and appeared at a businessmen's luncheon costumed as Gandhi to portray himself as the "poor man's candidate."
        Mr. Meyers, a liberal Democrat, lost that race. But he went on, with support of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, to run for lieutenant governor later that year. He won, and held the office until 1952, when he was turned out in the landslide that accompanied the election of Dwight D. Eisenhower as President.
        Four years later he was elected Secretary of State, and served in that office until 1964.
        Among Mr. Meyers's campaign one-liners was, "I never wear a vest, because I don't want to be accused of standing for vested interests."
        He is survived by a daughter, Mary Louise Moore of Kent, Wash.
