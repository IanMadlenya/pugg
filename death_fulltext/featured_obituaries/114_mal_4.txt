        Howard O. Colgan Jr., a retired partner in the Manhattan-based law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, representing such clients as the New York Stock Exchange and Chase Manhattan Bank, died on Tuesday at Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, N.J. A longtime Ridgewood resident, he was 84 and lived in Vero Beach, Fla., and Wyckoff, N.J.
        The cause was a ruptured aneurysm, the law firm said.
        Mr. Colgan was also a former trustee of Amherst College.
        He was born in Donora, Pa., and graduated from Amherst College and Harvard Law School. He joined the firm in 1937, specializing in corporate law, and retired 43 years later, in 1980, as a senior partner.
        Mr. Colgan is survived by his second wife, Jacqueline Biggio Colgan; two daughters, Cynthia C. McGrath of Morris Plains, N.J., and Ann C. Benson of Alexandria, Va., whose mother, Mildred Lively Colgan, died in 1972. Also surviving are three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
