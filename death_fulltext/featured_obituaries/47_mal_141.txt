        Morton K. Blaustein, a Baltimore industrialist and philanthropist who was the chairman and chief executive of the American Trading and Production Corporation, died Monday. He was 64 years old and lived in Pikesville, Md.
        He choked on food while on a business trip to Richmond, a corporation spokesman said.
        Mr. Blaustein had been with American Trading for 36 years and had been chairman of the family corporation since 1970. The company's primary business is in oil exploration and the operation of oil tanker fleets, but in his tenure it expanded into manufacturing, communications, real estate development, hotels and office building management.
        The holder of a Ph.D. in petroleum geology from Stanford University, he served as national vice president of the American Jewish Committee for nine years. He was former chairman of the committee's Baltimore branch and was a member of its board.
        He also served on the administrative council of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, an organization founded in 1971 by the Blaustein family to honor Mr. Blaustein's father.
        Mr. Blaustein was also a member of the National Petroleum Council and of the public policy committee of the Advertising Council. He served on the boards of the Park School, Sinai Hospital and Johns Hopkins University.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane; two daughters from a previous marriage, Susan Berlow of the Philippines and Jeanne Bokor of Manhattan; two stepchildren, Sandra Carter and Taylor Lucas, both of Baltimore, and two sisters, Barbara Hirschhorn of Baltimore and Elizabeth Roswell of Bridgewater, N.J.
