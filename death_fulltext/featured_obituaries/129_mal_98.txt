        George A. Vicas, a producer and director of television documentaries on politics and culture, died on Saturday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 71.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        For more than 30 years, Mr. Vicas produced documentaries for NBC, CBS, ABC and PBS, on subjects ranging from the history of the Kremlin to the political career of Charles de Gaulle. His film on Artur Rubinstein, produced for NBC in 1969, won an Emmy for Mr. Vicas, one of several awards he won during his long career.
        He also made historical films covering events like the Spanish Armada and the French Revolution.
        Mr. Vicas was born in Berlin in 1926 and moved to the United States with his family in the 1930's. He served in the Army counterintelligence corps during World War II. After the war, he attended Harvard University, graduating with a degree in government in 1950. He earned a master's degree in science from Columbia University.
        Fluent in languages including German, French and Russian, Mr. Vicas began his journalism career in Paris as a writer and producer for the French Government during the years of the Marshall Plan. He joined CBS News as a writer and producer of documentary films in 1954.
        He enjoyed his greatest success after joining NBC News in 1961. When he was named the chief of NBC's European production unit in 1967, Mr. Vicas called his appointment ''a revolutionary step in terms of network television.'' It was the first time an American network had established a documentary unit in Europe.
        He spent 10 years with NBC, making films like ''The Pope and the Vatican'' and ''Germany: Fathers and Sons -- A Barrier of Silence,'' before moving on to independent production work for clients like PBS and National Geographic.
        He is survived by a son, Robert,  and a daughter, Leslie, both of Manhattan; his companion, Danielle Kempf, and three grandchildren.
