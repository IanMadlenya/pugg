        H. David Meador, an art director at the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles advertising agency in New York, died Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 47 years old.
        Mr. Meador lived in Manhattan. He tested H.I.V.-positive five years ago and died of pneumonia, said Linda Mays, his executor and friend.
        A fine-arts graduate of the University of Arizona, Mr. Meador started his career with the J. Walter Thompson agency. He worked there for 19 years, becoming a vice president. After a freelance period, he joined D'Arcy Masius in 1990. He was promoted last year to senior vice president and senior art director. Over the years, his work was recognized with dozens of awards.
        Mr. Meador is survived by his mother, Mary Meador, of San Bernardino, Calif., and a sister, Mary Ann Watson, of Phoenix.
