        His father, Benjamin, said the cause of death was lymphoma.
        Mr. Bader was trained as a city planner at the School of Architecture at Yale University. During the John V. Lindsay administration, he served as deputy administrator for the New York City Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Administration and also directed the Mayor's Office of Lower Manhattan Development. He helped to create the 911 emergency telephone system. From 1973 to 1977, he was a curator at the State Museum in Albany, where he began a section devoted to the history of New York City.
        In 1977, he became executive director of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and was credited with reorganizing its finances. In the early 1980's he became a co-owner of the Wilbur Theater in Boston, and with his partner, Charles Parker, restored the 1,200-seat playhouse.
        In recent years, Mr. Bader served as a consultant to the city of Arlington, Va., and to the Private Industry Council, a Philadelphia public-interest group.
        Surviving Mr. Bader, in addition to his father, is his mother, Beatrice, of Manhattan.
