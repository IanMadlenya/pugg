        Mrs. Siskind was a founder of the Bronx Women's Bar in the early 1930's, before women were admitted to the men's bar association. She was its president for two decades, during which she was an active trial and appellate lawyer. Women were admitted to the Bronx Bar Association in 1945, and Mrs. Siskind served as its president from 1970 to 1971. She was appointed to the Mayor's Judiciary Committee by John V. Lindsay in the late 1960's and re-appointed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame. She retired in 1978.
        Mrs. Siskind was born in Mogilev in Byelorussia and came to the United States as a child. She studied at Hunter College and graduated from New York University Law School in 1923.
        She is survived by her husband, Jesse, a retired New York lawyer; a son, Dr. Gregory Siskind of Manhattan, and a brother, Nathaniel Drabkin, also of Manhattan.
