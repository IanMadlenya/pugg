        Herb Friedwald, a jazz producer, jazz historian and lawyer whose interests ranged from the most traditional New Orleans music to the most abstract free-jazz, died on Thursday at his home in Brooklyn Heights. He was 62 years old.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son, the jazz critic Will Friedwald.
        Mr. Friedwald fell in love with jazz at an early age. After studying at Tulane University in the 1950's, he began to gather oral histories from unsung and unrecorded jazz musicians in New Orleans. Many of his interview tapes are collected in the Hogan Jazz Archives at Tulane.
        For a series of recordings called ''New Orleans: The Living Legends'' for the Riverside label in the early 60's, he organized sessions with musicians like Jim Robinson, Billie and Dede Pierce, Kid Thomas, Louis Cottrell, Sweet Emma Barrett, Peter Bocage and Percy Humphrey.
        In the early 60's he moved back to New York and became a lawyer and author of legal texts. By the 70's his curiosity had turned toward the avant-garde, and he started the Kharma record label, recording and producing albums by Butch Morris, Kenny Davern and Steve Lacy, and Burton Greene, among others. He became active again in jazz scholarship, writing liner notes for albums by contemporary New Orleans musicians and reissues of albums like one by the pianist Joe Robichaux.
        In addition to Will, of Manhattan, he is survived by another son, Leo, of Las Vegas, Nev., and a brother, Frank, of Oceanside, N.Y.
