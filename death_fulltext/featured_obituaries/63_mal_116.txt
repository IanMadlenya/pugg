        Jack Mintz, a leader in the garment industry in the 1930's and 1940's and a real-estate executive until he retired at the age of 95, died on Tuesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 97 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Mintz was president of the National Dress Manufacturers Association and treasurer of the New York Dress Institute. For many years he was president of the Parisian Manufacturing Company, which was founded by his father. It closed in 1948.
        Later focusing on real estate, Mr. Mintz was president and general partner of a family firm whose main property was the office building at 205 West 39th Street, near Seventh Avenue, in Manhattan. He operated that business until 1990, when a grandson took over.
        An active Republican, Mr. Mintz was the manager of Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri's 1953 re-election campaign. The Mayor, an insurgent Democrat who was elected as an independent in 1950, lost his re-election bid to Robert F. Wagner.
        Among his civic activities, Mr. Mintz served with National Recovery Act agencies and the War Production Board in World War II. He was a fund-raising officer for the Navy Relief-USO Committee, National War Fund and United Jewish Appeal.
        His wife of 60 years, the former Susan Freedman, died in 1980. He is survived by a son, David, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
