        Scott F. Runkle, a journalist and longtime publicist for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, died on June 16 while on vacation in Vezelay, France. He was 77 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
        He died suddenly at his hotel, said his daughter, Dr. Beatriz Runkle.
        Mr. Runkle was the president of Washington-International Communications, a public relations firm, and was a consultant to the government of Puerto Rico until the end of 1992.
        His association with Puerto Rico began in the early 1950's, when he worked as director of public relations for the Economic Development Administration. A founder of the Puerto Rico Information Service in San Juan in the late 1950's, he was instrumental in publicizing the Commonwealth's "Operation Bootstrap," a rapid economic-development program based on tax incentives.
        During World War II, he served as an intelligence officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel on Gen. Omar N. Bradley's staff in France. Afterward, he remained in Paris for a while as a journalist, then returned to the United States to work on the foreign desk at Time magazine in New York.
        He was born in Millersburg, Ohio, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1938.
        Besides his daughter Beatriz, of Reston, Va., he is survived by another daughter, Dr. Isabelle Runkle of Madrid; a sister, Margaret Scales of Clearwater, Fla., and a grandson.
