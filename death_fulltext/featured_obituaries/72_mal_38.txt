        William H. Angoff, whose work with the Scholastic Aptitude Test helped make it more understandable to millions of high school students and college admissions officers, died on Tuesday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 73.
        He died of a heart attack, said Tom Ewing, a spokesman for the Educational Testing Service of Lawrenceville, N.J.
        Dr. Angoff wrote and lectured widely on the measurements used in testing and scoring. He translated into everyday English the sometimes arcane statistical measures that helped to determine the educational fates of millions of college-bound students from the 1950's to the present.
        He was a research scientist at the Educational Testing Service. In his 43 years there he was executive director and division director of College Board programs, director of the developmental research division and executive director for technical development.
        Dr. Angoff, who was born in Boston, earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1940. During World War II he served in the United States Air Force psychological testing branch, testing prospective bombardiers, navigators and pilots. After the war he earned master's and doctoral degrees from Purdue University. He joined the Edcuational Testing Service in 1950.
        He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; a son, Douglas, and a daughter, Carolyn, both of Princeton.
