        Wendy Moore, an artist whose work ranged from installation sculptures to computer-manipulated photographs and drawings, died on Saturday in a hospital in Cleveland. She was 29 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause of death was complications from injuries suffered in a skiing accident this year, her family said.
        Ms. Moore graduated from Bates College in Maine and received a master's degree from the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif.
        In 1992, one of her works, a latex display of wall hangings that resembled the aftermath of surgical procedures, was part of an exhibit at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Her most recent show, computer-altered landscapes, was held at the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies last fall.
        Her work was also displayed at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and at the Bradbury Building in Los Angeles in 1995.
        Ms. Moore worked in the art departments of various films and on freelance graphic design projects in Los Angeles.
        She is survived by her parents, Marjorie and Dan T. Moore 3d of Cleveland Heights, Ohio; two sisters, Halley and Heather Moore of New York City, and four grandparents, Wayne and Eleanor Lewis of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and Dan T. Jr. and Elizabeth Moore of Cleveland Heights.
