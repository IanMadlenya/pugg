        Bill Colleran, a film and television director whose work ranged from documentaries to musical variety shows, died on June 1 in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 77.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        Born William Arthur Colleran in Edgerton, Wis., he began his career in the story department at 20th Century Fox, then served in the Navy during World War II. In the late 1940's he became an assistant to the director Louis de Rochemont and worked on the films ''13 Rue Madeleine'' and ''Boomerang.'' He also worked with de Rochemont on ''Lost Boundaries,'' a 1949 film about racism, and on the documentary ''Windjammer'' (1958), a wide-screen chronicle of the 17,000-mile cruise of a Norwegian training vessel. Mr. Colleran directed the 1964 filming of ''Hamlet,'' a Broadway production staged by John Gielgud.
        In the early 1950's Mr. Colleran became the associate director of the weekly television variety show ''Your Hit Parade,'' staging and directing musical numbers on the show. He also directed television specials featuring stars like Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Debbie Reynolds, and was executive producer of ''The Judy Garland Show.''
        Mr. Colleran's marriage to the actress Lee Remick ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Kate; a son, Matthew; two sisters; and two grandchildren.
