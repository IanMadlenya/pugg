        Steven F. Arnold, a photographer and film maker, died on Saturday in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 51.
        The cause was AIDS, said Wessel O'Connor Gallery, his representative in New York City.
        Mr. Arnold, a native of Oakland, Calif., had a master's degree in photography from the San Francisco Art Institute. He was the author of three photographic collections, "Angels of Night," "Epiphanies" and "Reliquaries." A fourth collection, "Theophonies," is to be published next month. His photographs are in the collections of museums including the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles and the Cincinnati Art Museum.
        Mr. Arnold's film projects included collaborations with the actress Ellen Burstyn, the director Lee Strasberg and the architect Buckminster Fuller. In the 1970's, he was a founder of a group of performance artists based in San Francisco.
        He is survived by his father, William F. Arnold of Oakland, and a sister, Jo Ann Webster of Eagle River, Alaska.
