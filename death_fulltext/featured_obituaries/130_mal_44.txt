        Schuyler Merritt Meyer Jr., a retired entrepreneur and longtime head of the Edwin Gould Foundation for Children, died Nov. 4 at his home in Dover Plains, N.Y. He was 79.
        The cause was cancer, the foundation reported.
        At his death Mr. Meyer was chairman and projects officer of the foundation, which is based in Manhattan. From 1966 until a few years ago he served as president of the charity, which was endowed in 1923 by the son of Jay Gould, the financier, to promote the welfare of children and improve their living conditions and education.
        At the end of 1994, the foundation reported assets of $36 million and outlays of $2.5 million for that year. It spends its money chiefly in New York but also aids some special projects elsewhere in the country. Mr. Meyer had been a board member since 1953.
        He also was the founder, in 1989, of the George Bird Grinnell American Indian Children's Fund. Named after his great-uncle, the naturalist and ethnologist, the fund provides educational opportunities and other assistance to American Indian families.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Meyer graduated from Yale College in 1940 and served in the Navy in World War II, rising to the rank of commander. He formed his own real estate development concern in 1952.
        He was a past chairman of the National Maritime Historical Society and of the New York State Council on Waterways.
        Mr. Meyer is survived by his wife of 55 years, Barbara Scott Meyer; three sons, Schuyler 3d, of Plano, Tex., and Scott and Allen, of Millbrook, N.Y.; two daughters, Molly Meyer of New Haven, Conn., and Aileen (Chuca) Meyer of Washington; three sisters, Molly O'Connor of Seattle, Janet Denison of Sutton, Vt., and Helen Germann of Buffalo, Wyo., and five grandchildren.
