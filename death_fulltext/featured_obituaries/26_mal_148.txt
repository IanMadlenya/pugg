        A 1931 graduate of Columbia University Law School, Judge Conford served on the Appellate Division of Superior Court from 1953 until he retired in 1979, including service as presiding judge of the court and as an acting justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. He participated in a number of important rulings, including the original Mount Laurel zoning law case; the opening of Little League baseball to girls; the Karen Ann Quinlan ''right to die'' decision; the upholding of blue laws restricting sales on Sundays, and the outlawing of property covenants that excluded sales to blacks and Jews.
        After retirement, he became counsel to the Woodbridge law firm of Wilentz, Goldman & Spitzer. He was also a former mayor of Hillside, N.J. and in the 1950's had served as counsel to Gov. Robert Meyner. He is survived by his wife, Beatrice; a daughter, Amy Roth of Montclair, N.J.; a son, Jeffrey, of Neptune, N.J.; a sister, Evelyn Rinsler of Jackson Heights, Queens; and three grandchildren.
