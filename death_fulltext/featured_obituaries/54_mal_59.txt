        Dr. Nicholas P. Dallis, a psychiatrist who created the "Judge Parker," "Rex Morgan M.D." and "Apartment 3-G" comic strips, died Saturday. He was 79 years old.
        The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.
        The strips that Dr. Dallis created are published in more than 400 American newspapers with a readership estimated to exceed 60 million.
        Professional artists drew the cartoons, based on Dr. Dallis's scripts. He had been medical director of a mental health clinic in Toledo, Ohio, when he began, and the success of the strips prompted him to quit his practice and move to Arizona in 1958, where he worked full time on the comics.
        He is survived by his wife, Sally, a former nurse who inspired "Apartment 3-G," two daughters and a son.
