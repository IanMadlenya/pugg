        Leonard L. Farber, the first president of the International Council of Shopping Centers, died on July 28 at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 89. The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Farber joined the council as president when it was founded in 1957, as shopping centers and malls began to spread across developing American suburbs. He oversaw the group for three years as president, then was a longtime board member and remained active on its executive committee until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, Antje; and three daughters, Lindy Linder, Peggy Farber and Felicia Farber Gervais. His son Robert died in 1995.
