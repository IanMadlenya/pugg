        Reuben Botsford Johnson, former dean of men and director of alumni relations at the University of Connecticut, died on Tuesday at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London. He was 79 and lived in Storrs and Black Point, Conn.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Dean Johnson, known as Ben, was born in New Haven, a descendant of the Botsford family that helped settle Milford, Conn., in 1639. He graduated from the university, where he was captain of the 1936 football team, and earned a master's degree in genetics from Brown University.
        He served as an Army intelligence officer overseas in World War II and the Korean War, and was a member of the Connecticut National Guard until 1966, reaching the rank of brigadier general.
        At the university, he was dean of men from 1946 until 1960 and headed alumni relations from 1962 until his retirement in 1970. In 1990, the university honored him with its highest award, the University Medal.
        Dean Johnson is survived by his wife, Louise Teich Johnson; a daughter, Jill Johnson Bergeron of Martha's Vineyard; a son, Reuben 3d of Manhattan; a brother, William H. of Mount Carmel, Conn., and four grandchildren.
