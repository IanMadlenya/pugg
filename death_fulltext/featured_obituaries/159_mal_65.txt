        John Paul Blewett, a nuclear physicist who played a significant role in the development of particle accelerators, died at a hospital in Chapel Hill, N.C., on April 7. He was 89. A Chapel Hill resident, he had lived in Manhattan and New Suffolk, N.Y.
        Dr. Blewett retired in 1978 as a senior physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, which he joined in 1947 to take part in building its proton synchrotron. Known as the Cosmotron, it went into operation in 1952 and was the world's most powerful energy accelerator.
        Dr. Blewett then began the design study for the 33-billion electron volt Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, operating since 1960. Later he directed design studies for improving it, and toward the development of more powerful accelerators. He was a consultant on accelerator technology to the French Atomic Energy Commission and CERN, the European particle physics laboratory. After retiring from Brookhaven, he was an adviser on a synchrotron light source to the government of Taiwan.
        Dr. Blewett was born in Toronto. He received a degree in physics and mathematics from the University of Toronto in 1932, and a master's in physics in 1933. In 1936 he received a Ph.D. in physics at Princeton.
        He joined the research laboratory of the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y., in 1937. There he made the first direct observation of synchrotron radiation -- the electromagnetic radiation given off when high-energy particles are accelerated in a strong magnetic field -- and its experimental verification in 1945.
        He was a fellow of the American Physical Society, which awarded him its Robert R. Wilson Prize in 1993.
        Survivors include his wife, Joan Warnow-Blewett; two stepdaughters, Dr. Tandy Warnow of Austin, Tex., and Dr. Kimmen Sjolander of Lafayette, Calif.; a stepson, Paul Warnow of San Francisco; and a sister, Constance Blewett of Toronto.
