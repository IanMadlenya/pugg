        Howard Cann, the basketball coach at New York University for more than three decades and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, died yesterday after a long illness. He was 97.
        Mr. Cann, who lived in Irvington, N.Y., died at Community Hospital in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
        Cann, a huge, good-natured man, not only coached the Violets through many of their glory years of basketball, but also ranked among the school's greatest athletes. He was an aggressive, defensive-oriented basketball player, and also a football and track star.
        Three years after he graduated from N.Y.U. in 1920, Cann replaced Ed Thorpe as the Violets' basketball coach. By the time he retired from the job 35 seasons later, his teams had posted a 429-235 record. He also doubled as the N.Y.U. football coach in 1932 and 1933. Cann was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1967.
        The growth and popularity of major college basketball is often traced, in part, to the night of Dec. 29, 1934, when Madison Square Garden opened its doors for the first of eight regularly scheduled doubleheaders. St. John's was paired against Westminster, and in the feature game, N.Y.U., coached by Cann, played Notre Dame. Born In Bridgeport
        The Violets, who went into the game with a 19-game winning streak, defeated the Irish, who were making their first New York appearance, 25-18.
        Cann's 1933-34 team, led by Jim Lancaster, the brother of the actor Burt, and Hagen Anderson, who was to become an outstanding basketball referee, had a record of 16-0. It was the only unbeaten Violet team.
        The 1944-45 Violets were beaten in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament final by Oklahoma State, 45-44, and the 1947-48 team had a 22-4 record.
        Howard G. Cann was born on Oct. 11, 1895, in Bridgeport, Conn.
        Later, it almost seemed as if the 6-foot-4-inch, 217-pound Cann had been predestined to become one of N.Y.U.'s greatest and most popular athletes. His father, Frank, was the N.Y.U. director of physical education.
        Howard entered N.Y.U. in 1914 and led the basketball team in scoring during his freshman season. As captain of the 1916-17 team, he led the football team, for which he played tackle and in the backfield and was ranked as one of the outstanding punters in the East. Served in World War I
        After serving in the Navy in World War I, Cann returned to N.Y.U. for the 1919-20 season and led the Violets to the National Amateur Athletic Union championship with a 49-21 victory over Rutgers.
        Before he graduated in 1920 from the university's school of engineering, Cann won the IC4A Middle Atlantic States and Penn Relays shot-put titles. He was a member of the 1920 United States Olympic team as a shot-putter.
        Mr. Cann is survived by his wife of 60 years, Janet; a son, Howard Jr., two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
