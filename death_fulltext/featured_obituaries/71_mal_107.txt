        Richard D. Weigle, an innovator in higher education who was president of St. John's College in Annapolis, Md. for 31 years, died Monday at the Annapolis Convalescent Center. He was 80 and lived in Annapolis.
        He died of complications of Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        When Dr. Weigle became president in 1949 at the age of 37, all of St. John's students were white men. That year the college admitted its first minority student, and in 1951 it became coeducational. In 1964 he founded an affiliated St. John's College in Santa Fe, N.M., and became its president as well.
        At the first St. John's, which opened in 1696 and was the nation's third oldest college, he continued the campus's unusual "100 Great Books" curriculum, which required studies focusing on the classic works of Western civilization.
        During his tenure, he raised more than $40 million for the two colleges. The enrollment at Annapolis doubled to about 350, while the Santa Fe college grew to a similar size.
        Dr. Weigle headed the Association of American Colleges and was vice chairman of the Independent College Funds of America. After retiring from St. John's in 1980, he served for a time as interim president of St. Mary's College in Maryland.
        Born in Northfield, Minn. in 1912, Dr. Weigle (pronounced WHY-gull) grew up in New Haven. At the age of 19, he graduated from Yale, then earned a master's degree and a doctorate there.
        In World War II he was secretary to the General Staff of the Army's Chinese Combat Command and a captain in the Air Corps.
        Surviving are his wife of 50 years, the former Mary Day; two daughters, Mary Weigle of Santa Fe and Constance Mann of Winston-Salem, N.C.; two sisters, Margaret Quillian of Lynchburg, Va., and Ruth W. Guyton of Jackson, Miss., and a granddaughter.
