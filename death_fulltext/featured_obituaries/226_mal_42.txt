        Hal O. Anger, an electrical engineer in the field of nuclear medicine who invented diagnostic cameras allowing doctors to view metabolic processes occurring inside the human body, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 85.
        The cause was heart failure, said his brother, Clifford, of Canmore, Alberta.
        Mr. Anger was known in his field for inventing the gamma camera, which was first exhibited in 1958 at a meeting of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. The device, also known as a scintillation camera and later as the Anger camera, produced images of internal processes by tracking tiny amounts of radioactive substances, known as radiopharmaceuticals, given to patients.
        The invention and later improvements represented a major advance in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, bone marrow disorders and other life-threatening diseases.
        A 2003 profile of Mr. Anger in The Journal of Nuclear Medicine reported that ''millions of patients all over the world have benefited from diagnosis and treatment that depended on the use of the Anger camera and the innovations made possible by its development.'' It went on to say that 21st-century nuclear medicine had been ''profoundly affected'' by Mr. Anger's work.
        Hal Oscar Anger was born in Denver and grew up in Long Beach, Calif., where he developed an early interest in electronics and technology. He received a degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1943 and worked on developing radar-jamming technology until the end of World War II.
        After the war, Mr. Anger joined the Donner Laboratory at Berkeley, a center of research on the medical uses of radiation. Mr. Anger worked there until 1982, when he retired.
        He held more than a dozen patents for his innovations and received numerous awards for his work in the field of nuclear medicine.
