        Charles Drake Webster, a Long Island conservationist, gardener and stalwart of organizations like the Horticultural Society of New York and the Seatuck National Wildlife Refuge in Islip, died on May 15 at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. He was 92 and lived at Twyford, his home and part of the nature preserve.
        In 1968, Mr. Webster and his wife, Natalie Peters Webster, donated the land on which Twyford sits, nearly 200 acres of woods, swamp forest and grass, to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Once a working farm and weekend retreat of the Peters family, it is now home to the Seatuck Environmental Association and the Seatuck Research Program. Mrs. Webster died in 1979.
        Mr. Webster was chairman emeritus of the Horticultural Society. Over the years he also served as chairman of the garden committee at the Cloisters, a fellow of the Frick Collection and the Old Westbury Gardens, director of the International Wild Waterfowl Association, chairman of the Caribbean Conservation Corporation, field associate in ornithology at the New York Zoological Society and member of the visiting committee for medieval art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others.
        During his tenure at the Horticultural Society from 1957 to 1991 as president or chairman, he oversaw the revival of the New York Flower Show and helped to broaden the society's interests, changing it from a group of private horticulturists into an organization that also promoted public beautification projects.
        For instance, he helped to inspire the community garden movement in New York City, prompting the society to sponsor about 80 such gardens that transformed garbage-strewn empty lots.
