        Roy Eldridge, a major innovator of the jazz trumpet, died yesterday afternoon at the age of 78, just three weeks after the death of his wife of 53 years.
        The Rev. John Garcia Gensel of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Manhattan said Mr. Eldridge, who lived in Hollis, Queens, died at Franklin General Hospital in Valley Stream, L.I. A nursing administrator at the hospital said she could not provide details about the death.
        ''I think his death had a great deal to do with Viola's death,'' Mr. Gensel, who is known as the jazz pastor, said, referring to Mr. Eldridge's wife. ''He wasn't eating well. And I know he was very dehydrated.''
        ''We just had a birthday party for him at the church last month, and the next week Viola died,'' Mr. Gensel said of Mr. Eldridge, who gave up the trumpet for health reasons in 1980.
