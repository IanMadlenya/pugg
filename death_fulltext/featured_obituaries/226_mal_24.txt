        Daniel McNamara Gribbon, former managing partner of the prominent Washington law firm Covington & Burling, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Washington. He was 88.
        The cause was complications of kidney disease, his daughter Diana said.
        Mr. Gribbon was born on Jan. 27, 1917, in Youngstown, Ohio. In 1938, he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from what is now Case Western Reserve University. Mr. Gribbon received a law degree from Harvard and served as a clerk for Judge Learned Hand of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit of New York.
        When World War II began Mr. Gribbon enlisted as an ensign in the Navy and became the legal secretary of what was known as the Joint Chiefs War Plans Committee.
        Mr. Gribbon joined Covington & Burling in 1945; his practice included antitrust, tax, commercial and litigation matters. He argued many cases before the Supreme Court, including the unsuccessful effort of the Penn Central Railroad to win compensation for landmark restrictions that blocked plans to build over Grand Central Station. He served on the firm's management committee for 16 years and was its chairman for seven years.
        Mr. Gribbon's wife of 64 years, Jane Retzler Gribbon, died on Sept. 5. He is survived by two daughters, Diana Gribbon Motz and Deborah Gribbon, and four grandchildren.
