        Winslow Ames, an art historian who wrote widely about drawings, architectural history, decorative arts and genealogy, died on Wednesday at the South County Hospital in Wakefield, R.I. He was 83 years old and lived in Saunderstown, R.I.
        His family said he had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease and died after a heart attack.
        Mr. Ames was born in Chile and grew up on Staten Island. He was a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy and Columbia College, and received a master's degree from Harvard.
        During his career he served as director of the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London, Conn.; the Springfield Art Museum in Springfield, Mo.; and the Gallery of Modern Art in New York City. He also taught art history at several universities.
        A pacifist, he was a conscientious objector in World War II and directed a Civilian Public Service Camp in 1943 and, after the war, served with the American Friends Service Committee in Europe.
        He was the author of ''Prince Albert and Victorian Taste,'' published by Viking in 1967, and the first volume of ''Great Drawings of All Time'' (Shorewood Press, 1962), dealing with Italian works. He translated and expanded Joseph Meder's ''Die Handzeichnungen,'' issued here as ''The Mastery of Drawing'' in 1978.
        Mr. Ames is survived by his wife, the former Anna Gerhard; two sisters, five daughters and six grandchildren.
