        Dr. Martin Louis Kaye, a general practitioner on New York's Lower East Side for almost 60 years, died Wednesday at University Hospital after a brief illness. He was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        As a general practitioner, Dr. Kaye ''specialized in everything,'' as he put it, ranging from obstetrics to geriatrics. His patients included well-to-do people living on Fifth Avenue and people living in neighborhood housing projects and tenements. Throughout his career, he held morning and evening office hours six days a week and made house calls - although in recent years, he limited walk-ups to one flight - until he entered the hospital a few weeks ago.
        Dr. Kaye was born on Cannon Street on the city's Lower East Side, a street that has since become part of a housing project. He attended Columbia University and graduated from Long Island College Hospital in 1929.
        His wife, the former Ruth Spitzer, died in 1978.
        Surviving are a son, Robert Kaye of Manhattan, two daughters, Brenda Pace of Alpine, N.J. and Susan Melchner of Larchmont, N.Y., a sister, Betty Weiss of Manhattan, two brothers, Mack of Marlborough Township, N.J., and Jerry of Plantation, Fla., and five grandchildren.
