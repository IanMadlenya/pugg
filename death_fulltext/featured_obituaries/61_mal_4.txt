        Oscar De Mejo, a painter and children's-book illustrator, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 years old and also had a home in Pawling, N.Y.
        He died of colon cancer, said his wife, Dorothy.
        Mr. De Mejo's primitive and sometimes surreal paintings have been exhibited in the United States and in Europe. In the 1980's, he wrote and illustrated several children's books, including "Does God Have a Big Toe?" (with Marc Gellman), "Journey to Boc Boc," "There's a Hand in the Sky" and "The Tiny Vistor."
        Mr. De Mejo was born in 1911 in Trieste, at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. After law school, he had a brief career in Hollywood as a jazz composer. His first wife was the actress Alida Valli.
        In addition to his second wife, Mr. De Mejo is survived by two sons, Carlo and Larry, and five grandchildren.
