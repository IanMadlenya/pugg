        Theodore Hill Jr., a longtime Republican legislator from Westchester County, died of a stroke Wednesday at Peekskill (N.Y.) Community Hospital. He was 91 years old and lived in Jefferson Valley, N.Y.
        Mr. Hill was born in Jefferson Valley and attended the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. Mr. Hill, a farmer, was elected in the late 1920's as a supervisor in Yorktown, where he served until 1937.
        Then, he was elected to the Assembly from the Sixth District in Westchester, and served 12 terms until he retired in 1960.
        At that time, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller appointed Mr. Hill a trustee of the New York State Power Authority, and he later became its vice chairman.
        In 1963, Mr. Hill was elected chairman of the Westchester Republican County Committee. He held that job for two years.
        He was a former chairman of the Yorktown Planning Board, director of the Peekskill Hospital and a trustee of the John C. Hart Library in Shrub Oak, N.Y.
        He is survived by a daughter, Laura Hoenig of Greenwich, Conn., and three grandchildren.
