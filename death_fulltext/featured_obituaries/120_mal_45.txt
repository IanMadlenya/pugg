        W. Lane Barksdale, a microbiologist at New York University Medical Center who spent a lifetime studying bacterial infections like diphtheria and how to combat them, died on Dec. 26 at his home in Greensboro, N.C. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan until he retired 10 years ago.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Barksdale joined the N.Y.U. faculty shortly after he received his Ph.D. in microbiology from the university in 1953, and became a professor of microbiology in 1966. He published many papers on the biology of  diphtheria infection.
        He also pursued one of the most enigmatic targets in microbiology: the bacterium responsible for leprosy. The bacterium was discovered in the 1870's, but for years scientists  had trouble working with it in the laboratory.
        Dr. Barksdale's experience and novel approaches were credited with making headway in a complex and uncertain field.
        He was a fellow of the Pasteur Institute of Paris and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, among other honors.
        Walter Lane Barksdale was born in Emporia, Va., and graduated from the University of North Carolina, from which he also received a master's degree in 1940.
        Dr. Barksdale's wife of 30 years, Dr. Alma Whiffen Barksdale, died in 1981. They had no children.
        He is survived by two sisters, Susan Barksdale of Greensboro and Beverly Sheppe of Charlottesville, Va., and a brother, Wallace C., of Fort Collins, Colo.
