        Dr. Sidney D. Braun, an author on French literature and professor emeritus of the City University of New York, died on Wednesday at his Manhattan home. He was 80 years old and also kept a home in Newport, R.I.
        He died after a brief illness, a university statement said.
        Professor Braun, who held degrees from the Sorbonne and New York University, retired in 1979 as a professor of French at Lehman College and the Graduate School and University Center. A specialist on 19th and 20th century French writing, he conveyed a lifelong interest in Andre Suares, the poet and critic, in his own books, most recently "Andre Suares: Hero Among Heroes" (Summa Publications, 1978). He also wrote "The 'Courtesane' in the French Theatre From Hugo to Becque" (Johns Hopkins Press, 1947), and was the editor and a contributor to "Dictionary of French Literature" (Greenwood, 1958).
        Professor Braun is survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Miriam Kadish, and a brother, Monroe, of Durham, N.C.
