        William Karlton Jacoby, a former director of industrial design for The New York Times, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Boca Raton, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 80.
        The cause was cardiac arrest after surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Jacoby, a Manhattan native, trained at the Pratt Institute and worked for a design studio before becoming a vice president at the advertising firm of Mogul, Williams & Saylor.
        He joined The Times in 1969. He designed office spaces, including a remodeling of the main newsroom in the late 1970's and buildings for Times-owned papers in Florida. He retired in 1980 but was a design consultant for The Times for five years after that.
        Mr. Jacoby is survived by his wife of 58 years, Rhoda Barth Jacoby; a son, Leslie, of Wellington, Fla.; and a granddaughter.
