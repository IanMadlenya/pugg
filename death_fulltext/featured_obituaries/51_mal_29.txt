        William Esbitt, a lawyer, retired brigadier general in the Army Reserve and former assistant United States attorney, died on Monday at the J.F.K. Medical Center in Atlantis, Fla. He was 80 years old and lived in Atlantis.
        He died of heart failure, his daughter Jessica said.
        From 1953 to 1955, he was an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan. In 1958 he was put in charge of the New York phase of the Justice Department's investigation of the country's 100 "highest priority" criminals. He returned to private practice in 1959.
        The same year he was promoted to brigadier general, after 27 years as an Army Reserve officer. He was assistant division commander of the 77th Infantry Division when he retired in 1964.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from City College in 1930 and the Columbia University Law School in 1933. He served with the Army's 100th Infantry Division in World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Blanka Winig; two daughters, Jessica Hart of Providence, R.I., and Roberta Esbitt of Brussels, and a grandaughter.
