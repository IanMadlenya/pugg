        Dr. Robert Edward Rothenberg, a surgeon and the author of more than a dozen popular medical books, died on April 10 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 93.
        Dr. Rothenberg retired in 1998 as director of surgical research at Cabrini. He previously was chief of surgery at the Jewish Hospital of Brooklyn in the 1950's and 60's and at the French Hospital and Polyclinic Postgraduate Medical School in Manhattan in the 60's and 70's.
        Among his most recent publications were ''The New American Medical Dictionary and Health Manual'' and ''New Illustrated Medical Encyclopedia,'' which remain in print.
        In 1976, he wrote a four-volume set for children, ''Disney's Growing Up Healthy.''
        Robert Rothenberg was born in Brooklyn. He graduated in 1929 from Cornell University, where he received his medical degree in 1932.
        Dr. Rothenberg was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps during World War II, commanding the First Auxiliary Surgical Group. Working just behind the front lines, he and his team during the Battle of the Bulge operated on the wounded for 60 hours without a break.
        Dr. Rothenberg is survived by his wife, Florence R. Rothenberg; a son and daughter from his first marriage, Robert P. Rothenberg and Lynn B. Kay, both of New York City; and two grandsons. His first wife, Lillian Lustig Rothenberg, died in 1977, and his second wife, Eileen Kessler Rothenberg, died in 1987.
        Correction:  May 4, 2002, Saturday  An obituary of Dr. Robert E. Rothenberg on Tuesday misstated his position at three New York medical institutions. At French Hospital and Polyclinic Postgraduate Medical School and Health Center in Manhattan, both now defunct, he was a trustee and attending surgeon, not chief of surgery. Earlier, at Jewish Hospital in Brooklyn, he was an attending surgeon, not chief surgeon.
