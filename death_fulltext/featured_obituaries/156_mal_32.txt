        Dr. Karl Strauch, a high-energy physicist who helped provide insights into the fundamental structure of matter and energy, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Boston. He was 77 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He had Parkinson's disease, but the immediate cause was pneumonia, said Harvard University, where Dr. Strauch formerly headed the physics department.
        Dr. Strauch's research employed giant accelerators smashing subatomic particles together in search of the basic building blocks of the universe. In the early 1970's his experiments produced hints of the existence of quarks, a previously uncharted category of matter. At the time, he directed the Cambridge Electron Accelerator.
        Dr. Strauch also took part in colliding-beam experiments at the European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva, known as Cern; the Stanford Linear Accelerator, and the DESY laboratory in Hamburg, Germany.
        Karl Strauch was born in Giessen, Germany, and came to this country in 1939. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California at Berkeley in 1943 and served in the Navy in World War II. He returned to Berkeley and received a doctorate in 1950.
        He then went to Harvard for advanced studies and joined the faculty in 1953. He was named a professor in 1962, and from 1967 to 1974 directed the Cambridge accelerator. In 1975, he became the George Vasmer Leverett professor of physics and headed the physics department from 1978 to 1982. He retired in 1993 with emeritus status.
        He wrote nearly 150 scientific papers and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Dr. Strauch is survived by his wife of 49 years, Maria Gerson Strauch; two sons, Roger A., of Piedmont, Calif., and Hans D., of Belmont, Mass., and five grandchildren.
