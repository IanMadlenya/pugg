        Sister Mary Celeste, who held a Ph.D. from St. John's University, was community supervisor of schools in the Brooklyn Diocese in 1962 when the trustees elected her president of what then was Molloy Catholic College for Women. During her tenure at the school, enrollment rose to 1,100 students from 291.
        After her retirement as president, she remained director of special events until 1986, four years after the college became co-educational. Sister Mary Celeste was the author of a textbook, ''Biology for High Schools,'' which became widely used around the country.
        She is survived by three nieces.
