        Aaron Morse, the retired president of Kiehl's Since 1851, a line of natural cosmetics and skin-care treatments based in New York, died on April 4 at Cedars Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 72 and had homes in Los Angeles and Manhattan.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Morse was a native of New York City. He studied pharmacology at Columbia University and headed Kiehl's, which his family bought in 1921, from 1978 until his retirement four years ago.
        Kiehl's is on Third Avenue at 13th Street. Mr. Morse transformed the company's over-the-counter drugs and herbal remedies into body treatments based on unscented natural herbal formulas. Manufactured in Hackensack, N.J., his products were eventually sold at department stores around the country and overseas.
        Mr. Morse is survived by his daughter, Jami, of Los Angeles, now a co-owner of Kiehl's, and a granddaughter.
