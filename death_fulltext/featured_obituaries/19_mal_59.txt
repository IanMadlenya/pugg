        Mr. Scelsi, who was widely called the Charles Ives of Italy, was known for his choral and symphonic works. He studied music in Vienna, and his compositions, built on 12-tone scales, were influenced by Arnold Schoenberg. He composed several hundred pieces, many of which had spiritual themes and were influenced by Oriental philosophy.
