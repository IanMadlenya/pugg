        Nicholas Bonavita, a long-time presence at the New York City Council who most recently served as its chief sergeant-at-arms, died on Friday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 60 years old and lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
        He died after a five-year battle with heart disease, said his son Vincent.
        Mr. Bonavita, who joined the Council staff in 1976, oversaw the security detail at its hearings and helped people who appeared to testify. He also arranged tours of City Hall for visitors.
        In addition to his son Vincent, of Park Slope, Mr. Bonavita is survived by his wife, Diana; another son, Nicholas Jr., of Park Slope; four daughters, Donna Morales of Virginia Beach, Va., Karen Greenfeld of Riverdale, the Bronx, Debbie McCarthy of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and Gina Chiarello of Bensonhurst, and one grandchild.
