        Peter Van Schaik, an engineer who developed the backpack maneuvering unit that astronauts use in space, died here on Monday of undisclosed causes. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Van Schaik developed the Astronaut Maneuvering Unit in the early 1960's at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in nearby Dayton. Astronauts aboard space shuttles have worn a more advanced version called the Manned Maneuvering Unit.
        Mr. Van Schaik said in 1984 that he got the idea for the device from the ''Buck Rogers'' comic strip.
        He is survived by his wife, Faith, and seven children.
