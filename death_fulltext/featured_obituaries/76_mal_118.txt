        Dr. Herbert B. Callen, a theoretical physicist who wrote a standard work on thermodynamics and taught at the University of Pennsylvania for more than three decades, died on Saturday in Merion, Pa. He was 73 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla., and Loveladies, N.J.
        He died after an 11-year struggle with Alzheimer's disease, said his son, Jed Callen.
        Dr. Callen contributed to the field of statistical mechanics and was probably best known for a paper he wrote in 1951 with Theodore A. Welton, proving the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in its most general form.
        The theorem deals with the fact that fluctuations can be seen in almost any property of a system in thermal equilibrium, an assemblage of charged particles, for example, if examined closely enough. Dr. Callen showed that statistical analysis of spontaneous fluctuations the charged particles undergo can predict the current that will flow when an electric field is imposed.
        Dr. Callen was born in Philadelphia in 1919. He earned a bachelor's degree at Temple University and a doctorate in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He did theoretical work on the American atomic bomb project in World War II.
        He joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in 1948, became a professor in 1956 and in 1960 wrote a classic text, "Thermodynamics." He retired in 1985. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990 and won the Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1984.
        In addition to his son, of New Boston, N.H., Dr. Callen is survived by his wife of 48 years, Sara Callen; a daughter, Jill Bressler of Merion, Pa., and five grandchildren.
