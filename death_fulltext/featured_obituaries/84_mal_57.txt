        Jay Blackton, who was the music director for a string of hit shows in the golden age of the Broadway musical and who won an Academy Award for scoring the 1955 film of "Oklahoma!," died on Saturday at Granada Hills Community Hospital in Granada Hills, Calif. He was 84 and lived in Los Angeles.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Louise.
        When Mr. Blackton won his Oscar for "Oklahoma!" in 1955 -- an award he shared with Robert Russell Bennett and Adolph Deutsch -- he was also nominated, along with Cyril J. Mockridge, for scoring the film of "Guys and Dolls."
        Mr. Blackton, who was often billed as Jay S. Blackton, changed his name from Jay Schwartzdorf in 1943. He took his first job, as assistant conductor of the New York Opera Comique in 1927, shortly after graduating from the Juilliard School. From 1937 to 1942, he conducted the St. Louis Municipal Opera, and there he was noticed by the Broadway musical team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d.
        In 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein hired Mr. Blackton to conduct "Oklahoma!" on Broadway. He later conducted two of Ethel Merman's hits, "Annie Get Your Gun" (1946) and "Call Me Madam" (1950). He also conducted "Wish You Were Here," the 1952 musical starring Jack Cassidy, with music and lyrics by Harold Rome; "Happy Hunting," Miss Merman's 1956 return to Broadway after a six-year absence; "New Faces of 1956," and other shows.
        In 1967 Mr. Blackton was the music director at the New York State Theater for "The Magic of Cole Porter," leading Fred Astaire, Ethel Merman, Lisa Kirk, Dinah Shore, John Raitt and a stageful of musical-theater headliners in a tribute to the composer. In 1969, he was the musical director of the revival of "Oklahoma!" at the New York State Theater.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Jennie Lou Blackton Philhower of Santa Monica, Calif.; a son, William, of Arlington, Va., and a grandson.
