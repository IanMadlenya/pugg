        Charles S. Fleet, a former executive on Wall Street and in the oil industry, died Tuesday in Metairie, La. He was 60 years old and lived in New Orleans.
        Friends said he had been suffering from a serious ailment, and the Jefferson Parish coroner's office is investigating his death as an apparent suicide.
        Born in Cutchogue, L.I., Mr. Fleet earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from Dartmouth. He was the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Dominick & Dominick, an investment firm, before joining the Louisiana Land and Exploration Company, an oil and gas company. He became vice president before retiring from the company three years ago to become a consultant.
        He is survived by his wife, Jacquelin; a daughter, Katharine; his mother, Evelyn, and a sister, Patricia Beede.
