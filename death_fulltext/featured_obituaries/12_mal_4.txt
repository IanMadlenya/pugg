        In 1937, Mr. Van Buren began drawing the comic strip, ''Abbie an' Slats,'' which was written by Al Capp. It was carried by 400 newspapers and ran until 1971, when Mr. Van Buren retired.
        Mr. Van Buren, who was born in Pueblo, Colo., first worked for The Kansas City Star, creating sketches. In 1913, he moved to New York, where he worked as an illustrator for Life magazine, Puck and the Saturday Evening Post.
        After military service in World War I, he drew cartoons for The New Yorker and Esquire. He was a founder of the National Society of Magazine Illustrators and a member of the National Cartoonists' Hall of Fame.
        He is survived by a niece, Jean Harris, of Wilton, Conn., and two granddaughters.
