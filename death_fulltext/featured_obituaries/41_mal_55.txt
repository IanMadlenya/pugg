        Officials at the Roman Catholic retreat house said Father Hart died after a heart attack.
        He was born in Manhattan, ordained in 1930 and taught at Georgetown University before becoming principal of Canisius High School in Buffalo in 1934. Three years later he was named principal of Xavier High School and pastor of St. Francis Xavier Church in Manhattan.
        In 1943 he became president of St. Peter's and in 1947 he was appointed to the Fordham post. In 1957 he was made director of the Jesuit Retreat House in Shrub Oak, N.Y.
        He is survived by a sister, Catherine, of Manhattan.
