        Antonio Salemme, a sculptor and painter who won renown in the 1930's with his life-size nude sculpture of the singer and actor Paul Robeson, died on Tuesday at his home in Williams Township, Pa. He was 102.
        Mr. Salemme, whose younger half-brother was the painter Attilio Salemme, was born in Gaeta, Italy, in 1892. In 1904, after the death of his mother, he moved to Boston with his father. He began studying art there when he was 14. In 1912, a patron sent him to Rome, where he studied sculpture. Returning to the United States after World War I, Mr. Salemme established a studio in Greenwich Village, and in 1924, after seeing Robeson perform in "The Emperor Jones," he invited the actor to pose for him.
        Out of these sessions came a friendship important to both artists and a full-figure nude portrait of the actor in bronze-colored plaster, titled "Negro Spiritual." The sculpture was exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum and the Palace of the Legion of Honor in San Francisco. In 1930, the Philadelphia Art Alliance asked Mr. Salemme to send the Robeson sculpture for an exhibition, then declined to exhibit it because of the subject's fame and race. Its rejection elicited a string of editorials against censorship. The Robeson sculpture, later shipped to a foundry in France for casting in bronze, was lost during World War II.
        In the mid-1930's, Mr. Salemme worked for a while as director of the Works Progress Administration mural project in New York City, becoming friends with younger artists including Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning. Over the years, he executed many portrait commissions, including those of Ethel Waters, John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein and Dwight D. Eisenhower. His work is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Newark Museum, Rutgers University, Yale University and Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, Martha.
