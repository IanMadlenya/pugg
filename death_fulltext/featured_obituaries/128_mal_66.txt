        Henri Bendel, the founder of Belgian Shoes and a former president of the fabled Manhattan specialty store founded by his uncle in 1909, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 89.
        Mr. Bendel assumed the presidency of the store in 1935 after the death of his uncle, for whom he was named, and he retired in 1954 when the family sold it.
        Mr. Bendel, who had worked closely with several Belgian shoe-making families during the 19 years he served as president of Henri Bendel  Inc., purchased two 300-year-old shoe manufacturing companies in Belgium in 1956 and began producing a casual, classic loafer that became a staple of New York fashion.
        The hand-tailored, slipper-soft shoes, made for both men and women, come in many colors and materials, and are trimmed with a signature bow readily recognized by fashion connoisseurs. Some of his shoes are regarded as collectibles and are widely copied by other designers.  While the shoes are sold in outlets worldwide, his only store in Manhattan is at the company's headquarters, 60 East 56th Street.
        The Henri Bendel store was for decades a prestigious outlet for such haute couture fashion houses as Chanel, Dior and Balenciaga. It was sold by the Bendel family in 1954 to a group of investors and has had several owners since then.
        The Belgian Government, in recognition of Mr. Bendel's role in the rescue and expansion of that country's three-century-old shoe industry, made him a Knight of the Order of Leopold the First in 1964 and Knight Commander of the Order of Leopold the Second in 1970.
        Mr. Bendel, whose wife, the former Lillian Hirschler, died in 1982, is survived by a son, John, and daughter-in-law, Diana, of Boston.
