        Sergio Fenoaltea of Italy, a familiar figure in United States diplomatic, cultural and social circles as Ambassador in the 1960's, died on April 13 at his home in Marino, near Rome. He was 86.
        He suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Fenoaltea presented his credentials to President Kennedy at the White House in May 1961. His resignation in 1967 caused a trans-Atlantic stir because he seemed to disagree with his Government, particularly with what he felt was Foreign Minister Amintore Fanfani's lukewarm commitment to the North American Treaty Organization.
        The immediate cause was Mr. Fanfani's objections to renewed American aerial bombardments of North Vietnam as a hindrance to peace.
        Trained in economics and law, Mr. Fenoaltea had decades of experience in diplomacy and government. Born in Rome, he was a consistent opponent of Mussolini and spent time in prison until July 25, 1943, when the Fascist dictatorship crumbled.
        He was graduated from the University of Rome, where he also earned a law degree, and practiced law intermittently.
        In 1952, he became NATO Assistant Under Secretary for Political Affairs. Before he arrived in Washington, he was his country's Ambassador to Canada and Belgium.
        Mr. Fenoaltea is survived by a daughter, Annalina Sayad Porozynski of Sebring, Fla.; a son, Stefano of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
