        Carlo Verri, the chairman of Italy's state-owned airline, was killed Monday when his car collided with a city bus, the authorities said. He was 50 years old.
        The accident took place Monday night as Mr. Verri was telephoning his wife while sitting in the back seat of the car, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
        Mr. Verri's car ran a red light at high speed, crashed into an oncoming bus and was thrown against a soft drink stand on the corner of the intersection, according to initial police reports.
        Mr. Verri's driver, Enrico Grappelli, 25, was also killed. No one on the bus was hurt.
        Mr. Verri was appointed chairman of Alitalia, whose parent company is Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale, in 1988. He replaced Umberto Nordio, who resigned after a public dispute over management strategy. Previously, Mr. Verri had served as director general of the Swedish company Riv-Skf, director of Italian Zanussi Elettrodomestici and director and member of the executive committee of the Swedish Electrolux Component Group.
        He is survived by his wife and two children.
