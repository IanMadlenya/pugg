        William E. Minshall, who served as a Republican Congressman from Ohio for 20 years before he retired in 1974, died Monday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 79 years old.
        His family said he died of complications after a series of strokes.
        At his retirement Mr. Minshall was his party's ranking member on the House Appropriations subcommittees dealing with defense and transportation.
        A few years after he left Congress, he was one of several members of Congress whom Tongsun Park, a South Korean businessman accused of buying influence in Washington for his Government, identified as recipients of campaign contributions and other payments. A Justice Department investigation ended with no charges being filed against Mr. Minshall.
        A native of Cleveland, Mr. Minshall was a graduate of the Cleveland Law School. He was elected to the Ohio Legislature before World War II. While serving in the United States military in Europe during the war, he rose to lieutenant colonel and was awarded the Bronze Star.
        He later practiced law in Cleveland and went to Washington as general counsel to the Federal Maritime Board before a successful campaign for Congress in 1954.
        Mr. Minshall's survivors include his wife, the former Frances Smith, and three sons, William 3d, Werner and Peter, all of Chevy Chase.
