        Michael F. Wettach, an equestrian, restaurant owner and trustee of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, died on Sunday in Baltimore. He was 66 and lived in Monkton, Md.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his half-brother, Peter Lawson-Johnston of Princeton, N.J.
        Mr. Wettach was a grandson of Solomon R. Guggenheim, the founder of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan, and had been a trustee of the foundation, which oversees museums in Manhattan, Venice, Berlin and Bilbao, Spain, since 1957.

        A steeplechase rider, Mr. Wettach competed at Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and in the Maryland Hunt Cup.
        In 1977, he turned to a new passion,  restoring an 18th-century building in the Fells Point section of Baltimore. He opened a restaurant, the Admiral's Cup, in what what had been a sandwich shop in the building. He sold the restaurant in 1985.
        Mr. Wettach was born on Nov. 24, 1932, in Manhattan. He attended Avon Old Farms, in Avon, Conn., and Johns Hopkins University.
        He pursed a theater career after serving in the Army from 1952 to 1954. He worked as a driver for the singer Ethel Merman and as an assistant to the composer Jule Styne and was also the stage manager for several plays in the 1950's, including ''Mr. Wonderful'' and ''Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?''
        Besides his half-brother, he is survived by his companion, Robert Ludwig of Monkton.
