        Geoffrey Wigoder, a broadcaster, scholar and editor of Judaica, died on April 9 in Jerusalem. He was 76.
        The cause was a brain hemorrhage after a fall, said Andre Balog, a friend and colleague.
        Mr. Wigoder was born in Leeds, England, and earned degrees in medieval Jewish history at Trinity College, Dublin, and Oxford University. He also attended the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he met his future wife, Devorah Mac Dwyer. The couple immigrated to Israel in 1949 and settled in Jerusalem.
        By the early 1950's Mr. Wigoder was overseeing the overseas operations of Israeli radio, and in the 1960's and 70's he worked as correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation and The Yorkshire Post, at one point making daily broadcasts about the trial of Adolf Eichmann.
        He also collaborated with Cecil Roth, a scholar of Judaica at Oxford and Hebrew University in Jerusalem, on the one-volume New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia. The two scholars then began work on what was to become the 16-volume Encyclopedia Judaica. When Mr. Roth died in 1970, Mr. Wigoder took over as editor in chief. An updated version of the entire work was published on a single CD-ROM last year.
        Mr. Wigoder's credits also include ''The Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion,'' ''Jewish Art and Civilization'' and ''The Story of the Synagogue.'' His ''Dictionary of the Jewish-Christian Dialogue'' was commissioned by the Paulist Press in New York in 1995. He also lectured at Hebrew University, where he founded Israel's first oral history department, and was one of the founders of the Museum of the Jewish Diaspora in Tel Aviv.
        He is survived by his wife; two sons, Meir and Shimshon, both of Tel Aviv; a sister, Thelma Ruby of London, and two grandchildren.
