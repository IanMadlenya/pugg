        Paul J. Babbitt Sr., the father of former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democratic Presidential candidate, died today. He was 89 years old.
        Mr. Babbitt, who had been in declining health for several months, died at 4 P.M. at his home here, a family member said.
        Campaign aides for Bruce Babbitt said in New Hampshire that the candidate would cancel his appearances there Monday as well as an appearance at a debate in Boston on Monday night.
        ''He said the family comes first, and he will be returning early tomorrow morning from New Hampshire to Phoenix,'' Mick McCurry, a campaign aide said tonight.
        Paul Babbitt Sr. enjoyed the distinction from 1978 to 1982 of being the father of Arizona's Governor and of the Mayor of one of its cities. While Bruce Babbitt governed the state, his brother, Paul J. Babbitt Jr., was Mayor of Flagstaff.
