        Dr. McKee, the son of an Iowa farmer, enrolled as a student at the Biblical Seminary in 1925 after a friend persuaded him to try for the ministry. He had already received a bachelor's degree from Parsons College as a mathematics major and went on to get three degrees in sacred theology, including his doctorate, from the seminary.
        He became a member of the faculty in 1928, teaching New Testament Greek and church history. Dr. McKee, who was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1930, was named dean at the seminary in 1941. He served as president from 1946 to 1960, when he left the seminary to accept the position of Professor of Biblical Exposition at the Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur. He retired in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, Adele.
