        Norman Wells Mather, professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Princeton University, died on Tuesday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. He was 76 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Professor Mather died of Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman for the university said.
        Professor Mather retired in 1982, after 36 years on the faculty, 26 as a full professor. From 1952 to 1971 he was assistant director and head of the engineering division of the controlled-fusion program, which was originally known as Project Matterhorn and later as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. Professor Mather then returned to full-time teaching. He designed much of the equipment for the first generation of stellarators, vessels designed to simulate fusion in stars.
        He was born in Upland, Calif. Professor Mather graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1936. After six years as an engineer for the Otis Elevator Company and three years in the Navy, he received a master's at Princeton, in 1947.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Mary Adele Clark; a son, John, of Princeton; a daughter, Peggy Hester of Los Gatos, Calif., and six grandchildren.
