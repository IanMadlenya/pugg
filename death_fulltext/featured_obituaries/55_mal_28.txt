        Miroslav A. Kriz, an international economist and retired vice president of Citibank, died yesterday at his home in Hightstown, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        He died of complications of a stroke, his son said.
        Mr. Kriz, who was educated in Prague and Paris, began his career as an economist with the League of Nations in Geneva in 1936. In 1941, he and a handful of League officials were invited to the United States to continue their work. From 1945 to 1958, Mr. Kriz was with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and served on economic development missions to Iraq, Egypt and Latin America. He was with Citibank from 1958 until his retirement in 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a son, John, of Palisades, N.Y.; two daughters, Mireille Bessin of Madison, N.J., and Nina Leneman of Geneva; a sister, Zdenka Zemanova of Ceske Budejovice, Czechoslovakia; and seven grandchildren.
