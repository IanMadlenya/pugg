        Arthur Zaidenberg, a painter, sculptor and teacher who wrote the classic art-instruction book ''Anyone Can Draw,'' died Monday at his home in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. He was 88 years old.
        In 1938, Mr. Zaidenberg published his revolutionary techniques, which were based on his theory that a person who could write the alphabet could combine simple shapes and draw. He was also the first teacher at New York University to use nude models in his life drawing classes.
        Mr. Zaidenberg created murals for more than 100 hotels in Miami Beach, for the cruise ship Rotterdam and for the St. Moritz Hotel in Manhattan. During World War II he made animated films for the Army Signal Corps.
        After spending 30 years in Woodstock, N.Y., Mr. Zaidenberg moved to an artists' community in Mexico 10 years ago.
        He is survived by his wife, Tommy Beere, an artist.
