        Arthur Richard Silsdorf, a longtime mayor of the Fire Island resort village of Ocean Beach, died on Tuesday at his home there. He was 77 and also lived in Manhattan.
        He suffered a lengthy illness, his family said.
        Mr. Silsdorf, a Democrat and summer resident of Ocean Beach, was first elected Mayor in 1956 as the candidate of the Economy Party, which opposed the building of a village hall. He was repeatedly re-elected and remained in office until 1978. He was a lifetime member of the Ocean Beach Volunteer Fire Department and a founding member of the Fire Island Association and the Fire Island Synagogue.
        He was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College of New York and Harvard Law School. He retired from law practice about four years ago.
        Mr. Silsdorf is survived by his wife, Elisabeth; two sons, Franklin R., of Islip Terrace, L.I., and William D., of Katonah, N.Y.; two daughters, Maria Silsdorf and Edith Pappas, both of Manhattan; a sister, Jane Dahlberg of suburban Boston, and three grandchildren.
