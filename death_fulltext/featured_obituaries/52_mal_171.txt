        The Rev. Nicholas T. Elko, a retired auxiliary archbishop for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, died of cancer on Saturday. He was 81 years old.
        As auxiliary archbishop from 1971 until his retirement in 1985, Archbishop Elko helped prepare shortwave broadcasts to Catholics in Eastern Europe.
        He was ordained a priest in 1934 for the Byzantine rite and was consecrated bishop of the Byzantine Ruthenian Diocese of Pittsburgh in 1955. He resigned in 1967 after complaints by priests who objected to his supervision of the diocese and was in Rome until he was named to the Cincinnati post.
        In Cincinnati he became the first Eastern rite bishop to become auxiliary in a United States diocese of the Roman rite.
        He was active in the More Agriculture Production, an international organization that provided scientific and financial help to Asians and Africans.
        He also headed the Archbishop Elko Foundation, an organization that works with homeless children and recovering alcoholics.
