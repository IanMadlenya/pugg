        Dr. Myer Mendelson, a retired professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania known for his studies on depression, died on Dec. 25 at his home in Wynnewood, Pa. He was 74.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, said the Levine & Sons funeral home in Philadelphia.
        In addition to teaching, consulting and maintaining a private practice, Dr. Mendelson was a prolific author whose papers on depression and related topics spanned four decades. He was the author of a standard textbook, "Psychoanalytic Concepts of Depression" (Aronson, second edition, 1993).
        He helped to advance a system of classifying criteria for depression that is called Beck's Diagnostic Inventory. Introduced in the 1970's by A. T. Beck, the system is used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for treating children with mental disorders.
        Dr. Mendelson's work also focused on manic-depressive illness, obesity and theoretical models in psychoanalysis.
        He was born in Lithuania, grew up in Canada and graduated from Dalhousie University and Dalhousie Medical School in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He did further training in Halifax, Montreal and at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
        He began his career as a teacher and researcher at Johns Hopkins and Dalhousie before joining the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania in 1958. He became a full professor in 1972 and retired from teaching and his private practice in 1992.
        Dr. Mendelson is survived by his wife of 38 years, Margaret Algie Mendelson; a daughter, Dr. Sarah Mendelson of Moscow; a brother, Prof. Morris Mendelson of Swarthmore, Pa., and a sister, Ann Green blatt of Halifax.
