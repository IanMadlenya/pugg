        John McLiam, a character actor who worked in dozens of films and television shows and wrote the 1957 Broadway play "The Sin of Pat Muldoon," died on April 16 at his home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 76.
        The cause was melanoma and Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Roberta Williams McLiam.
        In 1951, Mr. McLiam began acting in some of Joseph Papp's earliest productions, and that same year he made his Broadway debut in Maxwell Anderson's "Barefoot in Athens." His subsequent Broadway credits included "One More River," "Desire Under the Elms," "Saint Joan" and "Tiger at the Gates."
        He appeared in more than 20 films, including "First Blood," "The Missouri Breaks," "Riverrun," "In Cold Blood," "My Fair Lady," "Cool Hand Luke," "Monte Walsh" and "Split Decisions."
        Among his television credits were the prime-time series "Dynasty," "Two Marriages" and "Highway to Heaven," and the specials "The Homeless" and "Freedom Road."
        Mr. McLiam, whose name was originally John Williams, graduated from St. Mary's College in Berkeley, Calif. He served as an intelligence officer in the Navy for four years, and was awarded a Bronze Star.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Claire deHeeckeren d'Anthes of Santa Barbara, Calif.; two brothers, Leonard Arthur Williams of Bakersfield, Calif., and Thomas Kevin Williams of Moraga, Calif., and one granddaughter.
