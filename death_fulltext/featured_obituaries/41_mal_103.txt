        Mr. Smallen died of respiratory failure, his stepdaughter, Candida Lapham Smallen of Manhattan, said.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Smallen moved to New Canaan, Conn., in 1954 with his wife, Katheryn Kroher Lapham. There he opened his own archtectural and design concern, Hugh Smallen & Associates.
        Earlier he had worked in Manhattan with the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. Mrs. Smallen died in 1973.  He is also survived by another stepdaughter, Amy Franzen of Santa Monica, Calif., and two grandchildren.
