        Seymour Samuels, a founder and past president of the Queens Jewish Community Council, died last Wednesday at North Shore University Hospital. He was 74 and lived in Bayside.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Samuels helped found the council representing 91 Jewish organizations in 1968 in the aftermath of a teachers' strike. He served as president in 1972 and 1973, which put him in the forefront of the opposition against a proposed low-income housing project in Forest Hills. A compromise cut its size in half and turned it into low-income cooperative apartments.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Samuels was a mathematics graduate of Queens College and taught the subject in the public schools. After his retirement in 1984 he taught computer courses at the Fashion Institute of Technology and operated a computer consulting firm.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Arlyne; two daughters, Judy Schneider of Worcester, Mass., and Lynne Samuels of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
