        Dr. Newton J. T. Bigelow, a former New York State commissioner of mental hygiene who fostered group therapy and the use of comic books to deal with the mentally ill, died on Jan. 30 at Faxton Children's Hospital in Utica, N.Y. He was 87 years old and lived in New Hartford, N.Y.
        He died of congestive heart failure, a daughter, Charlotte Gorsky of Marcy, N.Y., said.
        Dr. Bigelow joined the Department of Mental Hygiene in 1929 and was commissioner from 1950 to 1954, when he resigned to return to Marcy State Hospital as its director, a post he had previously held. He retired in 1973.
        In the 1950's Dr. Bigelow was among the first psychiatrists in New York State to use group therapy for the mentally ill. In his work with patients he often used "Blondie" comics to illustrate family conflicts.
        Before becoming commissioner he had also been director of clinical psychiatry at Utica State and Pilgrim State Hospitals.
        In addition, Dr. Bigelow taught at Albany Medical College and at Upstate Medical Center of the State University of New York. He was a graduate of the University of Western Ontario.
        He is also survived by his wife, the former Alberta Turnville; two other daughters, Anne Broad of Westport, Conn., and Barbara Baum of Providence, R.I.; a brother, Robert, of Toronto, seven grandchildren and one great-grandson.
