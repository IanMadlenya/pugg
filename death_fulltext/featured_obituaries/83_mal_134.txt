        He died of natural causes, said a grand-nephew, Michael Spekter of Chevy Chase, Md.
        Mr. Specter, an ambulance driver during World War I, remained in France after the war and worked as a cameraman and film distributor for Universal Studios in Europe. He was among the men who gathered in Paris in 1919 and worked to form the American Legion.
