        Frederic Ramsey Jr., a writer and historian who specialized in black culture in America, died on Saturday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson, N.J. He was 80.
        The cause was complications after surgery, said his daughter Alida Porter.
        Mr. Ramsey was broadly influential in both the popular arena and academe. In part, his importance came from his work as one of the first major scholars of jazz; in the late 1930's he edited, with Charles Edward Smith, "Jazzmen: The Story of Hot Jazz Told in the Lives of the Men Who Created It." The book included his account of the career of the cornetist and band leader King Oliver.
        Mr. Ramsey also went into the field to record black music, folk and church music, country music and blues. He traveled all over the South photographing black life, and helped shape the recovery and study of what was then considered marginal black culture.
        Much of his fieldwork is to be found in "Music From the South," a 10-volume set of recordings that has been released, in part, by the Smithsonian Institution. He also produced a series of historical recordings for Folkways, titled "Jazz." His book "Been Here and Gone," about black culture in the United States, was published in 1960.
        Mr. Ramsey was a staff member of The Saturday Review from 1949 to 1961. He also worked in television and was a consultant on educational programs for the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University and for the William Ransom Hogan Jazz Archives at Tulane University.
        His last major project, finished in 1988, was a series of interviews on jazz, "Been Here and Gone: The Ramsey Chronicles," which was broadcast on National Public Radio.
        In addition to his daughter Alida, of Manhattan, he is survived by a son, Loch, of Bloomsbury, N.J., and another daughter, Martha Ramsey of Putney, Vt.
