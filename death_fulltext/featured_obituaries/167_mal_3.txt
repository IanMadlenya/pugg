        William Barry Furlong, a widely read sports columnist, magazine writer and author, died last Saturday in Silver Spring, Md. He was 73.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Furlong wrote for The Chicago Daily News and The New York Times Magazine, and from 1974 to 1979 he was a sports columnist for The Washington Post. He also contributed to Sports Illustrated, Newsweek and The Saturday Evening Post. After leaving newspaper work, he was a management consultant in Washington, often writing on economic affairs.
        He wrote three books: ''Go for Broke,'' with the golfer Arnold Palmer; ''Season With Solti,'' a year with the Chicago Symphony and its conductor, Sir Georg Solti; and ''More Than Two Aspirin,'' about the causes and treatments for migraine headaches.
        As a high school senior, he started writing professionally, first for The Southtown Economist in Chicago. He received a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
        Mr. Furlong, who lived in Washington, is survived by his wife of 37 years, Isabel; a son, William B. Furlong Jr. of Seattle; and a sister, Elizabeth J. Furlong of Chicago.
        He was known for intriguing first paragraphs of articles.
        *On the young Jack Nicklaus: ''Of all the rich, old malevolent illusions assaulted by Jack Nicklaus in his first 20 months as a professional golfer, the one that old-timers on the circuit were most disturbed to see shattered -- or at least cracked -- was the notion that golf is an impossibly difficult game to master.''
        *On Gordie Howe: ''Nowhere are the dark forces that impel a man toward athletic self-destruction more clearly definable than in a hockey player -- indeed, the hockey player -- named Gordon Howe.''
        *On Smoky Burgess, one of baseball's best pinch-hitters: ''Forrest Harrill (Smoky) Burgess is a short, round, mildly ulcerous man whose job in baseball is to demonstrate that they also serve who mostly sit and wait.''
        *On Al Lopez: ''The mystique of the positive-thinking Al Lopez, who manages the Chicago White Sox, an occasional baseball team that has astonished the sports world, is a rich enigma based largely, he claims, on a policy of doing nothing and doing it well.''
