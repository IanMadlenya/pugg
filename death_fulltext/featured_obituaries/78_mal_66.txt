        John J. Codella, the New York public-relations man who brought American Mensa to the country's attention and watched it grow, died on Thursday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 64 and lived in Marlton, N.J.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        Mensa is a fellowship organization with members whose scores in standard intelligent tests place them higher than 98 percent of the population as a whole. Mr. Cordella became intrigued by it on a 1961 visit to England, where the society was founded.
        The name derives from the Latin word for table; the society says it connotes a roundtable of peers with nobody sitting at the head.
        An American chapter had been started in 1960 and boasted 121 members when Mr. Codella found it. He volunteered his services and became British Mensa's international representative and the first American Mensa selection officer, working with volunteers and a part-time clerk.
        In the early 1960's he also served as American Mensa's fiscal officer. By 1967 the membership was 12,000. The American branch helped establish others in Canada and Europe with profits from the entrance tests. Today it claims 55,000 members in this country alone.
        Mr. Coella, a native of New Rochelle, N.Y., attended Cooper Union and studied metallography at Stevens Institute of Technology and sculpture at the Art Students League. He spent much of his professional career as an advertising executive. In 1977, he joined Science Management Corporation, a consulting firm in Basking Ridge, N.J., from which he retired as a vice president two years ago.
        Mr. Codella is survived by his wife, Judith; two daughters, Kimberly Janney and Deirdre Sheehy, both of San Diego; a brother, Ralph, of Alpine, Calif.; three sisters, Kay Bradley of Flat Rock, N.C., Terry Dooner of Fredericksburg, Va., and Mary Codella of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
