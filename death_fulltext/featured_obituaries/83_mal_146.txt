        Juan Gonzalez, a Cuban-born realist painter who taught for nearly two decades at the School of Visual Arts, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 51.
        The cause was AIDS, said his daughter Maria Schleifman of Manhattan.
        A creator of meticulously rendered, often sumptuous paintings and collages infused with a sense of fantasy and religious symbolism, Mr. Gonzalez was adept at restating Renaissance and Baroque styles in contemporary terms. Some of his paintings took AIDS as their theme; others dealt with the complexity of human relations and frequently depicted family members and friends.  Designed Sets for Lorca Plays
        Mr. Gonzalez was born in Camaguey, Cuba, on Jan. 12, 1942, and immigrated to the United States with his family in 1961. In 1972, after earning a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Miami, he moved to New York City and had his first solo show, at the Allan Stone Gallery. Since 1975 he has been represented by the Nancy Hoffman Gallery in SoHo, where his most recent exhibition was presented in 1991.
        Mr. Gonzalez designed the sets for two plays by the Spanish writer Federico Garcia Lorca: "Blood Wedding" for the Great Lakes Festival in Cleveland in 1988, and "As Soon as Five Years Pass" in 1991 for Southern Methodist University, which also organized a traveling retrospective of his work. He is represented in numerous public collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Mr. Gonzalez's marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mrs. Schleifman, he is survived by a second daughter, Teresa Katz of Jacksonville, Fla., and by his parents, Juan and Enelia Gonzalez of Miami.
