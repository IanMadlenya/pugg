        Ernest T. Brainard, who apparently was the nation's oldest active stockbroker, died on Wednesday as he was getting ready to go work. He was 99 years old and lived in West Hartford.
        Mr. Brainard kept office hours at Coburn & Meredith in Hartford and New Britain until his death.
        Mr. Brainard began work as a stockbroker after World War I. He started his own brokerage house, Brainard & Judd, after a satisfied client provided him with $100,000 in seed money. He spent most of his career there until the firm was liquidated in 1975, when he joined Coburn & Meredith.
        He had served on the Board of Education, the Finance Board and the Recreation Committee in New Britain, where he lived for 60 years until he moved to West Hartford in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, Eileen; a son and two daughters; 16 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.
