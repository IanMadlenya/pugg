        Sefton D. Temkin, an author and scholar of American Jewish history,  died on Dec. 19 in his native Liverpool, England. He was 79 and a resident of Albany.
        The cause was complications from a stroke suffered while on a visit over the summer, said a spokesman for the State University of New York at Albany. Dr. Temkin, who was associate professor emeritus of Judaic studies at the university, was chairman of the department of judaic studies in the 1970's and had continued his research at Albany since retiring a few years ago.
        Dr. Temkin was an expert on the life and work of Isaac Mayer Wise, who founded Reform Judaism in the United States in the nineteenth century and oversaw its spread across the country as the founder and longtime leader of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Central Conference of American Rabbis.
        Dr. Temkin graduated from the University of Liverpool and earned a law degree in 1936 and an master's in modern history in 1938. He served as secretary of the Anglo-Jewish Association in London until 1951 and practiced as a barrister in London before coming to Cincinnati to receive his doctorate at Hebrew Union College in 1963.
        His most recent book was ''Isaac Mayer Wise: Shaping American Judaism,'' published by the Oxford University Press in 1992 for the Littman Library of Jewish Civilization.
        He also wrote ''The New World of Reform'' (Hartmore House, 1974).  Dr. Temkin also contributed to the American Jewish Yearbook and Encyclopedia Judaica, of which he was a past editor.
        He held teaching positions at the University of Cincinnati and Boston University before joining the faculty at Albany in 1970.
        He is survived by three sisters, Renee McGuire, Ruth Fogan and Cecily Manson, all residents of England.
