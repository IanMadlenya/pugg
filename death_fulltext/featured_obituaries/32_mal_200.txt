        Robert Preston Harriss was one of the last of a group of breezy, irreverent editorial writers and columnists in Baltimore who reached their peak in the 1920's and 1930's. The group included H. L. Mencken, who dedicated a book to Mr. Harriss; Gerald W. Johnson; Hamilton Owen, and Francis F. Beirne.
        Mr. Harriss is survived by his wife, Margery; a daughter, Clarinda Lott of Towson, Md., a sister, Ruth Tyson of Carthage, N.C., and two grandchildren.
