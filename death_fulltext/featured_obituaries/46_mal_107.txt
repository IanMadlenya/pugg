        William M. Walsh, a banker and executive vice president of the world's largest electronic funds transfer company, died on Saturday at his home in Pleasantville, N.Y. He was 54 years old.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Irene, said.
        Mr. Walsh was executive vice president of the New York Clearing House Association, which handles interbank payments on checks and other financial transactions. He also supervised two electronic fund transfer systems, Clearing House Interbank Payments and the New York Automated Clearing House, which are responsible for the exchange and settlement of nearly $1 trillion a day.
        He joined the clearinghouse in 1983 as a senior vice president and director of data processing. Before that he had been an officer with the Connecticut National Bank in Hartford and the Carteret Savings and Loan Association in New Jersey. From 1970 to 1976, he was with the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He was a graduate of Franklin and Marshall College.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Keith, of Boston, and Reed, of Pleasantville.
