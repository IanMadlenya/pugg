        Virginia Thompson Adloff, an author and teacher who wrote extensively on the countries of Southeast Asia and French-speaking Africa, died on Tuesday at the home of her sister in La Jolla, Calif. She was 86 years old and a longtime resident of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Adloff, who wrote under her maiden name, was married to Richard Adloff in 1943. Together they traveled for four decades and wrote several books on political, economic, social and cultural developments in Asia and Africa and on the islands of the Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
        A native of Newtonville, Mass., she was raised in New York, received a bachelor's degree from Vassar and a doctorate from Columbia.
        In World War II she was with the Office of War Information, specializing on Southeast Asia. After the war, she and Mr. Adloff contributed to scholarly journals, translated works from the French and wrote 11 books, including ''The Left Wing in Southeast Asia,'' published in 1950; ''The Emerging States of French Equatorial Africa,'' (1960), and ''The French Pacific Islands: French Polynesia and New Caledonia'' (1971).
        From 1961 to 1972, Mrs. Adloff taught political science at the University of California. In the 1978-79 academic year she was the first Distingushed Scholar in Residence at the Institute of International Studies in Berkeley. In 1973 she became the first American woman elected to France's 250-member Academie des Sciences d'Outre-Mer.
        She is survived by her husband and her sister, Juliet Pitt.
