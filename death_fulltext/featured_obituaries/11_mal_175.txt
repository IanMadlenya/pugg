        Alfredo Viazzi, a Greenwich Village restaurateur and an authority on the preparation of pasta dishes, died of a heart attack last night at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He was the proprietor of Trattoria da Alfredo on Eighth Avenue at 12th Street and had been admitted to St. Vincent's on Dec. 20 after an earlier heart attack.
        A native of Savona, Italy, Mr. Viazzi came to the United States in 1946 after having fought as a partisan during World War II. He later wrote a best-selling paperback novel, ''The Cruel Dawn,'' based on his wartime experiences.
        In 1957, Mr. Viazzi opened his first restaurant in Greenwich Village, Portofino, where he also staged plays on Monday evenings. A young actress named Jane White appeared in one of the plays, and after a brief courtship was married to Mr. Viazzi.
        In addition to Trattoria da Alfredo, which gained instant acclaim, Mr. Viazza opened two other restaurants in Greenwich Village that he later sold.
        In addition to his novel, Mr. Viazzi was the author of a book on Italian cuisine, and a memoir, ''Cucina e Nostalgia.''
        He is survived by his wife, two brothers, Piero and Nanni, and a sister, Jolanda, all of Savona, Italy; two daughters, Denise Perros of Port Charlotte, Fla., and Lynette Bender of Hurley, N.Y., and a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan.
