        Dr. Ralph Eddy Knutti, a former director of the National Heart Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., died last Wednesday at Chester-Crozier Hospital in Upland, Pa. He was 92 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, the institute said.
        A pathologist by training, Dr. Knutti was born in Palo Alto, Calif., and graduated from West Virginia University and the Yale University Medical School. He taught at the University of Rochester and the University of Southern California before he joined the United States Public Health Service in 1951. He initially worked at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases.
        He became director of the heart institute in 1961 and served until he reached the mandatory retirement age in 1965. He developed several important research programs at the institute and elsewhere through grants to fight diseases of the heart and blood vessels. He also traveled widely in Europe, Israel and the Soviet Union to further those efforts.
        After leaving the institute, he was executive officer of Universities Associated for Research and Education in Pathology in Bethesda until his final retirement in 1972.
        Dr. Knutti is survived by his wife, Dr. Sarah H. Knutti.
