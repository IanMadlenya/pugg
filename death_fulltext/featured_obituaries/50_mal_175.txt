        E. Paul Charlap, chairman of the Hem Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a Philadelphia drug research organization, and former head of the Savin Corporation, manufacturers of copying machines, died Tuesday at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 66 years old and lived in Plantation Key, Fla.
        Mr. Charlap died of cancer, a spokeswoman for his family said.
        In recent years he had been working on the development of a new drug called Ampligen, used to boost the immune system, which is currently being tested by the Food and Drug Administration.
        From 1960 to 1986 before joining Hem, he founded and became president and chief executive officer of Savin, with headquarters in Valhalla, N.Y.
        He was a director of Nu-kote International, manufacturers of business forms and office equipment supplies in Rochester; of Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Company until it was sold to Michelin last year, and of Mariner's Hospital in Tavarnier, Fla.
        A native of Philadelphia, he was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1950 he founded the Nylast Chemical Company in New York, which he sold to Seaman Brothers Corporation in 1955. He continued to operate the company as president of the Nylast division for Seaman until he founded Savin in 1960.
        Mr. Charlap is survived by his wife, the former Maryann Daley; two daughters, Rebecca Nan and Amanda Lynn Charlap, both of Plantation Key; a son and daughter from a former marriage, Peter Charlap of Stanfordville, N.Y., and Susan Levitt of Greenwich, Conn.; and five grandchildren.
