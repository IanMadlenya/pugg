        Frederic Ancrum Lord Holloway, a former vice president for science and technology at the Exxon Corporation, died on Nov. 30 in the Baton Rouge General Medical Center. He was 76 years old and a resident of Baton Rouge, La., and Cashiers, N.C.
        He died of a cerebral hemorrhage after a short illness, his family said.
        Mr. Holloway was manager of Exxon's science and technology department after the Arab oil crisis of the mid-1970's. At that time, Exxon began financing energy studies at colleges like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and the California Institute of Technology.
        From 1970 to 1973, Mr. Holloway was vice president of corporate planning at Exxon, which had changed its name from the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1972. Previously he had been president of the Esso Research and Engineering Company, a subsidiary of Jersey Standard.
        After nearly 40 years with Exxon, Mr. Holloway retired in 1978 and became a director of Gulf States Utilities Company of Beaumont, Tex., where he worked until 1985. At his death, he was a director of Construction Specialists in Cranford, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, May Bolling Cross; three daughters, Nell Wright of Charlotte, N.C., Mary McEntire of Dallas and Ann Stone of Cashiers, and six grandchildren.
