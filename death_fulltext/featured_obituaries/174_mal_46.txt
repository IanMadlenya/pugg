        Richard P. Rogers, director of the Film Study Center at Harvard University, and a filmmaker, died on Saturday at his home in Wainscott, N.Y. He was 57 and also had homes in Manhattan and Cambridge, Mass.
        The cause was melanoma, said his wife, Susan Meiselas.
        Mr. Rogers spent much of his career as a teacher. He was senior lecturer and senior research fellow at the Harvard center. Previously he was chairman of the film department at SUNY Purchase, where he and Willard Van Dyke created the highly regarded film program in 1974.
        His own films include ''Pictures From a Revolution,'' about Nicaragua in the wake of the Sandinista revolution, which he produced with his wife and Alfred Guzzuti.
        The film, narrated by Ms. Meiselas, a photographer who covered the struggle, was shown in 1991 as part of the 29th New York Film Festival. In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby summed up ''Pictures From a Revolution'' as ''serious and moving film reportage.''
        Mr. Rogers also made a series of films for PBS, including documentaries on William Carlos Williams, Wallace Stevens and William Kennedy, and directed ''A Midwife's Tale,'' a drama about an 18th-century American midwife, which was shown on PBS in 1998.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Bard Rogers Hamlen of Boston.
