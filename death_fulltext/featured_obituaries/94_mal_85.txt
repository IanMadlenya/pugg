        Don A. Schanche, who wrote books on American radicals and adventurers and was the chief editor of Holiday magazine, died yesterday at his home in Key Biscayne, Fla. He was 68.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Marybelle.
        After years as a magazine writer, editor and freelancer, Mr. Schanche was for 15 years a foreign correspondent with The Los Angeles Times. As bureau chief in Cairo, Rome and Miami, he covered the fall of the Shah of Iran, the rise of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Lebanese civil war and the negotiations between President Anwar El-Sadat and Prime Minister Menachem Begin for peace between Egypt and Israel.
        Mr. Schanche's books include "The Panther Paradox" (1970), about the Black Panthers, which Fred Powledge, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called "perhaps as complete a description as can be provided at this moment by any honest writer regardless of color." Other books written by Mr. Schanche (pronounced SKANK-ee) also won praise. They include "Mister Pop" (1970), about a retired Indiana farmer working as an agricultural adviser in warn-torn Laos, and "Man High" (1960), about Americans' high-altitude balloon flights.
        A native of New Brunswick, N.J., and an alumnus of the University of Georgia, Mr. Schanche was author or co-author of three other books. In the 1960's he held posts at the Saturday Evening Post and was Holiday's chief editor. He also worked for Time Inc.
        As well as his wife, survivors include a son, Donald Arthur Jr.; two daughters, Didrikke and Anne Ferro; a brother, and six grandchildren.
