        Mr. Dessibourg came to the United States from his native Switzerland in the mid-1950's. He was the maitre d'hotel at many of New York's most renowned French restaurants. He was known to many as ''Monsieur Paul'' and noted for orchestrating the running of a dining room with true precision.
        From 1978 to 1986, Mr. Dessibourg owned Le Chantilly on East 57th Street in partnership with Roland Chenus, the restaurant's chef. From 1986 to 1989 Mr. Dessibourg was a wine representative for the House of Burgundy, an importer of French wines.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ingrid Langer, and four daughters, Yvonne Ferruzza, of Belrose, L.I., and Ursula, Denise and Paulette Dessibourg, all of Queens.
