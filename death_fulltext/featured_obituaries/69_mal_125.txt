        Benjamin Weiss, a New York stock-market investor and art collector, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Weiss had been associated with the firm of Allen & Company since 1979 and remained an investment consultant until his death.
        Mr. Weiss made his mark about three decades ago as the broker in the acquisition by a group of investors of a small Mexican-based developer of hormones, the Syntex Corporation. It has since grown into a pharmaceutical giant with more than 10,000 employees, with headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
        Mr. Weiss was a collector of African and pre-Columbian art. He was also a member of the Rockefeller University Council and a supporter of research at New York University Medical Center.
        He is survived by his wife, Irma; a daughter, Jessica Weiss of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
