        Erich Hartmann, a photographer who documented the remains of the Nazi death camps, died on Thursday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 76 and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hartmann immigrated to the United States with his family in the 1930's. He served in the army in Europe in World War II, learned photography after his discharge and joined the photographic cooperative Magnum Photos in 1951. His photographic survey of the Nazi camps throughout Europe, from Auschwitz to Treblinka, took him five years to complete. The results were published in 1995 in book form by W. W. Norton and titled ''In the Camps.''
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Nicholas, of Milwaukee; a daughter, Celia Hartmann of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
