        Nan Wood Graham, the model for the tight-lipped farm woman in the painting "American Gothic," died Friday in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 91 years old.
        The 1930 painting by her brother Grant Wood portrays a somber farmer holding a pitchfork and his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in southeast Iowa. The model for the farmer was Dr. Byron McKeeby, a local dentist.
        The painting initially provoked complaints in Iowa, where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them with her dour expression. Her face would "sour milk," one woman wrote. But the painting eventually gained wide popularity here.
        "Grant made a personality out of me," Mrs. Graham once said. "I would have had a very drab life without it."
        She was protective of "American Gothic," bringing suit several times against the frequent caricatures and parodies of the painting, which hangs in the Art Institute of Chicago. She spent a lifetime as historian of the work of her brother, who died in 1942.
        Born in Anamosa, Iowa, she grew up in Cedar Rapids and married Edward Graham, a real estate investor. The couple settled in Riverside, Calif. They had no children.
