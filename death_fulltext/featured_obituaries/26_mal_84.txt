        Robert B. Betts, former chairman of the William Esty advertising agency, now Campbell-Mithun-Esty, died of cancer yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Betts, who was born in Easton, Pa., and who was a graduate of Harvard, served in the United States Army in Europe during World War II. He was an editor with Harcourt, Brace and a writer and producer of documentary films before entering the advertising business.
        At Esty he rose to become president and creative director in 1967, supervising a number of consumer product accounts.
        In recent years, Mr. Betts engaged in historical research, particularly into the American West. His published works include ''Along the Ramparts of the Tetons,'' a history of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and ''In Search of York,'' a biography of a slave who was the only black man in the Lewis and Clark expedition.
        Mr. Betts is survived by his wife, the former Emilie Woehrle; two daughters, D. Brooks Betts of Manhattan and Anne Charleston of Denver; a son, Robert, of Dubois, Wyo., and two granddaughters.
