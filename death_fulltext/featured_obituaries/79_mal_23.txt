        Paul H. Blaustein, a New York law partner who specialized in patent law, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 61 and lived in White Plains.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Blaustein was an engineering graduate of Columbia University. After military service, he earned his law degree at George Washington University, where he was patent editor of the Law Journal. While at the law school he also worked for the United States Patent Office.
        For the last 25 years he was a principal member of the mid-Manhattan firm of Hopgood, Calimafde, Kalil, Blaustein & Judlowe. He was the author of "Learned Hand on Patent Law" (Pineridge Publishing House, 1983).
        Mr. Blaustein is survived by his wife of 36 years, Barbara Milthen Blaustein; two sons, Dr. David Blaustein of New Haven and Richard Blaustein of Washington, and a daughter, Stacey Divack of Manhattan.
