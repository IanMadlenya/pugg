        Robert W. Freihofer, chairman of the board of the Charles Freihofer Baking Company in Albany, died on Saturday at his home in Lake George, N.Y. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Freihofer died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        He had been with the company, bought by General Foods Corporation in 1987, since 1948. He was president until 1988, when he was appointed chairman.
        When he was born in 1919, the Charles Freihofer Baking Company, founded by his father and two uncles, still made deliveries by horse and carriage. He turned the business into a modern corporation. With 1,500 employees, five plants and 11 distribution centers, the company supplied baked goods to communities in New York, New Jersey and New England.
        He was a director and treasurer of Quality Bakers of America Cooperative Inc., and a director of the Independent Bakers Association.
        He was chairman of the board of the Cohoes Savings Bank and a director of, among others, the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, United Mutual Insurance in Utica, the Samaritan Hospital in Troy and the Center for the Disabled in Albany.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Jane Tarrant; two sons, Robert W., of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Albert F., of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.; a daughter, Tia Griffiths also of Saratoga Springs, and two sisters, Ruth Lang of Troy and Doris Kelly of Boca Raton, Fla.
