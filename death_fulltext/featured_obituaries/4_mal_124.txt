Along with Herman David, then chairman of the All England Club, Mr. Hardwick was determined to introduce open tennis, involving both amateurs and professionals, at the Wimbledon championships even if other nations were against it. When others decided to follow, the first open tournament - the British Hard Court Championships -was played at Mr. Hardwick's home club, the West Hampshire Club in Bournemouth, in 1968.
