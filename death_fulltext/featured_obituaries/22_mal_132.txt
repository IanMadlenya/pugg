        The Rev. Haralan Popov, a Protestant minister who spent 13 years in a Bulgarian prison on charges of spying for the United States, died of complications from cancer on Nov. 14 at the Adventist Medical Center in Glendale, Calif. He was 81 years old and lived in Glendale.
        Mr. Popov, who was born in Bulgaria, was a prominent Pentecostal minister in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, when he was arrested in 1948. He was among 15 Protestant ministers charged with treason and espionage and accused of supplying the United States and Britain with information on Soviet troop movements in Bulgaria.
        After eight months of confinement, Mr. Popov and the other clerics pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and was released in 1962. He then started a worldwide campaign for human rights and religious freedom.
        He is survived by his son, Paul, of Vancouver, British Columbia; a daughter, Rhoda Linna, of Philadelpha, and six grandchildren.
