        Samuel Shapiro, who presided over a company that responded to the fast-food appetite of consumers by churning out containers for Big Macs at McDonald's, popcorn at movie theaters and HÃ¤agen-Dazs ice cream at supermarkets, died on March 8 at a hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 83.
        The cause was a heart ailment, according to his family.
        In 1980, Mr. Shapiro was president of the Maryland Cup Corporation and its subsidiary, Sweetheart Plastics Inc. At the time, the company was the nation's leading manufacturer of disposable food containers.
        Mr. Shapiro was born in Chelsea, Mass., and attended Syracuse University and Boston University. He earned a degree in business administration from Boston University before joining Maryland Cup.
        Mr. Shapiro is survived by his wife, Bernice Stein Shapiro of Palm Beach; two daughters, Randi L. Cohen of Marblehead, Mass., and Cindi M. Shapiro of Beverly, Mass.; a son, Donald R. Shapiro of Weston, Mass.; a sister, Anne Borenstein of Brookline, Mass.; and 10 grandchildren.
