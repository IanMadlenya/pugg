        Rabbi Samuel J. Fox, a former president of the Massachusetts Council of Rabbis and of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of Greater Boston, died on Monday in Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 75 and lived in Lynn, Mass.
        He died after a long illness, said his son, Joseph.
        At his death, Rabbi Fox was the spiritual leader of Congregation Chevra Tehillim in Lynn. He took that post three decades ago, after four years as the spiritual leader of Congregation Anshe Sfard, also in Lynn.
        In the 1960's, at a time when Massachusetts strictly enforced its blue laws, he played an important role in a successful campaign for legislation to permit work on Sundays by Sabbatarians, those who celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday and close their businesses on that day, opening for business on Sunday.
        Over the years, he was also active in the Rabbinical Council of America and was an editor of its Sermon Manual. In addition, he often spoke on television and radio. His writings include regular columns that the Jewish Telegraph Agency conveyed to numerous publications in the United States and abroad.
        Rabbi Fox was born in Rochester and studied at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, affiliated with Yeshiva University in Manhattan, and at Harvard, where he earned a doctorate in theology.
        In later years, he taught at various institutions, including Merrimack College, in North Andover, Mass., where he was the head of the religion department.
        His wife of 49 years, the former Edith Muskin, died in 1991.
        He is survived by his son, of Manhattan and Los Angeles.
