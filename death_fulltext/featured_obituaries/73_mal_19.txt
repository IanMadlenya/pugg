        Tom Adair, a former soloist with American Ballet Theater and a teacher and choreographer in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie. He was 57.
        Marsha Preiss, a friend, said the cause of death was lung cancer.
        Mr. Adair, who specialized in character roles, performed with Ballet Theater from 1956 to 1966 and was often featured in the dramatic ballets of Antony Tudor. In 1966 he moved to Poughkeepsie, where he established a school, the American Conservatory of Ballet, and Poughkeepsie Ballet Theater, a company for which he choreographed until it disbanded a decade later. His productions included his own versions of works like Stravinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" and Orff's "Carmina Burana."
        A native of Maypearl, Tex., Mr. Adair came to New York in 1952 and appeared with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before joining Ballet Theater. In recent years, he taught at his studio and as a guest teacher at Vassar College, Bard College, the State University College at Purchase, N.Y., and Dutchess Community College.
        He is survived by two sisters, Jane Ellis of Maypearl, and Frances Barbee of Houston.
