        Leon Braun, a lawyer and a former deputy comptroller for New York State, died on Tuesday at his home in Coconut Creek, Fla. He was 85.
        The cause was lung cancer, said John A. Garcia, a friend of the family.
        From 1961 to 1973, Mr. Braun was in charge of the retirement systems for state employees and for the state's police and firefighters. While in office, he completely restructured the systems to handle dramatic growth in the number of retirees. He also directed the state's Social Security agency.
        After leaving the comptroller's office, Mr. Braun was appointed to direct real-estate investments and mortgage loans for the state, managing accounts of more than $300 million a year. He retired in 1978.
        He was active in the Liberal Party throughout his life.
        Mr. Braun was born in Manhattan and attended St. John's University. He graduated from St. John's University School of Law in 1935 and was admitted to the New York State bar in 1936.
        He is survived by a sister, Jeanette Braun, of New York. His wife of 30 years, Ingeborg, died last May.
