        George W. Cornell, a New York lawyer and former Republican state senator, died last Thursday at his home in Boca Raton, Fla.. He was 91 years old and formerly lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.
        Mr. Cornell, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Amherst College in 1918 and earned his law degree at Columbia Law School in 1921. He specialized in international estates.
        In 1970, he moved to Florida, where he continued to practice law until 1985.
        Eight generations of Cornells served as elected town officials in Scarsdale since the arrival in 1713 of Richard Cornell, a grandson of a 1636 Boston settler, Thomas Cornell.
        Mr. Cornell himself was a village trustee from 1943 to 1946 and then the Republican town chairman before being elected supervisor of the town of Scarsdale in 1947.
        While on the County Board of Supervisors, he served as chairman of the legislative committee. In 1958, he was elected to the State Senate from the 31st District. He declined to seek re-election in 1964 but attended the New York Constitutional Convention in 1967 as a delegate and vice chairman of the Committee on Taxation and Finance.
        He is survived by a daughter, Paula C. Amy, and a son, John R., both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
