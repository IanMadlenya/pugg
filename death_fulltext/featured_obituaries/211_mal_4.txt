        Dr. Joseph Silver, a former chief of orthopedic surgery at New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, died on Monday in Stamford, Conn. He was 70.
        The cause was cancer, said Philip Fuchs, a friend.
        Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Dr. Silver lived in Lawrence, N.Y. His illness forced him to step down two years ago as chief of orthopedic surgery, but he continued to practice. He was an attending orthopedic surgeon at Maimonides Medical Center and Lutheran Medical Center and a visiting attending orthopedic surgeon at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, all in Brooklyn.
        Dr. Silver is survived by his wife, Madeline, an administrative law judge, of Lawrence; a son, Dr. Marc Silver, of Stamford; a daughter, Lauren Goldman, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; two brothers, Sheldon, the speaker of the New York State Assembly, and Gerald, both of Manhattan; a sister, Arlene Rosenfelder, of London; and three grandchildren.
