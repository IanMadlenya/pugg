        Brendan Joseph Reilly, a furniture designer who owned and operated a specialty furniture store on the West Side of Manhattan, died on Thursday at the Veterans Administration Hospital, at First Avenue at 24th Street. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Mr. Reilly, a native of Boston, graduated from Boston Latin School and was a member of the war-delayed class of '45. He served as a Navy lieutenant (j.g.), commanding harbor craft in the Pacific during the war. After graduation, he was a pitcher in the baseball minor leagues.
        Mr. Reilly turned to the design and manufacture of furniture after a few years, and one of his best-sellers was a multi-use, plastic-topped table resting on a pedestal. He was a co-founder, with Walter Wolff, of the Bon Marche stores in Manhattan in the 1950's.
        In 1982, Mr. Reilly founded Paradigm Inc., most recently situated on West 32d Street. It is a specialty business for the reproduction and marketing of classic modern furniture, primarily Bauhaus designs.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Jane Madden; three daughters, Eliza Gosse of Wellesley, Mass., and Mary Nichols and Sarah Ann Reilly, both of Manhattan; a sister, Elizabeth Moynahan of Princeton, N.J.; two brothers, Kevin, of Baton Rouge, La., and Eugene, of West Newbury, Mass., and two grandchildren.
