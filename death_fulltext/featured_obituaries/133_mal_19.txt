        Nino Pirrotta, an influential Italian musicologist, died on Jan. 15 in his native Palermo. He was 89.
        Mr. Pirrotta is best known for having brought new and rigorous techniques to the study of music, asserting that music history should be examined within the broader context of literature, philosophy and art history.
        He started his career as a lecturer in the history of music and librarian at the Conservatory of Palermo, and in 1948 became the director of the music library of the Saint Cecilia Conservatory in Rome.
        In 1956 he moved to Boston and taught in the music department at Harvard University, where he served as chairman from 1965 to 1968. He also taught at Princeton and Columbia universities. In 1972 he returned to Rome, where he held a professorship in music history at the University of Rome.
        Mr. Pirrotta was a national member of the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, a councilor of the Academy of Saint Cecilia in Rome, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an honorary member of the Royal Music Association. He was the author of numerous publications that dealt with 14th- to 17th-century music, including ''Music and Theater from Poliziano to Monteverdi.'' He is survived by four children.
