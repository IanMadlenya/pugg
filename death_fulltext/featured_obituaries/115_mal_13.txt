        Dr. Richard Vincent Ebert, a specialist in heart and lung disease who led the medical faculties at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and at the University of Minnesota, died on July 22 at his lake-side cabin in Cornucopia, Wis. He was 83 and lived in Little Rock.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Dr. Ebert was credited with laying the foundation for the department of internal medicine in the College of Medicine, in the medical sciences university, in Little Rock. He taught and practiced there from 1954 to 1966 and again from 1978 until his retirement three years ago. In between, he headed the department of medicine at Minnesota.
        He was a leading researcher on obstructive lung disease, congestive heart failure and shock.
        As an officer in the Army Medical Corps in World War II, he was decorated for treating battle wounds in Europe.
        He was born in St. Paul and graduated in 1937 from the University of Chicago, where he received his medical degree as well. He was chairman of the American Board of Internal Medicine and president of the American Society for Clinical Investigation.
        Dr. Ebert is survived by his wife of 49 years, Shirley Fairburn Ebert; three sons, Dr. Michael H. Ebert, of Nashville, Richard V. Ebert Jr., of Fayetteville, Ark., and Robert H. Ebert 2d, of Little Rock; two daughters, Constance A. Ebert of St. Paul, and Susan E. Kinzel of Minneapolis, and five grandchildren.
