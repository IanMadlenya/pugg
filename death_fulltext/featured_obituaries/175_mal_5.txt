        Wesley W. Posvar, former chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, who led the university as it went from near bankruptcy to academic prestige, died on July 27. He was 75 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The cause was a heart attack, the university said.
        Mr. Posvar served as chancellor from 1967 until his retirement in 1991. In that time, he eliminated the university's debt and the endowment increased to $257 million from $81 million.
        During his tenure, the university added the Honors College, the School of Health-Related Professions, the University Center for International Studies, the Center for Philosophy of Science and the University Center for Social and Urban Research.
        Mr. Posvar was the founding chairman of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which advises the government on response to national emergencies. He also advised the government on foreign intelligence, civil aviation and national emergency telecommunications.
        Wesley Wentz Posvar was born on Sept. 14, 1925, in Topeka, Kan. After graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1946, he joined the Air Force for two years. He then became the first Air Force officer to be awarded a Rhodes Scholarship and earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Oxford. He also earned a master's degree in public administration and a doctoral degree in political science from Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife of 51 years, Mildred Miller; three children, Wesley William Posvar, Margot Green, and Lisa Rossi, all of Pittsburgh; a half-brother, Jan Posvar of New York; and seven grandchildren.
        Correction:  August 4, 2001, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Wesley W. Posvar, chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, cited his military career incompletely. He was in the Air Force for 22 years, not 2, and reached the rank of brigadier general.
