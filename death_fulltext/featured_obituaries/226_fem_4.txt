        R. Gaynor McCown, the executive director of the Teaching Commission, a bipartisan advocacy group of leaders in business, government, philanthropy and education, died on Monday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 45.
        Her death was announced by the group's founder and chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., a former chairman of the I.B.M. Corporation. The cause was bile duct cancer, the commission said.
        Ms. McCown joined the group in 2002 to direct its reform agenda for the teaching profession, with goals including linking pay with performance and overhauling training, recruitment and support. She was a principal author of its report, ''Teaching at Risk,'' published last year.
        Rosemary Gaynor McCown was born in Mobile, Ala., and graduated from St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind., in 1983. She received a master's degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education in 1987 and taught high school science and health classes in the Bronx for five years.
        In the 1990's, she was a White House Fellow and a senior executive with the New York City Partnership. After receiving a master's in business administration in 2000, she was the senior vice president for business development at Edison Schools, an operator of commercial charter schools, when Mr. Gerstner recruited her for the Teaching Commission.
        She was a trustee of the Center for Employment Opportunities and a director of New York City Outward Bound.
        Ms. McCown is survived by her husband, Jonathan D. Miller; two brothers, John D. Jr., of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and James M., of Somerville, Mass.; and two sisters, Eugenia H. McCown of Fairhope, Ala., and Robin M. Mumford of Chicago.
