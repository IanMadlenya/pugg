        W. Russell Boss, former president and chairman of the A. T. Cross Company, a maker of expensive pens and pencils, died Monday. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Boss went to work as sales manager and treasurer of Cross in 1937, shortly after the death of his father, Walter Russell Boss Sr., owner of the Rhode Island-based company.
        Over the next 27 years, he rose to become chairman and president of the company and helped it evolve from a private, family-owned business with a dozen employees to a public company with $155.4 million in revenues and more than 1,400 employees worldwide.
