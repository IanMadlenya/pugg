        Robert Satiacum, a former Indian tribal leader who spent much of his last years as a fugitive from justice, died Monday, apparently of a heart attack, at a Vancouver hospital. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Satiacum died a week after his arrest in Canada on a warrant for child molestation.
        As a leader of Washington State's Puyallup Indians, Mr. Satiacum led the campaign for Indian fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest in the 1960's and 70's.
        Marlon Brando and Jane Fonda were among the celebrities who appeared at his side in fishing protests on the Puyallup River.
        In 1982 Mr. Satiacum fled to Canada while awaiting sentencing in the United States on racketeering charges that involved trafficking in contraband cigarettes, arson and the attempted murder of a rival tribal leader.
        He was captured in Canada in 1983 and jailed until 1987, when he won political-refugee status. The decision was later reversed by an appeals court.
        In 1989, while awaiting sentencing in Canada for molesting a 10-year-old girl, Mr. Satiacum disappeared again. He was captured a week ago.
