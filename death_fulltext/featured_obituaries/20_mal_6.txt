        Dr. Gerald Mast, an author, film historian and chairman of the English department at the University of Chicago, died of AIDS yesterday at the Bernard Mitchell Hospital in Chicago. He was 48 years old and lived in Hyde Park, Ill.
        Dr. Mast, who received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Chicago, joined the faculty there in 1978 after teaching at New York University, Oberlin College and the City University of New York. Because of his writings on film history, he is credited with helping establish the subject as a serious academic discipline. His books, including ''The Comic Mind: Comedy and the Movies'' (1979) and ''Film Theory and Criticism'' (1985), published by the University of Chicago Press, are used extensively in film courses across the country.
        He is survived by his mother, Bessie Mast, of Camarillo, Calif., and a sister, Linda Avanzino, of Solvang, Calif.
