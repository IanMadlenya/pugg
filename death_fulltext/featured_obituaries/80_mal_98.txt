        Julian Semyonov, a prolific Russian author of spy novels and thrillers whose crime fiction often portrayed the dark side of Russian life, died in the Kremlin Hospital in Moscow on Sept. 14. He was 61 years old.
        The cause was a heart attack, although he had been incapacitated for several years as the result of a stroke, said John Calder, president of Riverrun Press in England.
        The author of some 50 books and dozens of screenplays, Mr. Semyonov sold millions of copies of his books in Russia. And starting with "Petrovka 38," a 1965 police thriller, many of his works were published abroad.
        Mr. Semyonov, a past president of the International Association of Crime Writers, spoke Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, English, Spanish, German and French.  Was a Language Teacher
        He was born on Oct. 8, 1931, in Moscow, where his father was a secretary to the Bolshevik leader Nikolai Bukharin. A graduate of the Oriental Institute of Moscow University, Mr. Semyonov taught Oriental languages on the university level and later became a journalist.
        As a political writer and reporter for Pravda, he was regarded as a Russian liberal and internationalist, and among other stories covered the war in Vietnam, from the North Vietnamese side, while continuing to write crime fiction.
        Mr. Semyonov, who was a friend of the Soviet leaders Yuri V. Andropov and Mikhail Gorbachev, was accused of being an officer of the K.G.B. by Soviet emigres during an American book tour in 1987. He denied it, but said that he had been given access to K.G.B. files by Mr. Andropov so that his spy novels might be more accurate.
        He is survived by two married daughters, Olga, an artist, and Dunya, an actress, both of whom live in Moscow.
