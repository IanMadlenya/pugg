        George Perry Mahoney, a Baltimore contractor who was a frequent unsuccessful political candidate, died Saturday night at his residence in a Baltimore hotel, He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Mahoney, a Democrat, ran four times for the United States Senate and five times for Governor of Maryland.
        His most famous contest was in 1966, when he capitalized on a bitter split in the party to win the Democratic gubernatorial primary. But he was defeated in the general election by Spiro T, Agnew, who was elected Vice President two years later on a ticket led by Richard M. Nixon.
        In the 1966 contest Mr. Mahoney campaigned on the slogan ''your home is your castle - protect it,'' a statement that was considered aimed at those opposed to open housing and other civil rights goals. Many Democratic groups withheld their support.
        In 1973 when Maryland established its lottery, he was appointed head of the state lottery commission.
        He is survived by his wife, Dr. Linda Frank; his son, George Jr.; a daughter, Perry Rossi, and five granchildren.
