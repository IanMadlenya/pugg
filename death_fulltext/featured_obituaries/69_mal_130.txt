        Albert Bosco Reyes, a playwright, director and founder of the Nat Horne Musical Theater and School, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital. He was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of stomach cancer, said Nat Horne, a co-founder of the theater that bears his name. It is the second oldest active member of the Theater Row Association on West 42d Street, of which Mr. Reyes was a founding board member.
        Mr. Reyes was the president of Pro Desktop, a video production company, and a writer for News 4 New York. As a producer and director for NBC from 1968 to 1977 he won several industry awards, including eight Peabody Awards.
        Among the plays he directed at Nat Horne and regional theaters are "What the Butler Saw," "1776" and "Anything Goes."
        He is survived by his mother, Raquel Sevilla of New York City; his father, Carlos Reyes; three brothers, Carlos, Alejandro and Eduardo, and a sister, Cecilia, all of San Diego.
