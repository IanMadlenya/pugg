        Art James, a host and announcer for television game shows, died on Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif., where he was visiting. He was 74 and lived in Chaska, Minn.
        He died of natural causes, said his brother, Leo James; the exact cause was not known, pending an autopsy.
        Art James was an announcer and host on a dozen daytime television game shows broadcast from New York and, later, California, for several networks, starting in the 1960's with series like ''Say When!'' and ''Fractured Phrases.'' His last show was ''Family Feud Challenge'' in 1992.
        He was the president of Art James Productions, based in Chaska, which offered instruction in public speaking and staged TV-style game shows for corporate clients, intended to sharpen job skills.
        He lectured at adult classes in speaking and nonfiction writing at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Los Angeles.
        He was born Arthur Efimchick in Dearborn, Mich., and studied engineering at Wayne State University. He also became active in its theater program and worked at a rural radio station reading farm reports and playing country music.
        He spent two years with the Army in Europe as an announcer for the Armed Forces Network before graduating from Wayne State. After that he moved to New York and was hired in 1958 as an announcer and understudy for Hugh Downs, the host of a new television game show, ''Concentration.''
        For the next 28 years Mr. James worked on shows like ''Pay Cards!,'' ''Who, What or Where Game,'' ''Blank Check,'' ''Face the Music,'' and ''The Magnificent Marble Machine.''
        Besides his brother, Leo, of Clarkston, Mich., Mr. James is survived by his wife, Sandy; a son, Jeffrey James, of San Diego; a daughter, Jennifer Christie, of Layton, Utah; and three grandchildren.
