        Crosby S. Noyes, a longtime reporter and editor for The Washington Star, died Thursday after a heart attack. He was 67 years old and lived in Bethesda, Md.
        Mr. Noyes, a member of a family that had been part owners of The Star for 80 years, began his career there as a reporter in 1947. He made various reporting trips to Europe and opened the paper's Paris bureau in 1954. He became the newspaper's chief European correspondent and its foreign editor.
        He retired in 1974, when the Noyes and Kauffmann families, which had controled the newspaper since 1867, sold it to Joe L. Albritton. Mr. Albritton later sold the paper to Time Inc., which closed it in 1981.
        Mr. Noyes was born in Washington and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H., and Yale University.
        He served in the Army Air Force during World War II, serving as an instructor for French pilots in the United States. He later flew combat missions as a fighter pilot in Europe and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
        Mr. Noyes is survived by his wife, the former Letitia Hughson, four children, two brothers and a half-sister.
