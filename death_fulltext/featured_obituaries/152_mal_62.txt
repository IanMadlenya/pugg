        Bishop Basil Rodzianko, a retired Bishop of the Orthodox Church in America who was known for the broadcasts on religious topics that he made from Britain and the United States to what is now Russia for more than three decades, died last Friday at his home in Washington. He was 84.
        The broadcasts by the Bishop, whose first name was originally Vladimir, were initially transmitted by the British Broadcasting Corporation during the cold war.
        That was after he arrived in Britain, having been imprisoned in Yugoslavia for two years for ''illegal religious propaganda.'' He and his family moved there from their native Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution, and he earned a theological degree there.
        He made his broadcasts in a mellow voice in Russian, giving news and commentary and, later on, exploring theological themes.
        In the latter part of his broadcasting career, his radio talks were transmitted by the Voice of America and Radio Vatican.
        He kept on broadcasting after he retired from his episcopal duties in 1984 and moved to Washington. For most of the 1990's, he broadcast on Russian television during visits to Russia. He had been born in Ukraine while it was part of the Russian empire.
        In 1981, he was promoted to his last post, that of the Bishop of the Diocese of San Francisco, which includes much of the western United States.
        He had served for a short time as Auxiliary Bishop -- with the title of Bishop of Washington, D.C. -- to the Primate of the Orthodox Church in America, Metropolitan Theodosius, who still holds that office.
        The Orthodox Church in America is an independent daughter church of the Russian Orthodox Church.
        Bishop Basil's wife, the former Maria Kolyubayev, died two decades ago.
        His survivors include two sons, Vladimir and Peter, who live in Britain, and three grandsons.
