        Joseph Friedman, a retired professor of English at Long Island University, died on Tuesday at his home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 76 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said a son, Eric.
        A native of the Bronx, Professor Friedman attended the City College of New York, but interrupted his studies to enlist in the Army Air Corps during World War II. After the war, he completed his undergraduate studies at Columbia College, and earned a master's degree in American literature at New York University in 1961.
        Professor Friedman taught at Long Island University from 1965 until his retirement in 1984.
        Before joining the faculty there, he had been a freelance writer and also conducted writing workshops. That led him to found Venture Magazine, which he published from 1954 to 1960. The magazine included the works of many leading writers, especially those associated with the Greenwich Village literary scene, including Allen Ginsberg, Waldo Frank, Kay Boyle and Conrad Aiken. One of its last articles was the last interview the French writer Albert Camus gave before his death in 1960.
        Professor Friedman is survived by his wife, Doris; three sons, Jeffrey B., of San Francisco, William K., of Harrisburg, N.Y., and Eric A., of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Marlene Dann Soury, of Manhattan, and Hillary Dann, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
