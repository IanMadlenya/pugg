        Rabbi Solomon Gross, president of the Munkacher sect of Hasidim, died of heart failure on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 78 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        Rabbi Gross was a close associate of Grand Rabbi Moishe Rabinovich, the Munkacher Rebbe, who is spiritual leader of the 50,000-member sect, which was founded in 1790 in Eastern Europe. Although the movement was almost destroyed during World War II, its members, most of whom trace their roots to Hungary, Rumania and what is now Czechoslovakia, maintain synagogues in 30 countries.
        A native of Munkach, Hungary, Rabbi Gross served as president of the Munkacher for more than 30 years, during which he supervised the establishment of many charitable efforts.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose; a son, Leslie, of Forest Hills, Queens; a daughter, Mrs. George Katz of Brooklyn, and four grandsons.
        Rabbi Gross will be buried in Jerusalem. A tribute was paid yesterday by several thousand members of the Munkacher sect at its synagogue at 14th Avenue and 47th Street in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn.
