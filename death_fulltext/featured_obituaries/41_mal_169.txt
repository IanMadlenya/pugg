Mr. Hopkinson was editor of the now defunct magazine Picture Post from 1940 to 1950 and of the South African magazine Drum, which was aimed at black readers, from 1958 to 1961. He specialized in the use of bold, observant photographs to raise awareness of society's ills.
        He recalled his experiences with Drum magazine and his travels in Africa in a 1962 book, ''In the Fiery Continent.''
        Mr. Hopkinson was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1978 for his services to journalism.
        He is survived by his wife and three daughters.
