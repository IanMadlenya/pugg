        Herbert Singer, a stockbroker who owned one of the largest over-the-counter brokerage firms of the 1960's, died Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94.
        Mr. Singer had a career that resembled the American dream. The son of Hungarian immigrants, he never attended college and yet became one of Wall Street's shrewdest investors and advisers.
        Among Mr. Singer's early bosses were Armand Hammer and William Randolph Hearst, who hired Mr. Singer to work on the Hearst company's first financial journal in 1920.
        Mr. Singer remained with Mr. Hearst through the 1950's but quickly became interested in pursuing his own interests. Convinced that investors could prosper from small stocks, he was a co-founder of Singer, Bean & Mackie in 1961. The firm eventually helped form the Nasdaq market.
        While at Singer, Bean, Mr. Singer became known for a zest for life that many of his younger colleagues lacked. To get to work each morning, he took his boat down the Hudson River.
        The boat quickly became one of Wall Street's most chauvinistic watering holes. To buoy business, Mr. Singer would invite large numbers of his business associates aboard on the weekends, with the only stipulation being that no women were allowed.
        The exclusion made many on Wall Street chuckle, given that Mr. Singer's reputation was one of fair play and generosity. For years, numerous people on Wall Street who needed help with any sort of financial or personal issue often sought Mr. Singer's assistance.
        Away from the office, Mr. Singer maintained a hectic schedule. He spent time at the Central Synagogue and traveled extensively, often to Israel and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, with his wife Leona, to whom he had been married 58 years.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Singer is survived by two daughters, Ellen Sussman of Manhattan and Connie Stein of Palm Beach, Fla., and four grandchildren.
