        Ghulam Farid Sabri, a noted Pakistani singer of centuries-old devotional music, called Qawwali, in praise of the saints of Sufism, the principal mystical extension of Islam, died on April 5 in Karachi, Pakistan. He was in his mid-60's..
        Mr. Sabri grew up in Gwalior, in central India, in a musical family that moved to Karachi while he was a teen-ager. There he and his younger brother, Maqbool Ahmed Sabri, received advanced instruction in singing.
        The Sabri brothers went on to perform, in Urdu and other languages, before many audiences, including some in Germany and in the United States, where they were praised for the festiveness and soulfulness of their music and its presentation.
        When they sang in 10 American cities in 1981, their troupe consisted of Ghulam, the leader, and Maqbool Sabri -- both of them solo singers -- two other Sabri brothers and six additional singers and percussionists.
        Ghulam Sabri's survivors include five sons and six daughters.
