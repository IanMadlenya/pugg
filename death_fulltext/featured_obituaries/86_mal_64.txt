        Dr. Kenneth Neill Cameron, one of the country's foremost scholars of Shelley and English Romantic poetry in general, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Cameron's work as an author and editor threw new light on the life and poetry of Shelley and his circle, a group including William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Thomas Love Peacock, T. J. Hogg, Leigh Hunt, Byron and Edward John Trelawny. Work at Pforzheimer Library
        Much of Dr. Cameron's research was done at the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library in New York, a rich private repository of late 18th- and early 19th-century materials. At the invitation of Mr. Pforzheimer, an investment banker, Dr. Cameron supervised acquisition, arrangement and editing from 1952 to 1967. He was the editor of volumes one through four of "Shelley and His Circle," beginning a project that still continues.
        He was the author of "The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical" (1950), and he edited "Romantic Rebels: Essays on Shelley and His Circle" (1973), among others.
        Dr. Cameron was born in Barrow-in-Furness, England, and took degrees from McGill University and Oxford, as well as a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin. He started teaching at Indiana University and, after his Pforzheimer stint, was an English professor at New York University until 1975.
        The rebellious streak in Shelley's entourage was reflected in Dr. Cameron's thinking. It led him to write about Marxism and to promote "the scientific spirit of inquiry of Marx, Engels and Lenin," as a reviewer put it. He wrote "Marx and Engels Today: A Modern Dialogue on Philosophy and History" (1976), and "Marxism: The Science of Society; An Introduction" (1985).
        Dr. Cameron is survived by his wife of 48 years, Mary Owen Cameron; a daughter, Kathleeen Cameron of Martha's Vineyard, and two grandchildren.
