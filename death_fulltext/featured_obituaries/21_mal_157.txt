        Harry Evans, the founder and first editor of Family Circle magazine, died Oct. 11 at his home in St. Augustine, Fla., where he had lived since his retirement in the late 1960's. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Evans, a one-time movie critic and entertainer, founded Family Circle in 1932, with the backing of Charles E. Merrill, founder of the investment firm that became Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith and also founder of the grocery chain that became Safeway Stores.
        The first issue appeared on Sept. 9, 1932, and was distributed without charge in three chain stores. Fourteen months later, the magazine was being given away in stores in 31 states and Hawaii, with a circulation of 80,000. In 1946 it ceased to be free. It is now part of The New York Times Company with a circulation of 5,770,000.
        The initial recipe for success involved such domestic topics as food, fashion and household tips, and such entertainment as radio, movies, fiction, humor, games and prize contests. The content reflected what Mr. Evans wanted: a magazine with ''nothing that a woman could object to.''
        There are no immediate survivors.
