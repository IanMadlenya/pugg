        Jane Pack Dessau, an advertising executive, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 38 and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of breast cancer after a four-year battle, her husband, Stephen P. Dessau said.
        In 1989, Jane Pack, as she was known professionally, was named an executive vice president of Levine, Huntley, Schmidt & Beaver, a subsidiary of Grey Advertising. In 1988, Advertising Age magazine named her one of the 100 "best and brightest" advertising and marketing women in the United States.
        After 13 years with Levine Huntley, she left the organization, because of her health, in 1991, shortly before the agency closed. Throughout her illness, she was active in Reach for Recovery, a program of the American Cancer Society, and the T. J. Martell Foundation for Cancer and Aids Research.
        Mrs. Dessau was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from SUNY-Albany and received an M.B.S. from Baruch College.
        Besides her husband, survivors include a daughter, Julianna Sara, and a son, David Stephen; her parents, Dr. Milton Pack and Phyllis Pack of Brooklyn, and two brothers, Dr. Philip Pack of Scarsdale and Dr. Michael Pack of Boston.
