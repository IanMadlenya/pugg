        Howard Francis Shattuck Jr., a retired international counsel for the Mobil Oil Corporation who led a study of United Nations peacekeeping operations for the American Bar Association, died on Wednesday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 76 and also had a residence in Darien, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        He joined Mobil in New York in 1956, in its international division. In the 1960's, he helped negotiate settlements for expropriated American petroleum interests in the Middle East and before the World Court at The Hague. He retired in 1985. He then became a panelist for the American Arbitration Association.
        In retirement, he devoted time to international law, working on panels of the American Bar Association and the City Bar Association. Most recently, as co-chairman of an A.B.A. task force, he focused on the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations, visiting world trouble spots and helping to develop A.B.A. recommendations for standby United Nations military forces.
        Mr. Shattuck, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Yale University in 1942 and received his law degree from Harvard University in 1948.
        His first wife, Ruth Murphy Shattuck, died in 1990. He is survived by his wife, Julie Follansbee Pratt Shattuck; a son, John H. F., of Washington; a daughter, Christina Cort Stenhuis-Shattuck of Rowayton, Conn.; a brother, Roger W., and four grandchildren.
