        David T. Johnston, a commodities trader and executive who served two terms as chairman of the Commodity Exchange in New York, died May 26 at the Courtland Gardens Health Center in Stamford, Conn.
        Mr. Johnston, 76, died of complications of Parkinson's disease, according to his son, Peter A. Johnston.
        Born in New York City, he was educated at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned an undergraduate degree in economics. Mr. Johnston began a long career on Wall Street in 1946 at Merrill Lynch, where he was a member of the firm's third training-school class.
        Two years later, he began to specialize in trading commodities, and by the time he left Merrill in 1968 he was the second-ranking executive in its commodities department.
        He then moved to E. F. Hutton & Company, and remained with that firm in a variety of posts until it was acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers in 1987.
        During his years at Hutton Mr. Johnston was active in the Futures Industry Association, serving as chairman of its board from 1978 to 1980. He was chairman of the Commodity Exchange, the top volunteer position at the New York metals futures exchange, in 1975-76 and again in 1981-82.
        Mr. Johnston is survived by his son, Peter, of Brooklyn.
