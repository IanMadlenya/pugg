        Robert G. Bernreuter, a psychologist and university administrator who designed an early personality test and helped create one of the first laws in the nation to require psychological testing in public schools, died on Thursday at Centre Community Hospital in State College, Pa. He was 93 and lived in State College.
        Dr. Bernreuter worked at Pennsylvania State University from 1931 to 1966 as a teacher and an administrator.
        As his Ph.D. thesis for Stanford University in 1931, he published the Bernreuter Personality Inventory, before other tests like the widely used Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory were designed. Dr. Frank J. Landy, professor emeritus in psychology at Penn State, said the test was one of the first scientific measurements of personality. It was used widely by employers to screen job seekers.
        Dr. Bernreuter was born in 1901 in Tampico, Ill., and graduated from the College of the Pacific in 1924 before going to graduate school at Stanford. He went to Penn State to establish a psychoeducational clinic.
        In 1936, he took a leave of absence from the university to serve as chief of the Division of Special Education in the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction.
        At Penn State, Dr. Bernreuter organized the university's Division of Counseling and became its director in 1956. He became dean of admissions in 1958 and and vice president for student affairs in 1964.
        He is survived by his wife, Shirley; a daughter, Jane Bernreuter Zietlow of Burnsville, N.C.; four grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
