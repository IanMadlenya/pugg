        Joseph Ciampi, a builder and chief executive of the Ciampi Organization, a development company in Flushing, Queens, died on Thursday at St. Johns Hospital in Smithtown, L.I. He was 88 years old and lived in Malba, Queens.
        He died of heart failure, said his daughter-in-law, Donna Ciampi of Whitestone, Queens.
        Mr. Ciampi was born in Italy and came to the United States in 1920. The following year he started his own construction company, the Astoria Roof and Shingle Company, and built small apartment houses. In the 1930's he founded the Ciampi Organization and built residential and commercial buildings, including the Whitepoint Shopping Mall in College Point, Queens, and Tower Square Mall in Woodside, Queens. He became semi-retired in 1985 but remained as chairman and chief executive officer of the organization. In 1989, he was honored with the "Patriarch of Progress" award by the Booth Memorial Medical Center for his achievements.
        He is survived by his wife, Clara; four sons, Dominick, Joseph and Benjamin, all of Manhassett, L.I., and Douglas, of Whitestone; a daughter, Nancy Cambria of Todt Hill, S.I., 16 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
        Correction:  February 26, 1991, Tuesday
        An obituary on Saturday about a builder who headed a developmentcompany in Flushing, Queens, rendered his name and that of his organization incorrectly. He was Joseph Ciampa; he headed the Ciampa Organization.
