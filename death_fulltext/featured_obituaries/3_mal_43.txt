        Enrico Caruso Jr., an actor, singer and the last surviving son of the great tenor, died after suffering a heart attack Thursday at his home in Jacksonville, Fla. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Caruso was born on Sept. 7, 1904. His mother was the soprano Ada Giachetti. Several years after his father's death in 1921, Mr. Caruso moved to Hollywood, where he starred in two Spanish-language motion pictures, ''The Fortune Teller'' (1934) and ''The Singer of Naples'' (1935).
        Like his father, he was a tenor. In the late 1930's, he sang regular concerts in California, and made a concert tour of Cuba. After World War II, he gave up singing permanently and, under the name of Henry De Costa, worked as a department head for the import-export firm of Dunnington & Arnold until 1971. At the time of his death, he had just completed a book of memoirs, entitled ''Enrico Caruso, My Father and My Family,'' with Andrew Farkas.
        He is survived by his wife, Harriett Covington Caruso, of Jacksonville; two sons, Enrico Cesare, of Sacrofonto, Italy, and Wladimiro, of Milan; a half-sister, Gloria Murray of Florida; two grandchildren, and one great-grandson.
