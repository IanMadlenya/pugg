        James J. Norwood, the general secretary-treasurer of the Laborers' International Union of North America, died on Monday at St. Louis University Hospital. He was 63 and lived in St. Louis.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, a union spokesman said.
        Mr. Norwood, who took over the second-highest position of the 700,000-member union in February 1993, had specialized in negotiating and administering agreements with the construction industry.
        He is survived by his wife, Pauline, and a son, James J. Jr., both of St. Louis; a daughter, Madonna N. Raddie of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.
