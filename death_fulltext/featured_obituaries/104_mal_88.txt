        Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, who presided over the Western Wall of the ruined Second Temple in East Jerusalem -- Judaism's holiest site -- died on Sept. 17 in Jerusalem. He was 71 and lived in East Jerusalem.
        He died of a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
        After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in which Israeli forces captured East Jerusalem, Rabbi Getz was named the overseer of prayers at the wall. It is a remnant of Herod's temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70. In subsequent years Rabbi Getz accompanied various prominent visitors at the wall, including John Cardinal O'Connor, the Archbishop of New York, in 1987. The cardinal said to him, "Bless me," and the rabbi replied, "Let us bless each other."
        Rabbi Getz was born in Tunisia to a rabbinical family. In a 1980 interview, he said, "We lived hoping to return to our land after thousands of years." He moved to Israel in 1948, became a career Army officer and was a major in the artillery at the time of the 1967 war, in which his 19-year-old son, Avner, died. That personal tragedy led him to give up the military and move to Jerusalem. His rabbinical career followed.
        Another son died in the uprising by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza that lasted from 1987 to 1993.
        The rabbi is survived by his wife and six other children.
