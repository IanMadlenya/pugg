        Ichiro Isoda, once one of Japan's most powerful bankers, died yesterday at a hospital in Osaka. He was 80.
        News reports said he had had a heart ailment.
        Mr. Isoda resigned three years ago as chairman of the Sumitomo Bank after it became embroiled in a financial scandal that shook the Japanese business world. He accepted responsibility for the scandal at his bank in Osaka, then the third largest in Japan and one of the world's largest.
        He acted after a subordinate was arrested on charges that he had taken almost $750,000 for arranging $170 million in improper loans to a corporate raider. The recipient of the loans, Matsuhiro Kotani, was indicted for stock manipulation in a tangled web of deals involving other financial groups.
        Mr. Isoda joined the bank in 1935 and in his 55 years at Sumitomo guided it to enormous profitability and a leadership position in Japan's business community.
        Mr. Isoda, who was nicknamed emperor because of his influence on Sumitomo's management, became president of the bank in 1977 and chairman in 1983.
