        Dr. Leslie L. Balassa, a scientist and inventor whose 100 patents included painkillers for arthritis and tooth extraction, died Thursday at Pomona Valley Hospital in Pomona, Calif. He was 88 years old.
        A longtime resident of Blooming Grove, N.Y., in Orange County, he had moved to Claremont, Calif., this year. His family said he died of pneumonia just after returning from a Washington trade fair on recycled paper.
        A chemist and metallurgist, Dr. Balassa developed a treatment for promoting healing and stopping the excruciating pain that plagues about 1 in 10 people who have molars extracted. He received his patent in 1973, when he was president of Lescarden Ltd., a pharmaceutical research and development company in Goshen, N.Y.
        In 1976 he patented an arthritis treatment aimed at long-term remission of pain, allowing patients to recover free movement of their joints. Another patent covered micro-encapsulation, a process used by makers of time-release medications, among other applications.
        Born in Hungary, he received a doctorate in chemistry at the University of Vienna in 1926.
        He worked as a metallurgist in Mexico before joining E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, where he remained as a research chemist for 14 years until 1944. After that he founded and headed a number of companies to manufacture and market his inventions.
        Dr. Balassa is survived by his wife of nearly 60 years, the former Alice M. Hussey; a son, John Paul of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
