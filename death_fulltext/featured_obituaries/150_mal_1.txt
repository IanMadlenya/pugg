        James Bernard Boskey, a children's rights advocate and an expert on alternatives to the courts for resolving disputes, died on June 14 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. He was 57 and lived in North Caldwell, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Seton Hall University. Mr. Boskey was a professor of family law at Seton Hall's Newark law campus.
        His skill in settling disputes out of court, like mediating divorce cases, led him to create The Alternative Newsletter, a dispute resolution guide for lawyers and mediators that is now in its 10th year of publication.
        He also wrote extensively on workers' compensation and the rights of children and the elderly.
        He edited the ''Manual on Child Abuse and Neglect,'' published by the New Jersey State Bar Association in 1980. He was a founder of the association's Children's Rights Committee and he helped shape state legislation intended to protect the children of New Jersey.
        Mr. Boskey was born in Alexandria, La.. He graduated in 1964 from Princeton University, where he studied sociology and anthropology. He received law degrees from the University of Michigan in 1967 and the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1972.
        He joined the Seton Hall faculty as an assistant professor in 1971. He advanced to full professor in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife of 29 years, Adele Ludin Boskey, and their daughter, Elizabeth Boskey of Baltimore.
