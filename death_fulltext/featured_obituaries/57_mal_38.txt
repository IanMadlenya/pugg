        Hamilton Gates Ford, a former executive vice president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, a group that represents building owners in labor negotiations, died on Sunday at the Courtland Gardens Health Facility in Stamford, Conn. He was 78 years old and lived in Riverside, Conn.
        He died of heart failure after an extended illness, his son Jonathan said.
        He graduated from Lehigh University in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He was hired by the Charles F. Noyes Company, a real-estate management concern, and worked up to an executive position with the Findlay-Noyes Company, the former Noyes insurance affiliate.
        During World War II, he was a lieutenant in the Navy. After returning to Noyes, he rose to executive vice president for management operations.
        In 1971, he was appointed executive vice president of the Realty Advisory Board, from which he retired in 1985.
        He was president of the Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound, a judge for the United States Yacht Racing Union, a member of the New York Yacht Club and a former commodore of the Riverside Yacht Club.
        His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1987.
        Besides his son Jonathan, of Riverside, he is survived by another son, Carter, of Newport Beach, Calif.; a brother, Stanley, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and five grandchildren.
