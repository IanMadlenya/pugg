        John D. Voelker, the Michigan jurist who wrote "Anatomy of a Murder" and other books under the name Robert Traver, died today. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Voelker was driving his car near his home here when he suffered a heart attack, state police in Negaunee said.
        Mr. Voelker, who was born in Ishpeming on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan on June 29, 1903, was a retired justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. His 11 books consisted mainly of courtroom drama and fishing yarns.
        Mr. Voelker was the Marquette County prosecutor from 1935 to 1950 and served on the Michigan Supreme Court from 1957 to 1960.
        "Anatomy of a Murder," which was made into a movie filmed on the Upper Peninsula, was based on a 1952 murder at the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay. Mr. Voelker was the defense lawyer in the real-life case. The 1959 film starred James Stewart, Lee Remick, Ben Gazzara and George C. Scott.
        In a 1989 interview, Mr. Voelker said: "Spinning yarns is a protection against the nuttiness . . . the greed, the hate all around us. I'm a fisherman who likes to observe and tell yarns, and so I told stories about things that I knew about."
        He is survived by his wife, Grace, and three daughters.
