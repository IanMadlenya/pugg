        Hjalmar P. Hvam, a top United States skier in the 1930's and inventor of the  ski safety binding, died of a heart attack on March 30. He was 93.
        Hvam was the first winner in 1936 of the Golden Rose race at Mount Hood, Ore., the nation's oldest ski race, which he won again the following year. He qualified for the United States Olympic team in 1936 but declined to compete in  Hitler's Germany. He coached the 1952 Olympic team and operated a ski shop until his retirement in 1962.
        While hospitalized for a skiing accident, Hvam drafted a design for the first self-release ski binding. Called Saf-Ski, it was used by ski troops in World War II and as a ski-rental binding.
        Hvam, a member of the United States Ski Hall of Fame, came to Oregon from Norway in 1927.
