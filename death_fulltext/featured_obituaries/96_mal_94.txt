        William Dillard, a jazz trumpeter from the swing era who also acted on Broadway, died on Monday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 and lived in Queens.
        The cause was complications from lupus and pneumonia, said his wife, Celestine.
        Mr. Dillard was born in Philadelphia and began playing the trumpet when he was 12. He played in many of the great swing bands of the 1930's and 40's, under Jelly Roll Morton, Benny Carter, Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, Lucky Millinder and others. He was a mentor to Dizzy Gillespie and other young musicians who went on to stardom.
        He made his theater debut in "Carmen Jones" and sang in several other Broadway productions, including "Regina," "Beggars Holiday," "A Temporary Island" and "Lost in the Stars." He also appeared on television as Joe the bartender in the soap opera "Love of Life," and as the King of Babylon in "Green Pastures."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, William Jr., Pierre and Vincent; a daughter, Zoe, and many grandchildren.
