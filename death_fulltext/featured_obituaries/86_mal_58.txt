        Maj. Gen. Walter Morland Hutton, a Briton who was Chief of Staff of Jordan's Arab Legion in the 1950's until he was dismissed by King Hussein, died on March 5. He was 81 and had moved to Cornwall, in southwestern England, after living in retirement in Spain.
        General Hutton was an Arabist and a highly decorated veteran of World War II.He was Chief of Staff of the Arab Legion, as the Jordanian army was then known in English, from 1953 to 1956, when he was dismissed along with the force's British commander, Lieut.
        Gen. Sir John Bagot Glubb, who was known as Glubb Pasha.
        Various reasons have been given for Glubb Pasha's sacking, which caused an international furor. A British journalist, Peter Snow, wrote in his 1972 book "Hussein: a Biography" that it was "essentially a political decision" that gained the King "popularity and prestige in the Arab world and, equally important, in his own army."
        "It outflanked the nationalists," the book went on to say, "who had contended that King Hussein was the servant of Britain."
        General Hutton went on to become a deputy commander of British forces on the Arabian Peninsula, based in Aden, from 1957 to 1959. He also held staff and teaching posts before retiring from the British army in 1966.
        A native of Wiltshire and an alumnus of Sandhurst, he is survived by his wife, Stella, two sons and a daughter.
