        Leo Paquin, one of the nine Seven Blocks of Granite who made Fordham's front line into a formidable football force in 1936 and 1937, died yesterday at his home in Rutherford, N.J. He was 83 years old.
        His wife, Elsie, who could give no cause of death, said her husband died in his sleep.
        Although Fordham's publicist, Tim Cohane, first applied the name to the Rams' lines of 1929 and 1930, it was the legendary second edition, under Coach Jim Crowley, one of the Four Horsemen of Notre Dame, that made the Seven Blocks of Granite a household name.
        Like his roommate, Vince Lombardi, Mr. Paquin, a native of Brockton, Mass., played only the first of the two Granite seasons, as a senior in 1936, when Fordham had a 5-1-2 record, including a famous scoreless tie with Pittsburgh, and outscored its opponents, 128-33. Invitation From Giants
        A left end of such grace that he was given the nickname Twinkletoes, Mr. Paquin was invited to join the New York Giants, perhaps on the recommendation of another classmate, Wellington Mara, whose family owned the Giants.
        Instead, he accepted a position at Xavier High School in Manhattan, where he spent more than 40 years as football coach, as athletic director, and as a Latin and English teacher who would annually startle his awed freshman classes by telling them that his parents and professors had been far less impressed by his football glory than by the fact that he made the dean's list for four years. Even on a Monday after a big Saturday victory, he would tell his students, his professors cared only about his academic preparation.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Paquin is survived by a son, Leo, of Lake Tahoe, Nev.; two daughters, Noreen A. Then of Sparta, N.J., and Anne E. Kane of Wilmington, N.C.; six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
