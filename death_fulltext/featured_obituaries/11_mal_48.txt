        Jeffrey Richards Associates, his employer, said the cause of death was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
        Mr. Willard began his career in the theater as general manager of the Kennebunkport (Me.) Playhouse, a venerable outpost of the straw hat circuit. From 1961-1967, he was general manager of the New York-based Institute for Advanced Studies in Theatrical Arts, and he later worked with the producers Mary W. John, who also was his longtime partner, and Cheryl Crawford. He was a press representative with the New York concerns of Arthur Cantor Inc., Joe Wolhandler Associates and, from 1980 until his death, with Jeffrey Richards Associates.
        Mr. Willard is survived by four sisters: Katherine Propp of Loveland, Colo.; Elizabeth Mae Lewis of Golden, Colo.; Janet Royce of Little Rock, Ark., and June Willard of San Francisco.
