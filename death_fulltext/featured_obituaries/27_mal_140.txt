        Thomas McPherson Brown, author of a disputed theory on the treatment and cause of rheumatoid arthritis, died Monday at the National Hospital in Arlington, Va., after a long illness. He was 82 years old.
        Dr. Brown was on the faculty of the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington for 22 years before founding the Arthritis Institute at the National Hospital in 1970.
        Dr. Brown was best known for his promotion of antibiotic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a disease that he believed was caused by a type of bacteria.
        However, Connie Raab, a spokesman at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease, one of the National Institutes of Health, said, ''Most experts by far agree that it hasn't been proven that antibiotics are an effective treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.''
