        Earl Banks, who turned Morgan State University into a small-college football power during his 13 years as coach in the 1960's and 1970's, died yesterday after his car struck a brick wall, according to the police in Baltimore. He was 69.
        A Morgan State spokesman said that Mr. Banks, who served as athletic director from 1970 to 1983, was returning home from his job as manager of a local lounge when he suffered a heart attack and lost control of his car.
        Mr. Banks, who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame last December, took over as Morgan State coach in 1960 and remained at the Baltimore school until 1973. His teams posted a record of 94-30-2 and had 13 straight winning records. Among the players he coached were such future pros as Willie Lanier, Leroy Kelly, Raymond Chester, Frenchy Fuqua and Mark Washington.
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Banks was an all-Big Ten guard at the University of Iowa. After his attempt at a pro career was cut short by a knee injury, he was hired as head line coach at Maryland State, now Maryland-Eastern Shore, and coached there until joining Morgan State.
        His survivors include his wife, Effie; two sons, Ray and Bobby, and several grandchildren.
