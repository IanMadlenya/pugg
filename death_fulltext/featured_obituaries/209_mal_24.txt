        John R. T. Davies, an audio engineer known for his expertise in improving the sound of reissued vintage jazz recordings, died on May 25 at his home in Burnham, Buckinghamshire, England. He was 77.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Susan, said.
        Using a variety of techniques, many that he developed himself, Mr. Davies painstakingly chipped away at the clicks, pops and scratches on 78 r.p.m. records by Louis Armstrong, Fats Waller, Bessie Smith and other jazz legends in a quest to make them sound as close as possible to what the musicians themselves had intended.
        In his diligence for doing justice to the recordings he remastered, Mr. Davies also strove to correct pitch problems caused by the often flawed recording equipment used in the 1920's and 30's. Because he took so much time to restore a record's sound, he did most of his work for small specialty labels, primarily in Britain, Canada and the Netherlands, rather than for the more cost-conscious major labels.
        A self-taught musician, Mr. Davies played trombone, saxophone and several other instruments in traditional-jazz bands. He achieved a measure of fame in the early 60's with one of those bands, the Temperance Seven, whose records -- produced by George Martin, who later worked with the Beatles -- often reached the British pop charts.
        His career as an engineer grew out of his love of early jazz, which also led to his avid record collecting. With the advent of compact discs, he adapted his techniques to the new standards of the digital age.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Joanna; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
