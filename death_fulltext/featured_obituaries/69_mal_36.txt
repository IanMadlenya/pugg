        Bert Ottley, a former manager of the Joyce Theater, died on Oct. 1 at the New York University Medical Center. He was 46 years old and lived in East Orange, N.J.
        He died of AIDS, said a friend, Terence Womble.
        Mr. Ottley was well known to dancegoers as a stern but warm presence in the Joyce's lobby. He joined the theater in 1984 after managing Newark Symphony Hall and the Delacorte Theater. Mr. Ottley was also a singer, church choral conductor and music teacher.
        He is survived by his companion, Clifford Hicks, of East Orange, and his grandmother, Doris Ince of St. Albans, Queens.
