        Joseph T. Sternaman, the first quarterback of the Chicago Bears, died last Thursday at the age of 88.
        His brother, Edward (Dutch) Sternaman, was a halfback and co-owner of the fledgling National Football League team with George Halas. In 1922, during the Bears' first season, the brothers accounted for 73 of the team's 123 points.
        At 135 pounds, Mr. Sternaman also served as a runner, drop-kicker and blocker. He called plays featuring Red Grange, one of the first famous stars of the league.
