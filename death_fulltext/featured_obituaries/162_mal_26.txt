        Ray Scherer, a former White House correspondent for NBC News who covered six presidents, from Harry S. Truman to Gerald R. Ford, before becoming an executive for the RCA Corporation, died on July 1 at his home in Washington. He was 81.
        Mr. Scherer's career in broadcast journalism began in the infancy of television, when technical limitations meant interviews that could be no longer than two minutes. In 1956, he was among the first journalists to broadcast live from the floor of presidential nominating conventions. He was also one of the first to report live from the White House and to have a live nationally telecast midday news program.
        Mr. Scherer was born on June 7, 1919, in Fort Wayne, Ind. His father was the business manager of The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette, for which the younger Scherer delivered newspapers when he was a teenager.
        He graduated from Valparaiso University in Indiana and served in the Navy in World War II. He earned a master's degree in international relations from the University of Chicago and became a feature writer at The Journal-Gazette. He became a staff news writer at NBC in 1947 and soon became an on-air reporter.
        At 6 foot 4 and 200 pounds, he had an on-screen presence that radiated authority in the early days of television news broadcasts. He once calculated that he had logged 250,000 miles on various assignments in his 28 years as a reporter.
        In addition to covering the White House, Mr. Scherer reported on the Pentagon, Congress and, for four years beginning in 1969, Europe. He retired from journalism in 1975 and became a vice president with RCA, at the time the parent company of NBC. He retired from that position in 1986.
        Mr. Scherer is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Barbara Hetzner; a daughter, Nancy, of St. Paul; a son, David, of Washington; and two grandsons.
