        Donald R. Lynn, a photographer and fashion model, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 54.
        The cause of death was AIDS, said his companion, David Heeley.
        Mr. Lynn was a catalogue model in New York in the 1960's, then turned to photography, specializing in covers for record albums. In the early 1980's he produced interview shows for public access television.
        Mr. Lynn is survived by a daughter, Valerie Garret of Toledo; two brothers, Bill of Urbana, Ohio, and Joe of Rio Linda, Calif., and a sister, Ruth Lynn of Ypsilanti, Mich.
