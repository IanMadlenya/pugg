        Timothy Mawson, who combined passions for literature and horticulture in an influential gardening bookstore in New Preston, Conn., died on Monday at his home in nearby Washington Depot. He was 54.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Gael Hammer.
        Timothy Mawson Books and Prints opened in 1984 in a converted 19th-century cider mill. Studiedly cluttered with potpourri, sachets, a harvest table and a wheelbarrow, the store specialized in out-of-print and antique books, particularly those about English gardens. It closed in March.
        Mr. Mawson was also the author of "The Garden Room" (Clarkson N. Potter, 1994), a book devoted to porches, greenhouses and gazebos.
        "He did a lot to popularize and promote the connection between literature and gardening," said Gregory Long, president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. "Now, rare books about horticulture are very fashionable, trendy and sought-after."
        Mr. Mawson was born in Nelson, a town in Lancashire, England. He arrived in New York City in 1969 and worked at the Regency and Algonquin Hotels. In 1975, he joined Carlos R. Goez as a partner in the Pomander Bookshop, at 252 West 95th Street in Manhattan, which sold secondhand books to a distinctly literary clientele.
        Besides his companion, Mr. Mawson is survived by Mr. Hammer's daughters, whom he helped rear, Katherine, of Austin, Tex., and Evelyn, of Washington Depot.
