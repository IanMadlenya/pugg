        Judge Hunter was a lawyer in Camden, N.J., before President Richard M. Nixon appointed him to the Philadelphia-based court.
        Among the rulings he supported were a decision blocking enforcement of an anti-abortion law until its constitutionality had been determined and one upholding the approval of a Delaware River pumping station.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Jane Thierolf; three daughters, Jane Avis Wickes of Arlington, Mass., Judith Ann Hunter of Newtown, Conn., and Janet Margaret Hunter of Mill Valley, Calif., and a granddaughter.
