        She was born Suzanne Storrs Poulton in Provo, Utah, and studied speech and communication at the University of Utah.
        She turned to community work 27 years ago, helping to develop methods of improving child care and encouraging self-help among the disadvantaged.
        Mrs. Pincus was on the boards of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the American Place Theater in Manhattan.
        She is survived by her husband, Lionel I. Pincus, chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a venture banking firm; two sons, Henry A. and Matthew S., both of Manhattan; and three brothers, Brent Poulton, of Medford, Ore., Kent Poulton, of San Francisco, and Michael Poulton, of Lausanne, Switzerland.
