        Tom Pettit, an award-winning television reporter who was the only broadcaster on the scene and on the air when Lee Harvey Oswald was killed in Dallas, died on Friday at Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 64 and lived in Hamilton, Bermuda.
        A spokesman for NBC News said the cause was complications after surgery to repair a ruptured aorta.
        Mr. Pettit, who retired from NBC News earlier this year, wonthree Emmys, a Peabody Award and the Polk Memorial Award during a career that stretched from the Eisenhower era to the Clinton Administration.
        But his most famous report came from outside the Dallas City Jail in 1963, where he was the only reporter providing live coverage as police led John F. Kennedy's assassin out for transfer to the county jail, and he was shot dead by  Jack Ruby.
        In 1988, on the 25th anniversary of the assassination, Mr. Petit recalled standing just six feet away and watching as Ruby opened fire. "It was the only time I've really experienced doing eyewitness reporting while you're live on the air," he said.
        Mr. Pettit, a native of Cincinnati, began his broadcasting career in 1953 as  a reporter for WOI-TV in Ames, Iowa. After stops in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and Minneapolis, he joined the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia. He eventually held an  assortment of posts at NBC, working as a correspondent in Los Angeles, Washington, New York and London, and was executive vice president of NBC News between March 1982 and October 1985.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and four children from a previous marriage, Debra Pettit of Washington, Anne Pettit of Agoura, Calif., James Pettit of Philadelphia and Robert Pettit of Manhattan Beach, Calif.
