        Martin Blumenson, a military historian who wrote extensively about American commanders and campaigns in World War II, died last Friday at his home in Washington. He was 86.
        He died after a brief illness, said his son, John J-G. Blumenson.
        Mr. Blumenson wrote biographies of Gens. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Mark W. Clark and most notably of George S. Patton, whose papers he mined exhaustively. He wrote of battles on which turned the fortunes of war. From 1959 to 2001, he published 19 books, 10 of which remain in print.
        He served as an officer attached to the Army's historical branch and taught at war colleges and military schools, including the Citadel, where he was the Mark Clark professor in the 1970's. More recently he lectured at the National War College and at George Washington University.
        Mr. Blumenson furnished an official account of the Normandy landing in ''Breakout and Pursuit'' (1962), his segment in a narrative of United States Army operations in World War II, issued under the aegis of the Army's chief of military history.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Blumenson was raised in Bernardsville, N.J., and graduated from Bucknell University in 1939. He received master's degrees from Bucknell in 1940 and Harvard in 1942, when he entered military service and was assigned to the historical branch in the War Office.
        He accompanied General Patton's Third Army as well as the Seventh Army in Europe. Then, as a historian attached to the Army's European command, he was based in Paris, where he played jazz piano when he was off duty. He next taught French and history at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, N.Y., and at Hofstra College before being recalled to active duty during the Korean War, and rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
        He was a civilian historian at the Pentagon from 1957 to 1967 and an adviser to the President's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders. Over the years he also taught at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I.; the Army War College in Carlisle, Pa.; George Washington University; and Bucknell.
        His two volumes of ''The Patton Papers,'' covering the years 1885 to 1940 and 1940 to 1945, were published by Houghton in 1972 and 1974. He later added two volumes of ''Patton: The Man Behind the Legend, 1885-1945'' (Morrow, 1985), which was praised as the fullest portrait of the general yet.
        Other books still in print by Mr. Blumenson include ''Duel for France'' (1940), ''Anzio: The Gamble That Failed'' (1963), ''Kasserine Pass'' (1967) -- also called ''Rommel's Last Victory'' in its British edition, ''Salerno to Cassino'' (1969), and ''Masters of the Art of Command'' (1975), written with James L. Stokesbury.
        Mr. Blumenson's wife of 54 years, Genevieve Aldebert Blumenson died in 2000. His son lives in Toronto.
        ''Everyone has his own Patton story,'' Mr. Blumenson told The New York Times in 1985 upon publication of his biography of the general. ''In 'The Patton Papers,' I wanted Patton to speak for himself. 'Patton' is my book.''
        His last book, ''Heroes Never Die: Warriors and Warfare in World War II,'' which came out in 2001, is a collection of articles published over four decades.
