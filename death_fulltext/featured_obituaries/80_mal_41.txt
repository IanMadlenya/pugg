        Richard L. Berman, president of Moseley Associates, publishing consultants, died on Sept. 5. He was 64.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Berman, who lived in White Plains, was an expert in film and television production and spent 10 years with NBC in a variety of assignments. He had also been associated with Graflex, Screen Gems and Solocast, where he was one of the owners.
        In 1969 he joined Harper & Row, where he became vice president for planning and development.
        After the company was acquired in 1987 by the News Corporation, Mr. Berman joined Moseley Associates, management consultants to the publishing industry. In March he was elected president and chief executive officer.
        He was chairman of the Jewish Child Care Association in White Plains.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Constance Kaufmann; two sons, Anthony of Nyack, N.Y., and Donald of Cambridge, Mass.; two daughters, Patricia of Corvallis, Ore., and Anne of Newport, R.I., and six grandchildren.
        Correction:  October 1, 1993, Friday
        An obituary on Sept. 11 about Richard L. Berman, who died on Sept. 5, misstated when he became president of Moseley Associates, publishing consultants. It was in March 1990, not last March.
