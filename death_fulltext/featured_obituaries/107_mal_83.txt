        Samuel D. Ratcliffe, an Emmy-winning scriptwriter, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 50.
        The cause was AIDS, said David Ziff, a friend.
        Mr. Ratcliffe won the Emmy in 1991 for his work as head writer for the NBC series "Santa Barbara." He also served as chief writer for NBC's "Texas" and "Another World."
        A native of Winter Haven, Fla., he grew up in Birmingham, Ala., and graduated from Birmingham-Southern College, where he majored in music and in German. After moving to New York City, he pursued a career in the theater. One of his roles was Matt in "The Fantasticks."
        He later began to write for daytime television. His credits at NBC included "Days of Our Lives." He also wrote for CBS's "Capitol" and "Guiding Light" and ABC's "Loving."
        He is survived by his companion, Jeffrey Hayenga; his parents, Jennings and Marguerite Ratcliffe of New Orleans, and three sisters, Sandra, of Manhattan, Rebecca, of Atlanta, and Karen Daigle of New Orleans.
