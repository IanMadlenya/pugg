        Sidney W. Roos, a leading member of the New York real-estate industry for more than 60 years and a prominent Jewish philanthropist, died on Thursday at his home in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 94.
        His family said he died of natural causes.
        In the 1950's Mr. Roos was president of the New York Federation of Reform Synagogues and a board member of United American Hebrew Congregations. He also served as chairman of the real-estate division of the United Jewish Appeal and as vice chairman of the real-estate, builders and management division of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies.
        Mr. Roos was also a founding member and second president of the Central Synagogue of Nassau County in Rockville Centre.
        When he retired in 1962 as president of Federation of Reform Synagogues, he proposed a program to improve the moral climate of New York City to curb what he said was a growing sense of dishonesty and corruption.
        Mr. Roos was born in Scranton, Pa., and moved to New York City in 1916. He joined Williams & Company, a real-estate firm, in 1929 and became a co-owner in 1935. Today the firm manages nearly 20 million square feet of commercial real estate in Manhattan.
        Mr. Roos's wife, Alma, died in 1983. He is survived by his companion, Gertrude Kahn; a son, Edwin, of Manhattan; a daughter, Joan R. Cohn, of Baldwin, L.I.; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
