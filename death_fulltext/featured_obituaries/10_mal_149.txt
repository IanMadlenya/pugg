        George W. Korngold, a record producer and son of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, the Austrian composer, died of cancer Wednesday night at his Los Angeles home. He was 58 years old.
        Mr. Korngold was the producer in the 1970's of the 14-volume ''Classic Film Scores Series'' for RCA Records. More recently he produced a series of recordings of his father's works that included several symphonies, the operas ''Die Tote Stadt'' and ''Violanta,'' and the complete scores of several films, including ''Kings Row'' and ''The Sea Hawk.''
        Born in Vienna in 1928, Mr. Korngold attended the Vienna Academy of Music before immigrating to the United States with his parents in 1934.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gloria Kay; two sons, Gary and Leslie, both of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and a brother, Ernst, of Los Angeles.
