        Robert F. P. Amendola, a sculptor and former teacher who spent much of his life in the service of the blind, died on Jan. 4 at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. He was 86 and lived in Hopkinton, Mass., where he also had a studio.
        Mr. Amendola (pronounced ah-MEN-doe-lah) became associated with the Carroll Center for the Blind in Newton, Mass., in 1954. He developed a course he called  "Videation and Spatial Orientation," using his techniques as a sculptor to help  the blind get a surer feeling of spatial relationships.
        Over the years, he exhibited his work at Boston College, Yale University and the Carver National Monument in Diamond, Mo. He also taught sculpture and architecture at the School of Fine Arts in Worcester, Mass., Emmanuel College in Boston, Boston College and Notre Dame University.
        His best-known works include "Our Lady of Good Counsel," at the Boston College Bapst Library; "Stations of the Ways of the Cross," in St. Thomas More Chapel at Yale, and a bronze of the young George Washington Carver at the Carver monument. He also created a series of 270 sculptured cast-aluminum pieces depicting state flowers and birds, a project he undertook with his wife, Geraldine Lewis Amendola, for the ocean liner United States. Mrs. Amendola died  last year.
        Mr. Amendola was born in Boston, and graduated from the Yale University School of Fine Arts in 1933. In World War II he was a member of a team of artists and engineers that designed the Navy's Corsair fighter plane. Immediately after that he became an instructor in spatial relationships and mental mapping at the Army Rehabilitation Program for Blinded Veterans in Avon,  Conn.
        He is survived by a son, Charles, of Duluth, Ga.; four daughters, Judith, of  Cambridge, Mass.; Caroline, of Kailua, Hawaii; Susan, of Hopkinton, and Miriam,  of Plymouth, Mass.; a sister, Helen, of Natick, and six grandchildren.
