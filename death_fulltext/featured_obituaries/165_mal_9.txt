        Nick Fatool, a swing-era drummer who played with many of the most popular big bands in the 1940's and 50's, died on Sept. 26 in Los Angeles. He was 85 and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Fatool may be best known for his participation in the Benny Goodman Sextet sessions of the late 1930's and early 40's, which included the guitarist Charlie Christian and produced songs like ''Rose Room'' and ''Seven Come Eleven.''
        He also played in Goodman's band in the famous ''Spirituals to Swing'' concert in 1939.
        In his early career he exemplified the rhythms of the later swing era: crisp accompaniment on the high-hat and a steady, driving four-beat pattern on the bass drum.
        Born in Millbury, Mass., Mr. Fatool began his career in Providence, R.I., and after moving between cities in the mid-30's came to Cleveland to join Benny Goodman, replacing Lionel Hampton in the rhythm section.
        After leaving Goodman in the early 40's, he toured and recorded with Artie Shaw, Claude Thornhill and Alvino Rey, among others.
        Relocating in Los Angeles in 1943, he became a studio musician, backing up performers who included Harry James, Louis Armstrong and Jess Stacy.
        He can also be heard on film soundtracks, including ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).
        Mr. Fatool played sporadically in Los Angeles through the early 1980's and ran a music store there.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, David; a brother, Ernest; and a grandson.
