        John J. Muccio, the first United States Ambassador to South Korea, died of heart failure on Friday in Washington. He was 89 years old and lived in the capital.
        Mr. Muccio, a career diplomat who served in Seoul at the outbreak of the Korean War, was appointed Ambassador to South Korea in 1949 after having served briefly as the special representative of President Truman to the newly formed republic. He previously held several diplomatic posts in Germany, the Far East and South and Central America.
        As Ambassador in South Korea, Mr. Muccio in January 1950 negotiated its first agreement on American military aid, worth $10 million. Early that June, testifying to Congress, he warned of the imminent menace posed by Communist forces poised above the 38th parallel, and urged increased aid to Seoul.
        On June 25, Mr. Muccio telephoned Washington with an announcement that North Korean and allied Communist forces had begun ''an all-out offensive against the Republic of Korea.''
        That evening, he directed the evacuation of women and children from the embassy. He later acompanied the South Korean Government as it relocated to Taegu and then Pusan.
        He received two commendations for his service in Korea. One of them, the Medal of Merit, cited his ''valor and courageous devotion to duty and superlative diplomatic skill.''
        Mr. Muccio retired from the Foreign Service in 1961 with the highest diplomatic rank, that of career minister.
        He is survived by his wife, Sheila McCulloch; two sons, John Patrick and Colum Anthony, both of Washington; two daughters, Moira Elizabeth, of Washington and Sheila Philomena of San Francisco, and a brother, Mark DiMuccio of North Providence, R.I.
