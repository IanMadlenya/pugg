        William Mann, the chief music critic for The Times of London from 1960 to 1982, died last Tuesday after surgery in a hospital in Bath, England. He was 65 years old, and had been suffering from several health problems relating to the throat and chest, including cancer.
        Mr. Mann was born in India. He graduated from Cambridge University and joined the staff of The Times in 1948.
        A specialist in German opera, he wrote numerous program and record notes and reviews. He also prepared ''reading translations'' of Wagner's operas, as well as books on the operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, and was active as a radio and television reviewer. But it was through his clear and direct journalistic prose style and his association with The Times that he was best known to the British public.
        Despite his interest in the operatic tradition, Mr. Mann was open to new music - he was twice chairman of the Society for the Promotion of New Music - and in the early 1960's he created a stir in classical-music circles by proclaiming the Beatles the greatest songwriters since Schubert.
        He is survived by his wife, Eri, and four daughters.
