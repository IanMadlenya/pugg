        Edward K. Thompson, a former editor of Life magazine and the founding editor of Smithsonian magazine, died on Monday at Northern Westchester Hospital Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. He was 89 and had lived in a nursing home in Somers, N.Y., for the last three years.
        Mr. Thompson joined Life in 1937 as an associate editor and was its top editor when he retired in 1967. He was remembered yesterday by Philip B. Kunhardt Jr., who worked under him and was Life's managing editor from 1978 to 1981, as a ''feisty, hard-nosed, sentimental, intellectual in hick's clothing.''
        Mr. Thompson was sometimes immodest, but accurate. In his book ''A Love Affair with Life and Smithsonian'' (1995), he wrote: ''I didn't invent Life, but I had a lot to do with its development into a giant. And at age 60, I invented Smithsonian magazine, as founding editor and publisher.''
        John Loengard, a photographer who was Life's picture editor from 1973 to 1987, said yesterday that when Mr. Thompson took charge of Life as managing editor, ''the photographs in Life really blossomed, they got better, more inventive, more surprising.''
        Mr. Thompson held the title of editor of Life from 1961 to 1968 and was editor and publisher of Smithsonian from 1969 to 1981.
        He was born in Minneapolis, attended schools in St. Thomas, N.D., and received a bachelor's degree in 1927 from the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. He worked for newspapers, including The Milwaukee Journal, before joining Life.
        His marriage to Marguerite M. Maxam ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Lee Eitingon, of Somers, who was an editor at Life; two sons, Edward T., of Waccabuc, N.Y., a former editor in chief of Reader's Digest editions in the United States and elsewhere, and Colin R., of Rockville, Md.; six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
