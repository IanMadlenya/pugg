        Vaughn Shoemaker, an editorial cartoonist who created the character John Q. Public and won two Pulitzer Prizes, died Sunday at the Windsor Park Manor Medical Center in Carol Stream, Ill. He was 89 years old and lived in Carol Stream, a Chicago suburb.
        He died of cancer, said his physician, Dr. Maurice Birt.
        Mr. Shoemaker's most familiar character, John Q. Public, represented the beleaguered American taxpayer. The character appeared first in The Chicago Daily News, the paper on which Mr. Shoemaker began his career in 1922. In 1963 Mr. Shoemaker's cartoons were syndicated to more than 75 newspapers, and by the time he retired, in 1972, he had drawn 14,000 cartoons.
        He won his first Pulitzer in 1938 for a drawing, "The Road Back," which showed a World War I soldier marching backwards into war. The caption said, "You're going the wrong way." In 1947, he won his second Pulitzer, for a cartoon titled, "Still Racing His Shadow." In this cartoon a worker, marked "new wage demands," tried to outrun his shadow, "cost of living."
        Because Mr. Shoemaker was a devout Christian, he was known at The Chicago Daily News as a "gospel cartoonist." He once said he started each cartoon "on my knees with a prayer."
        He worked at the Daily News for 27 years and then moved to the New York Herald Tribune, the Chicago American and the American's successor, Chicago Today, where he retired.
        Mr. Shoemaker is survived by his wife, Evelyn, of Carol Stream; a son, Vaughn R. Jr. of Palatine, Ill.; five grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
