        The Rev. Blahoslav S. Hruby, a Presbyterian minister who headed a human-rights organization that monitors Eastern European countries, died on Monday at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his wife, Olga, said.
        At his death, Mr. Hruby was executive director of the Research Center for Religion and Human Rights in Closed Societies, which monitors Eastern European countries and helps persecuted Christians and Jews get visas to leave.
        In 1962 he and Dr. Paul B. Anderson founded a quarterly magazine, Religion in Communist Dominated Areas. He was also former director of Protestant programs to Czechoslovakia on Radio Free Europe and director of the American Fund for Czechoslovak Refugees. He was a former assistant pastor of the Jan Hus Czech Brethren Presbyterian Church in Manhattan.
        Mr. Hruby was born in Czechoslovakia and educated in Europe. He worked with the underground in Germany and France during Hitler's rise to power. He came to the United States in 1941 and joined the Office of Strategic Services. In World War II he served with Gen. George S. Patton's Third Army and later was a member of the United States Military Mission in Prague.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Suzanne, of Arlington, Va.; a sister, Mila Horak of Bayport, Minn., and a grandson.
