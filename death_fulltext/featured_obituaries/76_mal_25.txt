        Fitzhugh Dodson, a clinical psychologist who wrote about child-rearing, died Sunday at the Alamitos Belmont Rehabilitation Hospital in Long Beach, Calif. He was 69.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his family said.
        Dr. Dodson, who had a private practice in Redondo Beach, Calif., for more than 25 years, took what he considered an iconoclastic approach to child-rearing, advising parents against the permissiveness often attributed to Dr. Benjamin Spock. In Dr. Dodson's view, children want and need parental love to come with a degree of discipline. A lack of control makes for obnoxious children, he contended.
        His book "How to Parent" (Nash, 1970), remains in print in paperback, as do "How to Discipline With Love: From Crib to College" (Rawson, 1977), the illustrated "I Wish I Had a Computer That Makes Waffles: Teaching Your Child With Modern Nursery Rhymes" (Oak Tree, 1978) and "How to Father," edited by Jeanne Harris (Nash, 1974).
        Dr. Dodson was born in Baltimore and graduated cum laude from Johns Hopkins University and magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Yale University in 1948. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister the same year. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 1957.
        His survivors include three children, Robin Ellyn, Randall James and Rustin Fitzhugh.
