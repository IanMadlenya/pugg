        Anne Thompson MacDonald, the founder of Recording for the Blind, a nonprofit organization that has put more than 80,000 books on tapes for blind and learning-disabled students since 1948, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Huntington, L.I. She was 96 and had lived in Manhattan.
        She died in her sleep, said her daughter, Anne Thomas.
        Mrs. MacDonald started the recording service while working for the Women's Auxiliary of the New York Public Library. She was inspired by a program that provided recordings for blind veterans attending college on the G.I. Bill of Rights.
        She established a recording studio in a two-room office on West 44th Street in 1951 and became president of Recording for the Blind in 1952. That year, she persuaded friends to establish other studios in Los Angeles, Phoenix, Denver, Chicago, Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Athens, Ga. Volunteer for Several Groups
        The organization, now based in Princeton, N.J., has grown to 32 studios in 16 states, with about 4,000 volunteers making recordings of fiction and nonfiction books for students from the fifth grade to graduate school. Last year, about 33,000 people requested copies of the recordings.
        Mrs. MacDonald began working as a volunteer for several organizations during World War II. She was appointed assistant director of the Nurses' Aide Corps of the American Red Cross in 1942 and later helped set up a program to house and feed British soldiers released from Japanese prison camps who stopped in New York on their way home.
        In May 1988, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from Yale University for her volunteer work.
        She was the wife of Ranald H. MacDonald, a governor of the New York Stock Exchange, who died in 1988.
        She is survived by her son, Ranald H. Jr. of Denver; her daughter, Anne M. Thomas of Locust Valley, L.I.; 10 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
