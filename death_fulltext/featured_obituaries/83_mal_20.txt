        Mohammed Kasrawi, office manager for the Beirut bureau of The New York Times for 35 years, died Thursday night at American University of Beirut hospital. He was 67.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, doctors said.
        Mr. Kasrawi, who was born in Jerusalem, went to Lebanon in 1948 as a refugee. After joining the Beirut bureau in 1958, he served as the aide, field reporter, driver, bodyguard and translator for reporters in Lebanon.
        His first wife, Nazira, and two daughters, Azizza and Hanan, were killed in a bomb explosion in the summer of 1982 while protecting the New York Times office and residence in Beirut.
        Mr. Kasrawi is survived by his second wife and 11 children. He was buried in the Palestinian Martyrs Cemetery in Beirut.
