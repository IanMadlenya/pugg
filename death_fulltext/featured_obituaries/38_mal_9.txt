        Jack Conroy, a Depression-era novelist whose writings drew upon his childhood in a mining camp, died on Wednesday. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Conroy's best-known work was ''The Disinherited,'' a 1933 novel of a young Missourian from a mining camp who travels the country looking for work during the Depression.
        He first achieved national attention when his work was discovered by H. L. Mencken, who published sketches and stories by him in The American Mercury magazine.
