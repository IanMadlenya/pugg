        Robert C. McNamara Jr., a retired book publisher, died on Wednesday night at the Brewster Manor Nursing Home in Brewster, Mass. He was 86.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        Mr. McNamara was an executive, a director and officer of Scott Foresman & Company, a book-publishing company based in Chicago. He was a president of the American Textbook Publishers Association and a president of the national Great Books Foundation.
        He was a treasurer of Poetry magazine and stepped in to save it with a personal financial guarantee in the early 1950's, when an unpaid paper vendor threatened to shut it down. He then reordered the magazine's finances and fund raising.
        Mr. McNamara also helped write fair lending legislation in Illinois, protecting borrowers from deceptive lending policies. The legislation requires the use of plain language in contracts and requires a three-day waiting period on major homeowner credit purchases. It was adopted by the Illinois Legislature in 1966 and later by 41 other states.
        Mr. McNamara retired in 1970 and lived subsequently in Ireland and on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
        He is survived by his stepmother, R. C. McNamara of Winnetka, Ill.; a sister, Ruth M. Felton of Berkley, Ill.; three sons, Stephen, of Mill Valley, Calif., Robert C. 3d, of Orleans, Mass., and Norris T., of Chicago; a daughter, Cornelia McNamara Richter of Yarmouth, Me., and six grandchildren.
