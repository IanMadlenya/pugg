        Dr. Norbert H. Leeseberg, a former professor and administrator at Wagner College on Staten Island and the former chairman of the board of Staten Island University Hospital, died on Saturday at the hospital. He was 64 and lived in West Brighton, S.I.
        The cause was cancer, said Dr. Eleanor Meyer Rogg, a professor of sociology at Wagner College, from whose faculty he retired last year.
        Dr. Leeseberg was born in Elmhurst, Ill. He moved to Staten Island in 1952 to establish and direct St. John's Lutheran School. He served there for 15 years before joining Wagner College's faculty in 1967. In 1970, he became an associate dean.
        He was Wagner's senior vice president for administration from 1978 to 1990. In 1990, he became a professor and chairman of the department of education and psychology.
        He joined University Hospital's board in 1970, and helped in its 1987 consolidation with Richmond Memorial Hospital. He was elected chairman in 1990 and re-elected last year.
        He graduated from Concordia College in 1952, and received a master's degree in education from Wagner College and a doctorate in education from New York University.
        His wife, the former Ann H. Humphrey, died in 1992. He is survived by five brothers, Kenneth, of Montello, Wis., Rudolph, of Lombard, Ill., Roger, of Independence, Kan., Douglas, of Riverdale, Calif., and Charles, of Rockford, Ill.; and two sisters, Jean L. Meyer of Gurnee, Ill., and Patricia L. Ogle of Vista, Calif.
