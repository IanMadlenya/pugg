        Antonio de Almeida, a conductor and musicologist who was an authority on the music of Offenbach and whose recordings helped restore the works of Massenet, Duparc and Chausson to the active repertory, died on Tuesday at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He was 69 and had homes in St. Remy-de-Provence, France, and in Manhattan.
        The cause was liver and lung cancer, said Josephine Hemsing, his press representative.

        An obituary of the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida on Friday misidentified the composer of an opera he recorded. ''Mignon'' is by Ambroise Thomas, not Jules Massenet.
