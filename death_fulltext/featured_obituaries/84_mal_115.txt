        Jack H. Mohr, a Manhattan cosmetics executive for 30 years, died last Friday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. He was 82 and lived in Upper Montclair.
        He had a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of Millville, N.J., Mr. Mohr graduated from Trenton State College with a degree in education and a letter in football. In World War II, he served on a radio-and-radar advisory committee for the War Production Board.
        He started his career in cosmetics in 1947 at Warner Lambert's Richard Hudnut Company, where he was assistant to the president. He later held leading executive posts at other companies before he founded his own, Products of Excellence Ltd., in the 1960's.
        His company represented various cosmetic lines and imported European fragrances, and it produced a bath gel. He retired as president about 15 years ago. An Active Republican
        He was active in Republican Party matters in New Jersey and New York, including Nelson A. Rockefeller's campaigns for governor. In 1972, President Richard M. Nixon named him a delegate to the First White House Conference on Aging, and he remained active for some time on the steering committee of that conference.
        In New Jersey he served on the Essex County Rent Stabilization Board and was a board member of the Roosevelt Colony for the the Aging in Millville.
        Mr. Mohr is survived by his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Wood Mohr; four sons, Jon W., of Verona, N.J., Arthur W., of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Robert W., and Kent W., both of Upper Montclair; a daughter, Susan Davis of Highland Falls, N.Y., and nine grandchildren.
