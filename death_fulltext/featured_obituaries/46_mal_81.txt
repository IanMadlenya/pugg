        James C. Harrison, an artist who had his first one-man exhibition at age 58, died on Saturday at his home in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. He was 64 years old.
        He died of liver failure, said his dealer, Lori Ledis of the Ledisflam Gallery in SoHo.
        Mr. Harrison was born in Detroit. He studied briefly at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., but was largely a self-taught artist. He moved to New York in 1950, supporting himself for over 25 years by working as a color mixer for a textile manufacturer. By the mid-1950's he had devised a style of portraiture that incorporated the seemingly random scribbles of automatist drawing.
        His work was included in a dozen group exhibitions, in New York and around the country, from the late 50's through the 70's. But it was not until the 1980's, when Mr. Harrison was living on public assistance, that his work began to gain wider visibility. In 1983 he had his first one-man exhibition at A Place Apart Gallery in Brooklyn. In 1987, the Ledisflam Gallery mounted a 40-year retrospective of his work. A survey of Mr. Harrison's portraits is currently on view at Ledisflam, through today.
        There are no immediate survivors.
