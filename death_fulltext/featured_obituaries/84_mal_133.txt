        Sir Ashley Clarke, a former British Ambassador to Italy who became a leader in efforts to preserve Venice, died Thursday. He was 90 and lived in Surrey and in Venice.
        Sir Ashley, who was knighted in 1952, was Ambassador from 1953 to 1962, when he retired from diplomacy.
        In the following years, he gathered international support for safeguarding and restoring Venice's treasures of art and architecture. He was president of the Venice in Peril Fund from 1983 until his death, and in 1990 led a successful campaign to divert the projected World Exhibition for the Year 2000 away from the Venice area.
        He is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Frances Molyneaux.
