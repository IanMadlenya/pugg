        Paul Bruce Dowling, the founder and executive director of the America the Beautiful Fund in Washington, died on Sunday at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Va. Mr. Dowling, who lived in Arlington, was 67.
        The cause was heart disease, said his wife, Nanine Dowling.
        Mr. Dowling began the America the Beautiful Fund in 1965 as an outgrowth of a White House conference on sprucing up the country. The result has been the planting of thousands of trees and shrubs and the redecoration of blighted areas.
        Mr. Dowling was a graduate of Pennsylvania State University and an Army veteran of World War II.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Dawn, of New London, Pa., and Laurie, of Richmond; a brother, Peter, of Cape May, N.J., and a sister, Joyce Zawrotny of Mount Laurel, N.J.
