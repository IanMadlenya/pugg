        Dr. Walter Modell, a retired professor of pharmacology at Cornell University Medical School and an editor of professional journals in the field, died on Dec. 23 at Heritage-Shadyside Nursing Home in Pittsburgh. He was 83 years old and lived in Pittsburgh.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, his son, John, said.
        Dr. Modell received his medical degree from Cornell University and joined the faculty there after graduating in 1932. He was also in private practice and in 1956 became director of clinical pharmacology at Cornell.
        In the 1960's he warned that doctors were being deluded by pharmaceutical companies into prescribing inadequately tested drugs to their patients that often made them sicker. He was named professor emeritus in 1973.
        From 1960 to 1985, he was editor of "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics," a leading journal. He was also a member of the board of directors of United States Pharmacopeia.
        In addition to his son, John, a historian, of Pittsburgh, he is survived by his wife, the former Miriam Levant, who has written mystery novels and other fiction under the names of Merriam Modell and Evelyn Piper, and two grandchildren.
