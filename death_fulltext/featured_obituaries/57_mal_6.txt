        Bernard McDonald, Senior Fellow at the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development and a former official of the Ford Foundation, died on Sunday at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. He was 49 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of a heart attack, officials at the Pratt Institute said.
        Mr. McDonald, an expert on antipoverty issues, worked in community development for more than 25 years.
        He joined the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation in 1969 and worked there for nine years. The agency, founded in 1966, was the nation's first community-based development corporation.
        Mr. McDonald joined the Ford Foundation in 1978 to help establish programs in community development, urban education and youth employment. He directed the foundation's urban poverty program from 1981 to 1987, and its Special Project on Community Development from 1987 to 1989.
        He was named to his faculty post at Pratt Institute in October 1989 and directed the Ford Foundation-sponsored Community Development Corporation Oral History Project.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Hunter College in 1964 with a degree in economics and from Brooklyn College with a master's in secondary education in 1968. He was a high school teacher in Brooklyn from 1964 to 1966 and taught at the Brooklyn Adult Training Center from 1966 to 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, Clara, and his brother, Bobby.
