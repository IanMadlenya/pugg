        Jacob Bean, a connoisseur of Italian and French drawings who was the curator of drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for 31 years, died yesterday at New York Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer of the esophagus, said his sister, Mary East of Denver.
        Mr. Bean is credited with beginning the drawings department at the Metropolitan. Before his arrival, drawings had been incorporated in the museum's paintings department. Mr. Bean doubled the number of the museum's drawings to more than 4,000, making the collection one of the largest and most respected in America.
        He purchased or was able to attract through gifts and bequests nearly 1,800 drawings, including works by Raphael, Veronese, Poussin, David, Ingres, Delacroix and Degas.
        He was also known for his interest in lesser-known artists. For years he acquired works by 17th-century Italian draftsmen like Ludovico Cigoli, Giovanni Lanfranco, Paolo Pagani and Giovanni Battista Beinaschi for the Metropolitan's collection. More recently, he concentrated on 19th-century French artists like Isidore Pils, Paul Delaroche and Hippolyte Flandrin.
        During his tenure he organized more than 50 exhibitions, including displays of Delacroix, Seurat and Italian Renaissance drawings from the Louvre.
        Mr. Bean was born in Stillwater, Minn., and grew up San Marino, Calif. He graduated from Harvard University in 1945. Before joining the Metropolitan, he worked at the drawings department of the Louvre from 1957 to 1960. He was adjunct professor at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University from 1967 to 1980 and was associate editor of Master Drawings, a scholarly publication about Old Master drawings, from 1963 until this year.
        Only his sister survives.
