        Dr. DuMont Frelinghuysen Elmendorf Jr., a retired physician who specialized in pulmonary diseases, died on Saturday at St. Peter's Hospice in Albany. He was 69 and lived in suburban Menands.
        His death followed a brief illness, his family said.
        Dr. Elmendorf, a native of New York City, received his undergraduate and medical degrees from Johns Hopkins University. He served as an Air Force captain and flight surgeon stationed in New Foundland.
        From 1952 to 1954, he was a research fellow at Cornell University Medical College. He worked on the team led by Dr. Carl Muschenheim and Dr. Walsh McDermott of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center that developed INH, a drug that fights tuberculosis. Discovered in 1952, the new compound was isonicotinic acid hydrazide, or isoniazid, which sharply cut the TB death rate once it came into general use.
        For 20 years, starting in 1958, Dr. Elmendorf was assistant attending physician in pulmonary diseases, tuberculosis and infectious diseases at Albany Medical Center Hospital, and an assistant professor at Albany Medical College. He retired from private practice in 1981.
        Dr. Elmendorf is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Hood; four daughters, Dr. Sarah L. Elmendorf of Unionville, N.Y., Mary E. Dunn of Stony Brook, L.I., Gretchen L. Elmendorf of Boston and Laura E. Plummer of Guilderland, N.Y.; a son, DuMont F. 3d; two stepsons, David C. Hood of Syracuse, N.Y., and John D. Hood, who is serving in the Navy in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and four grandchildren.
