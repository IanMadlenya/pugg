        Dr. Herman K. Hellerstein, a cardiologist and emeritus professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University, died on Tuesday at the affiliated University Hospitals in Cleveland. He was 77 and lived in Dillonvale, Ohio, his hometown.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Hellerstein was one of the early researchers whose work helped in the rehabilitation of heart attack patients who might have previously been forced into premature retirement. That work, carried out in the 1950's, employed dietary controls and exercise to restore the health of cardiac patients. He was a past member of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission and of the scientific committee of the International Federation of Sports Medicine.
        Dr. Hellerstein graduated from Western Reserve and its medical school. In World War II he served as a battalion surgeon with the Seventh Armored Division.
        Dr. Hellerstein returned to Western Reserve and started his career there in 1950 as a teacher, research scientist and physician at the Medical School and University Hospitals. Western Reserve later merged with the Case Institute of Technology to become Case Western Reserve.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary F. Hellerstein; three daughters, Dr. Kathryn Hellerstein of Philadelphia, Dr. Susan Hellerstein of Boston and Dr. Elizabeth Hellerstein of Cleveland Heights; three sons, Dr. David J., of New York, Jonathan P., of Ottawa Hills, Ohio, and Dr. Daniel K., of Jacksonville, Fla.; a sister, Velma Axelrod of Pittsburgh; a brother, Dr. Earl, of Boston, and 10 grandchildren.
