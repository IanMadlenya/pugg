        Nino Caprioglio, a fashion illustrator whose drawings appeared in major publications in the United States and Europe for more than 40 years, died on Monday at his home in Casale Monferrato near Turin in northern Italy. He was 67.
        The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, friends said.
        Last month he attended the fall fashion openings in Milan and Paris and his sketches appeared in The New York Times, as they had for many years. His work also appeared in newspapers and magazines in other countries, including The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph, British Vogue, Country Life and The Glasgow Herald in Britain and Madame magazine in Germany. He also did sketches for fabric houses and manufacturers throughout Europe, such as Abraham in Switzerland and Jaeger in England.
        Early in his career, he attended the first Christian Dior fashion show in 1947, which introduced the New Look to the fashion world. At that show he met Alec Murray, a British photographer with whom he collaborated on fashion layouts for magazines throughout the 1950's and 1960's.
        Photographs have generally superseded illustrations in fashion publications, but Mr. Caprioglio was one of the few illustrators who had many assignments in recent years. One reason was that he could produce elegant and detailed fashion drawings more quickly than photographers could have their film processed.
        "I'm a gypsy -- I follow the fashion showings," Mr. Caprioglio used to say. In addition to his home in Italy, he maintained an apartment in London. He added the United States to his European itinerary in recent years because he believed New York fashion was becoming increasingly important on the world scene.
        There will be a funeral today in Casale Monferrato.
