        Julian Samson Greenspun, a Manhattan lawyer and former justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 21 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 63 and lived in Mill Basin, Brooklyn.
        The cause was gallbladder cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Greenspun was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn Law School. He was appointed to the bench in 1974 by Mayor Abraham D. Beame as a judge in the Civil Court in Kings County.
        He subsequently won election to the State Supreme Court but resigned in 1984 and returned to private practice, specializing in litigation. He was a partner in the Manhattan firm of Greenspun & Sands, which was dissolved earlier this year. At his death, he was of counsel to Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek & Shoot, a firm on lower Broadway.
        Mr. Greenspun is survived by his wife of 39 years, Beverly Davis Greenspun; a son, Scott S. of Manhattan; two daughters, Jill and Dana, both of Manhattan, and one grandson.
