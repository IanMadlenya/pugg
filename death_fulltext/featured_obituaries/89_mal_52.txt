        Walter J. Ganzi Sr., a Manhattan restaurateur for more than 50 years and head of the group that owned the Palm chain, died on Friday at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I. Mr. Ganzi, who lived in Hempstead, L.I., was 76.
        The cause was liver cancer, said his son Victor F. Ganzi.
        Mr. Ganzi was the president of the Palm Restaurant and the Palm Too restaurant, both on the East Side. In the 1960's Mr. Ganzi directed an expansion that eventually led to the opening in other cities of nine restaurants incorporating the name Palm.
        Mr. Ganzi began his career as a typesetter at The New York Daily Mirror, which was on the East Side of Manhattan near the Palm Restaurant, which was owned by his father, John Ganzi. Walter Ganzi left the newspaper business shortly afterward to go to work for his father as a bartender, and eventually directed the entire operation.
        Mr. Ganzi is survived by his wife, Gertrude Ganzi of Hempstead; his mother, Adele Ganzi of Valley Stream, L.I.; four sons, Walter Jr. of Aiken, S.C., Victor of West Bay Shore, L.I., John T. of Manhattan, and Frederick S. of Pittsbugh; a brother, Charles of Valley Stream; a sister, Lorraine Cook of Huntington, L.I., and six grandchildren.
