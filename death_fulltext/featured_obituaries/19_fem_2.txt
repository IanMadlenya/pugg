        In 1979, Ms. Wilson helped start the women's magazine as its first editor in chief, a job she held until last year when she became founding editor. At her death, she also was editorial director of the Conde Nast Collection, the publishing company's marketing division. Conde Nast publishes Self.
        Ms. Wilson, a native of New Orleans, began her career as a researcher and writer for Vogue. In 1963 she went to Glamour, where she became managing editor, a post she held until she founded Self.
        She is survived by her husband, Hugh, and her father, Dan Starr of New Orleans.
