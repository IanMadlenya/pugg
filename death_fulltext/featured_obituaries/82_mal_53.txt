        Gaston de Havenon, a dealer and collector who specialized in African art, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 89 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. de Havenon, who was born in Tunis, came to the United States in 1929 and went into the perfume business, eventually founding the Anne Haviland Company, importers of French perfume. He later opened an art gallery in the Fuller Building, at Madison Avenue and 57th Street, where he remained through the 1970's. In recent years he was a private dealer.
        He is survived by three sons, Michael, Andre and Alex, and a daughter, Sarah Fowler, all of Manhattan; a stepson, David Kapell of Greenport, L.I.; a stepdaughter, Rebecca Leigh of Washington, and two grandchildren.
