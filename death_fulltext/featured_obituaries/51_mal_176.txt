        Henry T. Harrison, a meteorologist who accompanied Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd on his first Antarctic expedition in 1929-30, died Sunday at Deerfield, a retirement home in Asheville, N.C. He was 87 years old.
        The cause of death was probably Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Grace. She said an autopsy would be conducted.
        After returning from the Byrd expedition, where he studied weather conditions, Mr. Harrison was a meteorologist with the United States Weather Bureau in Cleveland for several years.
        He then joined United Airlines as chief meterologist and head of the department in Chicago and Denver. He remained with United for more than 30 years, working with other airlines to develop airborne radar for avoiding severe weather. He retired in 1964, but continued conducting weather studies for the airline until the late 1960's.
        Mr. Harrison, a native of the District of Columbia, was a self-taught meterologist. He was an Army lieutenant colonel in World War II, and was a weather forecaster at the Yalta Conference in 1945.
        Besides his wife, the former Grace Smith, he is survived by a daughter, Anne Silver of San Carlos, Calif.; a sister, Elizabeth Fugate of Sterling, Va., and three grandchildren.
