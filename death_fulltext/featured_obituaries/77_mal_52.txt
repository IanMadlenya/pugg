        Bill Baker, the lead singer and music adviser for the American Indian Dance Theater, died on Tuesday in Minot, N.D. He was 58.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Les Schecter, his press representative.
        Mr. Baker, a member of the Mandan-Hidatsa Tribes, was also a member of the Mandaree Singers, an American Indian drum and singing group that performs at major intertribal gatherings throughout North America.
        He was taught traditional American Indian songs by his father and grandfather as a child and eventually mastered more than 400 of them. He also composed many songs that have become part of the American Indian musical repertory.
        Mr. Baker toured with the American Indian Dance Theater both at home and abroad. Last month he was among the featured artists in "Dances for the New Generations," part of the "Great Performances" series on public television.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane Baker; three daughters, Charlene, Betty and Bonnie; and four sons, Wade, Leonard, Sidrick and Sean.
