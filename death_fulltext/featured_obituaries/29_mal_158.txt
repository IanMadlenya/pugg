        Bernard P. Gallagher, founder and editor in chief of The Gallagher Report, a weekly newsletter about the communications industry, died Wednesday at New York Hospital. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Last week, Mr. Gallagher announced that he would cease publishing and retire. He cited age as the reason, adding that he had tried to sell the newsletter but could not find a suitable buyer. Its last issue was June 19.
        He began the publication 37 years ago, when the media business was beginning to boom after the dawn of television. Advertising executives said the newsletter's greatest influence had been in the 1950's and 1960's.
        A mixture of gossip, speculation and fact, the newsletter served as a vehicle for Mr. Gallagher's opinions. Regular features included the best and worst executives of the month, the best and worst advertisements and the magazine of the month.
        Mr. Gallagher was born in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Harriet; a daughter, Jill, of Manhattan, and a sister, Anne Cook of Manhattan.
