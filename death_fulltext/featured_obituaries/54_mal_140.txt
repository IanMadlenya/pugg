        Robert Clark Templeton, who painted Presidential portraits of Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter, as well as leaders of the civil-rights movement, died on Tuesday at his home in Woodbury. He was 62 years old.
        He died in his sleep, apparently of a heart attack, said his wife, Leonora.
        Mr. Templeton painted three portraits of President Jimmy Carter. One is in the Hall of Presidents of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, another at the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta, and a third in the Georgia State Senate chambers.
        He also did a series of portraits of civil-rights figures, among them Rosa Parks, Roy Wilkins and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Other subjects included Clark Gable, Hubert H. Humphrey, Stan Musial and Luciano Pavarotti. He also did several covers for Time magazine during the 1960's.
        Mr. Templeton was born in Red Oak, Iowa, and studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and the Art Students League in New York City.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Mark and Kevin, of Woodbury, and Timothy, of New York City; his parents, Clark and Grace Templeton of Red Oak; five brothers, a sister and a granddaughter.
