        Robert C. Lewis Jr., a former vice president of the American Red Cross, died Thursday at his home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 82.
        A family friend, Susanne Palmer, said the cause was a heart ailment.
        Mr. Lewis was with the Red Cross for nearly 40 years, serving as a field service director in Europe and operations director in China, Burma and India during World War II.
        Before becoming vice president of the Red Cross in 1957, Mr. Lewis served as the agency's commissioner in Tokyo, deputy manager in the Southeastern United States, director of operations in Europe and assistant to the vice president.
        He was a founder of the Center for International Security Studies of the American Security Council Education Foundation in Washington and a director of the American Red Cross.
        He is survived by his wife, Eve Newton Lewis, of Charlottesville.
