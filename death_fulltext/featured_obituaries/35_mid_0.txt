        Mrs. Darling and her husband, Louis, wrote and illustrated nine books about natural history before he died in 1970. Their works, intended to give the average person a working knowledge of natural sciences, were ''The Science of Life,'' a high school biology textbook; ''Bird,'' a reference book for adults on ornithology; ''The Sea Serpents Around Us,'' a children's book; ''A Place in the Sun: Ecology and the Living World''; ''Before and After Dinosaurs''; ''60 Million Years of Horses''; ''Turtles''; ''Coral Reefs,'' and ''Worms.''
        The Darlings also did illustrations for Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring'' and other publications.
        Mrs. Darling's ''H.M.S. Beagle, 1820-1870: Voyages Summarized, Research and Reconstruction,'' about the vessel in which Charles Darwin made his voyage of scientific inquiry, was published in 1984 by Sea History Press.
        There are no immediate survivors.
