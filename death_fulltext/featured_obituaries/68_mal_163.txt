        Robert G. Fairburn, the retired head of the Diamond Match Company who led the expansion of the leading producer of matches into other industries, died on Saturday at the Community Hospital in Monterey, Calif. He was 81 years old and lived in Carmel, Calif.
        He died after a history of heart illness, his family said.
        Mr. Fairburn succeeded his father, William, in the presidency of Diamond in 1947 and later became its chairman. Diamond and its related companies were the nation's leading producers of wooden stick matches and paper book matches.
        Mr. Fairburn diversified Diamond's products and also expanded by merger with other companies. The company, based in Manhattan, became Diamond Gardner in 1957 and Diamond National in 1959.
        As the company grew, matches became less than a fifth of the total operations. The other products included lumber, charcoal, molded pulp, cardboard, egg cartons and other packaging, labels, wrappers, posters and other printed material.
        In 1961 Mr. Fairburn left Diamond to lead another company, Keyes Fibre, in Waterville, Me., which specialized in paper products. He retired from there in 1978.
        His marriages to Mary Whitwell Gray in 1933 and Margaret Taylor Watson in 1951 ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of 20 years, the former Eileen Baker; a son, Robert G. Fairburn of Richmond, Me.; a daughter, Louise Lumley of Manhattan; a stepson, E. Stevens Rickard of Basking Ridge, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Victoria S. Rickard of Basking Ridge and Stacy R. Bedford of Mercer, Me., and two grandchildren.
