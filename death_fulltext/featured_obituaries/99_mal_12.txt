        Oliver Rea, a theatrical producer who was a co-founder of the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 71.
        The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Natalie.
        Mr. Rea (pronounced RAY) was active on Broadway early in his career. In 1947 he produced, with Robert Whitehead, a Robinson Jeffers version of "Medea," starring Judith Anderson. The production was praised by critics as a theatrical landmark.
        Mr. Rea and Mr. Whitehead also produced "Crime and Punishment" (1948), starring John Gielgud, and Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding" (1950), with Julie Harris and Ethel Waters.
        The Guthrie Theater's first season, in 1963, included plays by Shakespeare, Moliere, Chekhov and Arthur Miller. Mr. Rea served until 1966 as a managing director of the Minnesota Theater Company, an actors' troupe based in the Guthrie theater, and as president of the Minnesota Theater Company Foundation, the operator of the Guthrie Theater.
        Mr. Rea's work in later years included producing LeRoi Jones's play "Slave Ship."
        Mr. Rea was born in Manhattan. He attended Dartmouth College and was an ambulance driver with the American Field Service during World War II.
        In addition to his wife, the former Natalie Bocca, he is survived by a son, Peter, of Manhattan; three daughters, Caitlin, of Manhattan, and Edith and Margaret, of Los Angeles; a brother, Michael, of Washington, Conn., and six grandchildren.
