        Bernard Perricone, the youngest of the world's first documented male quadruplets to survive, died Sunday at a Nederland hospital. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Perricone died after a heart attack, said his brother Donald.
        Anthony, Bernard, Carl and Donald Perricone were born Oct. 31, 1929, in a Beaumont, Tex., farmhouse. Their parents, immigrants from Italy, already had five sons.
        The Perricone quadruplets were only the second documented quadruplets in the country.
        For seven months in 1952 all four served in the same unit of the Army in Korea after receiving special permission arranged by Senator Lyndon B. Johnson. Army policy normally prohibits brothers from serving in the same unit.
        After returning from the service, all four worked for the Pure Oil Company, now Union Oil. After Bernard retired from the refinery's clerical department, he managed a warehouse with his wife, Mildred, until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, eight brothers, including Anthony, Carl and Donald, and three children.
