        Howard D. Goldberg, a talent agent and founding partner of a Hollywood agency, died on Sunday at Sherman Oaks Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 40 and lived in Los Angeles.
        His family said the cause was complications from AIDS.
        In 1982, Mr. Goldberg and Scott Harris founded the agency Harris & Goldberg, which became Innovative Artists last year. Mr. Goldberg has represented such actors as Anthony Hopkins, Don Ameche, Frank Langella, Liam Neeson and Roddy McDowall.
        Born in Brooklyn, he graduated from the State University of New York at Binghamton in 1974. He went to Hollywood as an actor in 1976 and decided he preferred representing actors. He worked with the Henderson-Hogan Agency and Gersh Agency in Los Angeles.
        His survivors include his companion of 15 years, Jim Bean; his father and stepmother, Martin and Janet Goldberg of Howard Beach, Queens, and two brothers, Steven of San Antonio and Robert of Brooklyn.
