        Harry A. Sylvester, a writer of short stories and novels, died Sunday at the Friends Nursing Home in Sandy Springs, Md. He was 85 and had been a resident of Washington for nearly four decades.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        A native of Brooklyn, he graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1930, became a reporter for New York City newspapers and then turned to freelance writing. He contributed more than 150 short stories and articles to national magazines and had five novels published. The novels included "Moon Gaffney" (Holt, 1947) and "A Golden Girl" (Harcourt, Brace, 1950). Holt also published "All Your Idols" in 1948, a collection of 14 of his short stories.
        In 1951, he joined the United States Information Agency as a writer and spokesman, serving in New York, Washington and Mexico City. He retired in 1971.
        Mr. Sylvester's first wife, Rita Davis Sylvester, died in 1978; his second, Janet Hart Sylvester, died in 1987.
        He is survived by four children, John C. of Chapel Hill, N.C., Anne R. Sylvester of Woods Hole, Mass., Joan S. Wise of Washington and Clare S. Strickler of Augusta, W.Va.; a brother, William, of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I.; a sister, Margaret Sylvester of Brooklyn; three stepchildren from his second marriage, Barbara D. Wick of Northfield, Ill., John B. Diebold of Nyack, N.Y., and Beatrice D. Hart of London; 12 grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
