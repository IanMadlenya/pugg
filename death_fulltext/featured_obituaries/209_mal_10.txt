        Morton Cooper Feinberg, who used an aggressive and unorthodox marketing campaign to triumph over mixed reviews and sell more than three million copies of his sensational novel about an Italian-American singer, died on May 18 in Stamford, Conn.. He was 79.
        The cause was a complication of a blood clot, his daughter, Barbara, said.
        Mr. Feinberg's novel ''The King,'' which he wrote under the name Morton Cooper, followed the political aspirations and sexual misadventures of Harry Orlando, a character rumored to have been based on Frank Sinatra. The book earned praised for its realistic dialogue and rich detail but was criticized for its stock characters and steamy plot.
        ''None of us expected Morton Cooper to produce a work of genius,'' Bernard Geis, Mr. Feinberg's publisher, told The New York Times Book Review shortly after the release in 1967. ''But we knew from the beginning that the book was very commercial.''
        The success of ''The King'' owed much to an audience hungry for pulp and a relentless international marketing campaign, unusual for its day, that included a six-week European tour and a contest among London bookstores to create the most original promotional display..
        Mr. Feinberg was born in Greensburg, Pa., in 1925. He moved to New York after high school and began writing children's television programs, including a marionette series, ''Funny Bunnies.''
        In the 1950's Mr. Feinberg started writing paperbacks, many under pseudonyms that shared his initials. Later, he wrote freelance articles for The Chicago Defender.
        After ''The King,'' Mr. Feinberg wrote five more hardcover books, but none attained the same financial success.
        In addition to his daughter, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., Mr. Feinberg is survived by his wife Charlotte Plotkin, of Stamford, Conn., his son David Feinberg, of East Islip, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
