        Irving Schneider, a theater producer and general manager, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80 and also had a home in Quogue, N.Y.
        Mr. Schneider began his career in the mid-1930's as an office boy for the producer Sam H. Harris. He went on to become assistant stage manager of ''Merrily We Roll Along,'' a play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart.
        After serving in the Air Force in World War II, he was associate producer and general manager with Irene Mayer Selznick from 1946 to 1962. Their major hits included Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' John van Druten's ''Bell, Book and Candle,'' Enid Bagnold's ''Chalk Garden,'' Graham Greene's ''Complacent Lover'' and George Tabori's ''Flight Into Egypt.''
        In 1960, he married Kaufman's daughter, Anne, with whom he managed the Kaufman estate of plays and musicals after the playwright's death in 1961.
        He is survived by his wife; a daughter, Beatrice Cronin of Los Angeles; a brother, William, of Middle Village, N.Y., and two grandsons.
