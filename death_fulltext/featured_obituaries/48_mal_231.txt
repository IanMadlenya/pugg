        Barton K. Wickstrum, retired president of the General Time Corporation, which made clocks and industrial-control devices, died on Friday at his home in Sun City West, Ariz. He was 77 years old and had formerly lived in Riverside, Conn.
        He died of complications of emphysema, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Wickstrum joined General Time in 1960 as executive vice president. In 1965, he was named chief executive officer and diversified the company into the aerospace and military markets. Under his guidance the company became profitable and in 1969, it was taken over by Talley Industries.
        He later helped form Data-Plex Systems, a company engaged in video communications, and remained as chairman when it merged with T.V.C. Laboratories.
        Mr. Wickstrum was a 1936 graduate of Northwestern University. He held several sales positions before joining Sylvania Electric Products in 1939. When he left in 1958, he was a senior vice president.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a daughter, Janet W. Stack of Tampa, Fla.; a son, Barton Jr., of Ridgefield, Conn., and five grandchildren.
