        Truman S. Gray, widely recognized for his ground-breaking work in electronics, died Saturday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 86 years old and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        He died after a heart attack in his home a few days earlier, said Charles Ball, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Dr. Gray taught.
        Dr. Gray was professor emeritus of engineering electronics at M.I.T. He is best known for the development in 1931 of the Photo-Electric Integraph, a calculating machine that solved complex mathematical problems in minutes by turning them into rays of light. Out of this work came his book "Applied Electronics," an authoritative text, published by M.I.T. Press in 1954.
        In 1947-48, he designed and developed reactor instrumentation at the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
        He retired in 1971 but continued to teach his graduate level course on electronic instrumentation and control.
        Born in Spencer, Ind., he graduated from the University of Texas. He received a master of science degree in 1928 and a doctor of science degree in 1930, both from M.I.T.
        He is survived by his wife, Isabel Crockford, and a sister, Margaret Shepherd of Austin, Tex.
