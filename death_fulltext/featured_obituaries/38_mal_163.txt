        Charles van Ravenswaay, a museum director and specialist in American frontier history, died of cancer on Tuesday in Cokesbury Village, a retirement community in Hockessin, Del. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. van Ravenswaay directed the Henry Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum in Wilmington for 10 years before he retired in 1976. Earlier he had been director of the Missouri Historical Society and president of Old Sturbridge Village in Sturbridge, Mass. In the mid-1960's he was president of the American Association of Museums.
        His lifelong interest in frontier history led Mr. van Ravenswaay to encourage children visiting the Jefferson Memorial Museum in St. Louis to clamber on an 1849 fire engine and handle frontier firearms, tomahawks and spinning wheels.
        Mr. van Ravenswaay, who was born in Boonville, Mo., helped write the Works Progress Administration's guidebook to Missouri. Later he wrote on American horticulture and decorative arts in ''America's Age of Wood'' (1971), ''The Arts and Architecture of German Settlements in Missouri'' (1977) and ''A 19th-Century Garden'' (1977). His last book, as yet unpublished, is a history of the apple.
        Surviving are two brothers, Dr. Arie van Ravenswaay of Tucson, and William T. van Ravenswaay of Bedford, Tex.
