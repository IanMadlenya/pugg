        Anthony Bufano, the curator of the organ at the Riverside Church in Manhattan for more than 30 years, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Mr. Bufano, who lived in Manhattan, was 53.
        The cause was lymphoma, according to the church.
        Mr. Bufano began his stewardship of the church's organ in 1963 at the age of 21, and remained in that capacity for the rest of his life. He maintained and tuned the organ, which has 209 ranks and 12,000 pipes, and also built its console.
        In addition, Mr. Bufano built, installed or maintained pipe organs in New York and elsewhere, including those at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the Church of the Epiphany and the Metropolitan Opera House.
        Before joining the Riverside Church, Mr. Bufano was a foreman at the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company in Boston, and while there, he supervised the installation of other instruments, including the organ at Philharmonic Hall in Lincoln Center.
