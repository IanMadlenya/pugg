        Rodman Gilder, a psychoanalyst who specialized in treating emotional problems of children with major physical ailments, died on Wednesday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 74.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Gilder practiced in Scarsdale and taught psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical Center and Columbia University Hospital of Physicians and Surgeons.
        The subjects of his research and articles included children with leukemia, accident-prone children and the emotional effects of amputation.
        He had been an editor of Psychoanalytic Quarterly since 1965. He was also a former president of the Westchester Psychoanalytic Society and served on the boards of the Scarsdale Family Counseling Service, Westchester Adoption Service and Westchester Mental Health Association.
        Dr. Gilder was born in Manhattan.  He graduated from Harvard and received his medical degree at Columbia.
        Surviving are his wife of 43 years, the former Mary Ellen Bowman; two sons, David, of San Diego and Joshua, of Manhattan; a sister, Helena Miller of Montclair, N.J., and a granddaughter.
