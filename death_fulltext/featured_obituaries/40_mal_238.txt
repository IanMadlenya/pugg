        Mr. Wolfson began his professional career organizing acting clubs for striking coal miners in West Virginia. Later, he wrote plays for Broadway, dramas for television and at least two novels. He wrote professionally until his death.
        In 1931 Mr. Wolfson acted in Elmer Rice's play ''Street Scene,'' but his life's work was playwriting. He adapted most of his plays from novels. His Broadway productions included the 1937 comedy ''Excursion,'' as well as ''Bitter Stream,'' ''Pastoral,'' ''The Family,'' ''Pride's Crossing,'' ''American Gothic'' and ''Seventh Heaven.'' His novels were ''The Lonely Steeple'' and ''The Eagle on the Plain.''
        In 1961, the several episodes he wrote for ABC's 26-part television series ''Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years'' earned him an Emmy Award.
        In the theater, Mr. Wolfson worked as actor, assistant stage manager, director, playwright and producer.
        He is survived by three sons, Nicholas Wolfson and Martin Sloane of New York, and Thomas Wolfson of Hill, N.H.
