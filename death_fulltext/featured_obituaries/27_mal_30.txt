        Dr. Jan Aleksander Rajchman, an electronics expert whose work led to the development of high-speed computer memory systems, died Saturday at the Princeton (N.J.) Medical Center. He was 80 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Dr. Rajchman, who earned graduate degrees at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, was a former director of research and a former vice president for data processing at the RCA Corporation laboratories in Princeton. He was also responsible for technical direction at RCA labs in Zurich and Tokyo.
        Dr. Rajchman began his career at RCA in 1935 at a time when computers were just being developed. In his early work, in the 1930's, he focused on electron multipliers and in 1939 he was among the first to consider the possibility of electronic computation.
        In 1947, he was the co-recipient of the Levy Medal from the Franklin Institute for developing possible applications of electron acelerators to microwave devices. He developed tiny ferrite cores, magnetic memories and switching devices that led to the creation of high-speed computer memory systems. He retired in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth; a daughter, Alice Hammond of Kensington, Md.; a son, John, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
