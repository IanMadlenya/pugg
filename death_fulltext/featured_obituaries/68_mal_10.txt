        Ernest Albin Jones, for many years one of the country's foremost advertising executives, died on Monday at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital in Pontiac, Mich. He was 77 years old and lived in another Detroit suburb, Bloomfield Hills.
        He died of complications of a stroke, said the Vasu, Rodgers & Connell funeral chapel in nearby Royal Oak.
        Mr. Jones, known as Ernie, was a former president, chairman and chief executive officer of D'Arcy-McManus & Masius, where at various times he held virtually every top position. He retired from the firm in 1983 as chairman of the worldwide executive committee. Tripling of Billings
        During Mr. Jones's stewardship at the Bloomfield Hills headquarters, DM & M tripled its global billings, to $1.1 billion, and became the world's 12th largest advertising agency, with 46 offices in 27 countries. It has since become D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles.
        Mr. Jones, a native of Jamestown, N.Y., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1938 and went to work in the production department of DM & M's predecessor, MacManus John & Adams. He rose swiftly through the ranks, becoming president in 1955 at the age of 39, chief executive officer in 1956 and chairman in 1968. He was named international chairman in 1976 and chairman of the executive committee three years later.
        Mr. Jones was engaged in many civic activities. He also had a lifelong passion for music and, as a noted amateur conductor, often led the University of Michigan bands and appeared in concert with the Detroit Symphony.
        He is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Marian Wellman; three sons, Ernest A. Jones 2d of Bloomfield Hills; Stephen Jones of Naperville, Ill., and Mark G. Jones of Birmingham, Mich.; two daughters, Crystine Tauber of Pottersville, N.Y., and Janet M.
