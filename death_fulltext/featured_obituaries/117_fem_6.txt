        Diane Dickerson Montgomery, a former psychiatric social worker and bank officer who was involved in civil rights causes since childhood, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 62 and also had homes in Lubec, Me., and Key West, Fla.
        The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Charles H. Montgomery.
        A graduate of the Francis Parker School in Chicago and Mills College in Oakland, Calif., she earned a master's degree in social work at the University of Chicago and went to work for several public and private agencies. She later joined the First National Bank of Chicago as an officer in the trust department.
        Her early advocacy of racial equality was inspired by her father, Earl B. Dickerson, a prominent Chicago civil-rights lawyer and 30-year board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Dickerson, who won major legal battles involving housing segregation in Chicago, took her along as a child when he visited whites-only restaurants, was refused service and sued their owners.
        Later, barred from the dining room of a major Chicago hotel, she asked her father's advice. ''Sue,'' he said. She did, and won.
        Mr. Dickerson died in 1986.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Stephen Brown of Oak Park, Ill., and Joshua Cohen of Chicago; a daughter, Judith Cohen Brown of Seattle; a stepdaughter, Alison Montgomery of Chicago; a stepson, Douglas Montgomery of Libertyville, Ill., and two grandchildren.
