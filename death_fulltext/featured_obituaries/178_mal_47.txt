        Albert C. Todd, a professor of European languages and literatures who edited and translated poetry by his friend the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, interpreted for him and once physically defended him from attackers, died on Nov. 9 in a Queens nursing home. He was 74 and lived in Flushing.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Professor Todd, an expert on Russian literature, joined Queens College's faculty in 1966. Since 1994, Mr. Yevtushenko has been a CUNY distinguished professor at the college.
        Professor Todd was an editor of the 1991 book ''The Collected Poems, 1952-1990'' by Mr. Yevtushenko. Other poets translated the poems.
        As Mr. Yevtushenko recalled the 1972 attack, five Ukrainians threw him off a stage during a reading in St. Paul. They beat and kicked him, but Professor Todd bashed the assailants with a microphone stand.
        Albert Charles Todd was born in Pocatello, Idaho, and grew up in Salt Lake City. He received bachelor's and master's degrees from Brigham Young University and a doctorate in Russian history from Georgetown.
        His marriages to Kathryn Christiansen and Vivian Semko ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife, the former Lilia Yapparova; his children, A. Paul, of Mountain View, Calif.; G. Peter, of Marlboro, N.J.; Jeanmarie Todd and Lara Kristina Abbott, of San Francisco; Phillip A., of Geyserville, Calif.; and Anna Bella Todd, of Queens; a sister, Dorothy Jean Black, of Santa Monica, Calif; and five grandchildren.
