        John Hancock Callender, an architect and editor who was an expert on building materials and more efficient methods of construction, died on March 30 at the Meadowood Retirement Community in Worcester, Pa., where he moved five years ago. A longtime resident of Lebanon, Conn., he was 86.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Mary Carnwath.
        He became a proponent of prefabricated housing early in his career, when he conducted research for the John B. Pierce Foundation on cheaper, more efficient construction techniques.
        He was the editor of "Time-Saver Standards for Architectural Design Data," a standard reference book for architects that McGraw Hill first published in 1947. He oversaw later editions of the book, with the last one in 1982.
        During World War II, he supervised the remodeling of laboratories for the Manhattan Project to build an atomic bomb. After the war, he went into business as a designer of custom-built homes and did consulting work for Federal programs established to provide prefabricated housing for returning veterans.
        In 1953, he wrote "Before You Buy a House," published by Crown, which listed 134 points to check when considering the purchase of a house.
        Born in Kansas City, Mo., he received an undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1928 and a degree in architecture from New York University in 1939.
