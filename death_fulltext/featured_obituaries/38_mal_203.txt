        Rabbi Eli Chaim Carlebach, the co-rabbi of Congregation Kehilath Jacob on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his twin brother Shlomo, died of a heart attack on Friday after leaving a synagogue in Hillside, N.J. He was 65 years old.
        In recent years, the brothers revived the small congregation, on the ground floor of a brownstone at 305 West 79th Street, turning it into a center of Hasidic study, song and spirituality. The congregation had been founded by their father, Naphtali, who, until the rise of Hitler, was the chief rabbi of Baden, Austria.
        Several years ago, Rabbi Eli Chaim Carlebach and his wife, Hadassah, moved into the apartment on the second floor of the brownstone and turned it into an extension of the synagogue. Around their table, they gathered a wide range of worshipers, many of whom had never before been exposed to the charismatic Jewish movement of the Hasidim.
        A Research Institute
        Rabbi Eli Chaim divided his time between the West Side congregation and his second pulpit, the Hillside Jewish Center in New Jersey.
        The rabbi was also the editor in chief and founder of Zecher Naphtali, a research institute and publisher in Jersualem that has issued more than 40 titles on the works of Hasidic dynasties before the Holocaust.
        Besides his wife and brother, Rabbi Carlebach is survived by a sister, Shulamit Levovitz of Brooklyn; five daughters, Sterna Citron of Los Angeles, Sheina Berkowitz of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Y. Billie Dayan, Freyda Laufer and Esther Kugel, all of Brooklyn, and 22 grandchildren.
