        David L. Ford was president and chief executive of Interguard, a subsidiary of Guardian Industries Corporation that runs glass-making plants in Europe and the Middle East. He was also the director of sales for another unit of the company, Guardian Europe. He was 43 and lived in Luxembourg.
        Mr. Ford was traveling with Mr. Brown to donate 23 metric tons of glass to Sarajevo as part of the effort to rebuild the war-torn capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
        When he learned of a shortage of glass in the area," said William Davidson, the president and chief executive of Guardian Industries, "he had an answer."
        The company said the glass, enough to make roughly 8,000 windows, had been shipped to Sarajevo and would be turned over to a hospital for installation today.
        Mr. Ford spent his entire career at Guardian. Karl Straky, the director of commercial glass products for Guardian Worldwide in Detroit, said Mr. Ford had landed a summer job at age 17, working for a Guardian windshield distribution outlet near Washington. Later he was transferred to Carleton, Mich., Chicago and Kingsburg, Calif., before being assigned to Luxembourg in 1981.
