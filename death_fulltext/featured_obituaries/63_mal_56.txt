        Dr. Judson K. Albaugh, a retired psychiatrist and mental health administrator, died on Friday when he collapsed and fell into Cayuga Lake in New York while fishing on the shore.
        He was 66 years old and lived in Binghamton. His death was caused by a heart attack, his family said.
        Working for state and county agencies, Dr. Albaugh helped set up mental health clinics in upstate New York. For three years he was the Central New York regional director for the State Department of Mental Hygiene.
        Before that he was the director of the Onondaga County Mental Health Clinic for six years, director of Mental Health Services for Chenango County for five years and director of Mental Health Services for Cortland County for five years.
        After leaving government service in 1977, he worked 14 years for United Health Services, a private hospital company in Johnson City, N.Y. He was its acting director of Emergency Mental Health Services and director of Psychiatric Outpatient Services. He retired last year.
        The son of Baptist missionaries, he was born in the Belgian Congo, now Zaire, and grew up in Harrington Park, N.J.
        After serving two years in the Navy in the South Pacific in World War II, he graduated from Oberlin College in 1948 and completed his medical degree at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. He did his residencies in internal medicine and psychiatry at the Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse.
        He is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Carolyn Darling; a son, Kevin of Essex Junction, Vt.; three daughters, Nancy Sharkey of Glen Ridge, N.J., Kathryn Gitto of Binghamton and Patricia J. Albaugh of Clay, N.Y.; his mother, Mabel, of Alhambra, Calif.; a sister, Joyce Woodbury of San Diego, Calif.; five grandchildren, and three step grandchildren.
