        Herbert Millman, a former executive vice president of the J.W.B., the national organization in New York for Jewish community centers and Y.M.-Y.W.H.A.'s in North America, died on Sunday at the Sarah Neuman Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He was 85 and a longtime resident of Rye, N.Y.
        The J.W.B., which changed its name to the Jewish Community Centers Association of North America in 1990, was formed in 1918 to serve Jewish soldiers in World War I. Many of the social welfare, recreational and educational programs it ran became part of Jewish community life.
        Mr. Millman's career began in the 1930's, when he was a volunteer and then a staff member of the Young Men's Hebrew Association in Springfield, Mass., his hometown. He subsequently oversaw the growth of the Jewish Community Centers Association to include more than 200 member organizations.
        After graduating from Springfield College in 1937, Mr. Millman became executive director of the Y.M.-Y.W.H.A. in Brockton, Mass., and later was executive director of the Greater Boston Council of Jewish Community Centers. Before joining the Jewish Welfare Board in 1943 as field secretary in New England, he received a master's degree in educational administration from Harvard University.
        Mr. Millman served as president of the Association of Jewish Center Workers and as an officer of the National Conference of Jewish Communal Service. He also was a president of the International Conference of Jewish Communal Service.
        On his retirement in 1976, he was named executive vice president emeritus of the community center association. From 1976 to 1979, he was executive director of the World Confederation of Jewish Community Centers.
        Mr. Millman is survived by his wife, Susan; a daughter, Ellen Stoeken of New York City; a son, Lester, of White Plains, and three grandchildren.
