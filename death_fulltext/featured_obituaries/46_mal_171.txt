        Edwin Gary, an optician who was director of special services for Sola/ Barnes-Hind, a contact lens company in Phoenix, died Tuesday at his home in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Gary died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He began his 55-year career at the age of 17, in Manhattan. In 1965 he was asked by Guaranteed Contact Lenses of Manhattan, later Polymer Optics, to open a branch in Phoenix. The company, after a series of sales and mergers, is now a part of Sola/Barnes-Hind.
        Mr. Gary is survived by his wife, the former Bette Merring; a son, Stephen of Silver Spring, Md.; a daughter, Jane Handler of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.; a brother, Gustave Gold of Short Hills, N.J.; and four grandchildren.
