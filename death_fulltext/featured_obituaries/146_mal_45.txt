        Herman L. Weisman, a lawyer who was prominent in American Zionist organizations, died on Sunday at the Hospice of Palm Beach County, Fla. He was 95 and lived in Palm Beach County.
        Mr. Weisman was president of the Zionist Organization of America from 1970 to 1974, at a time when it had 110,000 members. His earlier posts included chairman of the American Zionist Fund in the mid-1950's, chairman of the Zionist Organization of America's national executive committee from 1965 to 1969, and chairman of that organization's national administrative board in 1969 and 1970. He was also active in other Jewish organizations.
        In the 1920's and 30's, he held New York State prosecutorial positions, and from 1938 to 1940, he was legal assistant to John Harlan Amen, the special assistant state attorney general, in Mr. Amen's investigation of law enforcement in Brooklyn. Mr. Weisman was active in the prosecution of Alexander R. Baldwin, staff assistant to District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan of Brooklyn. Mr. Baldwin was acquitted of a bribery charge in 1939, but his license to practice law was later revoked.
        Mr. Weisman was born in Russia but was brought to New York as a baby in 1906. He received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in 1924 from City College, where he was a captain of the debating team, and his law degree in 1927 from Harvard University.
        During the time he had a private law practice in New York, he counted Eleanor Roosevelt among his clients.
