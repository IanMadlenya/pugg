        Clarence B. Hutchenrider, a clarinetist who emerged as a top-ranking instrumentalist when he worked with the Casa Loma Orchestra 50 years ago, died on Sunday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and lived in Fresh Meadows, Queens.
        He died of lung cancer, said David Ostwald, leader of the Gully Low Band, with whom Mr. Hutchenrider performed until his final illness.
        Mr. Hutchenrider's career began in the 1920's and at the end of that decade he had performed with two notable ensembles: one led by Ross Gorman, the other by Tommy Tucker. In 1931, he brought his gritty-tone style to Glen Gray's Casa Loma Orchestra and was the orchestra's pre-eminent soloist. He remained with that band until 1943 when a lung ailment forced him to take a year off.
        He did studio work in Jimmy Lytell's band for ABC radio and at various times worked with Vince Giordano's Dixieland band, the New California Ramblers and the New Orleans Nighthawks. He also led his own trio. Until last year, he performed with Mr. Ostwald's Gully Low band, which he joined in 1982.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara.
        Funeral services will be held at 1 P.M. today at the Thomas Quinn Funeral Home, 162-14 Sanford Avenue, Flushing, Queens.
