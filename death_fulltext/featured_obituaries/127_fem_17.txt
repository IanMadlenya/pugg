        Loretta Blum, a fashion retailer in Dallas for more than 20 years, died on Saturday at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. She was 64 and lived in Dallas.
        The cause was a stroke, said Bud Knight, a friend and former colleague.
        At the time of her death, Ms. Blum was operating the Loretta Blum Boutique in Preston Center Plaza. She had no business partners or immediate family, and the boutique will close on Saturday after a memorial service for Ms. Blum.
        Ms. Blum became prominent on the Dallas fashion scene with the opening of the first boutique bearing her name in 1973 in the Highland Park area. There she sold the designs of Emanuel Ungaro, Valentino, Krizia, Oscar de la Renta, Scaasi and Franco Moschino, among others. Her clientele, Mr. Knight said, was ''the Dallas woman who had a passion for fashion, as she did.''
        She also opened an Ungaro boutique next door to her main store, a Miss B shop for the younger customer, and a Christofle boutique. Her shops flourished during the Texas boom years of the 1970's and 1980's but succumbed to the economic downturn in the late 80's. Ms. Blum managed to hold on until 1992, when she closed her businesses.
        The next year she returned with a boutique in the Lester Melnick store. In 1994 she opened the current Loretta Blum shop.
        She had worked as a buyer for Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue before going into business for herself.
        Ms. Blum was born in Kehoka, Miss., attended Ohio State University and graduated from the Tobe-Coburn fashion school in New York City.
