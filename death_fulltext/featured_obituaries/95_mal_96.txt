        Lee Brevard, a designer of fine jewelry whose clients included many Hollywood actresses, died on Sunday at a friend's home in Los Angeles. He was 45 and had a design studio in the Venice section of Los Angeles.
        The cause of death has not been determined.
        His jewelry, of gold and silver to which he gave an antique finish, often featured figures like hearts, stars and crosses and was embellished with garnets, citrines, sapphires and other colored gemstones as well as diamonds and pearls.
        Elizabeth Taylor, Candice Bergen, Cher and Jodie Foster were among those who collected his pieces. His designs were used in the movies "Basic Instinct," "Days of Thunder" and "The Two Jakes," among others, and they frequently appeared in fashion magazines.
        "His jewelry had a mysterious quality, part Renaissance, part Celtic," said Joan Kaner, vice president and fashion director of Neiman Marcus, which has carried his jewelry for the last four years. The jewelry is also sold at Takashimaya in New York and at boutiques in Los Angeles.
        He began his career in Paris as a painter of watercolors and moved to Los Angeles in 1977, where he soon switched to designing jewelry. There he attracted the attention of Ms. Taylor, who became one of his earliest clients.
        Mr. Brevard was born and reared in Bethel Park, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He attended Arizona State University and Cooper Union.
        He is survived by his father, Claire Brevard; his brother, John, and his sister, Patty Hall, all of Bethel Park.
