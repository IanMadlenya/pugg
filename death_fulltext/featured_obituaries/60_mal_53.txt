        Bill Naughton, who drew a memorable portrait of a woman-chasing Cockney in his 1964 play "Alfie," died on Thursday at his home on the Isle of Man. He was 81 years old.
        His family did not disclose the cause of death, The Associated Press reported.
        Mr. Naughton was described as a "sharp-eyed, pungent British writer" in a New York Times review when "Alfie" arrived on Broadway in December 1964, with Terence Stamp in the title role. Although the play received enthusiastic reviews, it closed after 21 performances.
        The role of Alfie in the 1966 film adaptation, for which Mr. Naughton wrote the screenplay, made Michael Caine an international star.
        Among Mr. Naughton's other plays was "Spring and Port Wine," about a Lancashire family. It broke box-office records at the Mermaid Theater in London and came to Broadway in 1967 as "Keep It in the Family," starring Maureen O'Sullivan and Patrick Magee.
        Mr. Naughton was born in Ireland and grew up in northern England, where he worked as a truck driver and coal bagger before beginning to write short stories and plays. His first published novel was "A Roof Over Your Head" in 1945. Subsequently, he worked in London for the humor magazine Lilliput and then became a writer for radio and television.
        He also wrote "All in Good Time," a comedy about working-class life. A success when it opened at the Mermaid in 1962 in London, the play came to Broadway in February 1965, with Donald Wolfit and Marjorie Rhodes in the principal roles; it ran for 44 performances. Mr. Naughton adapted the play into "The Family Way," a 1967 film that starred Hayley Mills.
        Mr. Naughton's autobiography, "Saintly Billy: A Catholic Boyhood," was published in 1988.
