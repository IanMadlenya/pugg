        Robert L. Crowell, president of the Thomas Y. Crowell Company, a New York publishing house that is now part of HarperCollins, died on Friday at his home in Ponte Vedra, Fla. He was 92.
        Mr. Crowell joined Thomas Y. Crowell, the first American publisher of Tolstoy and Gogol, as a sales representative in 1931, moving up the ranks until he became president and treasurer in 1937. During his career, he was known for his special interest in publishing reference books, which included Roget's International Thesaurus and The Reader's Encyclopedia.
        When HarperCollins acquired the company in 1978, Mr. Crowell stepped down as president and served as a consultant. In 1980, he retired to Newfane, Vt., where he was a benefactor of the Moore Free Library.
        The company, which started as a book bindery, began publishing books in 1876 when Mr. Crowell's grandfather, Thomas Young Crowell, started his own publishing branch of the Boston bookbinder. The bindery was closed in 1920 and the company became a publisher exclusively.
        Outside the company, Mr. Crowell was a director of the American Book Publishing Council, a member of the United States Information Agency's advisory committee and a director of the Yale University Press.
        An avid conservationist and benefactor, Mr. Crowell donated tracts of land in Vermont and Maine to Yale and the Nature Conservancy.
        Born in Montclair, N.J., Mr. Crowell graduated from Yale University in 1931.
        He is survived by his wife Muriel B. Crowell; two sons, John L. Crowell of Wayne, N.J.; Timothy Adams Crowell of Underhill, Vt.; two stepdaughters, Ann Sutherland of North Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Priscilla Barnett of Kenwood, Calif.; a stepson, William B. Hutchison; and two grandchildren.
