        Rene Char, called ''the greatest French poet of the 20th century'' by Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, died here Friday, according to the publishing company Gallimard. He was 80 years old and lived in Paris. Gallimard said Mr. Char died at the Val-de-Grace military hospital. No cause of death was given.
        Among Mr. Char's best-known poems are ''Hammer Without a Master,'' written in 1934, and ''Return Uphill,'' written in 1966. ''Hammer Without a Master'' (''Le Marteau Sans Maitre'') was set to music in 1955 by Pierre Boulez.
        Mr. Char's poetry borrowed imagery from nature and from his childhood in southern France. He also wrote criticism and plays for nearly half a century.
        Mr. Char was born on June 14, 1907, in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, in Provence. After completing his education at the University of Aix-en-Provence, he moved to Paris, where he became friendly with the surrealist writers Andre Breton and Paul Eluard. He also was a friend of painters, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Nicolas de Stael.
        Mr. Char, under the nom de guerre Captain Alexander, led a Resistance unit in the French Alps during World War II, for which he was awarded the Medal of the Resistance and the Croix de Guerre. He was also named to the Legion of Honor.
        In 1945, he moved to the Luberon mountains, not far from his birthplace.
        ''In our darkness, there is not a place for beauty,'' he once wrote. ''Every place is for beauty.''
        Burial will take place Tuesday in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue.
