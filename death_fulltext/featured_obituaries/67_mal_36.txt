        Ephraim Katz, a writer and film maker, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old.
        He died of emphysema, said his daughter Alyssa, of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Katz wrote "The Film Encyclopedia" (1979), a comprehensive reference.
        Mr. Katz was born in Israel, became a film reporter and critic, then moved to the United States in 1959. In New York City he made television documentaries for CBS, including "The Taste of Sunday," one of its first in color, and later for NBC. His 1960 book "Minister of Death," co-written with Quentin Reynolds and Zwy Aldouby, told of the capture of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal.
        Mr. Katz was revising "The Film Encyclopedia" when he died.
        In addition to his daughter Alyssa, he is survived by another daughter, Laura, of Tempe, Ariz., and two sisters, Miriam Pratt, of Springfield, N.J., and Yemima Halfon, of Tel Aviv.
