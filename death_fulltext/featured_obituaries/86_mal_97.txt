        John Yeon, an architect primarily known for houses designed in the regional style of his native Northwest, died on March 13 at his home in Portland, Ore. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        A lifelong resident of Portland, Mr. Yeon's best-known work was the 1937 Watzek house, a wooden, pitched-roof house whose design exploited dramatic views of Mount Hood. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the shingled dwelling defied the machine-tooled look of the International style. Designs for the house were exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in 1939.
        Mr. Yeon also specialized in the design of museum installations and was responsible for the interior design of galleries at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo., the Fagan galleries in the Palace of the Legion of Honor Museum in San Francisco and the Asian galleries in the Portland Art Museum.
        He is survived by a sister, Pauline Joseph of Portland, and a brother, Norman, of San Francisco.
