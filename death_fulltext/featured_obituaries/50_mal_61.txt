        Nathan H. Schwerner, a retired wig manufacturer who was the father of Michael Schwerner, a 24-year-old civil-rights worker killed by Ku Klux Klan members near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, died yesterday at Sarasota Community Hospital in Florida. He was 80 years old and lived in Sarasota.
        He died of kidney failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        After his son's death, Mr. Schwerner devoted himself to civil liberties activities. He was national secretary of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee.
        In 1967, seven men were convicted of conspiracy in the slayings of Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James E. Cheney. The victims were engaged in a summer effort to help blacks in Mississippi to register to vote.
        Mr. Schwerner was a partner in the Schwerner Oppenheim Company, a wig manufacturer that went out of business when he retired. A native New Yorker, he graduated from City College and received a law degree from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Siegel; a son, Stephen, of Yellow Springs, Ohio, who is the dean of students at Antioch College, and two granddaughters.
