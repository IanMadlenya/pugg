        Robert Ferro, a writer, died of AIDS yesterday at his father's home in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J. He was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Ferro, whose fiction explored issues of homosexuality and family relations, knew he was suffering from AIDS when he wrote his current novel, ''Second Son,'' published by Crown Publishers. It tells of the romance between two men with AIDS. Mr. Ferro's companion of 20 years, Michael Grumley, died of AIDS last April.
        Born in Cranford, N.J., Mr. Ferro graduated from Rutgers University and earned a master's degree from the University of Iowa. He taught at Adelphi University and was the author of three other books.
        He is survived by his father, Michael; his brother, Michael Jr., of Harrington Park, N.J., and two sisters, Camille Burns of Haworth, N.J., and Beth Quigley of Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
        A mass is to be offered on Thursday at 11 A.M. at St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church, in Saddle River, N.J.
