        Robert Edward Waterman, a research chemist associated with the discovery and mass manufacture of synthetic vitamin B1, died Saturday at his winter home in Delray Beach, Fla., following a brief illness. He was 87 years old and a resident of Morristown, N.J.
        Mr. Waterman retired in 1962 as senior vice president for research and development of the Schering Corporation, now Schering-Plough, but remained as a corporate director until 1972.
        A native of Orange, N.J., Mr. Waterman earned a degree in chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1921 and did his postgraduate work at the New York University Graduate School of Business Administration. In 1922, he joined the Western Electric Company in New York as a chemist, but transferred to the technical staff of Bell Telephone Laboratories five years later.
        At Bell, he worked under the company's chemical director, Dr. Robert R. Williams, an internationally famous chemist and nutritionist and Mr. Waterman's future father-in-law. The two men collaborated on an after-hours project to isolate pure crystalline vitamin B1 (thiamine), also known as the anti-beriberi factor.
        They synthesized the substance in 1936 and went on to improve that chemical process to the point where the vitamin could be mass-produced for the fight against malnutrition.
        Mr. Waterman is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Williams; a daughter, Mary E. Tipson of Mendham, N.J.; a son, James P. of New Canaan, Conn.; and three grandchildren.
