        Abe Rosenberg, a retired liquor importer and distributor who was active in many philanthropies in recent years, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Mr. Rosenberg, who lived in Manhattan, was 85.
        The cause of death was cancer, his daughter, Susan Goldstein, said.
        Mr. Rosenberg and several partners established Star Liquor Dealers in Long Island City shortly after the sale of liquor became legal again in 1933 with the repeal of Prohibition. They eventually moved the business to Syosset, L.I., and renamed it Star Industries.
        Mr. Rosenberg later became a partner in the Paddington Corporation, which imported J & B Scotch, and Star Industries later acquired Carillon Importers, which brought into the country such popular brands as Grand Marnier and Bombay Gin. These two companies were eventually sold to Liggett & Myers, which in turn sold them to Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.
        He was also president of the Stella and Charles Guttman Foundation and the Sunny and Abe Rosenberg Foundation, both of which donate funds to medical, educational and Jewish philanthropic groups.
        Mr. Rosenberg is survived by his wife, Sunny, of Manhattan; his daughter, also of Manhattan; a son, Michael, of Dallas; a brother, Julius, of Fairfield, Conn., and a sister, Anna Oknowsky, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
