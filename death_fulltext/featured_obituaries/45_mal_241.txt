        Dr. Robert Hamilton Alway, a pediatrician and former dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine, which he helped to lead to national prominence, died Friday at his home in Oak Harbor, Wash. He was 77 years old.
        He died of complications of heart disease, a spokesman for the medical school said.
        Dr. Alway became dean of the medical school in 1957 and was instrumental in moving it from San Francisco, where it had been for 50 years, to a new complex of hospital and medical school buildings at the Stanford campus in Palo Alto.
        He created a new department of genetics, revised the curriculum and recruited highly regarded professors for the faculty, which attracted additional financing. He stepped down as dean in 1964 and served as medical director and chief of staff of Stanford University Hospital until he retired in 1977.
        Dr. Alway earned his medical degree at the University of Minnesota in 1940 and taught pediatrics at the University of Utah for seven years before joining the Stanford faculty in 1949. He left in 1953 to head the pediatrics department at the University of Colorado but returned to a similar post at Stanford in 1955.
        He also served as medical director of a Stanford convalescent home and from 1963 to 1967 was an adviser to the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development. He was a member of many professional organizations, including the Royal Society of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, Sophie; three daughters, Anne Loewe of Alexander, Alaska; Maria Connors of Vancouver, British Columbia, and Joan Alway of Arlington, Mass.; two sons, Frederick of Mount Vernon, Wash., and Theodore of Peshatin, Wash.; two sisters, Lazelle Alway and Lenore Alway, both of New Canaan, Conn., and nine grandchildren.
