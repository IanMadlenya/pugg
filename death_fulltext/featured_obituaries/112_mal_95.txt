        Judah Wattenberg, the first executive director of what is now the American Technion Society, a group that raises money for Technion, a technical university in Israel, died on Tuesday at his home on the West Side of Manhattan. He was 96.
        Mr. Wattenberg, a lawyer who specialized in real estate law, was born near Stanislav in what was then Austrian Galicia, now Ukraine. During World War I, his family moved to Vienna, where he studied at the University of Vienna.
        He went to Palestine with a postwar migration of settlers from Europe. But he contracted malaria and later went to the United States to join other family members.
        He graduated from Columbia University Law School in 1927 and was in private practice in New York until 1939.
        He then became the first executive director of the American Society for the Advancement of the Hebrew Institute of Technology in Haifa, later the American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. He was also editor of the Technion Yearbook.
        He left the Technion society in the 1950's to resume his profession as a real estate lawyer and broker. He retired two years ago.
        His first wife, Rachel Gutman Wattenberg, died in 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, Regina Charitan Wattenberg; a daughter, Rebecca Schull of Manhattan and Los Angeles; a son, Ben J., of Washington; seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
