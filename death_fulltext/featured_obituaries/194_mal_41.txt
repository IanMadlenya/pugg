        John Sanford, a novelist, historian and autobiographer who often focused his moral fables on the American heartland, especially the Adirondacks, died on March 6 in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 98 and lived in Montecito, Calif.
        His memoir of his life from 1904 to 1927, ''The Color of the Air: Scenes From the Life of an American Jew, Volume I,'' was published in 1985 by Black Sparrow. Four more volumes in the series came later.
        Mr. Sanford was originally named Julian Lawrence Shapiro and changed his name in 1940. He also wrote as Julian L. Shapiro and as John B. Sanford.
        His career was hurt by his membership in the Communist Party and his related blacklisting. He wrote mainly novels until 1975 and went on to write collections of historic vignettes as well as autobiographical and other works.
        Mr. Sanford published a total of 24 books. He received a PEN award for ''The Color of the Air.''
        A native of Harlem, he was an alumnus of Lafayette College in Pennsylvania and of Fordham.
        Mr. Sanford's wife, Marguerite Roberts, a screenwriter whom he married in 1938, died in 1989.
