        Cornelius W. Owens, a longtime employee of AT&T who was president of its subsidiary, the New York Telephone Company, during one of its most trying periods, died Nov. 14 in Atlanta. He was 92.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, his family said.
        Mr. Owens joined AT&T after college and worked his way into executive-level positions in the parent company and its local units before the breakup of AT&T into regional phone companies in 1984.
        He also served on the boards of several New York City institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange, and was the first layman to become chairman of the board of Boston College, a Jesuit university.
        Mr. Owens was president of the New York Telephone Company during the summer of 1969, when he and the company faced many problems and much public derision -- dial tones were missing, calls were misrouted and some calls could not get through.
        He was succeeded at New York Telephone by William Ellinghaus, another longtime employee, the next year and returned to the parent company as an executive vice president. He retired in 1975.
        Mr. Owens was born in Boston in 1913. He received a bachelor's degree in 1936 and was given an honorary doctor of laws in 1968 from Boston College. He is survived by his wife, Mia, of Atlanta; three stepsons, Robert Morgan of Atlanta, George Morgan of Atlanta, and Stephen Morgan of New York City; and three stepgrandchildren.
