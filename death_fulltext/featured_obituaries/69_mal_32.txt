        Richard Sedric Fox Eells, a retired adjunct professor of business at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business and a leading authority on corporate philanthropy, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 75 years old.
        Professor Eells died after surgery for an arterial embolism, said an associate, Chauncey G. Olinger Jr.
        Professor Eells argued that the corporation has a social responsibility to support education, the arts and the community. While manager of public policy research at General Electric in the 50's, he championed having the corporation match the sums its employees gave to universities.
        In his 1967 book, "The Corporation and the Arts," he urged collaboration between business and the arts.
        Born in Cashmere, Wash., he was educated at Whitman College and received a master's degree from Princeton in 1942. After serving in the United States Army Air Force during World War II, he was chief of the division of aeronautics at the Library of Congress from 1946 to 1950.
        He joined General Electric in 1952 and left in 1960, the year he became an adjunct professor at Columbia's business school, retiring in 1985. At Columbia in 1964, he was director of its program for studies of the modern corporation, which published 30 volumes on corporate social responsibility.
        Initially, the undertaking was financed partly by Armand Erpf, the Wall Street financier. From 1962 until 1982, Mr. Eells was executive vice president of the Arkville-Erpf Fund, started by the financier to support his publishing ventures.
        There are no survivors.
