        Basil Vlavianos, an educator and editor who was a prominent member of the Greek-American community, died on June 27 in Alexandria, Va. He was 91 and had moved to Alexandria from Yonkers four years ago after the death of his wife, Katie.
        Mr. Vlavianos made Hellenism the central theme of his life's work. He was the editor and publisher of The National Herald, a Greek-language newspaper, from 1940 to 1947. From then until 1961 he taught political science and regional studies at New York University. He was the editor in chief from 1978 to 1981 of the daily Proini, a Greek-language sister publication of the English-language Greek American.
        Born in Athens, Mr. Vlavianos studied law there and in Germany. He practiced law in Greece and France before coming to New York on a visit in 1939. The war in Europe stranded him, and he took over and revived The National Herald. He traveled to Greek-American neighborhoods across the country and raised funds for the Greek War Relief.
        He was a noted stamp collector and donated his sizable library to the Basil Vryonis Center for the Study of Hellenism in Sacramento, Calif.
        He is survived by his daughter, Zeta Hosmer of Washington; three grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
