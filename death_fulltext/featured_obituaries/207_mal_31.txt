        Ernest Smith, an authority on jazz music and dance, died on Thursday in the Bronx. He was 79 and lived in Bolton Landing, N.Y.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Marlene Charnizon, his companion.
        Mr. Smith, who was known as Ernie, developed an interest in jazz during his teens in Pittsburgh. His love for music led him to dance, especially to the Lindy Hop, which he continued to dance for many years.
        He worked at several advertising agencies in New York. Among them were Sudler & Hennessy and Lubalin, Smith & Carnase, where he developed a logo for PBS.
        Mr. Smith began collecting jazz films in the mid-1950's, after studying with Marshall Stearns, who with Jean Stearns wrote ''Jazz Dance: The Story of Vernacular Dance.'' Mr. Smith's collection, now at the Archive Center at the Smithsonian Institution, included an 1884 film and 352 reels.
        In the process of collecting films Mr. Smith became an authority on jazz music and jazz dance films, providing the film listing for the Stearns book. He also wrote the entry on jazz film for the 1988 edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. He contributed films to many documentaries and lectured at colleges and museums throughout the country.
        In addition to Ms. Charnizon, of New York City, Mr. Smith is survived by a sister, Jane S. Kovenich, and three daughters, Kathryn Ann Smith, Rebecca Sela Smith and Julia Louise Smith.
