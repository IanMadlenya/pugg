        Joanne Minnich, whose heart was cut out to remove a cancer and then restored to her body in an extraordinary operation that drew widespread attention last November, died on Thursday at her home in Mahopac, N.Y. She was 58.
        The cause was cancer, her husband, William, said.
        Mrs. Minnich learned in April 2000 that she had a rare type of cancer called fibrous histiocytoma sarcoma, and she underwent open-heart surgery to remove it. But the cancer recurred in September.
        She then went to Houston, where surgeons had reported success in rarely performed surgery for cancerous heart tumors.
        Mrs. Minnich said that she underwent the risky surgery in hopes that her experience would help others if not herself.
        On Nov. 14 in Houston, Dr. Michael J. Reardon removed Mrs. Minnich's heart from her chest, put it in ice in a metal bowl, and cut out three large cancerous tumors and one small one. With the heart still in the bowl, Dr. Reardon rebuilt it using parts of a cow's heart.
        Mrs. Minnich did well until March, when the cancer recurred in her abdomen and chemotherapy failed.
        Dr. Reardon said he had performed two similar heart operations on patients who learned about the procedure from Mrs. Minnich's experience. Her case led a surgical colleague to perform a third operation in Guatemala. All three patients are alive, Dr. Reardon said.
        Mr. Minnich said, ''Joanne did what she wanted to do, and that was trying to help others.''
        Mrs. Minnich was born in Bronxville, N.Y., and worked in her family's woodworking business.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Virginia, of Chicago, and Kimberly, of Yonkers; a son, William, of Mahopac; and her mother, Elizabeth Roos of Yonkers.
