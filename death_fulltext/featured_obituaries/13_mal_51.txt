        Lee Goodman, an actor and nightclub comedian, died Saturday at his home in Manhattan at the age of 64.
        His longtime professional partner, James Kirkwood, said the cause of death was respiratory failure as a complication of tuberculosis.
        Mr. Goodman made his debut at the age of 8 in Noel Coward's ''Conversation Piece.'' After serving in World War II as a B-17 tail gunner, he teamed up with Mr. Kirkwood in a nightclub and radio comedy team.
        They began by winning a week's engagement at One Fifth Avenue in an amateur contest; they stayed six months. Kirkwood and Goodman went on to play such clubs as Le Ruban Bleu, the Blue Angel, Cafe Society downtown, the Mocambo in Hollywood and the Embassy Club in London. Other credits ranged from a Broadway revue called ''Dance Me a Song'' to a disk jockey show on WOR and a two-year stint on ''The Garry Moore Show.''
        Mr. Goodman's stage credits included ''Dead End,'' ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' in which he replaced Jack Gilford, ''On the Twentieth Century,'' ''So Long 174th Street'' and ''Miss Moffet.'' In the movies, Mr. Goodman appeared in ''Imitation of Life,'' ''Bachelor in Paradise'' and ''The Music Man.''
        During the 1960's, Mr. Goodman was also known as the Man from Checkerboard Square in his role as a spokesman for Ralston Purina.
        Mr. Goodman is survived by a sister, Effie Grubb of Bowie, Md.
