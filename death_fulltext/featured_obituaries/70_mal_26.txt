        Robert Blattner 2d, president of MCA Home Video, was killed Oct. 31 in a plane crash in Grand Junction, Colo. He was 40 years old and lived in Tarzana, Calif.
        Mr. Blattner was on his way back to the company's headquarters in Los Angeles after visiting a film location in Utah. The plane he was a passenger in had taken off from Canyonlands Airport near Moab, Utah. It crashed on approach to Walker Field in Grand Junction, said Christine R. Hanson, a spokeswoman for MCA.
        An MCA publicity agent, Dale Berliner, 32, who was the plane's pilot, also died in the crash. The two were alone in the twin-engine craft.
        Mr. Blattner a native of Stamford, Conn., graduated from Harvard College in 1974 and the Harvard Business School in 1976. He worked in direct marketing in the United States and Europe before joining Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment in 1980 as director of sales. He was appointed vice president and general manager in 1981. He continued in that capacity after the formation of the RCA/Columbia Pictures joint venture in 1982 and was appointed president in 1983. He became president of MCA Home Video in 1989 and in 1990 was given the additional title of vice president of MCA Inc.
        Mr. Blattner is survived by his wife, Pamela, and two daughters, Franci, and Marcy.
        The obituary also misidentified another person aboard. Dale Berliner was an independent publicity agent; she was not the pilot, and had no connection with MCA.
        Correction:  November 7, 1992, Saturday
        An obituary on Thursday about Robert Blattner, president of MCA Home Video, who died in the crash of a twin-engine plane on Oct. 31 in Grand Junction, Colo., misstated the number of people aboard. It was three; the third was Kevin James of Salt Lake City, the pilot, who was also killed.
