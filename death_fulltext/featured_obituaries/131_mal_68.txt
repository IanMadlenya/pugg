        Uzi Narkiss, an Israeli Army general who led the conquest of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, died today. He was 72 and had cancer.
        General Narkiss was regarded as the last of the generation of Jews who fought in the pre-independence militia known as the Palmach, which evolved into the Israeli Army.
        Born in Palestine in 1925, he joined the Palmach in 1941 at 16, and was involved in the smuggling of Jewish immigrants through Lebanon into Palestine.
        He fought in and around Jerusalem in the 1948 war of independence, and afterward held a number of senior commands and served as a military attache in Europe. In 1962 he founded and directed the National Security College. In 1965 he was promoted to brigadier general and named commander of the Central Command, and it was in that capacity that he led the conquest of the Old City and East Jerusalem.
        After retiring from the army in 1968, he served with the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization.
        General Narkiss is survived by his wife, Esther, a son, two daughters and nine grandchildren.
