        Morton J. Mitosky, a Broadway lawyer and colorful backstage fixture who outlived nearly everyone of his own era, died yesterday at Cabrini Hospital Hospice. He was 91 and lived in Ventnor, N.J.
        In his heyday, Mr. Mitosky, an adviser to Broadway investors, had a behind-the-scenes part in scores of productions.
        A friend, business associate and, finally, conservator for David Merrick, the producer, he turned into a busy and consistently prosperous investor in the New York theater. He  used his own and his friends' and associates' money for the stage and became a millionaire himself in the process.
        Most Broadway shows lose money for their investors, but Mr. Mitosky's long experience shortened the odds.
        Among the moneymakers to which he gave his blessings were ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Hello, Dolly!,'' ''Hair'' and ''My Fair Lady.''
        Mr. Mitosky, who remained at work until suffering a stroke last year, was a former theatrical consultant for R.C.A. and Columbia Pictures.
        He was a native of Philadelphia and a law graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, with legal offices in Manhattan and Philadelphia.
        He was appointed conservator of Mr. Merrick's estate in 1983 after the producer was left severely speech-impaired by a stroke. In that role, Mr. Mitosky managed all of Mr. Merrick's theatrical properties for about a year, including the hit ''42d Street,'' and various other business interests in films, real estate and the securities market.
        Mr. Mitosky is survived by his wife, Joy Klein Mitosky; a daughter, Dina Mitosky of Trumbull, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Stephanie Klein of Hamburg, Germany; a sister, Ruth Frankenheimer of Philadelphia, and one grandchild.
