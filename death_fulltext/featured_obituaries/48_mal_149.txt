        Dr. Ronald G. Michels, an internationally known ophthalmologist, died Tuesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 47 years old.
        He died of cardiac complications while awaiting a heart transplant, a family spokesman said.
        Dr. Michels specialized in vitreous retinal surgery, involving treatment of the light-sensing retina. Patients were referred to him from around the world for diagnosis and treatment.
        Among his patients was the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard, on whom he operated for a detached retina.
        At his death Dr. Michels was co-director of the Retina Center at St. Joseph's Hospital in Towson, Md. He had been a professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins Medical School since 1976.
        From 1979 to 1989 he was deputy director of the Wilmer Ophthamological Institute at Johns Hopkins.
        He graduated from the University of North Carolina Medical School in 1968 and completed his medical training at Johns Hopkins. He also did postgraduate work as a fellow in retina and vitreous diseases and surgery at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami.
        Dr. Michels wrote two medical textbooks, "Retinal Detachment," and "Vitreous Surgery," and won awards for both books from the Association of Medical Illustrators.
        He served on many national advisory committees.
        Dr. Michels, who lived in Ruxton, Md., is survived by his wife, Alice, a son, James, and a daughter, Jeanine, all of Ruxton; his parents, Dr. Glenn Michels and Jean Michels of Henderson, N.C., and two brothers, Dr. Dennis Michels of Kinston, N.C., and Dr. Gary Michels of Greenville, N.C.
