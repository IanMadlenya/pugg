        Dr. Walter H. Jacobs, a retired dentist who developed individually molded rubber mouth guards for boxers, died on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of unspecified natural causes, his family said.
        Dr. Jacobs, an amateur lightweight boxer in his youth, devised the protective devices to prevent loss of teeth and cuts in the lips, tongue and cheek. Early boxers sometimes clamped their teeth on matchsticks to cushion blows. Then they tried crude mouthpieces, but their standardized shapes often made them ill-fitting and ineffective.
        For 51 years Dr. Jacobs made thousands of individual mouthpieces for fighters, including Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Floyd Patterson and Larry Holmes. He rooted for boxers using his devices, Dr. Jacobs said, "but when two of my mouthpieces are fighting against each other, I must remain, of course, neutral."
        He also made hundreds of plaster casts of the boxers' fists, a collection he donated to the Museum of the City of New York and the Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, N.Y.
        Born in Manhattan, Dr. Jacobs graduated from City College in 1925 and the Columbia School of Dentistry in 1929.
        Dr. Jacobs was a former chairman of the First District Dental Society, a founder of the New York Shell Club and a charter member of the American Revolution Round Table. He retired in 1985.
        Surviving are his wife of 60 years, the former Fritzi Hurewitz; three sons, Daniel I. of Manhattan, Jonathan E. of Sea Cliff, L.I., and David W. of East Lyme, Conn.
