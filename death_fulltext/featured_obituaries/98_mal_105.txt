        The Rev. William Francis Hogan, procurator general of the Roman Catholic Congregation of Holy Cross, died last Wednesday at Salvator Mundi Hospital in Rome. He was 64.
        He suffered a brief illness, said a spokesman for the Robert J. Kane Funeral Home in South Easton, Mass.
        Father Hogan formerly taught theology at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass. At his death he was the official liaison of his order, conducting all business requiring Vatican action.
        He was born in Tewksbury, Mass., and studied at Holy Cross Seminary in North Easton, the University of Notre Dame, Holy Cross College in Washington and Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained in his order's Eastern Province in 1956.
        Father Hogan taught at Stonehill until 1966, when he went to the Vatican as Superior of the Holy Cross House of Studies. He later served as Provincial of the Eastern Province based in Bridgeport, Conn.
        He returned to the Vatican in 1974 and became the link for different religious congregations seeking Vatican approval of their revised ground rules in accordance with the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65. He helped congregations around the world to update their constitutions and served the church in various administrative positions.
        He is survived by a sister, Eleanor Hoffman of Dedham, Mass.
