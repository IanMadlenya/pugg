        Mr. Colos, who was born in Hungary, studied in Budapest and Paris. He fled Hungary after the 1956 uprising and came to this country in the 1970's. Originally named Szalay, he used Colos as the signature on his drawings, which were regularly featured in The New York Times Week in Review and the Op-Ed pages.
        Mr. Colos is survived by his wife, Michelle.
