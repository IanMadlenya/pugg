        Frank Hayes Wheaton Jr., who served for three decades as head of Wheaton Industries, a Millville, N.J., glass manufacturer founded by his grandfather, died on July 21 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 85 and a lifelong resident of Millville.
        Wheaton Industries, formerly the Wheaton Glass Works, was built into the country's largest family-operated glass company by his father, and Mr. Wheaton expanded its operations overseas. Wheaton makes everything from fine crystal to table glassware to plastic bottles.
        Mr. Wheaton entered the family business in 1935 after attending Boston College. He became chief executive in the mid-1950's and served until dissatisfied family members replaced him in 1991. The company was later sold to Alusuisse-Lonza Holding Ltd. of Zurich.
        Mr. Wheaton was president of Wheaton Village, a glass museum in Millville that he founded and endowed. A boating enthusiast, he also served as president of the Dorchester Shipbuilding Corporation.
        Mr. Wheaton is survived by his wife, Mary Bainbridge Wheaton; a son, Frank H. 3d, of Jacksonville, Fla.; three daughters, Mary Edith Smith of Newington, N.H., Susan H. Ball of Greenwich, Conn., and Nancy Wheaton of Gardnerville, Nev.; a brother, Laur Don Wheaton of Rose Hill, Va.; 13 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
