        B. H. Haggin, an American music critic noted for his passionate convictions and clean, cutting prose style, died yesterday after a short illness. He was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Over the course of his long career, which spanned six decades, Mr. Haggin contributed articles on music and dance to a wide variety of publications. From 1939 to 1957, his period of greatest influence, he was the music critic of The Nation; the best of these articles were later collected and published as ''Music in the Nation'' (1949).
        The poet and critic Randall Jarrell wrote in a review of that volume: ''Mr. Haggin is, as anybody can see, a born critic: The reader of 'Music in the Nation' gets to observe something rare and wonderful, a man who is doing exactly what he was put in the world to do.''
        Mr. Haggin's other books include ''A Book of the Symphony'' (1937); ''Music on Records'' (1938, revised 1945); ''Music for the Man who Enjoys 'Hamlet' '' (1944); ''Conversations with Toscanini'' (1959, revised 1979); ''Music Observed'' (1964, reissued as ''35 Years of Music,'' 1974); ''The Toscanini Musicians Knew'' (1967); ''The New Listener's Companion and Record Guide''(1967, revised 1978); ''A Decade of Music'' (1973) and ''Music and Ballet: 1973-1983'' (1984).
        ''The equipment I began with was a musician's ear, and an ability to assemble words in orderly, clear statements,'' Mr. Haggin said in an interview with The SoHo Weekly News in 1980. ''And this remained the equipment with which, as I continued, I heard more and wrote better.'' Praised for Writing Style
        Not all would agree with the latter statement, for Mr. Haggin's early writing is generally considered to be his best. At a time when much music criticism tended to be effusive and flowery, his sharp, elegant prose came as a bracing surprise.
        But many found his opinions narrow. He had no sympathy for most 20th-century music - he deplored Bartok, Schoenberg, Ives, most of the works of Berg, and virtually everyone who came after them - and worshipped certain artists, notably Arturo Toscanini, at the expense of all others. In his later work, he also developed the habit of attacking other critics, sometimes vitriolically.
        Bernard H. Haggin was born in New York on Dec. 29, 1900. He published his first article in 1923 and continued to write through the late 1980's. He was the music critic of The Brooklyn Daily Eagle from 1934 to 1937; from 1946 to 1949, he wrote a column about music on the radio for The New York Herald Tribune. In later years, he wrote for The Hudson Review, The New Republic, Musical America and The Yale Review.
        There are no survivors.
