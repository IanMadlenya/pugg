        The Rev. David Bauer, the Roman Catholic priest who founded Canada's national hockey team, died of cancer Wednesday. He was 64 years old.
        In the 1960's, as international hockey was being dominated by the Soviet Union, Father Bauer conceived the idea of a national team composed of amateur players.
        One of the arenas used at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, was named after him.
        He was born Nov. 2, 1924, in Waterloo, Ontario. His older brother, Bobby, who died in 1964, joined Woody Dumart and Milt Schmidt to form the famous Kraut Line that led the Boston Bruins to Stanley Cup championships in 1939 and 1941.
        David Bauer was a member of the Oshawa Generals, who won the Memorial Cup, the championship of junior hockey, in 1945. A year later, he entered the novitiate of the Bashian Fathers to study for the priesthood.
        After being ordained in 1953, he was a teacher and hockey coach at St. Michael's College in Toronto. His team won the Memorial Cup in 1961 in the last year the school participated in major junior hockey. He then coached at St. Mark's College at the University of British Columbia. He also coached Canada's 1964 Olympic squad and managed the 1968 team.
