        Max Epstein, a conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his family said.
        Mr. Epstein joined the Metropolitan Opera in 1984 as an assistant conductor. After his public debut there in 1986, with Mozart's "Nozze di Figaro," he conducted Wagner's "Lohengrin" and "Walkure," Bizet's "Carmen" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte."
        In 1987 Mr. Epstein led a new production of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" at the Opera Company of Philadelphia and supervised for the Salzburg Festival in Austria the musical preparation of Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron," which was eventually conducted by James Levine.
        Mr. Epstein was born in Bay City, Tex. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1973 and later studied conducting in Vienna with Hans Swarowsky. From 1980 to 1986 he worked at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany, where he assisted Mr. Levine on the centennial production of Wagner's "Parsifal" and Sir Georg Solti on the 1983 production of the "Ring" cycle.
        He is survived by his parents, Melvyn and Renee Epstein of Bay City; two sisters, Betty, of Austin, Tex., and Jane Fraser of Dallas, and a brother, Robert, of Atlanta.
