        Junnosuke Ofusa, the Japanese journalist who managed the Tokyo bureau of The New York Times for nearly six decades, died today in Tokyo. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Ofusa suffered a heart attack, said his son, Nobuo Ofusa.
        He was hired in 1930 by the first bureau chief for The Times in Tokyo, Hugh Byas. The Japanese Government, which in prewar days suspected Mr. Ofusa was a spy, later honored him. A Reporter and Interpreter
        He worked with more than 20 bureau chiefs and correspondents assigned to Tokyo, acting as reporter, interpreter and fixer.
        "He was a lovely man whose devotion and courage on behalf of The New York Times were an inspiration," said Arthur O. Sulzberger, the chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company.
        When the Japanese authorities decided that Mr. Byas, who was British, was a spy, Mr. Ofusa said that he, not Mr. Byas, had collected statistics about Japan's industrial output, then a military secret, and the officer interrogating him backed down.
        The next bureau chief, Otto D. Tolischus, was arrested on the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. For months Mr. Ofusa took food and clothes to Mr. Tolischus in prison, until he was sent to the United States in a prisoner exchange.
        When the American occupation army swept into Tokyo in 1945, Mr. Ofusa greeted the arriving correspondent, Lindesay M. Parrott, with a smile, saying: "I did my best to defeat your country. But now the war is over."
        Mr. Ofusa became a well-known figure in journalistic circles, with entree to political and business leaders.
        After his formal retirement in 1987, he held the post of senior adviser to The Times's Tokyo bureau.
        Mr. Ofusa is survived by his wife, Tama, his son, two daughters and seven grandchildren.
