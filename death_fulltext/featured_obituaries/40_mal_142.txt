        Herman Cohen, the president of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore from 1952 to 1986, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Baltimore. He was 95 years old.
        His death came only two days before the 115th running of the Preakness Stakes, the second of the Triple Crown series of races for 3-year-old thoroughbred horses, at Pimlico.
        Mr. Cohen and his younger brother, Ben, who were contractors in Baltimore, were among the leading members of a syndicate that purchased Pimlico from the Maryland Jockey Club in 1952 for $2.2 million. Herman Cohen became president of the historic track that was founded in 1870, and Ben was the secretary-treasurer.
        Mr. Cohen was a trustee of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations from 1964 to 1985, president of the Maryland Jockey Club during his tenure as president of Pimlico and an avid breeder and owner of thoroughbreds. He is survived by his wife, Grace; two brothers, Ben and Morris, and a sister, Bess Goldmann.
