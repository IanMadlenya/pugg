        Jane Morrison, an independent film maker, died of malaria Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya, where she was attending a film festival. She was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Ms. Morrison made a series of documentaries, followed in 1983 by her first feature-length film. Called ''The Two Worlds of Angelita,'' it was in Spanish with English subtitles and dealt with the cultural dislocation of a Puerto Rican family moving to New York.
        Ms. Morrison was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, and grew up in Gardiner, Me. She was a graduate of Boston University in 1969 and received a master's degree in media studies from Antioch College in 1975.
        She is survived by her parents, Dorothy Morrison of Randolph, Me., and Dean Morrison of Rangeley, Me., and two brothers, Dean, of Boothbay, Me., and John, of Gardiner.
