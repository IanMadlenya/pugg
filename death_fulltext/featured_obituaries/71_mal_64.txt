        William L. Schaaf, a retired professor of mathematics education and textbook author, died yesterday at Delray Community Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 94 and lived in Delray Beach, where he moved this year from Boca Raton.
        Dr. Schaaf taught at Brooklyn College from 1932-63 and wrote more than 20 books about math instruction from elementary to college levels.
        Before joining the Brooklyn faculty, he taught math at the Rhodes School, Townsend Harris High School and City College. After leaving Brooklyn, he taught two years at Florida Atlantic University.
        Upon retirement, Dr. Schaaf became a consultant and lecturer for the Broward and Palm Beach county schools. As recently as this spring, he helped to prepare the examinations for annual mathematics contests for students in Palm Beach.
        In his later years he also wrote a book on mathematical themes depicted in postage stamps, a biography of Karl Friederich Gauss, a mathematician, and an Encyclopedia Britannica article titled "Number Games and Other Mathematical Recreations."
        Born in Manhattan, Dr. Schaaf grew up there and in the Bronx. He graduated from Columbia College and earned a doctorate at Teachers College.
        His first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 56 years, the former Jennie Cooperstein; their two sons, Robert, of Vestal, N.Y., and Peter, of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
