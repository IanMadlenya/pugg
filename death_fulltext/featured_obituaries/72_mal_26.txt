        George R. Collins, an art history professor who was a leading scholar and champion of Antonio Gaudi's distinctive architecture, died yesterday in Falmouth, Mass. He was 75 years old.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease in a nursing home, said his wife, Christiane.
        Mr. Collins, a professor at Columbia University for 40 years, wrote 26 books and articles on Gaudi. They included "Antonio Gaudi" (1960), the first book in English on Gaudi.
        Mr. Collins founded the definitive collection on Gaudi and his Catalan "modernismo" style, the Amigos de Gaudi U.S.A., which became the George R. Collins Archive of Catalan Art and Architecture at the Art Institute of Chicago.
        He also organized exhibitions for galleries and museums. His showing of nearly 100 newly recovered Gaudi drawings at the Drawing Center in New York in 1977 was regarded as one of the major architectural exhibitions of the year. He was also an adviser on a 1965 film on Gaudi. Student of City Planning
        City planning from ancient to modern times was another of his specialties. With his wife, also an art historian, he wrote "Camillo Sitte and the Birth of Modern City Planning" (1965). He also edited nine volumes in the "Cities and Planning" series published by George Braziller.
        Mr. Collins was born in Springfield, Mass. He graduated from Princeton in 1939 and earned a master of fine arts degree there in 1942.
        In 1946 he joined the Columbia faculty. He also served on the University Senate and other panels. He retired in 1986.
        Mr. Collins won a Guggenheim fellowship and grants from the Rockefeller Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies.
        He is survived by his wife; three sons, David, of San Francisco, Nicolas, of Amsterdam, and Luke, of Chicago, and a grandson.
