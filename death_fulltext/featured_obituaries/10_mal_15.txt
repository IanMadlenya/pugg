        The Rev. Dr. R.B.Y. Scott, an Old Testament scholar and former William H. Danforth Professor of Religion at Princeton University, died Sunday at a home for the elderly in Toronto, where he had lived for several years. He was 88 years old.
        Born in Toronto, Dr. Scott was a graduate of Knox College and the University of Toronto, where he received his doctorate. He was ordained in the United Church of Canada in 1926.
        He began his teaching career at Union College in Vancouver. He moved to Montreal in 1931, where he was a professor of Old Testament language and literature at United Theological College. In 1947 he became dean of McGill University's faculty of divinity.
        In 1955, Dr. Scott was appointed Danforth professor in the newly formed department of religion at Princeton. He served as department chairman from 1963 to 1965, and retired in 1968.
        His books included ''The Relevance of the Prophets,'' ''The Way of Wisdom'' and ''Treasures from Judeaan Caves,'' about the Dead Sea Scrolls.
        Dr. Scott helped recover several fragments of the scrolls in 1951. They had found their way into the hands of private dealers in Bethlehem and Dr. Scott bought them on behalf of McGill. They are now in a museum in Israel. His first wife died in 1979. He is survived by his second wife, Ruth; a daughter, Mary Poapst of Toronto; two sons, John, of Ottawa, and Gavin, of Chicago, and 11 grandchildren.
