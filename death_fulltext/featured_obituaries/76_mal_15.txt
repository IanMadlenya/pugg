        Mick Ronson, the former lead guitarist for David Bowie's band, and a rock music producer, died on Friday in London. He was 46.
        The cause was cancer of the liver, British newspapers reported.
        Mr. Ronson was a hard-rock guitarist who also understood melody, and his chunky chords and riffs put a firm rock foundation under the ironies of Mr. Bowie's androgynous glam-rock. Songs like "Suffragette City" helped to establish the proportions of a genre that survived the 1970's and thrived anew in the 1980's as so-called lite metal.
        Mr. Ronson joined Mr. Bowie's band, the Spiders From Mars, in the late 1960's, playing on the albums "The Man Who Sold the World" and "Hunky Dory.' He was credited as co-arranger and guitarist on the 1972 album "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars," which established Mr. Bowie as a star. He also performed and arranged on Lou Reed's 1972 album "Transformer," including the hit "Walk on the Wild Side," and performed on Mr. Bowie's 1973 album "Aladdin Sane."
        After the Spiders disbanded, Mr. Ronson released two solo albums, "Slaughter on 10th Avenue" and "Play, Don't Worry," in 1974 and 1975. He joined Mott the Hoople in 1974, and continued working with the band's singer, Ian Hunter, during Mr. Hunter's mid-1970's solo career. In the mid-1970's, he toured with Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue. He also produced "Cardiff Rose," a 1976 album by Roger McGuinn, formerly of the Byrds.
        He rejoined Mr. Hunter to collaborate on the album "Y.U.I. Orta" in 1990, and in 1992 he produced "Your Arsenal" by the English singer and songwriter Morrissey.
        He is survived by his wife, Suzy Fussey, from whom he was separated, and a daughter.
