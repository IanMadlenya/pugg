        Dr. Ian A. H. Munro, a crusading editor of the British medical journal The Lancet for 12 years, died in a hospital in Kent, England, on Jan. 22. He was 73.
        The cause was complications of surgery, said David Sharp, deputy editor of The Lancet.
        Dr. Munro brought the passion of a reformer to his work, continuing The Lancet's tradition of championing Britain's National Health Service, which was begun in 1948 to provide free medical care but which has struggled with declining resources in recent decades. Although the troubles of the health service have prompted many in Britain to seek private care, Dr. Munro was a National Health Service patient.
        He was also a prominent advocate for human rights, serving as the first president of Physicians for Human Rights U.K. His editorials opposed the use of nuclear weapons and called for better medical care for people in developing countries and for population control.
        ''He was a radical journalist more than a medical science editor,'' Mr. Sharp said. ''I suspect he was happiest writing editorials about things like abortion-law reform -- medical-social issues -- rather than the latest on DNA.''
        Ian Arthur Hoyle Munro was born in Bradford, England, on Nov. 5, 1923. He qualified as a radiologist at Guy's Hospital in London in 1946 and practiced medicine for three years.
        Dr. Munro's career as a medical journalist began in 1951 because of a letter of thanks he wrote to Dr. Theodore F. Fox, then The Lancet's editor, after a lunch. Dr. Fox wrote later that he had hired Dr. Munro immediately because ''whoever can write a really good letter must be able to recognize a bad one and therefore has the makings of an editor.'' Dr. Munro became the editor in 1976.
        Dr. Munro married Dr. Olive Jackson in 1948. He is survived by his wife, of Sevenoaks, Kent; three sons, and two daughters.
