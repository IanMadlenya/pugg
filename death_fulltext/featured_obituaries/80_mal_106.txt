        The Rev. Christopher F. Mooney, professor of religious studies at Fairfield University in Connecticut, and winner of two national Catholic book awards, died on Saturday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He was 68 and lived at the Fairfield Jesuit Community.
        The cause was cancer, the university said.
        Father Mooney, was the author of seven books. His "Teilhard de Chardin and the Mystery of Christ" won the National Catholic Book Award in 1966, and "Public Virtue: Law and the Social Character of Religion" earned the first prize in the humanities from Alpha Sigma Nu, the National Jesuit Honor Society, for 1986.
        His latest book, "Boundaries Dimly Perceived: Law, Religion, Education and the Common Good," was published by Notre Dame in 1990. He also contributed numerous articles to journals and served on many scholarly committees.
        The Rev. Michael Boughton, rector of the Jesuit Community at Fairfield, characterized him as an exceptional scholar who had long been concerned with the "search for God in the secular," such as in the interaction of religion and law or science.
        A native of Bayonne, N.J., Father Mooney entered the Society of Jesus in 1944. He graduated in the classics at Loyola University, where he also earned a master's degree in history.  He held a master's in law from Yale University as well as doctorates in theology from the Catholic University in Paris and in law from the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
        He was the president of Woodstock College in New York City from 1969 to 1974. He served as an assistant dean of the University of Pennsylvania Law School for two years until he joined Fairfield University in 1980 as academic vice president and professor of religious studies.
