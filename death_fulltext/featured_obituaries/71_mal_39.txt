        Emil W. Haury, an archeologist and anthropologist who was influential in the study of the prehistory of the American Southwest, died Saturday at his home in Tucson, Ariz. He was 88 years old.
        He had suffered from a heart ailment for three months, said his secretary, Carol A. Gifford.
        Dr. Haury (pronounced HOW-ree) was a professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona from 1937 until his retirement in 1980, and headed its anthropology department from 1937 to 1964. He was also the director of the Arizona State Museum, in Tuccn, from 1938 to 1964. Identified Indian Cultures
        Through excavations, scientific analysis and writings, he was instrumental in identifying and defining the prehistoric Mogollon Indian culture that flourished for several centuries before A.D. 1000 in what is now eastern Arizona and western New Mexico.
        That farming culture was characterized by houses that were partly dug into the soil and by what scientists call brownware pottery.
        In 1964 and 1965, Dr. Haury led an expedition that expanded scientists' knowledge of the development of another prehistoric culture, the Hohokam culture, which prevailed for a millennium, until about A.D. 1400, in the desert basins of what is now central and southern Arizona.
        He also helped to shape Federal policy on the preservation of archeological remains on Government land. From 1957 to 1975 he was a member of the Committee for the Recovery of Archeological Remains, a panel advising Government agencies like the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
        He was born in Newton, Kan., and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Arizona in 1927 and 1928 and a doctorate from Harvard University in 1934.
        His books included "The Hohokam: Desert Farmers and Craftsmen, Excavations at Snaketown, 1964-65" (University of Arizona Press, 1976).
        He was married in 1928 to Hulda E. Penner, who died in 1987.
        Dr. Haury is survived by his second wife, the former Agnese N. Lindley, to whom he was married in 1990; two sons, Allan, of Annapolis, Md., and Loren, of Del Mar, Calif., and four grandchildren.
