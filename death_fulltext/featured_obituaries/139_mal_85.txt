        Bernard F. Van Lenten Jr., a New York editor and columnist on the men's clothing industry who helped organize the first major private fund-raiser for AIDS research, died Aug. 15 at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        He had a long illness, according to DNR, a sister publication of Women's Wear Daily at Fairchild Publications, where he was associate publisher, editor at large and a columnist.
        Mr. Van Lenten reported from the men's designer fashion-show circuit as a regular visitor to runways in New York, Milan and Paris. He was an industry reviewer and commentator for more than 30 years.
        In 1986, as AIDS began to take its toll in his industry, he joined the organizing committee of a fund-raiser for research presided over by Elizabeth Taylor. The event was sponsored by the fashion, fragrance and cosmetics industries and by the American Foundation for AIDS Research, known as Amfar.
        Born in Paterson, N.J., Barry Van Lenten graduated from Rutgers University. In the 1960's, he briefly worked at Fairchild's Men's Wear magazine before helping to found Boutique magazine in Boston. He also set up his own fashion publicity firm, Wordesigns, and wrote a column for GQ magazine.
        He returned to Men's Wear in 1981, moved to DNR two years later as associate editor and helped design DNR Magazine, becoming its managing editor. He was promoted to associate publisher-editor at large last year.
        He is survived by a sister, Patricia Ann Van Lenten of North Branch, N.J., and a brother, Brian J., of Sherman Oaks, Calif.
