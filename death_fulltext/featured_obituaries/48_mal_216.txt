        Col. Charles W. Davis, retired, a holder of the Medal of Honor who spent more than 32 years on active Army duty, died Jan. 18 at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in San Francisco, where he lived. He was 73 years old.
        The colonel died of a heart attack, a doctor at the center said.
        He was awarded the Medal of Honor as a captain in the 25th Infantry Divison on Guadalcanal Island in World War II. A volunteer, he made his way to units trapped by Japanese machine-gun fire and then led an assault on enemy positions, breaking enemy resistance.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Joan Kirk; a daughter, Carol Denier of Clarksville, Ohio; a son, J. Kirk Davis, of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a sister, Frances Downing of Santa Rosa Beach, Fla.; a brother, Emmett of Montgomery, and five grandchildren.
