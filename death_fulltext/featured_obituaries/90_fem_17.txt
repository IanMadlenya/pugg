        Irma Shorell, a skin-care specialist and retired cosmetics executive, died on Monday in her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 69.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Ms. Shorell got her start in the industry by working for Estee Lauder when Ms. Lauder was still a small entrepreneur. She also modeled and acted.
        When Ms. Shorell entered her 30's and began to notice signs of aging in her own complexion, her father, Dr. I. David Shorell, who was a well-known surgeon, prescribed a special postoperative skin formula of his own invention.
        In 1961 Ms. Shorell formed a business with a $1,500 investment and Dr. Shorell's cream -- marketed under the name Contour/35 -- as its first product. The company, Irma Shorell Inc., eventually added a cleanser, sun blocks and other skin-care items in a full line of products for women and men. She sold the company in 1985 to Alfin Fragrances Inc. of New York.
        A column bearing Ms. Shorell's byline was published weekly as an advertisement in Women's Wear Daily until the 1980's.
