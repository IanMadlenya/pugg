        Edward M. Mervosh, an economist and business journalist, died on Tuesday at St. Clare's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 57.
        The cause was heart failure, according to his daughter.

        At Business Week, he was associate economics editor, a senior economics correspondent and a European economics correspondent based in Brussels before being named economics editor in 1980.
        After leaving the magazine in 1985, he worked as a senior editor and columnist for U.S. News & World Report. He was also a correspondent and commentator for the Financial News Network and CBS before becoming editor in chief of International Business in 1993. Mr. Mervosh left a position as a managing director for the Economist Group in 1995 and co-founded Global Business, an Internet business publication. Last year, he joined KPMG Peat Marwick as a managing editor for an on-line banking publication.
        He is survived by his companion, Patty Swain, of Manhattan; his daughter, Heather Carson of San Diego; a sister, Joyce Stromman of Cleveland, and an aunt, Nelda Perkins of Pittsburgh.
