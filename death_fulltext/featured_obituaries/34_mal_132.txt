        Mr. Jupp, chairman of the United Nations' nongovernmental Committee on Children's Rights, was regarded as a leading authority on the subject.
        His death came on the eve of passage by the United Nations General Assembly of an international Convention on the Rights of the Child, one of Mr. Jupp's main concerns in recent years.
        Mr. Jupp, born and educated in Britain, came to the United States in 1981 as a visiting scholar in comparative international social policy at Rutgers University. In 1983, he became executive director of the children's advocacy group.
        He is survived by his mother, Olive Godfrey of Worthing, England.
