        John Francis Cummings, the James Law Professor of Veterinary Medicine at the College of Veterinary Medicine of Cornell University, died on Nov. 3 in Tenafly, N.J. He was 60 and lived in Ithaca, N.Y.
        He suffered a heart attack while visiting friends, the university said.
        Dr. Cummings joined the Cornell faculty in 1967. For the last five years he headed a research team that tracked the spread of equine motor-neuron disease, a crippling affliction in horses with similarities to human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
        Dr. Cummings was born in Newark and graduated from Cornell, where he also received doctorates in veterinary medicine and veterinary anatomy.
        He is survived by his wife of 35 years, Mary Ellen; three sons, Michael, of Providence, R.I., Daniel, of Hamilton Square, N.J., and Patrick, of Eatontown, N.J.; two daughters, Tara Zigarelli of Fairfield, Conn., and Mary Anne Cummings of Ithaca; a brother, Eugene, of Reading, Pa., and six grandchildren.
