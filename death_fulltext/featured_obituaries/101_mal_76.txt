        Frederic Garfield Worden, a retired professor of psychiatry and former director of the Neurosciences Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died last Tuesday at his home in Jamestown, R.I. He was 77.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the Fagan Funeral Home in North Kingstown, R.I.
        Dr. Worden was noted as a brain research scientist whose work focused on the relationships between brain function and behavior. Auditory brain functions were his specialty.
        He joined the research program at M.I.T. in 1969 and served as its director from 1978 to 1981. The program, supported by the Neurosciences Research Foundation, is now in San Diego.
        Dr. Worden was born in Syracuse and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1939 and from the University of Chicago Medical School three years later.
        In 1952 he became a founding member and assistant professor of psychiatry at the new University of California-Los Angeles Medical Center. He advanced to full professor in 1963. Moving to M.I.T. in 1969, he served as a professor of psychiatry until his retirement in 1982.
        Dr. Worden is survived by his wife of 51 years, Kay Cole Worden; three sons, Fred, of New York City, Dwight, of Del Mar, Calif., and Phil, of Northeast Harbor, Me.; two daughters, Barbara Lundy of Jamestown, R.I., and K. C. Worden of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.
