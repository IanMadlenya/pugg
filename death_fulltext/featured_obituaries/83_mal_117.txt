        Dr. Lewis R. Koller, a retired physicist who developed supersensitive photoelectric devices and equipment for the General Electric Company, died yesterday at the Josephine M. Lilly Care Center in Falmouth, Mass. He was 98 and lived in Falmouth and Cambridge, Mass.
        Dr. Koller was a native of New York City. He graduated from Cornell University in 1917 and then earned a Ph.D. in physics there in 1921. After postgraduate studies in Cambridge, England, he joined General Electric's Edison Lamp Works in Harrison, N.J.
        In 1925 he transferred to the General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady, N.Y., where he held the title of research associate until his retirement in 1960.
        Among his early inventions were a giant, highly sensitive photoelectric cell that recorded the amount of daylight over any desired period; a photoelectric cell that acted as a traffic checker, registering passing automobiles for traffic planners 24 hours a day, and a germ-killing lamp.
        After his retirement, he moved to Cambridge and worked as a research associate at the National Research Corporation.
        Dr. Koller's wife of 59 years, Noreen Mathews Koller, died in 1985. He is survived by three daughters, Felicity K. Putnam of Falmouth, A. Noreen Koller of Cambridge and Sylvia K. Gerhard of Canton, Mass.; a sister, Hortense K. Becker of Highland Park, Ill.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
