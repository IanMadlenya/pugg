        Frederick J. Almgren Jr., a mathematics professor at Princeton University who studied the geometry of surfaces, died on Wednesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 63 and lived in Princeton, N.J.
        The cause was a complication from a bone marrow transplant for the marrow disorder myelodysplasia, the university said.
        Dr. Almgren was an early and influential figure in geometric measure theory, which is concerned with such questions as the least amount of surface area obtainable for a particular shape.
        He worked, for example, on analyzing the structure of soap-bubble clusters and the growth of snowflakes.
        He was born in Birmingham, Ala., on July 3, 1933, and received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Princeton and a Ph. D. in mathematics from Brown University. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1962 and became a professor in 1972. At his death, he was the Henry Burchard Fine Professor of mathematics.
        Dr. Almgren was a founder of the National Science and Technology Research Center for Computation and Visualization of Geometric Structures in Minneapolis.
        His first marriage, to Beverly S. Almgren, ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Jean Taylor; two daughters, Ann S., of Pleasanton, Calif., and Karen T., of Princeton; a son, Robert F., of Chicago; his mother, Sarah W., of Princeton; a brother, David, of Concord, Mass., and a sister, Linda Kime, of Cambridge, Mass.
