        Burton I. Monasch, an entertainment lawyer who became executive vice president of the 20th Century Fox film studio, died Saturday in Los Angeles. He  was 68.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said the studio's publicist, Lee Solters.
        Mr. Monasch, who was born in Brooklyn, began his legal career in New York as a litigator, then expanded into divorce and entertainment law. In 1982, he moved to Los Angeles when Marvin Davis, a college friend and owner of 20th Century Fox, hired him as the studio's chief counsel.
        He is survived by his wife, Linda; two daughters, Helaine Strauss of Roslyn Harbor, L.I., and Debra Monasch of Manhattan; a son, Grant Raider of Manhattan,  and two grandchildren.
