        Mr. Bailey's wife, Loree Catherine Bailey, with whom he owned the Lorraine Motel, suffered a stroke a few hours after Dr. King was slain and died five days later. The motel was closed last March, and a civil rights museum is planned for the site.
        Mr. Bailey, who lived in Memphis, is survived by his second wife, Eula; three sons, Wayne, Jerome and Patrick Bailey, all of Memphis; a brother, Otis, also of Memphis; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
