        The Rev. Dr. John Henderson Powell Jr., a retired minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in New York, died yesterday at a nursing home in Manhattan. He was 92 years old.
        He died of a heart attack after a long illness, his daughter, Diana Powell Ward of Manhattan, said.
        Dr. Powell was the minister of the Reformed Church of Bronxville from 1929 to 1949. He was later associated with the administrative division of the National Industrial Conference Board and, in 1954, was named director of the Camp Fire Girls Council. He was also the philosophy and religion editor of the Americana Encyclopedia published by the Grolier Society. He retired in 1963.
        He was born in Kansas City, Mo., and was a graduate of the University of Illinois and Yale University. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Edinburg.
        In addition to his daughter, Dr. Powell is survived by two grandchildren.
