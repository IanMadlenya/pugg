       Malcolm Forbes, chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine and one of the country's most flamboyant multimillionaires whose enthusiastic pursuits included yachting, motorcycling and ballooning, died yesterday of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Far Hills, N.J. He was 70 years old.
        Malcolm Forbes, chairman and editor in chief of Forbes magazine and one of the country's most flamboyant multimillionaires whose enthusiastic pursuits included yachting, motorcycling and ballooning, died yesterday of a heart attack in his sleep at his home in Far Hills, N.J. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Forbes was pronounced dead at 4:30 P.M. at his home, Timberfield, by his friend and physician, Dr. Oscar Kruesi of neighboring Bedminster, said an aide to Mr. Forbes, Don Garson, director of corporate communications for Forbes Inc. Mr. Forbes had been scheduled to see Dr. Kruesi for a physical exam earlier in the day, said Mr. Garson.
        Mr. Forbes had returned from London early yesterday, where he had been a member of a bridge team representing corporate America in a tournament against members of British Parliament. The tournament was in Mr. Forbes's home, Old Battersea House, on the Thames River. Mr. Garson said the multimillionaire had flown home in his private jet.
        Dr. Kruesi said last night he was called by Mr. Forbes's houseman, Dennis Stewart, who said Mr. Forbes had arrived home at 5:30 A.M. and asked to see the doctor later in the day.

        But later, Mr. Stewart called again, a tone of urgency in his voice.
        ''He said he had looked in and was alarmed that Mr. Forbes hadn't awakened, so I raced out of my office for the Forbes home,'' Dr. Kruesi said. ''Mr. Forbes had obviously died in his sleep. He had died very peacefully, apparently.''
        Most often pictured with a grin in the face of occasional criticism of his life, Mr. Forbes seemed to exemplify a kind of gleeful capitalism that relished the things money could buy, from macho symbols like his many motorcycles to delicate collections like his Faberge eggs.
        His worth was estimated at $400 million to $1 billion, and his life was reflected as much in the society columns as it was on the business pages. He was often seen in the company of Elizabeth Taylor and at one point was rumored to be planning to marry her. They were never married.
        'Extraordinarily Positive Force'
        Mr. Forbes's marriage to the former Roberta Remsen Laidlaw ended in 1985 after 39 years.
        Mr. Forbes made headlines for weeks last year when he flew nearly 1,000 guests to Tangier, Morocco, for his 70th birthday party at a cost of $2 million.
        The guests included Donald Trump; Beverly Sills; Walter Cronkite; Barbara Walters; the singer Julio Iglesias; the publishers Katharine Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, and the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger.
        Mr. Trump, through a spokesman, Howard Rubenstein, told the Associated Press when he learned of Mr. Forbes's death that ''Malcolm was an extraordinarily positive force in America's business and social life.''
        A Man Who Truly Enjoyed Life
        Mr. Trump said Mr. Forbes's death ''takes excitement, creativity and genuine business leadership from every American businessman.''
        Barbara Walters said, ''I don't know anyone who enjoyed life so much or gave so much back.''
        Malcolm Stevenson Forbes was the exuberant head of one of the country's oldest family-owned business management publications and at one time was also a rancher and politician.
        He pursued his varied interests with an intensity that quickly brought him success, or at least near success, like his 1957 Republican candidacy for the governorship of New Jersey.
        Ballooning a Weekend Passion
        He took his first ride in a balloon in June 1972, and was so enthusiastic that the trip turned into an initial instruction session to qualify for his commercial balloon pilot's license, which he received five months later from the Federal Aviation Administration.
        Ballooning became the weekend passion at Timberfield, the Forbes's 40-acre estate.
        Sixteen months after his first time aloft, he piloted a specially designed blue-and-gold hot-air balloon from the Oregon coast cross-country to a landing in the Chesapeake Bay. He was the first person to fly coast to coast in the United States in a hot air balloon.
        ''You think of this country as all cities,'' he said, ''but when you pass over it slowly, you see it is not. It's mostly green. Even in the midst of megalopolis, the towns are few and far between.''
        Flew Over Beijing
        He set six world records in hot-air ballooning in 1973 and made the first hot-air balloon flight over Beijing.
        Among the Forbes holdings were a Fiji Island, Lauthala; Old Battersea House; a palace in Tangier, used as a guest house, and Slegers-Forbes motorcycle agency in Whippany, N.J., which stemmed from Mr. Forbes's pre-ballooning passion for motorcycling.
        He reportedly owned 68 motorcycles, most of them Harley-Davidsons, which he seemed to be at home riding in many charity events.
        All his holdings were acquired after Mr. Forbes became publisher and the editor in chief of Forbes magazine after his father's death in 1954.
        Graduated From Princeton
        Born in Englewood, N.J., on August 19, 1919, Mr. Forbes was the third son of Bertie Charles Forbes, a Scottish emigrant who founded Forbes magazine in 1917. Young Forbes attended the Lawrenceville School and Princeton University, where he majored in politics and economics.
        Upon graduation from Princeton in 1941, he was cited as the ''member of his class who has contributed most to Princeton as an undergraduate.''
        After publishing two weekly newspapers for a year in Ohio, he enlisted in the Army in 1942. He served as a machine gun sergeant in Europe, where he was severely wounded in the thigh during combat.
        He received the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.
        In 1946, he married Miss Laidlaw, daughter of Robert Remsen Laidlaw, who was a partner of Laidlaw & Company, an investment firm founded in 1842. The couple bought the Far Hills estate they named Timberfield.
        Entering politics in 1949, he was elected to the Borough Council in Bernardsville, N.J., and from 1951 to 1957 served in the New Jersey Senate and then ran for governor on the Republican ticket with a pledge of ''No State Income Tax.'' He lost to the Democrat, Robert B. Meyner.
        Mr. Forbes is survived by a brother, Wallace, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; four sons, Malcolm Jr., of Bedminster, Robert, of Manhattan, Christopher, of Far Hills, and Timothy, of Manhattan; a daughter, Moira Mumma, of Paoli, Pa., and eight grandchildren.

        Correction:  March 3, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary in some editions on Sunday, reprinted in all copies on Monday, about the magazine publisher Malcolm S. Forbes included two names erroneously on a list of guests at his 70th-birthday party last year in Tangier, Morocco. Donald J. Trump and the singer Julio Iglesias did not attend.
