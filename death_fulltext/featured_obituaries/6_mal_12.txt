        Dr. Wise, who immigrated to the United States from Poland in 1926, was chancellor of Tel Aviv University in Israel when he died.
        He had previously served as that university's first president from 1963 to 1971, overseeing its growth from a temporary campus with 1,200 students on the outskirts of the city of Jaffa to a full university of 12,000 students in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
        He also played an active role in Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1953 he was appointed chairman of its board of governors and helped to raise funds to build the university's new campus. He left that position in 1962 to become president of Tel Aviv University.
        Born in Pinsk, Poland, in 1906, Dr. Wise graduated with a bachelor's degree from Furman University in Greenville, S. C., in 1950, and then received his master's and Ph. D. degrees in sociology from Columbia University. He taught sociology at Columbia from 1930 to 1952. He also served as assistant director of the university's Bureau of Applied Social Research.
        In addition to his academic career, Dr. Wise created two newsprint companies, George S. Wise & Company and the Inter-American Paper Corporation.
        An active Zionist, he played a major role in many development projects in Israel, including Israel Paper Mills.
        Dr. Wise had also served as the Distinguished Professor of International Affairs at the University of Miami and was a member of its board of governors.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence, who lives in Miami Beach.
