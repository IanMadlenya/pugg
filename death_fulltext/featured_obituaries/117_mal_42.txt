        Stephen J. Friedman, who produced ''The Last Picture Show,'' ''Slap Shot'' and ''The Big Easy,'' died on Oct. 4 at his home in Brentwood, Calif. He was 59.
        The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of cancer, said Ken Aguado, his nephew.
        Mr. Friedman was born in Brooklyn and attended Midwood High School. After graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and earning a law degree at Harvard University, he worked as a motion-picture lawyer for the Paramount and Columbia film studios and for Ashley Famous talent agency, the precursor of International Creative Management.
        Intent on becoming a producer, Mr. Friedman acquired the rights to the novel ''The Last Picture Show,'' by Larry McMurtry.
        The film, released in 1971, was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including best picture. Mr. Friedman went on to produce ''Slap Shot,'' ''Little Darlings'' and ''Eye of the Needle.''
        In 1984 he formed Kings Road Entertainment, a company that produced more than 20 films, including ''All of Me,'' ''The Big Easy'' and ''Jacknife.''
        He is survived by his mother, Dorothy, of West Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Susan Aguado of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.
