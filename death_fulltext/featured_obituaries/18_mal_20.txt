        Fritz Wiessner, a mountain climber whose active career spanned eight decades and who led difficult ascents until he was nearly 87 years old, died on Sunday from complications after a stroke at his home home in Stowe, Vt. He was 88 years old.
        Mr. Wiessner, a native of Dresden, Germany, who came to the United States in 1929, pioneered mountain-climbing routes around the world. He made the first ascents of Devils Tower in Wyoming and of Mount Waddington in British Columbia. Near Conquest of K-2
        Perhaps his greatest feat was his near conquest in the 1930's of the world's second-highest mountain after Mount Everest, the K-2, or Mount Godwin Austen, between Kashmir and Pakistan. The climb of the 28,250-foot peak was accomplished by an American team in 1938, before mountaineers had oxygen packs to ease their ordeal.
        In the same period, Mr. Wiessner discovered the rock-climbing possibilities of the Shawangunk Mountains, which stretch across southern New York State from Rosendale to Port Jervis. He staked out routes that remain the most popular on the East Coast.
        He develeoped a following among younger mountaineers, whom he led on new and difficult ascents in the United States and in Europe, particularly on the sandstone cliffs of East Germany.
        Mr. Wiessner, who was an avid skier, worked as a manufacturing chemist who made ski waxes for the 10th Mountain Division of the Army's Alpine troops during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Muriel; a son, Andrew, of Denver; a daughter, Pauline, of Munich, and four grandchildren.
