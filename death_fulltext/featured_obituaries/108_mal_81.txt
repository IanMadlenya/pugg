        George Smith, who coached Jack Twyman in the early years and Oscar Robertson  in his last years as he helped guide the University of Cincinnati's basketball program to national prominence from 1952-60, died of cancer on Sunday night. He  was 83.
        In compiling a 154-56 record at the school, Smith took Cincinnati to third-place finishes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament  in 1959 and 1960. He was appointed athletic director after the 1959-60 season, then became a vice president for development in 1974. He retired from the university in 1980.
        Using players recruited by Smith, his successor as coach, Ed Jucker, guided  the Bearcats to national championships in 1961 and 1962, plus a runner-up spot in 1963.
        Smith is survived by his wife, Helen, of Cincinnati.
