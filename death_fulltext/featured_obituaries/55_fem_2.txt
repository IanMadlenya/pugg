        Erma Campbell, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 49 years old.
        She died of cancer, said Margo Britton, a friend of the family.
        Ms. Campbell appeared in a number of Off Broadway and regional theater productions. In 1990, she won praise for her portrayal of a blues singer in "Ground People," an Off Broadway play about a black minstrel troupe in the 1920's.
        She appeared on television in the soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "All My Children," and had a small role in the Woody Allen film "Zelig."
        She is survived by her mother, Addie Hutchins of Los Angeles; two sons, Darrin and Raymond, and a daughter, Tracey, all of New York City, and three grandchildren.
