        Dorian Corey, a star of the documentary "Paris Is Burning," the award-winning film about female impersonators, died on Sunday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 56 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said Jennie Livingston, the director of the 1991 film.
        After "Paris Is Burning," Mr. Corey established himself as an older, wiser and wryly unflappable observer of drag life as well as a carefully put-together participant in it. "I didn't do it for the money," he said of the film in an interview this year in The New York Times. "I did it for fun. Always have. You see I was in show business for years, so when my 15 minutes finally came, it was gravy."
        Mr. Corey grew up in Buffalo. After study at the Parsons School of Design, he toured the United States in the 1960's in the Pearl Box Revue, a cabaret drag act. He performed regularly at Sally's Hideaway and at Sally's II on West 43d Street and also had a clothing business, Corey Design.
