        Lucy D. Manoff, for four decades a leader in cultural and educational institutions in Israel, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 81.
        She died of complications of pulmonary and heart disease, said her son Robert K. Manoff of Pound Ridge, N.Y.
        Among the institutions in which she held leadership posts were the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the Vidal Sassoon Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism of the Hebrew University and the Committee on Manpower Opportunities in Israel. The latter group recruited American volunteer doctors to serve with the Israeli forces during the Six-Day War of 1967.
        For more than 30 years, Mrs. Manoff was the American executive director for the Institute of Contemporary Jewry of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The institute was organized to study American historical ties to Israel and the contemporary Jewish experience worldwide.
        Mrs. Manoff played a prominent role in developing curriculums for Jewish studies in American colleges and universities.
        An early feminist, she was a founding member of the board of the Women's Campaign Fund, organized to promote the election of women to public office.
        Mrs. Manoff was born in New York City and graduated from Hunter College.
        She is survived by her husband of 52 years, Richard K. Manoff; another son, Dr. Gregory P. Manoff of Santa Fe, N.M.; a sister, Martha Deutscher of New York, and six grandchildren.
