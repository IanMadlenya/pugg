        Mr. Zimmerman's long and distinguished career included 36 years with the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, where he was the principal bassist from 1945 until 1977 and a member of the bass section for four years thereafter. He was also personally chosen by Arturo Toscanini to be the principal bass in the NBC Symphony Orchestra, a post he held from 1938 to 1945.
        Mr. Zimmerman was born in Philadelphia, where he was a member of the first graduating class of the Curtis Institute; he was hired by the Philadelphia Orchestra as a 19-year-old student. He played with the orchestra for six years, until he went to the St. Louis Symphony as principal bass player in 1936.
        He taught at the Eastman School of Music from 1945 to 1977, and for 44 successive summers at the Interlochen National Music Camp in Michigan.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane McCluskey Zimmerman; two sons, Robert and Philip, and several grandchildren and step-grandchildren.
