        George Siravo, a pop music arranger who worked with Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Tony Bennett and other singers, died on Feb. 28 at his home in Medford, Ore. He was 83.
        A longtime associate of Sinatra's, Mr. Siravo orchestrated that singer's early 50's albums, ''Sing and Dance With Frank Sinatra'' (Columbia) and (with Nelson Riddle) ''Songs for Young Lovers'' (Capitol).
        Born in Staten Island, Mr. Siravo began his career playing reeds with the Cliquot Club Eskimos and later worked with the orchestras of Gene Krupa, Glenn Miller, Charlie Barnet and Jan Savitt. After working for the popular radio program ''Your Hit Parade'' in the 1940's, he became a staff arranger and conductor for Columbia Records.
        Besides many Sinatra uptempo recordings on Columbia, his credits include Doris Day's ''It's Magic'' and Tony Bennett's ''Who Can I Turn To?'' He also recorded several instrumental albums, one of which, ''Seductive Strings by Siravo,'' featured the trumpeter Doc Severinsen.
        He is survived by a daughter, Christine Reddy; a son, Michael; and three grandchildren.
