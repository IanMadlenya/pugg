        Timothy H. Fine, a leader in franchise law, died of cancer last Friday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Fine founded his own law firm, Fine, Carter & Koenigsberg, in 1977 after working in another San Francisco office.
        Much of his practice was representing franchise holders. He was a member of the American Bar Association's committee on franchising and formerly served as its chairman. In 1986 he helped write model standards for franchise law and was a delegate to a White House conference on small business.
        Mr. Fine received his law degree in 1955 from the Boalt Hall School of Law of the University of California after getting degrees in engineering from the University of Virginia and the University of Southern California.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Ellen; three daughters, Rachel, Susan and Margaret, all in California; his mother, Emily B. Fine, of Berkeley; and a brother, Ned of Woodside, Calif.
