        Prentice Bloedel, a founder of the Canadian timber giant MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., died on June 15. He lived in Seattle and was 95.
        Mr. Bloedel retired in 1951 when a merger created MacMillan Bloedel of Vancouver, British Columbia. The company, which manufactures and exports lumber, newsprint and other forest products, had earnings of nearly $130 million in 1994.
        He and his wife, Virginia Merrill Bloedel, moved to Bainbridge Island in Puget Sound and began gardening around their French country house on a 150-acre  sweep of forest land north of Seattle.
        The grounds evolved into the Bloedel Reserve, an expanse of gardens, ponds, meadows and wildlife habitats covering about 66 acres.
        The reserve was opened to the public in 1988.
        Mr. Bloedel, whose wife had a hearing disorder, donated $5 million to the University of Washington in 1988. The gift led to the creation of the Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center.
        He also was a benefactor of the Japanese Garden in the Washington Park Arboretum in Seattle, and contributed to medical and arts institutions in Seattle and Vancouver.
        Mrs. Bloedel died in 1989. Mr. Bloedel is survived by two daughters, Virginia Wright of Seattle and Eulalie Schneider of Geneva, seven grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren.
