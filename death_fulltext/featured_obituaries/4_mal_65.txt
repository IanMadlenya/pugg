        Edward Swayduck, the former head of the lithographers union in New York City, died Thursday at the Hollywood (Fla.) Medical Center of complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 75 years old and lived in Hollywood.
        Mr. Swayduck was president of the 9,000-member Amalgamated Lithographers of America, Local 1, for 27 years until his resignation in 1975 for health reasons. He moved to Florida some years ago.
        During his tenure, Mr. Swayduck gained a reputation in labor circles as a nonconformist. Unlike most union leaders of his time, he spoke out for automation and against featherbedding. He also was openly critical of other labor leaders.
        Mr. Swayduck's leadership was credited with helping bring prosperity, labor peace and growth to the lithographic trade in the New York City area.
        He created the magazine Lithopinion, a showcase for the graphic arts. He was a trustee of the New School for Social Research and, in 1970, the school dedicated a new lecture hall in his honor.
        He is survived by his wife, Rachel; four daughters, Sarita Tier of Miami, Ethel Welt and Irene Swayduck of Hollywood, Fla., and Patricia Rosen of East Meadow, L.I., and five grandchildren.
