        Charles William Hagen Jr., a professor emeritus of biology at Indiana University who researched the basic chemistry of plant development, died on Nov. 5 at Meadowbrook Retirement Community in Bloomington, Ind. He was 78.
        The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, the family said.
        A native of Spartanburg, S.C., he graduated from Cornell University and received a doctorate in botany in 1944 from Indiana University, where he spent his entire career. Besides being a researcher and teacher, he took on administrative assignments over the years that included department chairman and dean responsible for personnel and fiscal affairs.
        His research into plant development investigated how pigments are controlled by the plant's genes; his other principal interests included radiobiology and plant tissue culture. He retired in 1983.
        Professor Hagen is survived by his wife of 54 years, Mary Swan Hagen; three sons, Charles W. 3d of Nashville, Ind., David C. of Eugene, Ore., and Ronald E. of Honolulu; two brothers, Donald of Sparrowbush, N.Y., and Richard of Edgartown, Mass.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
