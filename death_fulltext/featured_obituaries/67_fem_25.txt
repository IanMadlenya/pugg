        Judith Berg Fibich, a dancer and choreographer who used Jewish themes, died on Aug. 19 at Mt. Sinai Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of pneumonia, said her husband, Felix Fibich.
        Mrs. Fibich was born in Lodz, Poland, and trained in modern dance there. She studied with Mary Wigman in Germany and opened a dance school in Warsaw, where she developed Hasidic-influenced works. She and Mr. Fibich, who had been her student, ran the school together.
        They moved to New York City in 1950 and performed modern dance with Jewish themes throughout the United States and in Canada, South America, Israel and the Soviet Union. They choreographed musicals with Yiddish themes and created dance for the television programs "Look Up and Live" and "Lamp Unto My Feet." From 1978 to 1988, Mrs. Fibich directed and choreographed for the Jaffa Dance Ensemble of New York, a group of dancing grandmothers that performed locally and on national tour.
        She is survived by her husband.
