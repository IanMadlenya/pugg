        Abraham S. Bolsky, a real estate executive who built some of the tallest buildings in Los Angeles, died Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, Calif. He was 68 years old.
        Mr. Bolsky, who lived in Encino, Calif., died of heart failure, said a spokesman for the family.
        He was executive vice president of the Tishman Realty and Construction Company of Manhattan, the parent company of Tishman Construction Corporation, of which he was president. Mr. Bolsky, who moved to California in 1958, was a graduate of City College of New York.
        In Los Angeles he directed the construction of the 48-story Wells Fargo Bank Building, the Broadway Plaza complex and the Twin Towers in Century City.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Stoller, and two daughters, Debbie Bolsky and Francine Bolsky, both of Los Angeles.
