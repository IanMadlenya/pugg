        John E. Kerrigan, a longtime City Councilman and former Mayor of Boston, died Saturday of cardiac arrest. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Kerrigan was brought to Boston City Hospital by ambulance and pronounced dead at 3:40 P.M., said Louis Daddario, the hospital administrator on duty.
        A bachelor who lived in the city's South Boston section, Mr. Kerrigan served 15 terms on the City Council. He also served in the State Senate. In 1945, while he was Council president, he was named Acting Mayor when Maurice J. Tobin was elected Governor.
        Mr. Kerrigan was later given full mayoral powers by the Legislature but was defeated in the mayoral race later that year by James Michael Curley. He retired from the Council in 1973.
