        Judge Irving L. Goldberg, a friend and adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson and one of the Federal judiciary's strongest links to the civil rights era, died Saturday at his home in Dallas. He was 88 and died of complications of a long-standing neurological disorder, family members said.
        President Johnson appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, in 1966. Judge Goldberg remained there until his death. In nearly 29 years on the appellate court, he ruled on issues ranging from school desegregation to cold-war-era loyalty oaths to public school financing.
        Born June 29, 1906, in Port Arthur, Tex., Mr. Goldberg graduated from the University of Texas and, before his 23d birthday, from Harvard Law School. He first met Mr. Johnson, a friend of his wife's uncle, in the early 1930's. A decade later, during World War II, Mr. Johnson, by then a Congressman, got Mr. Goldberg, who was working as an officer in the Navy, assigned to the staff of the House Committee on Naval Affairs.
        In 1950 Mr. Goldberg was one of the founders of the law firm now known as Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. One of his partners was Robert S. Strauss, later chairman of the Democratic National Committee and an Ambassador to Russia. While practicing law, Mr. Goldberg was active in several civil rights and Jewish organizations.
        On Nov. 22, 1963, a few hours after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, when Johnson sought an explanation of the laws of succession, he called Mr. Goldberg at his home.
        He is survived by two daughters, Nancy Todes and Julie Lowenberg, and five grandchildren.
