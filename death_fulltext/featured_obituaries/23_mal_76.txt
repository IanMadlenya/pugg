        Ulrich Finsterwalder, a widely known West German bridge designer, died Dec. 5 in a Munich hospital. He was 90 years old and lived in Munich.
        Dr. Finsterwalder designed hundreds of bridges that were built in dozens of countries, mostly in Scandinavia and central and southern Europe. He served as a consultant in the design and construction of bridges in the United States.
        For half a century beginning in the 1920's, he was connected with a Munich-based construction concern, Dyckerhoff and Widmann A.G., known as Dywidag, long serving as its chief engineer. In recent years he had been an independent consultant.
        Dr. Finsterwalder added his voice to an international controversy earlier this year, contending that the configuration of structures known as cable-stayed bridges could lead to their cables' suffering undue vibration. That, he said, could lead to metal fatigue and other problems. Other experts disputed his contentions.
        He was born in Munich and earned a doctorate in engineering from the University of Munich.
        He is survived by his wife, Eva; three sons; two daughters, and 12 grandchildren.
