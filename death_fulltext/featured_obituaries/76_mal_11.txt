        Arthur B. Belfer, the founder of the Belco Petroleum Corporation and a philanthropist, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 86 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Fla.
        His son, Robert A. Belfer, said the cause was cancer.
        In 1939, Mr. Belfer arrived in the United States as a penniless immigrant from Poland. He made his fortune in the oil and gas business. He founded Belco in 1953, which engaged in exploration and development mainly in Wyoming and Peru and grew to be one of the Fortune 500 largest industrial companies.
        Listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1962, Belco merged in 1983 with what is now Enron Corporation, the Houston-based gas pipeline and production company. Mr. Belfer was a director and major shareholder of Enron until his death.
        Mr. Belfer had been a dealer in feathers and down in Cracow, Poland. He arrived in New York on a business trip four days after the Nazi invasion of Poland and found his money was worthless. Persuading a New York broker to purchase feathers in Europe, he set up the Belfer Corporation, which manufactured down sleeping bags for the Armed Forces. In 1950, he branched out into the foam rubber business and later into petroleum products.
        Among his philanthropic works, he established the Belfer Institute for Advanced Biomedical Studies at Yeshiva University and the R. A. Rees Pritchett Chair in Microbiology at Cornell. He also founded the Belfer Center for Energy Research in Israel.
        His first wife, the former Rochelle Anisfeld, died in 1961.
        Besides his son, Robert, of Manhattan, he is survived by two daughters, Selma Ruben of Purchase, N.Y., and Anita Saltz of Scarsdale, all from his first marriage; his wife of 28 years, Diane; a brother, Norman Belfer of Palm Beach, Fla.; nine grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
