        Christopher Lynch, an Irish tenor who sang on the "Voice of Firestone" shows on radio and television, died on April 15 at his home in Worcestershire, England. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Fred Manning, a family friend.
        Mr. Lynch was born in County Limerick, Ireland. A protege of the great Irish tenor John McCormack, he moved to the United States in 1946 when he was chosen by Harvey Firestone to succeed Richard Crooks as the lead tenor on "Voice of Firestone," first on radio and later on television. He stayed with the show until 1954.
        Mr. Lynch often toured the United States, appearing with orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy. He also sang the songs for the film "The Hills of Ireland" and recorded for RCA and Columbia.
        He is survived by his wife, Yvonne; three sons, Brian, of Canada, Terrence, of Michigan, and Christopher, of Pennsylvania, and a daughter, Rosaleen, of Ireland.
