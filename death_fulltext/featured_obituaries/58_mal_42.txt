        Harold K. Wolfson, a retired hotel and real-estate executive, died on Thursday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from a coronary bypass operation, his family said.
        In 1950, Mr. Wolfson founded the Craig Hotel Corporation, which is now defunct, and was its managing director for more than two decades. In the real-estate business, he worked for 25 years with Brener & Lewis in Manhattan. He advised the developer William Zeckendorf Jr. on the conversion of the Delmonico Hotel to a rental property.
        He is survived by a brother, Walter, of Merrick, L.I.; three sons, Neil, of Manhattan, Craig, of San Francisco and Wayne, of Winter Park, Fla.; a daughter, Dale Reiff, of Chicago, and a granddaughter.
