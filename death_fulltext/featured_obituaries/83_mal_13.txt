        Arthur Lodge, a longtime executive in television and radio news broadcasting, died on Sunday in Marietta, Ga. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Margaret Bailey, with whom he lived.
        In 1949 Mr. Lodge helped organize NBC television news and special events. In 1953 he formed his own production company, which made documentary and educational films for television and corporate use.
        Mr. Lodge wrote and produced more than 500 episodes of the "Industry on Parade" series that was broadcast in the 1950's and 1960's.
        He is survived by Mrs. Bailey and a son, Peter Lodge of Patterson, N.Y.
