        C. Frederick Kelley, this town's school superintendent, who earlier this year proposed offering a quality guarantee to employers who hired Canton graduates, collapsed and died Sunday while competing in a triathlon. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Kelley, who had been superintendent since 1972, collapsed after a half-mile swim, the first leg of the triathlon. The competition, held in Canton, also included a 25-mile bicycle race and a 10-kilometer run.
        Last winter he proposed what he described as a ''product warranty'' for students, under which the school system would guarantee that Canton graduates had mastered 10 areas of learning, including mathematics, reading, writing and computer skills.
        The school system would agree to retrain students, at its expense, if colleges or employers found the students deficient. The Board of Education has not yet acted on the proposal.
        Mr. Kelly was born in Fairmont, W. Va., and received his bachelor's and master's degrees in education from the College of William & Mary. He earned his doctorate in educational administration from the University of Virginia.
        He is survived by his wife, Lynda, and two daughters, Kate and Abigail.
