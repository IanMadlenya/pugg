        Remo P. Palmier, a jazz guitarist who performed with Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday and Dizzy Gillespie but won his chief fame on ''The Arthur Godfrey Show,'' died last Saturday in the Bronx. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
        He had been suffering from leukemia and lymphoma, said his wife, Margery.
        Remo Paul Palmieri was born in the Bronx on March 29, 1923. He dropped the ''i'' from his name in 1952 because ''everyone had so much trouble spelling it,'' his daughter Janis Cascone said.
        A self-trained guitarist, he became a fixture in New York's jazz scene in the early 1940's and performed with  Coleman Hawkins and Red Norvo, among many others.
        In the late 1940's he began performing with Arthur Godfrey on CBS, and taught Godfrey to play the ukelele. He did arrangements and also performed opera and pop.
        After Godfrey retired, Mr. Palmier returned to jazz clubs and released his own albums, including  ''Windflower'' and ''Remo Palmier.''
        In addition to his wife and Ms. Cascone, who lives in White Plains, he is survived by another daughter, Stephan Kiani of Manhattan; two brothers, Raymond Palmieri of Riverhead, and Paul Palmieri of Hackensack, N.J.; and two grandchildren.
