        William A. Sodeman Sr., a cardiologist and medical educator, died on Saturday in a nursing home in Tampa, Fla. He was 88 and had lived in Tampa since his retirement about 20 years ago.
        Dr. Sodeman was a former president of Jefferson Medical College, now Thomas Jefferson University, in Philadelphia.
        He was the author of numerous publications and wrote the original text of "Pathologic Physiology: Mechanisms of Disease" (1950). He continued with the next two editions and then teamed with his elder son, Dr. William A. Sodeman Jr. The most recent two editions of the text (Saunder; 7th ed., 1985) were brought out by the younger Dr. Sodeman and his brother, Dr. Thomas M. Sodeman.
        Born in Charleroi, Pa., the elder Dr. Sodeman graduated from the University of Michigan and its School of Medicine. He joined the faculty of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans in 1932, rising to chairman of the department of tropical medicine and public health.
        After 20 years at Tulane he was named founding chairman of the department of internal medicine at the University of Missouri School of Medicine. In 1957 he moved to Jefferson Medical College.
        Besides his sons, William, of Toledo, Ohio, and Thomas, of Cincinnati, Dr. Sodeman is survived by his wife, Lucile Kadle Holder, whom he married in 1989, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
