        Les Trautmann, who was the editor of The Staten Island Advance for 27 years, died yesterday at his home on Staten Island. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Trautmann, who was the daily newspaper's editor until his death, suffered a heart attack, said Brian J. Laline, associate editor of the paper.
        A native of Staten Island, Mr. Trautmann began his newspaper career in 1938 as a freelance reporter for various newspapers. He joined The Advance in 1940, working first as a summer intern and later as a full-time reporter, but left when he was drafted by the Army for World War II. While serving as a second lieutenant in New Guinea and the Philippines he founded seven different Army publications.
        Upon his return to The Advance in 1946, Mr. Trautmann worked as an editorial writer, then left the paper in 1954 to become editorial-page editor of The St. Petersburg Times in Florida. He came back to The Advance a year later, and was promoted to city editor in 1962 and to editor in 1965, overseeing the growth of the newspaper to its present circulation of 80,000 copies on weekdays and 95,000 on Sundays. Praised by Dinkins
        "He cared about the community," Richard E. Diamond, publisher of The Advance, said in a front-page story published in yesterday's Advance. "He was also extremely proud that he was a teacher of young journalists."
        In a prepared statement, Mayor David N. Dinkins said, "Many are called to the profession of journalism; few perform as superbly as Les did."
        Mr. Trautmann held a bachelor's degree in English from Wagner College and a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Virginia Mackoy; a daughter, Julie Cooper of Burlington, Mass.; a brother, Henry Trautmann, of Toms River, N.J., and a granddaughter.
