        Barclay G. Jones, an expert on the social and economic consequences of earthquakes, died on May 26 at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 72 and lived in Ithaca.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his son, Barclay Jones 3d of Locust Valley, N.Y.
        Dr. Jones was a professor of city and regional planning and regional science at Cornell University, where he taught since 1961. He was also an expert on preventing earthquake damage and wrote extensively on the topic. He was a member of the executive and research committees of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was responsible for the center's program in disaster research.
        In a preface to a report issued by the center in January, he warned that the economic cost of earthquakes and other natural disasters was rising. He said: ''The existing Federal machinery for providing assistance after disasters is reaching a point where it will no longer work. It needs to be completely overhauled.''
        Dr. Jones was a key researcher in a five-year, $50 million study of earthquake hazards in the Eastern United States and the behavior of concrete and steel structures in temblors.
        He was born in Camden, N.J., and received bachelor's degrees in art and architecture from the University of Pennsylvania. He received a master's degree in regional planning and a doctorate in economics from the University of North Carolina. Before joining Cornell, he taught at the University of California at Berkeley.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by a daughter, Louise, of Columbus, Ohio, and three grandchildren. His wife, Anne, died in 1994.
