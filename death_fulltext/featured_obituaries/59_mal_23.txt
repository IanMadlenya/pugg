        John C. Miller, a retired professor at Stanford University who wrote several major books about early American history that won praise for their scholarship and analysis, died Sunday at Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 83 years old and lived in Palo Alto.
        He died of liver cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Miller wrote a dozen books about the American Revolution and the early years of the nation.
        Critics praised him for research and fresh insights dispelling myths. They said his work captured the color and personalities of history while plumbing political, social and economic forces.
        Born in Santa Barbara, Calif., he grew up in Tacoma, Wash. He was a graduate of Harvard University, where, studying under Samuel Eliot Morison, he also earned his master's and doctoral degrees in history.
        After traveling in Europe on a fellowship, he wrote his first book, "Sam Adams, Pioneer in Propaganda" (Little, Brown, 1936), which delved into the often devious methods of that founding father. It was a Book-of-the-Month Club reserve selection and was described in a review in The New York Times as a "distinguished contribution."
        His next volume was "Origins of the American Revolution" (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1943). A review in The Times said the work's urbanity, scholarship and clarity deserved "a very wide public," and it became a Book-of-the-Month selection.
        In all, Mr. Miller's career as a writer of history spanned more than four decades. His last book was "The Wolf by the Ears: Thomas Jefferson and Slavery" (Free Press, 1977).
        In his academic career, he taught history at Bryn Mawr College from 1939 to 1949 and at Stanford from 1950 to 1973.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gladys Johnson; three sons, Jeffrey B. of Friday Harbor, Wash., Charles A. of Palo Alto and John H. of Tokyo, and three grandchildren.
