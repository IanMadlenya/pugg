        David Gill, who with his partner, Kevin Brownlow, restored many classic films of the silent era, including Abel Gance's ''Napoleon,'' died on Sept. 28 at his home in Huntington in Cambridgeshire, England. He was 69.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Patricia Tobias.
        Mr. Gill was born in Papua New Guinea, where his father was a missionary doctor. He had an early career as a ballet dancer and became a soloist with the Sadler's Wells company.
        In 1955, he left ballet to work as a producer and director of television documentaries. While at Thames Television in London, he met Mr. Brownlow, author of ''The Parade's Gone By,'' about the early days of silent film. They collaborated on a film based on Mr. Brownlow's book, and discovered they shared a passion for old movies.
        In 1980, the two mounted a theatrical presentation of the film ''Napoleon'' (1927). It had been presumed lost until around 1955, when the teen-age Mr. Brownlow, scouring film archives and collections, started piecing it together and restoring it frame by frame.
        Mr. Gill and Mr. Brownlow took the film on a world tour, from Radio City Music Hall to the Colosseum in Rome. One portion of the film was shown on three screens at once. Mr. Gance lived just long enough to enjoy it.
        Mr. Gill and Mr. Brownlow formed their own company, Photoplay Productions, in 1990. Among the films they restored were ''Ben Hur,'' ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' D. W. Griffith's ''Intolerance'' and Rudolph Valentino's ''Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.''
        Mr. Gill is survived by his wife of 44 years, the former Pauline Wadsworth; two daughters, Maryon and Judith, of London, and three grandchildren.
