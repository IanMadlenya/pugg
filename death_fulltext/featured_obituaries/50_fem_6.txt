        Olga Kattan, a professor of Spanish language and literature at Brooklyn College for the last 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.
        She died of cancer, her niece, Roxanna Siman, said.
        Dr. Kattan, a 1963 Ph.D. graduate of the University of Madrid, taught at the University of Pennsylvania and at Wells College before joining Brooklyn College in 1966. For many years, she directed the City University of New York's program abroad at the University of Seville and often took groups of students from the New York metropolitan area to Spain.
        In 1988 the Government of Spain honored her with an award for fostering intercultural understanding. Dr. Kattan did extensive research on the Arabic influence in Spanish literature and recently completed a translation of a medieval Hispanic-Arabic manuscript.
        She is survived by her mother, Mania, of Manhattan; two sisters, Jeanette Siman of Guatemala City and Betty Nasser of New Windsor, N.Y., and two brothers, Antonio, of Caracas, Venezuela, and Rene, of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
