        Mr. Brown took an early stand against segregationist laws and was credited in the 1950's with filing the first civil rights suit in Mississippi.
        In the 1960's he was one of only four black lawyers in Mississippi, and one of three who took civil rights cases.
        In 1962 he was one of Mr. Meredith's lawyers in Mr. Meredith's successful bid to break the color barrier at the University of Mississippi. Mr. Brown also represented Mack Charles Parker, who was accused of raping a white woman in 1959. Mr. Parker was lynched and thrown into the Pearl River before trial after Mr. Brown had raised the issue of jury discrimination.
        Mr. Brown, a native of Muskogee, Okla., attended Illinois State University, Indiana University and the Texas Southern University Law School.
        In 1948 he sued on behalf of black teachers in Jackson, seeking salaries that were equal to those of white teachers, and he worked with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund in fighting discrimination against blacks in transportation and other public accommodations in the 1960's.
        Survivors include his wife, Jether, of Jackson; a son, Robert Jess Jr. of New Orleans, and a daughter, Jacqualyn Roberts of Jackson.
