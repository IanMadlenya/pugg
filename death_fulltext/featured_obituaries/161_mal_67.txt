        Dr. Lester Schwartz, a Manhattan psychoanalyst who taught at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 72 and had homes on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and in East Hampton, N.Y.
        The cause was cancer, said Dr. Ronda R. Shaw, a colleague at the institute.
        Dr. Schwartz was a former president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, whose members are almost all graduates of the institute. He was instrumental in the creation, in 1998, of a two-year program for psychodynamic psychotherapy at the institute, intended for people who are already mental health professionals. He also maintained a private psychoanalytic practice in Manhattan for more than three decades.
        A native New Yorker, Dr. Schwartz held posts at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (where he had earned his medical degree) and at Montefiore Medical Center. A 1966 graduate of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, he was a training and supervising analyst there from 1984 until his death.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mara Schwarz; two sons, Ralph, of Westbury, N.Y., and Theodore, of Hamden, Conn.; three grandchildren; and a brother, Martin, of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y..
        Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Dr. Lester Schwartz, a psychoanalyst, misidentified the institution from which he received his medical degree. It was New York University, not the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
