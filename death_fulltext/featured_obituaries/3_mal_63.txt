        Kent Taylor, who portrayed the dapper, crime-stopping detective in the television series ''Boston Blackie'' in the early 1950's, died Saturday at the Motion Picture and Televison Hospital. He was 80. As ''Boston Blackie'' from 1951 to 1953, Mr. Taylor played a dashing former crook who became a detective. Blackie, his girlfriend, Mary, and dog, Whitie, were renowned for solving crimes steps ahead of the police, with the detective and Mary punctuating the show with wisecracks and light asides.
        Mr. Taylor, whose name originally was Louis Weiss and who was born on a ranch outside Nashua, Iowa, studied engineering for two years after graduating from high school, then held a variety of odd jobs before going to Hollywood to pursue acting in 1931.
        He began his career as an extra, but was given a contract by studio executives who saw him on a screen test he made to demonstrate a new camera.
        Mr. Taylor appeared in such movies as ''Road to Reno,'' ''The Devil and the Deep,'' ''Death Takes a Holiday,'' ''Ramona'' and ''Mississippi Gambler.''
        Mr. Taylor is survived by his wife, the former Augusta Frances Kulek.
