        Dr. J. Murray Luck, a professor of chemistry at Stanford University and an expert on the effects of population on the environment, died on Thursday at his home in Menlo Park, Calif. He was 93.
        The cause was cardiac failure, his family said.
        Dr. Luck was an early advocate of abortion as a means of worldwide population control. A speech he made at a gathering of biologists at Stanford in 1957, in which he advocated making abortions available to those who wanted them, generated a storm of protest.
        Dr. Luck began his career at Stanford in 1926 as an associate professor of biochemistry. He taught there as a full professor from 1939 until his retirement in 1965.
        He was an attache for science at the American Embassy in Bern from 1962 through 1964 and also wrote books on malnutrition as well as science in Switzerland.
        Born in Paris, Ontario, in 1899, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Toronto in 1922 and a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Cambridge University in England in 1925.
        Dr. Luck is survived by his wife, Eroeda S. Luck; a son, Edward, and a daughter, Nadya O'Connell, both of Menlo Park, and three grandchildren.
