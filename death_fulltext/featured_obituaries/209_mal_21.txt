        Eugene Raskin, a folk singer and architectural scholar who wrote the unusual 1968 hit ''Those Were the Days,'' died on Monday at his home in Manhattan, his son Michael said. He was 94.
        Mr. Raskin, who performed with his wife, Francesca, as Gene & Francesca, wrote the lyrics and music for ''Those Were the Days'' in 1962, basing the tune on a Russian folk melody. Paul McCartney heard the Raskins sing the song at a London club in 1964 and remembered it four years later when he was looking for material for the Beatles' newly formed label, Apple Records.
        Mr. McCartney decided to give the song to Mary Hopkin, a Welsh teenage singer and multiple winner of the British television talent show ''Opportunity Knocks,'' who had been introduced to him by Twiggy, the fashion model. The song, with its catchy refrain -- ''Those were the days, my friend, we thought they'd never end'' -- was one of the first four releases by Apple Records. It reached No. 2 on the American charts in the fall of 1968 and held the top position on the British charts for one week, edging out another of Apple's first four releases, ''Hey Jude.''
        Mr. Raskin, who was an adjunct professor at Columbia from 1936 to 1976, also wrote three books about architecture: ''Architecturally Speaking'' (1955), ''Sequel to Cities'' (1971) and ''Architecture and People'' (1974).
        He was a playwright as well. His first play, ''One's a Crowd,'' was a 1949 comedy about an atomic scientist whose experiments leave him with four personalities. ''Amata,'' a romantic fantasy he wrote in 1951, was the second production of the Circle in the Square Theater.
        Eugene Raskin was born in 1909 in the Bronx and received his undergraduate and master's degrees from Columbia.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife; both live in Manhattan. Another son, Jonathan, died in 1974.
