        Ron Hays, an Emmy Award-winning multi-media artist whose creations melded computerized film, slides, synthesizers and music, died on April 16 at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey, Calif. He was 45 years old.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his business partner, Gerald Betzen.
        He won an Emmy Award in 1979 for best graphic design for the "Krofft Superstar Hour" with the Bay City Rollers and was nominated for another Emmy in 1982 for "Omni" on PBS.
        Mr. Hays was among the first in his field. His creations have accompanied symphony orchestras and provided special effects at Las Vegas nightclubs.
        His work included the special effects for the "Star Wars" concerts with Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl.
