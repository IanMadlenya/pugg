        Nikita Talin, a dance coach, teacher and director of the Harkness Ballet school, died on Wednesday at his home in McKinney, Tex. He was 75.
        The cause was heart failure, said Norma Rogers, a friend.
        Mr. Talin was a popular teacher known for his ability to encourage the most hesitant of students. He danced as a teen-ager with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet and later with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo before opening a dance studio in Dallas. His students' recitals were not the usual earnest fare but were filled with glamour because of the ballet stars he imported to dance with them. He joined the dance department at Southern Methodist University in 1965, serving as a choreographer and a teacher.
        Mr. Talin came to New York City and joined the Harkness Ballet in 1978, returning to Dallas nearly a decade later to choreograph and teach in his own studio.
