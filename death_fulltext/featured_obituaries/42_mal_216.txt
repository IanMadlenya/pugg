        Nick Pippin, an actor and the founder of the People With AIDS Theater Workshop, died on Friday at his home in midtown Manhattan. He was 35 years old.
        He died of several AIDS-related infections, his mother, Nita Pippins, said.
        Mr. Pippin founded the workshop in 1987, the first company to be composed entirely of people with AIDS. His company won an Obie award for the production ''AIDS Alive'' at Don't Tell Mama, a midtown cabaret, in 1989. The workshop's productions depicted the prejudice, revulsion and insensitivity that people with AIDS encounter in their daily life.
        ''I thought sitting around was a waste of our lives, a waste of our talents and our abilities, and a waste of ourselves,'' Mr. Pippin said in an interview in 1988. ''I wanted to create a way that other people with AIDS could do something that would be important to them and to people who saw it.''
        Before learning that he had AIDS in 1986, Mr. Pippin had been a professional actor for 10 years. He had appeared in the 1979 Warner Brothers movie ''Simon'' and the television series ''Andros Targets,'' as well as some 40 national commercials.
        Born in Jacksonville, Fla., Mr. Pippin graduated from Pensacola (Fla.) Junior College and moved to New York City in 1976.
        Mr. Pippin occasionally directed the AIDS workshop from a wheelchair because of AIDS-related arthritis. He retired because of his illness late last year and was confined to his home. The workshop itself was disbanded early this year, after all but one of its actors died.
        In addition to his mother, also of Manhattan, Mr. Pippin is survived by his father, Joseph Pippins of Pensacola, and his grandmother, Junie Roberts of Macon, Ga.
