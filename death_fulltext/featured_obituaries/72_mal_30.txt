        William G. McLoughlin, a professor emeritus of history and religion at Brown University, died Monday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. He was 70.
        Professor McLoughlin, who lived in Providence, died of liver cancer, his family said.
        A historian of American civilization, he wrote 17 books and voluminous articles on religion in Colonial and modern times, the Cherokee Indian nation, the antislavery movement, Rhode Island and other topics.
        Among his books are "New England Dissent: The Baptists and the Separation of Church and State" (Harvard University Press, 1971) and "Rhode Island: A Bicentennial History" (Norton, 1978). His latest book, "After the Trail of Tears: The Cherokees, 1839-1880," is to be published this year. Civil Libertarian Causes
        Professor McLoughlin was a former chairman and longtime member of the Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, and opposed United States military intervention in Vietnam in the 1960's.
        He was born in Maplewood, N.J., served as an Army officer in Europe in World War II, graduated from Princeton University in 1947 and received a doctorate from Harvard University in 1953. He joined the Brown faculty as an assistant professor in 1954 and became a full professor in 1963.
        Professor McLoughlin retired from the faculty last June, but in July he was appointed a Chancellor's Fellow and resumed teaching full time last fall.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virginia Duffy; three daughters, Gail McLoughlin-Elliott of Greenville, R.I., Martha, and Helen McLoughlin Duffy, both of Providence; and two brothers, Quin, of Palatine, Ill., and Frank J., of Hockessin, Del.
