        Dr. James V. McConnell, a retired professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who wrote ''Understanding Human Behavior,'' a textbook used widely in college psychology courses, died of a heart attack on Monday at St. Joseph's Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 64 years old and lived in Scio Township, Mich.
        Professor McConnell, who received his doctorate in 1957 at the University of Texas, was best known for a set of studies on learning and memory transfer in invertebrates, especially in the freshwater flatworms known as planaria.
        His experiments showed that the worms, which have rudimentary nervous systems and brains, can be ''educated'' to respond with a conditioned reflex to exposure to light and a simultaneous electric shock. His studies showed that the animal, which has the ability to regenerate a new tail or head when cut in half, transferred the reflex to the regenerated halves.
        He also studied sensory phenomena in autistic children, subliminal stimulation and the psychology of persuasion.
        For 20 years Professor McConnell was the publisher of Worm Runners Digest, a satirical magazine that often needled his colleagues. He joined the faculty at the University of Michigan in 1956, was promoted to professor in 1963 and retired in 1988.
        He also served as a research psychologist at the Mental Health Research Institute of the university from 1963 to 1980.
        There are no immediate survivors.
