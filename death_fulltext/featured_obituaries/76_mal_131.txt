        Roger Georges Morvan, a French encyclopedist, lexicographer and poet, died on May 22 in the Cochin hospital in Paris. He was 66 and lived in Paris.
        The cause was cancer, said James I. Lader, a family friend in New York.
        Mr. Morvan founded and directed the publication of L'Encyclopedie Internationale des Sciences et des Techniques, (Presses de la Cite, 1967-73), which comprises 10 volumes of more than 3,500 entries by some 800 scientists, including French Nobel laureates.
        In 1985, Mr. Morvan published his own dictionary of affixes and roots, Le Petit Retz Morvan (Retz, Paris). Earlier in his career, he worked with Paul Robert, creator of the widely used Dictionnaire Robert and the Collins-Robert English-French Dictionary.
        With the French actor Michel Bouquet, Mr. Morvan recently completed readings of his poetry on two cassettes, titled "Chants" (Editions La Voix de Son Livre, Paris, 1992 and 1993).
        Mr. Morvan had most recently been working with his wife, the American-born Christine Morvan-Hanf, on developing a system to make the French language more accessible to adult English speakers. This "Method Morvan" is based on the large body of similarities between the vocabularies of adult speakers of the two languages.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons from a previous marriage, Frank and Erik, both of Paris, and a sister, Madeleine Prou, of Nantes.
