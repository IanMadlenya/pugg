        Robert B. Gingrich, a retired Army officer, died yesterday at a hospital near his home in Harrisburg, Pa., hours before his son, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, was unanimously renominated by the Republican majority for a second term as Speaker of the House of Representatives. He was 71.
        His family said the cause was lung cancer.
        Mr. Gingrich married Kathleen McPherson in 1946. In what became a family legend he was able to adopt her 3-year-old son, Newt, after the toddler's father, Mrs. Gingrich's ex-husband, agreed to the deal in exchange for being released from the obligation to pay back child support.
        In addition to his wife and son, Mr. Gingrich is survived by three daughters, Susan Gingrich of Harrisburg; Roberta Brown of Camp Hill, Pa., and Candace Gingrich of Washington; a sister, Fern Shertzer of Hershey, Pa., and four grandchildren.
