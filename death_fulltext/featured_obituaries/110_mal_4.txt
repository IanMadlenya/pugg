        Albert Harris, a theater director and head of Theater Off Park, died yesterday at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 51.
        The cause was lymphoma, said James Randolph, a friend.
        Mr. Harris, who specialized in chamber-size productions of musicals, staged  "I Married an Angel" and "America's Sweetheart" as part of "Rodgers and Hart Rediscovered," the recent series of concert revivals at Theater Off Park. In 1986 he conceived and directed "Stardust," a musical revue celebrating the lyrics of Mitchell Parish. After opening at Theater Off Park, the show moved to  Broadway.
        Among the other shows he directed in New York were the musical version of Jean Anouilh's "Mlle. Colombe" (starring Tammy Grimes), a revival of "The Poker  Session" by Hugh Leonard, and a revival of the musical "Promenade" by Al Carmines and Maria Irene Fornes.
        Mr. Harris was born in Philadelphia.
        He is survived by his father, Albert Settimio of Woodlynne, N.J.; a sister, Anastasia Brauner of Swedesboro, N.J., and a brother, Robert Settimio of Clementon, N.J.
