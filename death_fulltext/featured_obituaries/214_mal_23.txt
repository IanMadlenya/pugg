        Chandler Harper, who won the 1950 Professional Golfers' Association Championship and became a mentor to Curtis Strange, a future two-time United States Open champion, died Monday in a hospital in Portsmouth, Va. He was 90 and lived all his life in Portsmouth.
        The cause of death was complications from pneumonia, his family said.
        From 1950 to 1955, Harper won seven tournaments on the professional tour. He played in 231 Tour events between 1933 and 1971, spending most of that time as a club pro.
        In an era when winners of Tour events often earned $2,000 or $3,000 in prize money, his purses for Tour and exhibition tournaments totaled $90,463. In comparison, Vijay Singh led in Tour earnings this year with $10,905,166.
        Harper was a tall, wiry man whose precise short game and putting offset a lack of distance off the tee. According to The Virginian-Pilot, Ben Hogan called him the best putter on Tour and Sam Snead said Harper ''could get it up and down from inside a shoe box.''
        Harper's most important victory came in Columbus, Ohio, in the 1950 P.G.A. Championship, then match play (direct elimination) rather than medal play (low score wins). He defeated Henry Williams Jr., 4 and 3, in the final after eliminating such renowned pros as Bob Toski, Lloyd Mangrum and Jimmy Demaret.
        In winning the 1950 Tucson Open, Harper took only 21 putts in the third round, a Tour record at the time. In the self-styled world championship in Chicago in 1953, he led by one stroke until Lew Worsham holed a 104-yard wedge shot on the last hole for an eagle and a then-record winner's purse of $25,000. In the 1954 Texas Open, Harper played the last three rounds in 63, 63 and 63.
        Strange recalled that his father died of cancer in 1969 and that Harper became his mentor at 14.
        ''He was not a guru like today's gurus,'' Strange told The Associated Press. ''He taught as a player. He never subdued my enthusiasm. When you're 14 and you need help, he was the man who stepped in. He was a big deal to a kid.''
        Harper was born March 10, 1914, and started playing golf at 9. He was 16 when he won the first of his three Virginia amateur championships and was 18 when he won the first of his 10 Virginia Open titles.
        He played for the United States in the 1955 Ryder Cup matches against Britain and won the United States seniors title in 1965 and the world seniors in 1968. He was elected to the PGA Hall of Fame in 1968. He played golf into his 80's (''It's good exercise,'' he said), and in 1994 he wrote an autobiography, ''My First Seventy Years in Golf.''
        His wife, Essie, died in 1994. They had no children. He is survived by two nephews and two nieces.
        Harper was a longtime friend of Bobby Jones, who won the Grand Slam of golf in 1929 and helped found Augusta National Golf Club and the Masters. Harper cherished a painting of Jones that he was given, as he put it, ''by an amateur painter named Dwight D. Eisenhower.''
