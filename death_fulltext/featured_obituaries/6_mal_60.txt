His ''Torture of Mothers,'' published in 1968, called attention to the ''Harlem Six,'' who were convicted of murder in 1964, but later retried.
        Mr. Nelson is survived by a son, Garrison Nelson of Colchester, Vt.; a daughter, Abigail Nelson of Cambridge, Mass.; a stepson, John Berry 4th of San Francisco, and a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rutherford of Newton, N.H.
