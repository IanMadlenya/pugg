        A spokeswoman for the family said Mr. Severud died of Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Severud founded Severud Associates, a Manhattan-based consulting engineering concern, in 1928, after coming to the United States from Norway. He was a graduate of the Norwegian Institute of Technology.
        His designs also included the David S. Ingalls Hockey Rink at Yale University and the Toronto City Hall, and he wrote many articles and books on structural engineering. He retired in 1972.
        He is survived by a son, Fred, of Rockaway, N.J.; two daughters, Laila Shalkoski of Willoughby, Ohio, and Sonja Susich of Miami, seven grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
