        Hermann Julius Oberth, a pioneer of the space age who worked with Werner von Braun to help develop Germany's V-2 rocket, died on Friday. He was 95 years old. Mr. Oberth died at a hospital in Nuremberg after a short illness, the Hermann Oberth Museum in Feucht said in a statement.
        He began experiments on a jet motor for the German Government in 1930 and developed a model later that year. He worked on the motor with Mr. von Braun, considered the leading scientist in American space flight development.
        Mr. Oberth joined Mr. von Braun in rocket experiments in the United States in 1955, but he retired three years later and returned to West Germany. Mr. von Braun died in 1977.
        Mr. Oberth was born near Nuremberg on June 25, 1894. At age 15, he built a model of a rocket motor described in Jules Verne's ''From the Earth to the Moon.'' After high school and service in the infantry in World War I, Mr. Oberth studied medicine, aerodynamics and physics at universities in Munich, Gottingen and Heidelberg.
        He submitted a thesis on rocket experiments for his doctorate, but it was rejected as too cursory. An expanded version was published in 1923 as the book ''The Rockets to the Planets in Space.'' A third publication of the work in 1929, ''The Way to Spaceship Travel,'' is today seen as a pioneering work in rocket research.
