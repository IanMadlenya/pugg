        Deane W. Lord, a public relations official at Harvard University for 35 years, died on Tuesday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. Mrs. Lord, who lived in Cambridge, was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said a university spokesman.
        Mrs. Lord began her career at Harvard as a public relations officer at Radcliffe College in 1958 and became director of that school's news office two years later. In 1973 she became director of the Harvard News Office, and was named director of information in 1981.
        She was a 1948 graduate of Bennington College and received a master's degree in dramatic arts from Smith College.
        Mrs. Lord is survived by her husband, Edwin Jr., of Cambridge; a son, Edwin 3d, of Frankfurt, Germany; a daughter, Mary, of Washington, and a brother, Ted Allen of Scottsdale, Ariz.
