        Edward Pulling, the founder of the Millbrook School in Millbrook, N.Y., and its headmaster for 34 years, died on Wednesday at his home in Oyster Bay, L.I. He was 92 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his daughter Lucy said.
        Mr. Pulling was born in England, graduated from Princeton University in 1920 after serving as a sublieutenant in the Royal Navy during World War I, then taught history at the Groton School for two years before returning to England to study at Trinity College, Cambridge. He earned a master's degree at Cambridge in 1924 and returned to Groton, where he was named head of the history department.
        In 1928, he moved to a similar position at the Old Farm School in Avon, Conn., and three years later bought a farm and founded the Millbrook School. It started with 21 boys and became known for the quality of its teaching and for the students' participation in the daily functioning of the school through community service.
        One student in its early years was William F. Buckley Jr., who described the experience in a 1981 article in The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Buckley concluded that article by writing, "At Millbrook, we always knew that for better or for worse, if Mr. Pulling had said it, it was, de facto, so."
        In 1971, the school, which maintains an enrollment of fewer than 200 students, first admitted girls as day students and as boarders in 1975.
        Mr. Pulling retired in 1965 and then served for many years as chairman of the Long Island Biological Association.
        He is survived by three daughters, Joan Shepard of Oyster Bay and Woodstock, Vt., Patricia Sands and Lucy Cutting, both of Oyster Bay; a son, Thomas, of Oyster Bay and Manhattan; 16 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
