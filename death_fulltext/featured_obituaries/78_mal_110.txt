        Chris DeBlasio, a composer best known for his song cycles, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 34.
        His companion, William Berger, said the cause was AIDS.
        Mr. DeBlasio attended New York University and the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with John Corigliano and Giampaolo Bracali. Among his song cycles are "All the Way Through Evening," "Villagers" and "The Endless Assent." He also composed liturgical pieces.
        His song "Walt Whitman in 1989" was part of "The AIDS Quilt Songbook 1992," a program presented at Alice Tully Hall in June 1992.
        In addition to Mr. Berger, he is survived by his parents, Thomas and Margaret Gregory of Twin Rivers, N.J., and two brothers, Philip DeBlasio of Brooklyn and Richard Gregory of Glendale, Ariz.
