        Jhan Robbins, a freelance writer and the author of a dozen books, including several biographies, died on Sept. 27 at his home in Columbia, S.C. He was 76.
        The cause was prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Robbins's articles appeared in Reader's Digest, McCall's, Redbook, This Week and other magazines. He began his career as an editor of pulp fiction Westerns and mysteries and also tried his hand at writing comic strips. With his first wife, June, he went on to write articles on topics ranging from civil rights to teen-age suicide.
        His books include ''Bess and Harry: An American Love Story'' (1980), about the Trumans; ''Everybody's Man'' (1985), a biography of James Stewart, and biographies of Helen Hayes and Jimmy Durante.
        Mr. Robbins's first marriage ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Sallie I. Prugh; two sons, Tom, of Brooklyn, and David, of Newport, R.I.; three daughters, Penny, of Haydenville, Mass., Meg, of Northampton, Mass., and Katie, of Columbia, and nine grandchildren.
