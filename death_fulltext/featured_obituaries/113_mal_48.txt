        John Davis Hatch, a collector, consultant and former museum director who donated an important collection of 19th- and 20th-century American drawings to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, died on May 30 at St. Vincent Hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 89.
        When Mr. Hatch donated 270 works to the National Gallery, Nicolai Cikovsky Jr., curator of American and British paintings, called him a "pioneer collector  of American drawings" and said that his gift formed the cornerstone of the museum's holdings of such works.
        Mr. Hatch studied landscape architecture, and took courses in Far Eastern, Near Eastern and American studies.
        He was director of the Art Institute of Seattle (1928-31), assistant director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston (1932-35), director of the Albany Institute of Art and History (1940-48) and director of the Norfolk Museum of Art and Sciences in Virginia, now known as the Walter Chrysler Museum  (1950-59).
        Mr. Hatch's wife, the former Olivia Egleston Phelps Stokes, died in 1983. He  is survived by a daughter, Sarah Saeger of Washington; three sons, John D. 3d, of Arlington, Va., Daniel L., of San Leandro, Calif., and James S., of Lenox, Mass.; two sisters, Doris Munster of Molokai, Hawaii, and Mary Mills of Portsmouth, N.H.; nine grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.
