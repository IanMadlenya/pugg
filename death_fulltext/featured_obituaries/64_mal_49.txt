        Matthew Meyer, the Scripps Howard newspaper executive who headed the ill-fated effort to merge and preserve three New York City dailies as The World Journal Tribune, died on May 7 at Bethesda Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 87 years old and lived in Delray Beach.
        He died of a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Meyer, who was president of The World-Telegram and Sun, in 1966 led the joint venture to meld it with Whitney Communications' Herald Tribune and Hearst's Journal-American.
        Before the presses rolled, a bitter 140-day strike erupted. After nine months, the paper folded.
        "It was the saddest day of my life," Mr. Meyer said in 1967. "I wouldn't take a million dollars in exchange for that experience. But, also, I wouldn't want to go through it again."
        Mr. Meyer returned to Scripps Howard as assistant general manager of the chain until 1971, then was president of the Scripps Howard Foundation until he retired in 1978.
        He was born in Tilden, Ala., grew up there and in Selma and Montgomery, and came to New York City at the age of 16. After graduating in 1926 from New York University, he worked in advertising before joining Scripps Howard as a salesman in 1932. Eventually he became advertising director, business manager and president of The Washington Daily News, now defunct, before moving to The World-Telegram.
        He was married 46 years to the former Emily Dorlon, who died in 1977. His second wife, the former Blim Hazzard, also is deceased. He is survived by three daughters, Julie Quinn of Bethesda, Md., Lillian Hoik of Providence, R.I., and Emily Zook of Pelham Manor, N.Y.; nine grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
