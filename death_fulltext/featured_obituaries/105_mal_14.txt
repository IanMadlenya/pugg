        Eiji Okada, the Japanese actor who starred in "Hiroshima, Mon Amour" and "Woman in the Dunes" and who in his only Hollywood film appeared opposite Marlon Brando in "The Ugly American," died on Sept. 14. He was 75 and lived in Japan.
        Mr. Okada was cast in a number of Japanese films in the 1950's. But it was not until he appeared in Alain Resnais's 1959 film about the aftermath of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that he gained an international reputation.
        In fact, it was his performance as the handsome, enigmatic Japanese architect who has an affair with a French actress that prompted Mr. Brando to recruit Mr. Okada for a leading role in "The Ugly American" (1963), as the leader of a fictional Southeast Asian country strongly suggesting South Vietnam.
        His most memorable scenes in "Hiroshima" were his haunting rebukes to the actress, played by Emmanuele Riva, "You have seen nothing in Hiroshima, nothing."
        But his most famous role in Japanese film was as the entomologist in the 1964 film "Woman in the Dunes," in which he discovers an attractive widow living at the bottom of an enormous sandpit on a deserted beach. He spends most of the film endlessly shoveling sand in a desperate attempt to avoid being buried alive.
        His other films, many of which appeared throughout the world, include "She and He" (1964) and "This Transient Life" (1971).
        Although Mr. Okada continued to appear in films, he devoted most of his time  to his primary interest, the theater, founding a company with his wife, Aiko Wasa.
        Before his career as an actor, Mr. Okada served in the Japanese Army in World War II and worked as a traveling salesman and a miner until he made his first film, "Until the Day We Meet Again," in 1950.
