        Alvin Z. Rosenfeld, who was vicedirector for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and a foreign correspondent for newspapers and television, died of cancer at Georgetown Hospital in Washington, on Saturday. He was 73 years old.
        Born in St. Louis, Mr. Rosenfeld began his journalism career with The United Press in Washington during World War II and later covered the Middle East for The New York Post, The New York Herald Tribune, NBC News and The Washington Post.
        In his 30 years as a foreign correspondent, Mr. Rosenfeld reported on the creation of the state of Israel, the trial of Adolph Eichmann, and the Six-Day War. During the 1964 civil war in Cyprus, Mr. Rosenfeld was seriously wounded by gunfire that left him blind in one eye and deaf in one ear.
        In 1978, Mr. Rosenfeld left journalism to become director of the Office of Public Affairs for the Smithsonian Institution. Eight years later, he became vice director for administration of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, then in its planning phases.
        Mr. Rosenfeld is survived by his wife, Judith Shepard Rosenfeld of Washington; a daughter, Dana, of North Hollywood, Calif.; two sons, Michael, of New York City and Joel, of Tacoma Park, Md.; a grandson, and a sister, Helen Abrams of Brooklyn.
