        Willis J. Winn, a former Federal Reserve Bank official and Wharton School dean who helped shape the country's economic policies in the 1960's and 1970's, died on April 11 at a hospital in Kansas City, Mo. He was 84 and lived in Trimble, Mo.
        He suffered a stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Winn was dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in the 1960's. Under his guidance, the school promoted public service and sought to instill a social awareness in its graduates. Its graduate and undergraduate programs expanded to prepare students for a wider range of professions in banking and accounting, as well as occupations like theater or hospital management.
        From 1961 to 1970, Dr. Winn was a director of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank, and he was its board chairman from 1966 to 1970. After leaving Wharton and the University of Pennsylvania in 1971, he was elected president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, where he served until 1982.
        He sat on the Fed's influential Open Market Committee during some volatile economic times under Arthur F. Burns and Paul A. Volcker, the chairmen of the Fed from 1970 to 1987. His tenure coincided with Mr. Volcker's efforts to lower the inflation rate through painful increases in interest rates, a policy that Dr. Winn supported.
        Willis Jay Winn was born in Plattsburg, Mo., and graduated from Central College in Fayette, Mo. He received a master's in 1940 and a Ph.D. in 1951 in finance at the University of Pennsylvania, where he began his academic career in 1946.
        He served as dean at the Wharton School from 1958 to 1971, as well as vice provost of the university.
        Dr. Winn is survived by his wife of 59 years, Lois Gengelbach Willis; a daughter, Judith Ann, of Shorewood, Wis.; a son, Steven J., of San Francisco; and one granddaughter.
