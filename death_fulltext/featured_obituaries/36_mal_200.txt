        Dr. Rubinstein, an authority on the pathology of tumors of the nervous system, was born in Brussels and received his medical degree from the University of London. He practiced at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx and taught at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University in the early 1960's and later taught for 17 years at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
        He and Dorothy S. Russell, a pioneer of British neuropathology, wrote ''Tumors of the Central Nervous System,'' a reference work first published in 1972. He also wrote nearly 140 scientific articles and chapters for 12 books.
        Last year he received the Merit Award of the American Association of Neuropathologists, an organization he formerly headed.
        Dr. Rubinstein is survived by his wife, Dr. Mary M. Herman, co-director of the University of Virginia Division of Neuropathology; his mother, Diane Rubinstein of Antwerp, Belgium; a sister, Odette Ross of London; two sons, Francis, of Oakland Hills, Calif., and Edmund, of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Marion Rubinstein-Salzedo of Sunnyvale, Calif., and two grandchildren,
