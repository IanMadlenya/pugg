        Mao Thawka, a Burmese poet and speech writer serving a 20-year prison sentence for a poem critical of his country's military rulers, died today in a hospital in Yangon, the Burmese capital, a Western official there said, citing a report in the Government newspaper. The poet was 64 years old.
        In reporting the death, the Working People's Daily, the Government newspaper of Myanmar, formerly Burma, did not give the cause nor say when Mao Thawka was taken from prison to the hospital, said the Western official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
        Mao Thawka, whose given name was U Bathaw, was arrested in July 1989. A former navy captain, he wrote speeches for Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma's leading dissident, who has been under house arrest since July 1988.
