        Thomas Quinn Curtiss, for many years a reviewer of theater and film for The International Herald Tribune, died on Monday in Poissy, France, outside of Paris. He was 85.
        Long a fixture on the Paris scene, he had lived below the famous restaurant Tour d'Argent, where he was a friend of the proprietor, had an egg dish named after him and was a regular at its tables, interviewing stars like Marlene Dietrich and Paulette Goddard.
        Mr. Curtiss, who settled in Paris after World War II, worked for The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times in the 1960's before joining The Tribune in Paris.
        In addition to his reviews and other articles on the arts, he was the author of ''Von Stroheim'' (1971), a biography of Erich von Stroheim, and ''The Smart Set: George Jean Nathan and H. L. Mencken'' (1998).
        Mr. Curtiss, a native of New York, developed his love of theater and film as a boy, lived and studied in Europe in the 1930's and was a critic by the time World War II began. He served in the Army, helped liberate Paris, and returned to France in 1950.
        He was awarded a Legion of Honor in 1968.
        Correction:  December 2, 2000, Saturday  An obituary on Thursday about Thomas Quinn Curtiss, a film and theater critic for The International Herald Tribune in Paris, misstated the date of his death. It was July 17, not Monday. Publication was delayed by an editing oversight.
