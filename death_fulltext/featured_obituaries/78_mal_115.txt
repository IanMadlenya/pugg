In his review of the 1992 Easter show in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called it "an object lesson in how to stage a seasonal pageant that never flags."
        Mr. Salmon received an Emmy nomination in 1985 for his choreography of the "The 57th Annual Academy Awards Show." He also did the choreographyfor Grammy Awards productions, three Steve Martin specials and the Barbara Mandrell series.
        He was choreographer for the Miss America Pageant for eight years and also staged musical sequences for the film version of Harvey Fierstein's "Torch Song Trilogy."
        Mr. Salmon was born in Wichita Falls, Tex. He graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1965 with a bachelor's degree in music education.
        He made his Broadway debut as a dancer in 1966 in "Mame" with Angela Lansbury, and also appeared in "George M," which starred Joel Grey, in 1968.
        He is survived by a daughter, Meagan; a son, Gavin of Van Nuys, Calif., and his mother, Sarah Anne Reed of Killeen, Tex.
