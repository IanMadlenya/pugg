        Robert J. Schwartz Jr., a banker who was among the first to promote derivatives as a financial instrument to help companies hedge against fluctuating currencies or interest rates, died July 15 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was 50, and his family said the cause was leukemia.
        Mr. Schwartz, who earned undergraduate degrees in mathematics and information science and an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School, was active in educating the world about derivatives -- financial contracts like stock options that are  based on the value of a specified underlying security such as common stock or foreign currency.
        He was a co-editor of three books on the subject and the founder and chairman of the International Association of Financial Engineering, which provides a forum for academics and financial executives to swap ideas. He was also one of the founders of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, a trade association for financial executives, and a frequent guest lecturer about derivatives at business schools.
        Mr. Schwartz's interest in derivatives, which have evolved into a $53 trillion annual market, was not just academic. He developed Mitsubishi Bank Ltd.'s derivative products trading operation in North America. More recently, he headed Republic Bank of New York's global derivatives business.
        Mr. Schwartz is survived by his wife, Gail Ross; two sons, Matthew and Michael, and a daughter, Alexandra, all of Scarsdale, N.Y.; his parents, Beatrice of Great Neck, N.Y., and Robert of New York City; a stepmother, Josephine Martine of New York City, and his mother-in-law, Matilda Ross of Clifton, N.J.
