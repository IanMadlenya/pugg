        Hensleigh Cecil Wedgwood, former president of his family's internationally known Wedgwood china company, died of complications of emphysema on Thursday at RHD Memorial Hospital. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Wedgwood, a native of Britain, was trained in all processes at the company, Josiah Wedgwood & Sons. Josiah Wedgwood was his great-great-great-grandfather.
        After serving as assistant director of production, he moved to New York to work with a subsidiary marketing concern.
        He became president of the company in 1945 and is credited with enhancing its reputation as well as increasing its sales. He established Wedgwood Societies and the Wedgwood International Seminar for china collectors.
        He retired in 1960 and later became a training consultant in London.
        In 1986 the company was merged with Waterford, maker of Irish crystal, to form Waterford Wedgwood P.L.C.
        Survivors include his wife, Barbara Boyd, a son and two daughters.
