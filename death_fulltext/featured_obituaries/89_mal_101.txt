        Murray Gitlin, a dancer and stage manager, died on Wednesday at St. Clare's Hospital. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his cousin, Frances Jacobs, of Syosset, L.I.
        Mr. Gitlin, who was born in West Hartford, Conn., studied with Hanya Holm, Alwin Nikolais, Martha Graham and Jose Limon, and danced with the New York City Opera, the companies of Mr. Nikolais and Pearl Lang, and in such musicals as "The King and I," "The Golden Apple," "Can-Can" and "Irma la Douce."
        He was stage manager for Off Broadway revivals of "On the Town," "The Boys From Syracuse" and "Private Lives," and was production stage manager for "The Boys in the Band" from its first workshop production throughout its initial Off Broadway run and first national tour. He was also production stage manager for the Broadway revival of "Blithe Spirit" with Richard Chamberlain, and for touring productions of "Long Day's Journey Into Night," "Death Trap" and Brian Bedford's one-man show, "Poets, Lunatics and Lovers."
        He is survived by his mother, Anya, of Boynton Beach., Fla., and a brother, Milton, of West Hartford.
