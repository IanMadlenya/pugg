        Casper R. Callen, a Manhattan real-estate executive for more than half a century, died on Sunday in Winter Haven, Fla. He was 95 years old and lived in Winter Haven.
        He died of a concussion suffered in a fall last Wednesday, his family said.
        Mr. Callen formally retired a decade ago but was still actively managing residential properties in Manhattan.
        Mr. Callen, known as "Cappy," was a founding member of the real-estate firm of Hanfield, Callen, Ruland & Benjamin, Inc.
        His wife, Florence, to whom he was married for 72 years, died in 1988.
        Mr. Callen is survived by a son, Robinson, a hotel developer in Winter Haven; a daughter, Gloria Jones of Charleston, W.Va., 18 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.
