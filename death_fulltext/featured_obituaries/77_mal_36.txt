        William Steiner, who was long prominent in the fields of direct marketing, advertising and promotion, died May 20 in his apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure, said his brother, Clyde Steiner of San Francisco.
        William Steiner was born in Brooklyn, grew up there and earned a bachelor's degree from New York University. He went on to become director of promotion for The Washington Post, circulation manager at Scholastic Magazines and business manager of American Girl Magazine, a publication of the Girl Scouts.
        He also was the founder and publisher of Garden Magazine and an executive of Drug Topics Magazine and other trade publications.
        In 1953 he founded William Steiner Associates, a Manhattan advertising and promotions-consulting firm that specialized in direct marketing and whose clients included The Wall Street Journal, General Foods and 3M Corporation. He operated it for 35 years.
        Besides his brother, who is a journalist, William Steiner is survived by three nieces: Patrice Metzler, who is in public relations; Ellen Rix, a teacher; and Vienna Steiner, a television producer.
