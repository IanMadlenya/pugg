        Leonard Frey, an actor admired for his vivid and often flamboyant performances, died of AIDS yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. He was 49 years old.
        Mr. Frey was born in Brooklyn and attended James Madison High School. Having studied art from the time he was 8, he was headed toward a career as a painter, but decided to change goals, switching from Cooper Union to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his New York professional debut as Yellow Feather in the Off Broadway musical ''Little Mary Sunshine'' and won a Vernon Rice Award for his subsequent performance in ''The Coach with Six Insides,'' Jean Erdman's adaptation of ''Finnegans Wake.''
        After playing a small role in ''Fiddler on the Roof'' on Broadway, he made his theatrical breakthrough as Harold in Mart Crowley's ''Boys in the Band,'' and later re-created his role in the 1970 film. He also played Motel the tailor in the 1971 movie of ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' for which he received an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor. Performed in Comic Roles
        As a character actor, he often played roles of a comic nature. He performed a variety of leading roles for the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center, in ''The Time of Your Life,'' ''Beggar on Horseback,'' ''Twelfth Night'' and Athol Fugard's ''People Are Living Here.'' He also appeared in plays by Moliere and Ronald Ribman at the Yale Repertory Theater and starred on Broadway in Peter Nichols's ''National Health.'' He acted in several operas, including ''Die Fledermaus,'' with Beverly Sills and Joan Sutherland.
        In recent years he had been active on television. His last appearance was in an episode of ''Murder, She Wrote.''
        He is survived by a brother, Charles Frey Jr., and a nephew, Charles Frey 3d.
