        Chris Steinbrunner, an authority on mystery films and mystery shows on radio and television, died on Wednesday night at his home in the Middle Village section of Queens. He was 59.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Robert Madison.
        Mr. Steinbrunner was a longtime executive at WOR-TV, which is now WWOR. He was also the co-editor -- with Otto Penzler, another mystery enthusiast -- of "Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection" (1976). The Mystery Writers of America recognized the duo's effort with an Edgar Award.
        "Nothing exactly like this has been published before," Newgate Callendar wrote in The New York Times. "It has remained for the Steinbrunner-Penzler team to give us a real encyclopedia." Lectured and Edited, Too
        Mr. Steinbrunner was the co-author of such other books as "Detectionary" (1974) and "The Films of Sherlock Holmes" (1978). He was head of the New York chapter of the Mystery Writers of America for more than a decade, until 1987, gave lectures, and was the longtime editor of the Mystery Writers' newsletter, "The Third Degree."
        The modern public, he contended cheerfully in a 1982 interview, "finds the mystery both stimulating and relaxing -- especially in times of national stress." Shannon OCork, a mystery writer who served on the Mystery Writers' national board, said yesterday, "He probably knew more about mystery films than anyone else."
        Peter Christian Steinbrunner grew up in Queens and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Masters degree in sociology from Fordham University. In 1953, at 19, he won first prize in a citywide contest for television scripts about American history. His was about the American Revolution.
        After leaving Fordham, Mr. Steinbrunner joined WOR-TV and eventually became its film director. He left the station in the mid-1980's.
