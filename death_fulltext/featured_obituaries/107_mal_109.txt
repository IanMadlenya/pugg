        Joseph B. Vasquez, an independent film maker whose "Hangin' With the Homeboys" won the 1991 Sundance Film Festival screenwriting award, died on Saturday at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista, Calif. He was 33 and lived in Hollywood.
        The cause was AIDS, said Mark Groubert, his collaborator.
        The award-winning film, which Mr. Vasquez wrote in 3 days and shot in 30 days, depicted an all-night adventure in Manhattan of four friends from the Bronx. Completed with a budget of only $2 million, the film featured John Leguizamo in one of his first starring roles.
        Mr. Vasquez, who earned a degree in film from the City University of New York, made two other low-budget films -- "Street Story" and "The Bronx War" -- before making "Homeboys." He had recently finished work on a new film, "Manhattan Merengue."
        He is survived by his mother, Dolores, of San Ysidro, Calif.; two brothers, Tony and Tito, of New York City, and two stepbrothers, Harriman and Raul Olave of San Diego.
