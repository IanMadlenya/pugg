        Dr. William Goldfarb, a psychiatrist and founding director of the Henry Ittleson Center for Child Research in Riverdale, died on Tuesday at a Salt Lake  City nursing home to which he had moved in April. He was 80 and had lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Goldfarb devoted his career to the study and treatment of childhood schizophrenia, a subject on which he wrote extensively. He was the author of "Childhood Schizophrenia" (Harvard University Press, 1961) and "Growth and Change of Schizophrenic Children: A Longitudinal Study" (John Wiley, 1974), as well as the co-author of "A Time to Heal -- Corrective Socialization: A Treatment Approach to Childhood Schizophrenia" (International Universities Press, 1969).
        He was in charge of the Ittleson Center from 1953 until his retirement in 1985. The center is a division of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, one of the largest mental health and social service agencies in the country.
        Dr. Goldfarb was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College. He received a Ph.D. from Columbia University and an M.D. from Cornell Medical College. He was a clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia and lectured widely in the United States and abroad.
        Dr. Goldfarb is survived by his wife of 56 years, Frances Lyons Goldfarb; a son, Michael of Port Washington, L.I.; a daughter, Dr. Deborah G. Reichert of Salt Lake City; a brother, Isidore of Brooklyn, and six grandchildren.
