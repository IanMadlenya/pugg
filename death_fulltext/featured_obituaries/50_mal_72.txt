        Nguyen Van Hieu, a founder of the Vietcong and a negotiator at the Paris peace talks during the Vietnam War, died on Wednesday, the official Vietnam News Agency reported today. He was 68 years old.
        The press agency said Mr. Hieu died in Ho Chi Minh City, called Saigon when it was the capital of the United States-backed South Vietnam. The cause of death was not given.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Hieu was president of the Vietnam-France Friendship Association and a leading member of the Fatherland Front, sponsored by the ruling Communist Party.
        He was general secretary of the Central Committee of the National Front for Liberation of South Vietnam in 1960, its founding year.
        North Vietnam established the front, better known as the Vietcong, to gather local opposition to the South Vietnamese Government and to buttress Hanoi's claim that it was not violating a Geneva agreement by sending forces to the south.
        In 1973, Mr. Hieu was a minister in the Provisional Revolutionary Government that the insurgents had set up four years earlier, and he headed the provisional government's delegation to the Paris conference that negotiated an American withdrawal from the conflict.
        After Vietnam was reunited with the fall of the South Vietnamese Government, Mr. Hieu was a deputy in the National Assembly and Minister of Culture.
