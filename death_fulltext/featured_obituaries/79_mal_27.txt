        John Chadonic, a New York commodities trader and past governor of the Commodity Exchange, died on Tuesday at Monmouth County Hospital while vacationing on the New Jersey shore. He was 50 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Chadonic was one of the most respected members on the trading floor. In his honor, all New York commodity markets halted trading for a minute of silence at 11 A.M. Thursday.
        A native of Pittsburgh, he graduated from Gannon College in Erie, Pa., and began his career in Washington. He was associated with what was then the Commodity Exchange Authority in the Department of Agriculture. Now the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the agency monitors member firms and trading activities on the country's commodity exchanges.
        In New York, Mr. Chadonic worked for J. Aron & Company before becoming a partner and head of New York operations for the Chicago firm of Stotler & Company. Stotler collapsed in 1990.
        While with Stotler, Mr. Chadonic was a member of the New York Cotton Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Coffee and Sugar Exchange and the Commodity Exchange, which deals in gold, silver and copper.
        He was elected a governor of the Commodity Exchange in 1986 and served on the 25-member body for three years.
        Mr. Chadonic is survived by his wife, Catherine Ganon Chadonic; a 12-year-old daughter, Meghan; a son, John-Michael, 10; his mother, Emma, of Pittsburgh; and two sisters, Judith Joseph of Santa Fe, N.M., and Barbara Lakotos, also of Pittsburgh.
