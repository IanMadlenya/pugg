        Edmund Anderson, a former stockbroker with an interest in music who became a producer and also influenced the career of his friend Duke Ellington, died on June 29 at his home in Quogue, N.Y. He was 89.
        Mr. Anderson, who worked for some years at his father's brokerage, Anderson & Company, met Ellington in 1936 and they remained close friends until Ellington's death in 1974. In ''Duke: A Portrait of Duke Ellington,'' Derek Jewell wrote of their friendship's early days: ''Ellington was already glimpsing other horizons. His sessions listening to symphonic music with his friend Edmund Anderson had changed him. He was reaching out to better himself, intrigued with all kinds of musical experimentation.''
        In the early 1940's the Ellington band recorded ''Flamingo,'' a love song written by Mr. Anderson in collaboration with Ted Grouya. The song became an Ellington standard. Mr. Anderson also pressed Ellington to perform in Carnegie Hall. In 1943 he and his band held their first concert there.
        Early in his career, Mr. Anderson produced jazz broadcasts for radio and then network radio broadcasts that included a program with Mario Lanza, best remembered as ''The Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy Show.'' Mr. Anderson also wrote music for and directed radio and television commercials.
        His marriages to Antoinette Johnson and Gwendolyn Seyburn Lindley ended in divorce. Surviving are his wife, Joan Bauer Uttal Anderson; two daughters, Wendy Swindell of Washington and Wellington, Fla., and Linda A. Rost of Wilton, Conn.; a son, Wesson, of Wilton; two stepsons, Bro Uttal of Manhattan and Lynn Uttal of Winchester, Va.; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
