        William Doyle, who founded and ran one of New York City's largest fine art and antiques auction houses, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 53.
        His family said the cause was leukemia, which he had fought for 10 years.
        Mr. Doyle's auction house, William Doyle Galleries at 175 East 87th Street in Manhattan, bought and sold antique furniture, art and carpets valued at hundreds of millions of dollars during the 1980's. He also specialized in purchasing estates from houses owned by the Morgans, Woolworths and Buckleys and others like Gloria Swanson, Rock Hudson, Truman Capote, James Beard, Ruth Gordon, Count Basie and Louis Armstrong.
        Affable and unpretentious in a world that outsiders often perceived as somewhat stuffy, Mr. Doyle loved antiques and even more, the search for and sale of them. He said he rarely became attached to them. "I don't fall in love with very many things," he said in 1966. "I'm a merchandiser, not a possessor. I buy what sells."
        Mr. Doyle was born into a large Irish family of nine children in Newton, Mass. He arrived in New York City in 1961 to enter a training program of the Chase Manhattan Bank. But on weekends he would travel around New England picking up antiques and then selling them to New York dealers before going back to work on Mondays.
        In 1963, he gave up banking and purchased a shop on East 81st Street. He moved to his present auction house in 1972, achieving sales of about $12 million a year by 1979 and thriving in the early boom years of the 1980's.
        A funeral service will be held at 10 A.M. Wednesday at St. Ignatius Loyola Church, 980 Park Avenue.
        Mr. Doyle is survived by his wife, Kathleen; three daughters, Elizabeth, Caroline and Laura, and eight brothers and sisters.
