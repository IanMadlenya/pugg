        Ann DeChiara Malamud, whose marriage to Bernard Malamud helped him determine his course as a writer, died on Tuesday in Cambridge, Mass. She was 89.
        The immediate cause was kidney failure, her daughter, Janna M. Smith, said.
        Bernard Malamud, who died in 1986, said the horror of World War II and his marriage to a gentile in 1945 made him question his Jewish identity and compelled him to start reading and writing about Jewish tradition and history.
        Ann DeChiara was born on Nov. 1, 1917, in New Rochelle, N.Y., and was a 1939 graduate of Cornell, fluent in Italian and French. She worked briefly at an advertising agency. The Malamuds, whose marriage was opposed by both sets of parents, met in 1942. From typing 100 application letters for a college teaching job for her young husband to typing and reviewing his manuscripts as a mature writer, Mrs. Malamud supported his career and managed his family life.
        Besides her daughter, Janna, of Milton, Mass., her survivors include a half-brother, Albert DeChiara of Venice, Fla.; a son, Paul, of Washington; and two grandsons.
