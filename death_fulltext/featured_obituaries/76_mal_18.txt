        George Ward Whitney, a New York lawyer specializing in patent, trademark and copyright laws, died on Friday at his retirement home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Whitney graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and George Washington University Law School. In 1952 he began to practice with what was then the firm of Campbell, Brumbaugh, Free & Graves. He retired as a partner in Brumbaugh, Graves, Donohue & Raymond at Rockefeller Center.
        He was a past president of the American Intellectual Property Law Association and a governor of the New York Patent, Trademark and Copyright Association. He served as deputy mayor and village trustee in Garden City, L.I.
        He is survived by his wife of 44 years, C. Patricia Thayer; three sons, G. Ward Jr., of Charlotte, N.C., Jonathan, of Chapel Hill, and Mark, of Watertown, Mass.; a daughter, Lynn Thibodeau of Peterborough, N.H., and five grandchildren.
