        Caroline A. Penney, a philanthropist and the widow of the legendary merchandiser James Cash Penney, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.
        She died of heart failure, a family spokeswoman said.
        During their 45-year marriage, Mrs. Penney actively supported her husband's business activities. She often accompanied him in his travels and appearances as he built J. C. Penney into one of the world's largest retail chains. After his death in 1971, she served as president of the J. C. Penney Foundation for eight years.
        She also was a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and its guild, was on the boards of the Parsons School of Design and American Mothers Inc. and was a member of the Young Women's Christian Association World Service Council.
        The Penneys' life was not always financially secure. In the Depression, the couple were forced to sell their Miami house and close their Westchester house during winters to save heating costs, and Mrs. Penney canned fruits and vegetables they raised on their farm in Westchester.
        Mrs. Penney, whose maiden name was Autenrieth, was born in Eldred, N.Y., and also lived in Phoenix.
        She married Mr. Penney in 1926 in Paris. It was his third marriage; his first two wives had died.
        Mrs. Penney is survived by a sister, Olga A. Chase of New Canaan, Conn.; two daughters, Mary Frances P. Wagley of Baltimore and Palm Beach, Fla., and Carol P. Guyer of Woodside, Calif.; nine grandchildren; eight great-grandchildren and a stepgranddaughter.
