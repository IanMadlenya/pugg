        She was Lord Custodian of the Great Shrine of Ise, a major Shinto shrine in western Japan, for 14 years. She resigned in October, citing poor health.
        In 1950, Mrs. Takatsukasa married Toshimitsu Takatsukasa, a member of one of the five families who have traditionally served as advisers to the imperial family. Her husband died in 1966.
