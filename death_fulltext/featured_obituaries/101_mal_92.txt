        Walter E. Sindlinger, professor emeritus of higher education at Teachers College of Columbia University and a leader in the postwar development and expansion of community colleges, died yesterday at Nyack (N.Y.) Hospital.
        He was 81 and lived in New City, N.Y.
        Although retired, he had continued to teach and was advising doctoral candidates just before his death.
        As a faculty member at Teachers College from 1958 until he retired in 1979 and as director of the college's Center for Community Colleges, Professor Sindlinger trained hundreds of educators to become administrative heads of community colleges, which after World War II largely replaced what had been known as junior colleges.
        In 1960, the college was one of five institutions that shared a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to train community college leaders.
        A dean at Orange County Community College in Middletown, N.Y., from 1950 to 1956, Professor Sindlinger was also a member of the faculty at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor from 1956 to 1958 and a consultant to community colleges in Michigan.
        Professor Sindlinger graduated from Ohio University in 1936 and taught in public school until he entered military service in World War II. He received a master's degree in 1939 and his doctorate in 1956, both in education, from Teachers College.
        Returning there in 1958, Professor Sindlinger developed one of the first programs of study that prepared administrators for service in community colleges. He also served as chairman of the department of higher and adult education.
        Professor Sindlinger is survived by his wife, Agnes; two daughters, Judith D. Kydon, of Nyack, and Kathleen L. Hagen, of New City; a brother, Albert, of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.
