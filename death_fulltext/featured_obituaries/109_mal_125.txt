        Niall MacDermot, who was Secretary General of the International Committee of  Jurists for 20 years and a former British Labor Government minister, has died at the age of 79, the committee announced today.
        The committee, which links senior jurists around the globe in campaigning for the rule of law and defense of human rights, said that Mr. MacDermot died last Thursday in Geneva, where he had settled after retiring in 1990.
        At dire times when most were silent, Niall MacDermot stood up to dictators  to defend the rights and lives of the oppressed," the jurists' committee said in a statement from its headquarters in Geneva.
        Mr. MacDermot, born in Dublin in 1916, studied law at Oxford University and served as a lieutenant colonel in the British army during World War II, winning  an Order of the British Empire for his part in the Normandy landings in June 1944.
        After the war, he practiced law in London as a barrister and served twice as  a Labor member of Parliament, from 1957 to 1959 and from 1962 to 1970.
        He joined the newly elected Labor Government of Harold Wilson in 1964 as Financial Secretary to the Treasury and served as Minister of State for Planning and Land from 1967 to 1968. He took up the post for the jurists' committee in 1970.
        The committee said Mr. MacDermot was a prime force behind the drafting of many international human rights covenants, including accords aimed at preventing torture and arbitary detention.
