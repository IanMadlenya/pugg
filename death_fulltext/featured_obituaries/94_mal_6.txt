        Bernard Jolis, who helped find work for hundreds of political refugees in New York City as a volunteer over the last decade, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Until Friday, Mr. Jolis continued his work for the International Rescue Committee and its New York City Employment Project, one of the largest such groups, helping to sponsor and find work for people fleeing Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa.
        Born in London, he came to the United States when his family opened an American branch of its European diamond business.
        He is survived by his wife, Alicia; four daughters, Gillian, of Manhattan, Jennifer, of Fairbanks, Alaska, Rosanna, of Breckenridge, Colo., and Melanie Marino of Manhattan; two sons, Roderick and Marcus Marino of Manhattan, and a brother, Albert, also of Manhattan.
