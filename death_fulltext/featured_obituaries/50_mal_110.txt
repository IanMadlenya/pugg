        Al Klink, a tenor saxophonist who worked with the Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Bob Haggart and Sauter-Finegan Orchestras, died Thursday at his home in Bradenton, Fla. He was 75 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his wife, Evelyn, said.
        Mr. Klink, a big-toned swing player, contributed to some of the better known recordings in jazz and popular music. As a member of the Glenn Miller orchestra between 1939 and 1942, he was prominently displayed as an improviser on the hit "In the Mood."
        During the next decade, Mr. Klink worked with Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, and recorded with Billie Holiday in Bob Haggart's orchestra. During the 1970's and into the early 1980's, Mr. Klink worked as a member of Yank Lawson and Bob Haggart's World's Greatest Jazz Band.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Patricia Turner of Stewart Manor, N.Y.; a son, William, of Freeport, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
