        Morton Dean Joyce, a former stockbroker and internationally recognized philatelist, died of prostatic cancer Tuesday at Southern Maine Medical Center in Biddeford. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Kennebunk, Me.
        Mr. Joyce, a native of St. Paul, Minn., was a graduate of Princeton University and a stockbroker with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for many years. But his real love throughout his life was stamps.
        The oldest surviving member of the American Philatelic Society, he began collecting at the age of 8. As an adult, he concentrated on United States revenue stamps, most of which were issued in the late 19th century to show that tax had been paid on various manufactured goods and legal documents.
        He also built extensive holdings of privately printed revenue stamps, tax documents and receipts from pre-Revolutionary times, and the pre-canceled stamps used largely for bulk mail.
        His collection formed the basis of an extensive study of revenue stamps written by George Turner and published by the Bureau Issues Association, a collectors' group.
        Mr. Joyce served in World War I and was a lieutenant colonel with the Eighth Army Air Force in England during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betty J. Boyle; two daughters, Anne Wyman and Lucy Curley Brennan, both of Manhattan, and three granddaughters.
