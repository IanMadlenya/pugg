        Joseph X. Dever, a retired journalist who covered the social scene in New York and Philadelphia, died on May 10 at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 77 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Marian B. Javits, a friend.
        Mr. Dever graduated from St. Joseph's College in his native Philadelphia. Early in his career, he contributed items to the Cholly Knickerbocker column in The New York Journal-American.
        He joined the Marines in World War II and received the Bronze Star for service in the South Pacific, where he saw action on Saipan, Tinian and Iwo Jima. He went on to become a colonel in the United States Marine Reserve.
        Mr. Dever wrote a society column for The New York World-Telegram and The Sun from 1958 until it was folded into the short-lived World Journal Tribune in 1966. He returned to Philadelphia to cover society there for The Bulletin, which ceased publication in 1982.
        Mr. Dever is survived by a sister, Margaret Dever of Philadelphia.
