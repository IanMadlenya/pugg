        Cid Corman, a prolific American poet, editor and translator who lived in Japan for the last four decades, died on Friday at a hospital in Kyoto. He was 79.
        His death was reported on the Web site for English Teachers in Japan. Richard Aaron, his archivist, said that Mr. Corman had been in a coma since undergoing heart surgery in January.
        Starting with juvenilia in the 1940's, Mr. Corman published more than 150 titles, from hardcover books to slim hand-sewn, rice-paper selections holding 16 poems each. A sizable part of his output is included in a series he called ''of,'' 350-page volumes that started appearing in 1990 (Lapis Press); a sixth and final volume is pending. In addition, Mr. Aaron said, Mr. Corman wrote about 80,000 unpublished poems. He said that for nearly 60 years Mr. Corman had written constantly, both poetry and correspondence.
        In 1951 Mr. Corman started Origin, a press and journal appearing at irregular intervals and distributed by Longhouse, Publishers & Booksellers, in Vermont. It featured fresh voices like the Black Mountain poets and helped establish poets like Robert Creeley, Theodore Enslin, Denise Levertov, Lorine Niedecker, Charles Olson and Philip Whalen.
        With Origin, Mr. Corman also provided an outlet for new poets from abroad. Literate in several languages, he translated many of them himself.
        He was born Sidney Corman in Roxbury, Mass., and studied at Boston Latin School. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Tufts College (now University) in 1945 and did postgraduate work at the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina and, as a Fulbright scholar, at the Sorbonne in 1954 and 1955.
        His first book, ''subluna,'' was privately printed in 1944. His first professionally published book was ''A Thanksgiving Eclogue to Theocritus'' (Sparrow, 1954). Some of his more recent works include ''Just for Now'' and ''The Despairs,'' published in 2001; ''How Now'' (1995); ''No News'' (1992); ''And the World'' (1987); and ''Aegis: Selected Poems, 1970-1980'' (Station Hill Press, 1983).
        Mr. Corman is survived by his wife of 39 years, Shizumi Konishi.
