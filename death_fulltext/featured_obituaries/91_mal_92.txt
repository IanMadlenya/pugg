        William Ross, a theatrical producer, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ross produced a number of successful tours of Broadway shows, including "Fiddler on the Roof," "No, No, Nanette" and "Camelot." He also served as director of more than 100 national and touring productions, among them "The Lark," "The Best Man" and "Born Yesterday." He was the production stage manager of more than 30 Broadway shows, including "Born Yesterday," "Two's Company" and "Marriage Go Round."
        Mr. Ross, who was born in New York City, served as vice president of the Actors' Equity Association and was the first president of the Stage Managers Association. He was a recipient of the Philip Loeb Humanitarian Award and the Paul Robeson Award in recognition of his efforts for racially integrated casting.
        He is survived by two daughters, Anita Ross-Fein of Manhattan and Melanie Ross of Van Nuys, Calif., and a brother, Joseph Rabinowitz of Manhattan.
