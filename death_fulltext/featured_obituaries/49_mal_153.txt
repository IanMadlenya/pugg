        John Fetzer, a former owner of the Detroit Tigers baseball team and a broadcast pioneer, died today in Honolulu. He was 89 years old. The cause of death was not disclosed, but Mr. Fetzer had a history of heart problems.
        In 1956, he led a syndicate that bought the Tigers from the Briggs family for $5.5 million. In 1983, he sold the club to Thomas Monaghan, the founder of Domino's Pizza Inc., for a reported $53 million.
        In 1923, he was hired by Emmanuel College, now Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Mich., to start a campus radio station. He bought the station and moved it to Kalamazoo, where it began broadcasting as WKZO in 1931.
        Mr. Fetzer founded other radio and television stations in Michigan in Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, Cadillac and Sault Ste. Marie, as well as in Nebraska. He sold most of his broadcast holdings in 1985.
