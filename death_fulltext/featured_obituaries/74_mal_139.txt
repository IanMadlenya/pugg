        William Allan Dyer Jr., president of Indianapolis Newspapers Inc., publisher of Indiana's two largest newspapers, died Sunday at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, where he lived. He was 90.
        Death was caused by complications from a fall he had suffered at his home two weeks earlier, a spokesman said.
        Mr. Dyer, who kept a full work schedule to the end, spent more than 48 years with the two Indianapolis dailies, The Star and The News. He joined The Star as a vice president and general manager in 1944. He became vice president and general manager of the newly formed Indianapolis Newspapers four years later when the Star's publisher, the late Eugene C. Pulliam, acquired The News.
        He was named president in 1975. In that capacity, he oversaw the finances, advertising, mechanical operations, circulation and labor relations of the two papers. The Star appears mornings seven days a week; The News is circulated evenings, Monday through Saturday.
        Mr. Dyer is survived by two sons, Allan H., of Indianapolis, and William E., of New York City.
