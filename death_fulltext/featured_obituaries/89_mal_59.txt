        Gerhard Brandt Naeseth, a chronicler of Norwegian emigration to the United States, died on Saturday at the Middleton Village Nursing Center near Madison, Wis., where he lived. He was 81.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Naeseth, a former university librarian, founded the Vesterheim Genealogical Center in Madison in 1974 and served as its president until his retirement last year. His work traced 18,000 Norwegians who came to the United States from 1925 to 1951 and were the subject of a biographical dictionary published last year.
        A second volume was nearing publication at his death. The names were compiled from ship manifests and church records and cemeteries in Norway and the United States.
        Mr. Naeseth, who was born in Valley City, N.D., received a bachelor's degree from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa, and two graduate degrees from the University of Michigan. He was associate director of the university's library from 1948 to 1978, and held a similar post at Oklahoma State University for a total of eight years, interrupted by service in the Navy in World War II.
        Mr. Naeseth is survived by his wife of 54 years, Milma, and a son, Charles P., both of Madison; three sisters, Margaret Hegland of Lakeside, Mont., Louise Hubbard of Hasting-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Elaine Lee of Baldwin, L.I., and a brother, Erling, of Decorah.
        Correction:  June 16, 1994, Thursday
        An obituary yesterday about Gerhard Brandt Naeseth, a genealogist and retired university librarian, misstated the period for which he traced 18,000 Norwegian immigrants. It was 1825 to 1851, not 1925 to 1951. The obituary also misstated the day of Mr. Naeseth's death. It was Friday, not Saturday.
