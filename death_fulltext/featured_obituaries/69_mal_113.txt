        Don Cahalan, who did early research on alcohol abuse, died on Tuesday at his home in Laguna Hills, Calif. He was 80 years old.
        His family said he died from cancer.
        Dr. Cahalan, a retired professor at the University of California at Berkeley's School of Public Health, received his doctorate in social psychology from George Washington University in 1968.
        He began his research on drinking patterns in the mid-1960's, and was a co-author of a study entitled "American Drinking Practices" (NCUP, 1969). In 1970 he wrote "Problem Drinkers: A National Survey" (Jossey-Bass), and in 1974 was co-author of "Problem Drinking Among American Men" (NCUP).
        Professor Cahalan continued his research and writing at the School of Public Health at Berkeley. He retired in 1979, and then turned his attention to public policy issues. A year ago he wrote "An Ounce of Prevention: Strategies for Solving Tobacco, Alcohol and Drug Problems" (Jossey-Bass).
        After receiving a master's degree in psychology from the University of Iowa in 1938, he became a researcher and assistant to George Gallup in 1938 at the American Institute of Public Opinion in Princeton, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, Ellen Johnson Cahalan, a daughter, Carolyn Cooper of Hamden, Conn.; a son, Michael D. Cahalan of Laguna Beach, Calif., and four grandchildren.
