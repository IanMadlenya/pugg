        Tom Fears, a Pro Football and College Football Hall of Fame receiver and later a National Football League coach, died Tuesday in a convalescent home in Palm Desert, Calif., near his home in Palm Springs. He was 77.
        His son Dan said his father died of complications from Alzheimer's disease.
        From 1948 through 1956, Fears played wide receiver and tight end for the Los Angeles Rams. At 6 feet 2 inches and 215 pounds, he was a fast, sure-handed receiver and a solid blocker.
        As a former teammate, Don Paul, told The Los Angeles Times: ''He was never a guy to get by on ability. He intimidated defensive backs because he was a great blocker. The defensive guy knew if Tom didn't like the way he was tackled, he'd take his head off on the next play.''
        In the pre-Super Bowl era, with an aging Bob Waterfield and the newcomer Norm Van Brocklin at quarterback and Fears and Elroy (Crazy legs) Hirsch as the receivers, the Rams reached the N.F.L. title game in 1949, 1950 and 1951. They won in 1951 when Fears's 73-yard touchdown reception from Van Brocklin in the fourth quarter provided a 24-17 victory over the Cleveland Browns.
        In his nine N.F.L. seasons, Fears caught 400 passes for 5,397 yards and 38 touchdowns. He led the league in receptions each of his first three seasons. In a 1950 game against the Green Bay Packers, he caught 18 passes, still the N.F.L. record for one game. In 1950, he caught 84 passes, an N.F.L. single-season record that lasted 10 years.
        Thomas Jesse Fears was born on Dec. 3, 1922, in Guadalajara, Mexico, to an American mining engineer and his Mexican wife. When the youngster was 6, the family moved to Los Angeles. As a boy, Fears earned 25 cents an hour unloading truckloads of flowers at a wholesale market. Later, he made 50 cents an hour as an usher at football games.
        During World War II, his father was a prisoner of the Japanese, and the son wanted to become a fighter pilot and fight the Japanese. He did become a pilot, but Fears was shipped to Colorado Springs to play for an armed services football team.
        He had started college at Santa Clara and after the war transferred to U.C.L.A. for his last two years. Meanwhile, the Rams, then based in Cleveland, drafted him in 1945.
        ''The Rams wanted me to sign when I got out of the Army,'' he said, ''but I'd already made a commitment to U.C.L.A.''
        Besides, U.C.L.A. supporters provided cushy campus jobs and bit parts in movies. For Fears, that included six seconds as a fighter pilot in a Humphrey Bogart film, ''Action in the North Atlantic.''
        Fears said later that when he signed with the Rams in 1947 for a $6,000 salary and a $500 bonus, ''I took a cut in pay.'' He retired as a pro player after two games in 1956, when his football salary had reached its peak, $13,000.
        He became an assistant coach of the Rams (1960-61) under Waterfield and an assistant of the Packers (1962-65) under Vince Lombardi. He was the New Orleans Saints' first head coach from 1967 to 1970 and was coach of the Southern California Sun of the World Football League in 1974 and 1975 until the league collapsed.
        Later, Fears owned restaurants and avocado fields and rented out condominiums. In 1994, he was told he had Alzheimer's disease.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, the former Luella Wintheiser; three sons, Pat, Jonathan and Dan; three daughters, Kathleen Cook, Katie Prather and Joanna Fears; six grandchildren, and an older brother, Charles Fears Jr.
        When he learned he had Alzheimer's, Fears addressed it squarely.
        ''I know the last six months my memory has been slipping,'' he said. ''Your neighbors, unless you see them regularly, you forget their names. It's embarrassing. That's the worst part. People think that you don't give a damn about them, but that's not the way it is.''
