        Adolph Dreher, founder and president of one of the largest leather manufacturers and importers in the country, died of a heart attack Thursday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. He was 86 years old and lived in Chatham, N.J.
        Mr. Dreher, who was educated in Germany, founded the Dreher Leather Manufacturing Corporation in Manhattan shortly after coming to the United States in 1930. The company moved 20 years ago to Newark, where it now employs about 150 people.
        Dreher Leather, which imports skins from all over the world, is one of the largest sharkskin tanning companies in the world. His was one of the first companies to do business with China after President Richard M. Nixon's visit there in 1972, a business associate said.
        He is survived by his wife, Lott; a son, John, also of Chatham; a daughter, Kathy Brodsky of Manchester, N.H., and four grandchildren.
