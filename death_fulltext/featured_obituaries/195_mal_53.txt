        Prof. Franz Rosenthal, an eminent interpreter of Arabic literature and Islamic religion and a scholar of Aramaic, died on April 8 at a hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 88 and had lived in Hamden, Conn.
        He was Sterling professor emeritus of Arabic at Yale.
        Professor Rosenthal, a native of Berlin, received a doctorate in 1935 from the University of Berlin, where he studied classics and Oriental languages and civilizations.
        In 1938 he finished writing, in German, a history of Aramaic studies. It won a prize, but the prize money was denied him because he was Jewish.
        He left Nazi Germany that year, soon after Kristallnacht.
        He went to Sweden and Britain and, in 1940, moved to the United States. During World War II he was a translator for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington.
        After the war, he taught at Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati and the University of Pennsylvania. He was the Louis M. Rabinowitz professor of Semitic languages at Yale from 1956 to 1967 and held his Sterling professorship there from 1967 to 1985.
        Professor Rosenthal was a past president of the American Oriental Society.
        His brother, GÃ¼nther, and most of his family died in Nazi camps.
