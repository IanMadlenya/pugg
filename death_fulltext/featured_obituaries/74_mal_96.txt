        Jay E. Raeben, who devised a twice-monthly video service to help doctors keep their medical expertise up to date, died last Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was heart failure, according to Visual Information Systems Inc., the firm he founded in 1962.
        Mr. Raeben created the Network for Continuing Medical Education, whose technical staff produces one-hour videos at medical centers around the country. The company then distributes them to about 1,000 hospitals, where they are seen by about 150,000 doctors.
        Mr. Raeben graduated from the University of Connecticut. He earned a master's degree at the University of Chicago in 1950. That year he began his career as a science writer for magazines and then television, winning a number of awards in both areas. Aiming at Specialties
        In the late 1950's he started producing and marketing live television programs that were transmitted through closed circuit to meetings of doctors, scientists and corporate stockholders. He convinced a number of pharmaceutical companies that they could use the medium to reach doctors in ways that standard channels could not.
        The Roche Laboratories division of Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. underwrote the start of his video-cassette network. Now his company also produces programs aimed at medical specialists in areas like dermatology, emergency medicine, oncology and infectious diseases.
        Mr. Raeben was president and chief executive of Visual Information Systems, based in Secaucus, N.J., until last year but continued full time as a consultant.
        He is survived by his wife, Dolores; a son, Joshua, and a stepson, Dale Keidel, all of Manhattan.
