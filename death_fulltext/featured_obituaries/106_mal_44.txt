        Richard A. Guarino, a longtime executive of the International Business Machines Corporation who helped establish the company's alliance with Apple Computer Inc., died on Oct. 29 in Santa Clara, Calif. He was 48 and lived in Brookfield, Conn.
        The cause was a heart attack, his wife, Debra, said. I.B.M. announced Mr. Guarino's death last week.
        At his death, Mr. Guarino was on assignment in California as the acting chief executive of Taligent, a joint venture of Apple, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. He and Taligent's board of directors were conducting an executive search to find a permanent chairman and chief executive. Mr. Guarino was one of several I.B.M. executives who helped implement the alliance between Apple and I.B.M. Once bitter rivals, the two companies surprised the computer industry when their partnership was announced in 1991.
        Besides Taligent, which was set up to develop new computer-operating-system software and would later include Hewlett-Packard, the agreement resulted in Kaleida Labs, a multimedia software company, and an alliance between the two companies and the Motorola Corporation to develop the Power PC, a microprocessor to act as the electronic brain in a personal computer.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Guarino is survived by two daughters from a previous marriage, Jessica and Laura, all of Brookfield.
