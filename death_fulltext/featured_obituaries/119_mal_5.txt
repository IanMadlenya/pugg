        Dr. Paul Dowd, a researcher in organic chemistry known for his investigation of the mechanics acting in various vitamins, died on Nov. 21 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He was 60 and lived in Pittsburgh.
        The cause was cancer, said the university, where he was a professor of chemistry.
        In recent years, Dr. Dowd drew international attention with his original research of the mechanistic action of vitamins, particularly K and E. A study made public last year, for instance, suggested that vitamin E, a potent antioxidant that can help keep cholesterol from clogging arteries, may also protect against heart disease and stroke by preventing blood clots.
        Vitamin E had long been known to have some anticoagulant properties, and people with bleeding problems are cautioned against taking supplements of it. But the study by Dr. Dowd and a graduate assistant, Barbara Zheng, demonstrated that in the future vitamin E quinone, a main metabolite of the vitamin, might offer a safe alternative to slow-acting anticoagulants now in use.
        Born in Brockton, Mass., Dr. Dowd graduated from Harvard College in 1958 and received his medical degree at Columbia University in 1962.
        He taught at Harvard before joining the Pittsburgh faculty in 1970 to teach organic chemistry.
        He was appointed a full professor in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Susan Ramsmeyer Dowd; a daughter, Katherine Cramer of Minneapolis; a son, Michael, of Pittsburgh; three sisters, Maryanne Deyst of Arlington, Mass., Nora Dahl of Cambridge, Mass., and Patricia Karwowski of Albany, Ga.; and three brothers, Joseph, of Gettysburg, Pa., Dennis, of Fairfield, Pa., and John, of Vienna, Va.
