        Roger W. Martin, a restaurant consultant and a longtime associate of Joseph H. Baum at both Restaurant Associates and Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center, died on Jan. 4 at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan. He was 70.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Baum credited Mr. Martin with creating the name Windows on the World when the restaurant was being planned in the early 1970's.
        Mr. Martin began his restaurant career in the early 1950's as a host at the ''21'' Club while a student at New York University. He served in the Army from 1956 to 1958 and joined Restaurant Associates in 1959. As an assistant to Mr. Baum, he supervised the openings of Forum of the Twelve Caesars, the Four Seasons, Charley O's, La Fonda del Sol and a half-dozen other restaurants.
        In 1970, he opened his own restaurant, Roger's, in Sagaponack, on Long Island. Over the next four years, he moved Roger's to Montauk, Bridgehampton and finally to East 57th Street in Manhattan. It closed in 1974.
        In 1972, noting that his clientele included much of the equestrian set of the East End of Long Island, he played host to a Sunday brunch not for riders but for their mounts. The horses were served in the restaurant's parking lot on the Montauk Highway.
        In 1991, he and his daughter, Stacey, a lawyer, opened yet another Roger's on Long Island, this time on the South Shore, in Wainscott. ''She went from torts to tarts,'' he liked to say. It was sold in 1996 to Alison Hurt, the owner of Alison's on Dominick Street, in Lower Manhattan.
        Mr. Martin was the marketing and public relations director of Windows on the World from 1974 to 1979 and then was a restaurant consultant.
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by a son, John; a brother, Stephen G.; and two grandchildren.
