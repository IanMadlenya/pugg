        Sam Falk, a photographer at The New York Times for more than 40 years, died on Sunday at the Sunrise Health Center in Sunrise, Fla. He was 90 years old and lived in Plantation, Fla.
        He died of heart failure, said his nephew, Howard Falk of Montclair, N.J.
        Mr. Falk, who was a pioneer in 35-millimeter photography at The Times, joined the staff in 1925 and during his career specialized in photographs of famous people and events.
        He toured with President Calvin Coolidge and covered national political conventions and championship boxing matches. He also covered the Lindbergh kidnapping trial, snapped finishes of the Kentucky Derby and roamed the United States and Europe taking pictures for The New York Times Magazine.
        His photographs were often the subject of one-man exhibitions, including one at the Smithsonian Institution that ran for 14 months. He retired in 1969.
        He is survived by his wife, Anne.
