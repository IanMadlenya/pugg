        The Rev. Paul Abrecht, an ethicist who, under the auspices of the World Council of Churches, took a leading role in formulating mainstream Christianity's response to modern ethical challenges for more than three decades, died on May 21 at his home in Geneva. He was 87.
        His death was announced by his family.
        In 1949 Mr. Abrecht joined the Geneva staff of the newly founded World Council of Churches, a fellowship of what is now 347 Christian churches in 120 countries. He became director of its department of church and society in 1954.
        During his tenure, Mr. Abrecht brought leading experts together to address the social issues emerging in his time: the rift between Communist and capitalist countries, social and civil rights activism in the United States, populist revolutions worldwide, aid for developing nations, nuclear disarmament and the ethics of biotechnology.
        He wrote ''The Churches and Rapid Social Change'' (Doubleday, 1961), and edited the 1988 publication ''Fifty Years of Ecumenical Social Thought,'' commemorating the anniversary of the conference that decided to found the World Council of Churches.
        Paul Robert Abrecht was born on Dec. 9, 1917, in Cincinnati. He earned a bachelor's degree at Berkeley Baptist Divinity School, now American Baptist Seminary of the West, in 1944 and completed his dissertation at Union Theological Seminary in New York. He retired from the World Council of Churches in 1983.
        Mr. Abrecht is survived by his wife, Audrey, of Geneva; his sons Gary and Stephen, of Washington, and Rudy, of La Barre de Seuilly, France; a daughter, Susan Joyet of Lausanne, Switzerland; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
