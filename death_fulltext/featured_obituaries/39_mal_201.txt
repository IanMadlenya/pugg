        The Rev. Michael W. Murphy, who in 1971, at the age of 80, became the oldest man to be ordained a Roman Catholic priest, died on Wednesday. He was 98 years old.
        Born in 1891 on a berry farm near Detroit, he worked with his family on the farm and later in land development after the city had absorbed it.
        He had lived in Maggie Valley, near Asheville, for 16 years when in 1968, at the age of 77, he was encouraged by friends and Catholic bishops to become a priest. He entered a Detroit seminary shortly afterward.
        He returned to Maggie Valley in 1972, serving as a priest at St. Margaret's Catholic Church until his death.
