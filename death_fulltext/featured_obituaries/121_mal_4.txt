        Thomas M. Belk, the president of Belk Stores Services, a quietly run department store chain in Charlotte, N.C., died at Presbyterian Hospital there last Saturday. Mr. Belk, who was 71, suffered complications following gallbladder surgery, according to his secretary, Susan Blount.
        Mr. Belk, who ran the department store chain with his brother, John M. Belk, was one of the few merchants who lived to see his family business remain a private, regional chain, rather than be taken over by a department store conglomerate. The company, which has about $2 billion in annual sales, has stores in the middle market of 11 Southern states. John M. Belk will remain the company's chairman and chief executive. No replacement for Thomas Belk was named.
        Belk Stores was founded in 1888 by Thomas and John Belk's father, William Henry Belk. A family business that prided itself on quality service, Belk Stores was transformed over the years into a chain whose name itself could attract shoppers, while it carried brands like Estee Lauder, Tommy Hilfiger and Liz Claiborne. This merchandising strategy was largely formed by Thomas Belk, who wooed vendors to Charlotte to put together deals in festive settings.
        Mr. Belk was born in Charlotte in 1925 and graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1948. After serving in the Navy in World War II, he joined the family business, where he held various positions; he was named president in 1980.
        Mr. Belk is survived by his wife, Katherine; a daughter, Katherine Belk Morris of Southern Pines, N.C.; his sons, Thomas M. Belk Jr., H. W. McKay Belk and John R. Belk, all of Charlotte; a sister, Sarah Belk Gambrell of Charlotte; three other brothers, William Henry Belk Jr., Irwin Belk and Henderson Belk, all of Charlotte, and 15 grandchildren.
