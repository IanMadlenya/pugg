        Robert James Burkhardt, a onetime power in the New Jersey Democratic Party who helped organize the Soviet-American summit meeting at Glassboro, N.J., but stumbled in a bribery scandal, died on Dec. 30 at Arden Hill Hospital in Goshen, N.Y. A former resident of Trenton and Central Valley, N.Y., he was 83.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Burkhardt was a highly influential force as executive secretary to  Robert B. Meyner, who was governor from 1954 to 1962, and as Gov. Richard J. Hughes's secretary of state from 1962 to 1970. He was Democratic state chairman for most of the 1960's and played a major role in planning the meeting between President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Soviet leader, Alexei N. Kosygin, at Glassboro State College in 1967.
        A native of Chicago, he attended Purdue University and did engineering work before turning to politics in New York and then New Jersey. He headed the New York State Young Democrats in 1949 and after that became an increasingly important figure in state and national election campaigns, starting with Adlai E. Stevenson's campaign committee in 1952.
        He was a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1956 to 1968 and helped organize the one in Atlantic City in 1964. He also served twice each as gubernatorial campaign director for Mr. Meyner and Mr. Hughes.
        Mr. Burkhardt's political career ended in a guilty plea in Federal Court in 1972 to a charge of accepting  $30,000 in bribes in 1964 while Governor Hughes's secretary of state and close adviser. The case against him involved a bridge construction contract, and he was given a suspended sentence and three years' probation.
        Mr. Burkhardt's wife, Lucille Hogan Burkhardt, died in 1995 after 58 years of marriage. He is survived by two daughters, Robin Burkhardt of Central Valley, and Valerie Merier of Kennebunkport, Me.; two sons, Robert Jr. of Estes Park, Colo., and Ross of Las Cruces, N.M.; and six grandchildren.
