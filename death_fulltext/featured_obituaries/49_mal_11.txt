        Charles H. Salesky, the former president of the Hat Corporation of America and an innovator in the industry in the 1960's, died on Thursday at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 71 years old.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Salesky, who was in the hat business for almost 40 years, bought the Hat Corporation of America with his brothers in 1955 and became its president in 1962.
        For a time, the company was the nation's leading maker of men's hats under labels like Dobbs, Champ, Tenderfoot, Knox, Cavanaugh, Thomas Begg, Keens British and Crofut & Knapp.
        Under his leadership, it brought in designers to restyle hats for men and women, developed man-tailored hats for women and began selling hats in shoe stores and coordinating hats with suits and sportswear.
        Mr. Salesky also helped reduce the number of sizes by using elastic hatbands so as to offer only small, medium and large instead of 12 different sizes.
        For the last five years, he was involved with mergers and acquisitions. He was also a trustee of Norwalk Hospital in Connecticut.
        He is survived by his wife, Phyllis; a daughter, Jill Mola of Westport; three brothers, David and Irving, both of Philadelphia, and Phoenix, of West Palm Beach, Fla.; a sister, Edna, of Philadelphia; and two grandchildren.
