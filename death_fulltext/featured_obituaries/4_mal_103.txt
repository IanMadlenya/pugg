Mr. Monteclaro, who was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1970-71, was president of the National Press Club in 1972 when martial law was declared by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. He challenged many Marcos decrees in the courts here before seeking political asylum in the United States, where he worked as an editor at The Chicago Sun-Times. He returned to the Philippines last year and became executive editor of The Manila Chronicle before taking over at The Manila Times.
