        John F. Fanning, the advertising makeup manager for The New York Times, died yesterday at Centrastate Medical Center in Freehold, N.J. He was 61 years old and lived in Howell, N.J.
        His daughter, Katherine Frangione, said the family was awaiting results of an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Mr. Fanning had pneumonia last month but was believed to be recovering, she said.
        A native of Springfield, S.C., Mr. Fanning graduated from Columbia University with a degree in English literature. He joined The Times in 1951.  He began as a clerk in advertising production and worked his way up through the department.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Point Pleasant, N.J., he is survived by his wife, the former Floy Ann Brown, from whom he was separated; four sons, Geoffrey, William, James and Charles, all of Brick Township, N.J.; and two grandchildren.
        His companion was Valerie Matthew.
