        Mitchell Salem Fisher, a rabbi who resigned his pulpit to become a lawyer, died of a heart ailment on Monday at Greenwood House, Home for the Jewish Aging in Ewing, N.J. He was 86 years old and lived in Princeton.
        Dr. Fisher, a graduate of the Jewish Institute of Religion, served as rabbi with Temple Israel in Washington Heights from 1925 to 1928. He was then named acting rabbi of Congregation Temple Rodeph Sholom and in March 1930 moved the congregation into a new temple at 83d Street and Central Park West. A month later, he resigned from the active rabbinate, stating that he wanted to speak out forcefully on issues ''without immediate institutional restraint.''
        ''Preachers enunciate ideals,'' Rabbi Fisher said in his letter of resignation, ''but these must remain so indefinite, so unpointed, so unchallenging, so completely removed from the real issues of everyday living and struggling, that these ideals become patently and utterly vain. The rabbi becomes an exalted lecturer, entertainer and institution promotion agent.''
        Earlier, he had denounced Prohibition as a ''national curse'' and had supported the Socialist Party and the Presidential aspirations of Norman Thomas.
        After graduating from Columbia University Law School in 1933, he was the lawyer for the Anti-Nazi League and opposed the German-American Bund. He was also counsel to the New York Board of Rabbis and specialized in matrimonial law. He helped draft much of the family law in New York State.
        He is survived by a daughter, Joanne Peterson of New Haven; two sons, Franklin, of Cambridge, Mass., and Wesley, of Princeton, N.J.; a sister, Clara Pollak Ulansky of Yonkers; eight grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
