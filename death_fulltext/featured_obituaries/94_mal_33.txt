        McHenry Boatwright, a baritone who appeared in opera and concerts, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Ruth, the sister of Duke Ellington.
        Mr. Boatwright made numerous appearances as a recitalist, a soloist with orchestras and on the opera stage. He sang for several Presidents at the White House, including Jimmy Carter at his inauguration, and was the recipient of several music prizes, among them two Marian Anderson Awards and first place in the National Federation of Music Clubs competition.
        Mr. Boatwright, a native of Tennielle, Ga., studied piano and voice at the New England Conservatory of Music. After a successful debut at Tanglewood in 1953, he sang with the New England Opera Theater in Boston, where Leonard Bernstein heard him and invited him to sing with the New York Philharmonic.
        In 1956 Mr. Boatwright sang the lead role in Clarence Cameron White's "Ouanga," presented by the National Negro Opera Foundation at the Metropolitan Opera House. As a member of the Hamburg Opera in Germany, he sang the lead in the 1967 premiere of Gunther Schuller's "Visitation." He sang the role of Crown in the first complete stereo recording of Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess," with the Cleveland Orchestra under Lorin Maazel.
        He was a voice teacher at Ohio State University for many years and a producer of the Duke Ellington Sacred Concerts performed in New York and London in 1982.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Ruth Boatwright Evans.
