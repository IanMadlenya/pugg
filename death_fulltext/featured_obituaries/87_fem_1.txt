        Marie T. Mandry, who over 36 years in the advertising business rose from a secretary to senior vice president of Young & Rubicam in New York, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said her brother, Gerard Mandry.
        Miss Mandry joined Young & Rubicam after graduating from Marymount College in Tarrytown. When she retired in 1985 she oversaw the agency's account management department.
        She is survived by her brother, of Dobbs Ferry.
