        Aimee Mott Butler, a philanthropist who was a daughter of a founder of the General Motors Corporation, died on Thursday at her home in St. Paul. She was 91.
        The cause was complications after a stroke, said a son, Peter Butler of St. Paul.
        Mrs. Butler was the daughter of Charles Stewart Mott, who at the turn of the century became the largest stockholder in General Motors. She graduated from Vassar College and after her marriage founded the Aimee and Patrick Butler Family Foundation with her husband. Over the years the St. Paul philanthropy has provided financial support to schools, colleges, museums and alcoholism treatment centers.
        Her husband died three years ago. Among Mrs. Butler's survivors is a half-brother, Stewart Mott of New York.
