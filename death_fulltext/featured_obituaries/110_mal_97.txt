        Hugh Kemp Clark, a chemist and lawyer who had central roles in the development of atomic energy from the days of the Manhattan Project to the era of nuclear power plants, died on March 17 at his home in Kennedyville, Md. He was 90.
        A member of the legal department of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company from 1936 to 1970, Mr. Clark drew up his company's contracts with the Federal Government regarding the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of the  atomic bomb.
        Later, Mr. Clark wrote the book on safety for Du Pont's Savannah River nuclear-weapons plant near Aiken, S.C. After leaving Du Pont, he was an administrative judge for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's panel on safety and licensing, responsible for granting licenses for the construction of nuclear plants.
        Mr. Clark, who was born in Norfolk, Va., graduated with honors in chemistry from George Washington University in 1931 and in 1936 received a doctorate in law with highest distinction, also from George Washington. Before joining Du Pont, he worked for the United States Bureau of Standards and was an examiner in the United States Patent Office.
        Mr. Clark was a member of the American Bar Association and belonged to several genealogical societies. He was an Eagle Scout and a longtime supporter of scouting activities.
        He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Nancy; a son, Matthew, of Chestertown, Md.; three daughters, the Rev. Elizabeth Naylor of Wilmington, Del., Nancy Alobert of Claremont, Calif., and Sarah, of Chestertown, and 10 grandchildren.
