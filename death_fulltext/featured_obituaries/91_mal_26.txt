        Pierre Menard, a violinist and founding member of the Vermeer Quartet, died on Wednesday at his home in Warren, Me. He was 53.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, John Ladley.
        Mr. Menard was born in Quebec and began studying the violin there when he was 6. Later, he studied with Ivan Galamian and Dorothy Delay at the Juilliard School. After graduating, he became concertmaster of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra and the Aspen Summer Festival Orchestra in Colorado.
        In 1969, Mr. Menard became the second violinist in the newly formed Vermeer Quartet, the resident quartet at Northern Illinois University, where he was also a full professor of music. Over the years, he toured extensively with the group throughout North and South America, Europe and Australia, and made many recordings.
        The ensemble also became the resident quartet in the Bay Chamber Concerts summer series in Rockport, Me. Mr. Menard retired from the quartet in 1992.
        In addition to Mr. Ladley, he is survived by two sisters, Denise Tailfer and Georgette LeClerc, and three brothers, Gilbert, Yves and Jean-Paul.
