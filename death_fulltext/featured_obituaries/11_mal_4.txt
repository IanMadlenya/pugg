        J. Howard Pyle, Governor of Arizona from 1951 to 1955 and an aide to President Eisenhower, died here Sunday. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Pyle had been hospitalized since Oct. 23 after suffering a stroke.
        Mr. Pyle was also president of the National Safety Council, chairman of the Occupational Health and Safety Act's National Advisory Committee and a Tempe City Councilman.
        In 1950 he was elected Governor in a major upset as a Republican in a state long dominated by Democrats. He was re-elected in 1952, but defeated while seeking a third term, with political analysts attributing his defeat to a raid in 1953 on Short Creek, a polygamous community now called Colorado City, on the Utah border.
        In a 1985 interview, he said he believed reaction to the raid had cost him the election. ''When I die, I know I will be remembered for Short Creek far beyond anything else I did in office,'' he said.
        Still, he said, if he were Governor again, he would mount another effort to end polygamy in Arizona.
        Survivors include his wife, Lucile; two daughters, Mary Lou Myers of Pina and Virginia Erhardt of Tempe; a brother and four grandchildren.
