        Stan Z. Burns, a broadcaster who played a major role in the development of the all-news radio station WINS, died on Friday night at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 63 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Burns died after a brief illness, the station said. The family prefers not to disclose the cause of death.
        During his 40-year career at WINS, Mr. Burns covered many major news events, including the New York City blackouts and transit strikes. He left the station in 1946 but returned in 1952 and was broadcasting until his last illness.
        "Stan was one of the legendary radio professionals in New York," said Warren Maurer, vice president and general manager of WINS, which is owned by the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company. "We will miss him for his good humor, his sense of perspective and his professionalism."
        Mr. Burns went to work for WINS as a staff announcer in May 1944, when the station was known for its music. He introduced the first Beatles record to his listeners in the early 1960's.
        He is survived by a daughter, Jenny of Manhattan, and a son, Howard, of Connecticut.
