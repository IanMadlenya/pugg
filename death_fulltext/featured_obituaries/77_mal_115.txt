        Norman Cohn, a Chicago builder and developer who was active in the fight against multiple sclerosis for many years, died last Tuesday at Highland Park Hospital in suburban Chicago. A lifelong resident of Chicago, he was 80 years old.
        He died after a long illness, his family said.
        Mr. Cohn was an architectural engineering graduate of the University of Illinois and served in World War II as a lieutenant colonel responsible for the construction of air fields in North Africa, the Middle East and Europe. After the war, he established the Inland Construction Company, which built shopping malls in the Chicago area. He was also a founder of the Urban Investment and Development Company, which developed projects like Copley Square in Boston and Water Tower Place in Chicago.
        In 1958, doctors found that his wife, Carol, had multiple sclerosis, prompting Mr. Cohn to join the efforts to find a cure for the disease. He became co-chairman of the regional chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1959 and was named to the society's national board the next year.
        He retired from the development corporation in the late 1970's to devote more time to his ailing wife and the search for a treatment. He was president of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1978-79 and chairman from 1981 to 1984. He remained active in the society until his death.
        Mr. Cohn's wife died in 1988. He is survived by two daughters, Susan Cohn of Miami Beach and Lauren Cohn Michaels of Hillsborough, Calif., and three grandchildren.
