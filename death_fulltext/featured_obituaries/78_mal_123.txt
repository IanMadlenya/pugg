        Joseph John Palisi, a history professor, research specialist and former official historian of the Borough of Brooklyn, died on Wednesday at his home in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. He was 67.
        His nephew, Christopher Policano, said the cause was a heart attack.
        Dr. Palisi joined the faculty of St. Francis College in Brooklyn in 1968 and headed the Latin American Studies department until 1975. He had served as field director for Catholic Relief Services in Paraguay and Mexico.
        In 1973, he was named Brooklyn's official historian by the borough president, and he directed preparations for the borough's bicentennial celebration. Through his efforts, work was done to restore the Prison Ships Martyrs Monument at Fort Greene Park, a 153-foot Doric column honoring 11,500 people of many nationalities who died during their imprisonment in British ships anchored off Brooklyn during the American Revolution.
        In 1977, after teaching for a year at Brooklyn College, Dr. Palisi went to work for the Federal Government, serving first as interpreter and translator at the Social Security Administration in Manhattan and then as an analyst for the Drug Enforcement Administration. He retired in 1990.
        A lifelong resident of Brooklyn, Dr. Palisi graduated from Columbia University, where he received a master's degree in 1952. He received a Ph.D. from American University in 1968.
        An expert in Italian and Sicilian languages, he began his career as a Foreign Service Officer serving in Genoa and Palermo for several years before going to Latin America for Catholic Relief.
        In 1978, he helped found Arba Sicula, a Brooklyn society dedicated to preserving Sicilian language and culture. He was also an active member of the Brooklyn Diocesan Commission on World Justice and Peace and a director of the Washington-based Bread for the World.
        Besides his nephew, he is survived by his wife, the former Joan Policano.
