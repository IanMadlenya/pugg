        Rubin Leon Gorewitz, a New York tax accountant with an artistic who's who for a clientele, died on March 7 in Manhattan. He was 78 and lived on the West Side.
        A native of Brooklyn and a 1951 graduate of City College, Mr. Gorewitz started his career with a New York acounting firm in 1942 and eventually became the senior partner in his own firm, Gorewitz, Krant, Bialick & Grutman.
        Mr. Gorewitz became a familiar name in artistic circles in the early 1950's as a financial adviser to Martha Graham. He helped her obtain tax-exempt status for her dance company.
        As a lobbyist and accountant he assisted many prominent artists in shielding certain income -- from royalties, resales and the like -- from taxes and in taking deductions for charitable contributions.
        His association with the pop artist Peter Max took a bad turn in 1997 when Mr. Max pleaded guilty to federal conspiracy and tax-fraud charges involving $1.1 million that he was accused of concealing from the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Gorewitz subsequently pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was sentenced to six months' home confinement and a fine.
        Mr. Gorewitz's marriage to Friede Heller ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons, Shalom and Heshi; a daughter, Marian Kleinman; and four grandchildren.
        Correction:  May 30, 2003, Friday  An obituary on Sunday about Rubin L. Gorewitz, a New York tax accountant with an artistic clientele, misstated the date of his death. It was May 7, not March 7.
