        Josef Greindl, a German bass who was best known for his performances of Wagnerian roles, died on April 16 in Vienna. He was 80.
        Austrian press reports said the cause was heart failure.
        Mr. Greindl's performances as Hunding, Hagen and Fafner in Wagner's "Ring" cycle and as Pogner in "Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg" were well known to record collectors through his recordings with Karl Bohm, Clemens Krauss and Wilhelm Furtwangler. He also appeared at the Metropolitan Opera, as Heinrich in "Lohengrin" in 1952 and as Pogner the following year.
        Born in Munich on Dec. 23, 1912, Mr. Greindl made his professional debut there in 1936 as Hunding at the Krefeld Stadttheater. He joined the Dusseldorf Stadttheater in 1938, moved to the Berlin Staatsoper in 1942 and went to the Stadtische Oper in 1949.
        He first appeared at Bayreuth in 1943 as Pogner in "Meistersinger," and was a fixture at the festival during the 1950's and 60's. He also sang regularly at the Vienna State Opera from 1956 into the early 1970's, and performed throughout Europe as a recitalist and oratorio soloist.
        Among his other major roles were Sarastro in Mozart's "Zauberflote," and Don Alfonso in "Cosi Fan Tutte." He portrayed Moses in the German premiere of Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron," in 1959, and he created roles in two Carl Orff works: "Antigonae" in Salzburg in 1949 and "De Temporum Fine Comoedia" in Vienna in 1973.
