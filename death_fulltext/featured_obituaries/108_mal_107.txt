        Sinan A. Korle, who served as United Nations chief of protocol -- smiling, shaking hands and smoothing the ruffled feathers of foreign ministers and heads  of state -- died on Sunday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81 and lived in Istanbul, Turkey.
        In the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Korle's duties required him to oversee as many as 350 receptions a year, some for several thousand guests. In 1974, when Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, addressed the General Assembly wearing a gun holster, Mr. Korle escorted him to and from the podium.
        Mr. Korle, who was born in Istanbul, joined the United Nations in 1951, serving as a public relations officer in New York, Athens and Teheran. He served as an observer for the Trusteeship Council mission to French Togoland (now Togo) in 1958, and as an information officer with the United Nations in the Congo in 1960.
        Mr. Korle became deputy chief of protocol in 1962 and was chief of protocol from 1968 to 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara E. Korle, a writer and journalist, of Istanbul, and a nephew, Tunc Yalman, of Manhattan.
