        Jay Spectre, a New York-based interior and furniture designer, died yesterday at his house in New Canaan, Conn. He was 63 years old.
        He died of pneumonia after a long illness, said his brother-in-law, Elliot Marcus.
        Mr. Spectre long specialized in designing interiors for luxurious homes and for offices. In 1968, he established his Manhattan-based design company, Jay Spectre Inc., whose work was marked by Art Deco, Asian and African influences. Its designs have incorporated high-tech and hand-carved elements, and represent "a strong a 20th-century point of view," said Mr. Spectre's partner, Geoffrey Bradfield.
        Mr. Spectre liked to describe the firm's clientele as "silent celebrities," who valued their privacy. The firm's work has included designing interiors in Canada, South America, Europe and Asia, and its commissions have included large houses, private jet aircraft and yachts, and large office complexes.
        The company has a design staff of 15, headed by Mr. Bradfield.
        Mr. Spectre and Mr. Bradfield founded a Manhattan-based licensing firm, J. S. P. S. Inc., in 1985 to sell to companies the right to manufacture furniture, china, rugs and other articles that were designed by Jay Spectre Inc.
        The two men were co-authors of "Point of View: Design by Jay Spectre," which was published by Bulfinch Press in 1991.
        Mr. Spectre was born in Louisville, Ky., went to schools there and began his career in interior design there in 1951.
        He was named to the Interior Design Hall of Fame in 1986, won a Bride's magazine award for excellence in 1987 and numerous other awards over the years.
        Mr. Spectre was enthusiastic about technological advances and their use in interior design, saying, "Technology is the servant of today."
        Mr. Spectre is survived by his sister, Rena Marcus of Frankfurt, Ky.
