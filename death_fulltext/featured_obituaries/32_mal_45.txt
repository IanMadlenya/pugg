        Arlee Andre, creator of the original Duncan Hines cake mixes, died Monday. He was 89 years old and lived in Titusville.
        Mr. Andre was a cereal chemist testing flour for Nebraska Consolidated Mills in Omaha in 1952 when he decided to develop a cake mix with better flavor and uniformity than the two mixes then commercially available.
        He researched the best ways to make yellow cake, white cake, chocolate cake and angel food cake.
        When the mixes were ready to be marketed, Nebraska Consolidated Mills paid Duncan Hines, the food and drink connoisseur, a penny a box to use his name. The mixes quickly became popular and were sold to the Procter & Gamble Company in 1956.
        Mr. Andre also moved to Procter & Gamble and retired in the mid-1960's.
        He is survived by his wife, Thelma; a son, a daughter, four grandchildren, and ane great-grandchild.
