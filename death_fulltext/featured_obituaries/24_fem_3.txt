        Lina Prokofiev, a singer and the wife of the Russian composer Sergei Prokofiev, died Tuesday in London. She was 91 years old and lived in London.
        Born in Madrid, Mrs. Prokofiev, whose original name was Carlina Codina, spent her childhood and went to high school in New York. A soprano, she made her debut in Milan as Gilda in Rigoletto, and took the stage name of Lina Llubera.
        It was in New York where she first met Mr. Prokofiev, after one of his performances in Carnegie Hall in 1918.
        They were married in 1923 and lived in Paris through the 1920's and 1930's.
        In 1936, they moved to Moscow with their two sons, Oleg and Svyatoslav.
        Their marriage began to deteriorate within a few years after their move, and in 1941, Mr. Prokofiev left his wife for Myra Mendelson, a young Soviet writer.
        In ''Prokofiev,'' a biography published by Funk & Wagnalls, the author Victor Seroff said the separation and divorce was forced upon the composer by the Stalinist government.
        She was placed under surveillance by the Stalinist authorities and sent to a Siberian labor camp in 1948 where she remained eight years. Mr. Prokofiev died in 1953.
        Mrs. Prokofiev left the Soviet Union for Paris in 1974 and never returned.
        She returned to New York in 1985 to narrate a performance of Mr. Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf'' at Alice Tully Hall.
        She is survived by her two sons and eight grandchildren, all of London.
