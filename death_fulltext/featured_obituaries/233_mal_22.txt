        Wayne Hage, a cattleman who won a significant legal case affirming the rights of ranchers to have their herds graze and drink water on federally owned land, died Monday at his ranch in Tonopah, Nev. He was 69.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, also named Wayne Hage.
        In 1991, Mr. Hage filed suit against the National Forest Service, arguing that it had illegally denied him access to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest. The 7,000-acre Pine Creek Ranch, which Mr. Hage bought for about $2 million in 1978, is adjacent to the national forest.
        Eleven years later, Judge Loren Smith of the United States Court of Claims in Washington ruled that Mr. Hage retained property rights to what are called federal grazing allotments. Under those allotments, the government owns the land but ranchers retain access to water and grazing if they can prove they or their predecessors had previously used the land, or built roads or wells on the property. Mr. Hage said the Forest Service had illegally taken his property when it fenced off several water sources and confiscated more than 100 head of his cattle.
        Elwood Wayne Hage was born in Elko, Nev., on Dec. 21, 1936. He graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno, where he also earned a master's degree in animal husbandry.
        Besides his son, Wayne, of Tonopah, Mr. Hage is survived by his second wife, former Representative Helen Chenoweth, Republican of Idaho, whom he married in 1999; his brother, Dave, of Tonopah; two sisters, Faye Tewell of Fallon, Nev., and Alice Hage of Woodburn, Ore.; four daughters, Ramona Morrison of Reno, Ruthe Agee of Elko, Margaret Byfield of Taylor, Tex., and Laura Perkins of Boise, Idaho; and 10 grandchildren. His first wife, Jean Nichols Hage, died in 1996.
