        Edward Treutel, a trumpeter who taught at the Juilliard School for nearly 60 years, died on Friday at the Englewood Medical Center in New Jersey. He was 84 and lived in Leonia, N.J.
        He was born in Philadelphia and studied with Herbert L. Clark, the author of a well-known trumpet-method book, and with Harold Rehrig, a trumpeter in the Philadelphia Orchestra. He studied in New York at the Institute of Musical Art and the Juilliard Graduate School (forerunners of the Juilliard School). In 1938 he performed with the Pittsburgh Symphony, the New York City Center Opera Company and the 1939 World's Fair Band.
        Mr. Treutel began teaching in the Juilliard preparatory division in 1937, while he was still a student, and was that division's only trumpet teacher until his retirement in 1995. He began teaching college-level students at Juilliard in 1946. Among his students were Philip Smith of the New York Philharmonic, Vincent LaSelva, who is now an opera conductor, and Lew Soloff, a founder of the rock group Blood, Sweat and Tears.
        Mr. Treutel also taught at the Manhattan School of Music, Columbia University Teacher's College and other schools. He composed 24 etudes for the trumpet.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen Leonora Marsteller-Treutel.
