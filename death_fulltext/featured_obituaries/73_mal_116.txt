        Harold Barlow, a songwriter and consultant on music plagiarism, died on Feb. 15 at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 77 and lived in Douglaston, Queens.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest brought on by sepsis, said his son, Steven, of Fresh Meadows, Queens.
        In addition to co-writing "The Things I Love" in 1941 and the 1960 Connie Francis hit "Mama," Mr. Barlow was best known for "I've Got Tears in My Eyes (From Lyin' on My Back in My Bed While I Cry Over You)," recorded by Homer and Jethro in 1949.
        He was born in Boston and trained as a classical violinist, graduating from Boston University in 1937. He played under the conductors Arthur Fiedler and Fabien Sevitzky before entering the Army in 1941. After World War II, he was a sheet-music arranger for music publishing companies.
        Since 1965, he worked as an expert on music plagiarism, appearing as an expert witness in many trials, most notably in defense of George Harrison, whose hit song "My Sweet Lord" brought on a lawsuit for copyright infringement by the publishers of the earlier Chiffons' hit, "He's So Fine." The court ruled against Mr. Harrison.
        Mr. Barlow was the author, with Sam Morgenstern, of "A Dictionary of Musical Themes" (1948) and a companion volume, published in 1950 and since retitled "A Dictionary of Opera and Song Themes."
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Sara; two daughters, Peggy, of Marble, N.C., and Pamela, of Westlake Village, Calif.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.
