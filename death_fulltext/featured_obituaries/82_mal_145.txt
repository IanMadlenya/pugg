        William H. Nuchow, the newly elected president of the New York Joint Council 16 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 65.
        The cause was a heart attack, the union said.
        Last month, Mr. Nuchow was elected president of the council in the first secret-ballot vote in the council's history.
        He held various positions in the union over 40 years. He also served as district leader of the Ansonia Democratic Club on the West Side of Manhattan.
        He donated his organizing skills to many labor union, peace and civil-rights rallies throughout the United States.
        He is survived by his children, Laura Vural and Robert, Leslie and Joni; and a sister, Sylvia.
