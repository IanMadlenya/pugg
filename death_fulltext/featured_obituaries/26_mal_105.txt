        Jakob Gimpel, a concert pianist known for his interpretations of Chopin, died at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Gimpel was born in 1906 in Lvov, Poland, which is now part of the Soviet Union. He received his earliest musical training from his father, Adolph, and later studied in Vienna with Alban Berg and Eduard Steuermann. He made his debut in Vienna in 1923.
        In 1935, Mr. Gimpel met the violinist Bronislaw Huberman, with whom he toured the world and whom he helped, in 1937, to found the Palestine Symphony, now the Israel Philharmonic.
        Mr. Gimpel immigrated to the United States in 1938, settling first in New York and, a year later, in Los Angeles. There he had a long teaching and performing career that included numerous solo and orchestral engagements. He also appeared in several motion pictures, including ''Gaslight,'' and recorded the soundtrack for ''Mephisto Waltz'' and other films. In 1971 he became distinguished professor in residence at California State University at Northridge.
        Mr. Gimpel was one of the first American artists to return to Europe after World War II; in 1954 he played hundreds of concerts in West Germany, and he later was awarded the West German Order of Merit, First Class. He also received the Ben-Gurion Award from Israel, for his fund-raising efforts.
        Mr. Gimpel is survived by his wife, Mimi, and a son, Peter, both of Los Angeles.
