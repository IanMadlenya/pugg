        Stuart Hamblen, a gospel and country singer who wrote inspirational songs and once ran for President as a Prohibition Party candidate, died today at St. John's Hospital and Health Center. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Hamblen lapsed into a coma after surgery Feb. 28 to remove a malignant brain tumor.
        Host of ''The Cowboy Church'' radio program in Los Angeles, which is still heard in reruns around the country, he was best known for his spiritual tunes of the 1950's, ''It Is No Secret What God Can Do'' and ''This Old House.''
        Mr. Hamblen was born in Kellysville, Tex. After winning an amateur talent contest, he left Texas and signed recording contracts. He appeared on television and performed concerts nationwide. He also owned one of the leading stables for race horses in the West.
        His life changed one night when he visited a tent revival conducted by the evangelist Billy Graham. His conversion was immediate and he gave up drinking and race horses.
        In 1952 he became the Prohibition Party's nominee for President in an election won by Dwight D. Eisenhower.
        Mr. Hamblen is survived by his wife, Suzy, and three daughters, Lisa Jaserie, Viva Pressnel and Kim Hamblen.
