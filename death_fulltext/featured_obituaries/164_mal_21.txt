        Edward Anhalt, a prolific Academy Award-winning screenwriter best known for his work on the films ''Becket'' and ''Jeremiah Johnson,'' died on Sunday at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 86.
        A native of New York and a graduate of Columbia University, Mr. Anhalt worked as a writer during the embryonic days of television in the 1930's and 40's before landing his first screenwriting credit for the 1946 disaster movie ''Avalanche.''
        Four years later, he received an Oscar for ''Panic in the Streets,'' sharing the Oscar for original story with Edna Anhalt, the first of his five wives and his most frequent collaborator. In 1952 they earned a second nomination for ''The Sniper.''
        In a career of more than two dozen films, among them ''The Madwoman of Chaillot,'' with Katharine Hepburn in 1969, and the 1962 Elvis Presley vehicle ''Girls, Girls, Girls,'' he was especially well regarded for his adaptations of other writers' works. Notable credits included ''The Member of the Wedding'' (1952), from Carson McCullers; ''Not as a Stranger'' (1955), from Morton Thompson's novel; ''The Young Lions'' (1958), from the best seller by Irwin Shaw; and, in 1983, ''The Right Stuff,'' by Tom Wolfe.
        In 1964, Mr. Anhalt won a second Oscar for his screen adaptation of the Jean Anouilh play ''Becket,'' which starred Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole and received 12 nominations in all. With John Milius, he wrote the 1972 Robert Redford movie ''Jeremiah Johnson.''
        He is survived by his wife, Huguette Anhalt, and a daughter, Julie Rice of Los Angeles.
