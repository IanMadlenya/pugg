        Harvey E. Kapnick, a former chairman and chief executive of Arthur Andersen who in the 1970's raised concerns about conflicts of interest between the accounting and consulting arms of the firm, died last Friday. He was 77 and lived in Naples, Fla.
        Mr. Kapnick died of a heart attack at his beach house on Keewaydin Island, about two miles south of Naples, the family said.
        He joined the Chicago office of Arthur Andersen in 1948, becoming a partner in 1956 and serving as the managing partner in the Cleveland office from 1962 to 1970. He was chairman and chief executive from 1970 to 1979, overseeing a period of rapid growth.
        But as the consulting arm grew, Mr. Kapnick warned against conflicts of interest that could arise from consultants and accountants working for the same clients, and set up an independent oversight board to monitor operations, the only such body in the industry.
        Mr. Kapnick left Arthur Andersen in 1979 because of his concerns over the potential conflicts of interest; he had even suggested separating the consulting and auditing businesses. The same issues that Mr. Kapnick raised were investigated by the federal government during its recent prosecution of Arthur Andersen for its role in the collapse of Enron, the Texas energy company.
        In the 1980's, he served as chairman and chief executive of Chicago Pacific and was a director of General Dynamics, where he worked as vice chairman for strategic planning from 1991 to 1994.
        ''Harvey was always ahead of the industry with some of the things that he put in place for the firm,'' said Fred J. Brinkman, a co-chairman of Arthur Anderson from 1977 to 1981. ''He was one of those leaders that was a think-straight, talk-straight kind of guy.''
        Mr. Kapnick was born June 16, 1925, on a farm in Palmyra, Mich. He served in the Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946, mostly in the South Pacific, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in 1945.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Clearly College in Ypsilanti, Mich., in 1947, and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1948.
        Mr. Kapnick was also a trustee of the Chicago Symphony, the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry, Northwestern University and the Chicago Lyric Opera.
        In 1947, he married M. Jean Bradshaw; she died in 1962. In 1963, Mr. Kapnick married Mary Redus Johnson. He is survived by her and three sons, David, of San Francisco; Richard, of Winnetka, Ill.; and Scott in New York; a sister, Marion Miller, of Cheyenne, Wyo.; a brother, Ernest, of Gaylord, Mich.; and eight grandchildren.
