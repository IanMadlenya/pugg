        John G. Lord, who as an author, television producer and documentary script writer dealt with modern history, died on Wednesday at his home in Upper Montclair, N.J. He was 70.
        The cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, Karolyn Lord.
        In the 1970's Mr. Lord wrote "Duty, Honor, Empire: The Life and Times of Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen" and "The Maharajas," both published by Random House. He also wrote film documentaries including "A King's Story," about Edward VIII of England; "Four Days to Omaha," a docudrama about the Normandy invasion, and a film tribute to the Eighth Air Force.
        In 1984 Mr. Lord wrote one episode of the television series "Israel, Heritage of the Jews" and produced the documentary series "The Unknown War," about World War II through Russian eyes.
        Born and raised in England, Mr. Lord graduated from Oxford University, served as a captain in the British Army during World War II, and emigrated to the United States in 1960.
        He is survived by his wife, of Upper Montclair; a son, Nicholas, of Leeds, England, and a daughter, Annette Lord of Wimbledon, England.
