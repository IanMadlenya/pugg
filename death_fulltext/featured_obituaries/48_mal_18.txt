        Daniel M. C. Hopping, an architect who specialized in restorations and who supervised the installation of 14 historic American rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Dec. 26 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. He was 85 years old and lived in Bronxville.
        He died after a heart attack, said Mary Huber, Bronxville's village historian and a family friend.
        Mr. Hopping graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1931. His interest in restoration began with his acclaimed reconstruction of the Jan Martense Schenck House in the Brooklyn Museum in 1961. The House, built in 1675 in Brooklyn's Flatlands, had been dismantled in 1952.
        He was a consultant on the restoration of the Bartow-Pell Mansion in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.
        He is survived by his sister, Margaret, of Bronxville.
