        Dr. Leslie C. Duly, an educator and president of Bemidji State University in Minnesota, died Saturday in his home in Bemidji. He was 57.
        He apparently had a heart attack, said Jack Rhodes, spokesman for Minnesota's state universities.
        Dr. Duly took over as the seventh president of Bemidji State in 1990, after serving 10 years as vice president for academic affairs. During his tenure, he strengthened cultural-diversity programs at the university, which has 5,200 students.
        Before joining Bemidji State, Dr. Duly was a member of the faculty of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln from 1968 to 1980. Earlier, he taught history at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., and Memphis State University.
        Since 1977, Dr. Duly was co-editor of "International Studies Notes," a quarterly of the International Studies Association. He published extensively in the areas of law, administration, race relations and on the role of ethnicity in the 20th century.
        He was a native of Kenmore, N.Y. A graduate of the University of South Dakota, he received a master's degree in Australian history from the University of Melbourne and a Ph.D. in British and Commonwealth history from Duke University in 1965.
        Surviving are his wife, Diane; three daughters, Susannah Duly of Duluth, Melissa Semerau of Hammond, Ind., and Abigail Duly of Grand Forks, N.D.; a son, William Duly of Minneapolis, his mother, Lucille Duly of West Amherst, N.Y., and two sisters, Priscilla Kuntz of Clarence, N.Y., and Lucille Schoepf of Chester, S.D.
