        Dr. Ruth Landes, an anthropologist who won critical acclaim for her studies of black Brazilians, Indians in North Dakota and Hispanic-Americans in the American Southwest, died on Feb. 11 at her home in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 82 years old.
        Dr. Landes's best-known book was "The City of Women," published in 1947 by Macmillan, in which she reported on life around the Brazilian seaport of Bahia, in which women played the dominant roles in a society of descendants of African slaves.
        Dr. Landes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Joseph Schlossberg, a co-founder of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. While attending New York University, where she earned a bachelor's degree, she began a four-year anthropological study of black Jews and of followers of Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement.
        She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work and a doctorate from Columbia, under whose auspices she did research among North Dakota's Ojibwa Indians. Her nine published works include studies of other Indian tribes and a treatise on bilingualism and biculturalism in Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the United States.
        Since 1965 Dr. Landes had taught at McMaster University in Hamilton.
        There are no immediate survivors.
