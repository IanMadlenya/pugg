        Francis S. Levien, a New York lawyer-industrialist who specialized in the creation of corporate conglomerates, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of Palm Beach, Fla., he was 90 and had lived in Manhattan and Stamford, Conn.
        Mr. Levien (pronounced leh-vee-EN) struck it rich in the late 1930's, when he and a partner won a Delaware case that resulted in the forming of what is now Pepsico.
        His success as an industrialist grew out of a partnership with Harry E. Gould, a New England paper merchant. They teamed to redeem a marginal steel maker as the country geared up for World War II. Their enterprise, the Steel Materials Corporation, landed Navy contracts and prospered. After the war, they converted to peacetime production.
        In 1950, they bought a defunct steel mill in Ohio and put it back in operation. In 1951, they traded their stake in it for control of a printing-ink business, Universal Laboratories, changed it to Universal American and made it their holding company.
        Universal American was merged in 1968 into Gulf & Western, and Mr. Levien became a director. He later was a director of several other major companies. He retired in 1985.
        In 1962, Mr. Levien, a graduate of Columbia College and the Columbia School of Law, contributed $1 million toward a new gymnasium at Columbia that now bears his name. He was a founder of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a contributor to the Salk Institute in San Diego, New York Polytechnic Institute and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He also contributed to Lincoln Center and the Juilliard School.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, Janice Currick Levien; a daughter, Lorna Lubash of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
