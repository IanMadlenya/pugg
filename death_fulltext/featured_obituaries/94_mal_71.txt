        Peter Wilenski, a former representative at the United Nations from Australia, died on Nov. 3 at his home in Sydney. He was 55 years old.
        The cause was lymphatic cancer, according to a statement from the Australian Mission to the United Nations.
        Mr. Wilenski was born in Poland in 1939 and moved with his family to Australia when he was 4. He began his rise in Australian Government in the early 1970's as a private secretary to Prime Minister Gough Whitlam.
        He served as Australia's representative at the United Nations from 1989 to 1992, during which time he was a strong advocate of improving the record of the United Nations for hiring women. He also formed a group of representatives who met to write a package of reform proposals for the top United Nations administration.
        He is survived by his wife, Jill; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Katy, all of Sydney.
