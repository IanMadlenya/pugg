        Jerome P. Dunlevy, who headed a stock-trading and investment-banking firm, died on Monday at his home in Naples, Fla., at the age of 59.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Dunlevy was the founder and president of Dunlevy & Company in Manhattan, a stock-trading member firm of the New York Stock Exchange specializing in large institutional investors in the United States and Europe. Under the same company name, he also headed an investment banking firm.
        Earlier he was a senior partner of McDonnell & Company and of A. G. Becker & Company, both investment-banking firms, where he was in charge of the institutional-client sales staff.
        Mr. Dunlevy was born in Ridgewood, N.J. He was a graduate of Georgetown University and served in the Navy.
        His survivors include three sisters, Maura Fuller of Jackson, N.J., Sheila Foley of Hilton Head, S.C., and Eileen Grant Patten of Ramsey, N.J.
