        Constantine Simonides, who was both vice president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and secretary of the M.I.T. board, died on Sunday while playing tennis at Wellesley College. He was 59 and lived in Wellesley, Mass.
        The apparent cause was heart failure, said his son, Philip.
        Mr. Simonides was the chief strategist for M.I.T. during more than two years of legal battles in Federal courts in which the Department of Justice contended that the institute and the eight Ivy League colleges and universities had violated Federal price-fixing laws by trading information about how much financial aid they were offering to students accepted at more than one institution.
        A settlement of the case, which many educators considered a victory for M.I.T. and the Ivy League schools, was announced last December.
        As vice president for the last 24 years, Mr. Simonides served four M.I.T. presidents. His responsibilities included personnel, the medical department, public relations, admissions, athletics, career services and the M.I.T. Press.
        As secretary of the board for the last decade, Mr. Simonides was one of four chief administrators of the institute serving on the 73-member board of trustees.
        Born in Athens, Mr. Simonides came to the United States as an exchange student at St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Del. He attended M.I.T., later received a degree in economics from Boston University and earned an M.B.A. at Harvard in 1960.
        That year he joined M.I.T., rising from assistant to the director of the summer session to assistant dean of the Sloan School of Management in 1964. He was named a vice president of the institute in 1970.
        Mr. Simonides is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter, Cynthia, of Boston; two sons, Ted, of Palo Alto, Calif., and Philip, of Wellesley, Mass., and a sister, Julia Cotsarides of Athens.
