        Gayle Kirkpatrick, a fashion designer known for his youthful, modern approach to American sportswear, died on Jan. 25 at his home in New York City. He was 62.
        The cause was AIDS, said Howard Lawrence, a friend and the executor of his estate.
        In his 30-year career on Seventh Avenue, Mr. Kirkpatrick designed everything from children's wear to furs to evening dresses. But he achieved his greatest success with moderately priced sportswear, winning a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1965, the year he opened his first business, Atelier.
        Mr. Kirkpatrick was in the vanguard of designers who turned away from structured clothes into the soft easy styles that prevailed in the 70's.
        In the late 1950's, he worked in the display department at Saks Fifth Avenue, but soon switched to fashion design and was hired as a sketcher by a company called Miss America, which made cocktail dresses.
        He later worked as an assistant to Arnold Scaasi and in 1963 became the design director of Aileen, which made cotton knits. He designed children's wear for Suzy Brooks and Mode Kiddie Coats and also designed for Dorian Loungewear.
        When the Gayle Kirkpatrick company folded in the mid-70's, he designed for several sportswear companies, including Tudor Square and the Breckinridge division of Leslie Fay, and for the private label programs of Carter-Hawley-Hale stores and Associated Merchandising.
        There are no immediate survivors.
