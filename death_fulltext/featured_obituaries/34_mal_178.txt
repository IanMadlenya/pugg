        Gunnar Hedlund, the longtime leader of the Swedish Center Party and a former Interior Minister, died on Sunday after a long illness. He was 89 years old. The cause of death was not made public.
        Mr. Hedlund entered Parliament in 1942, representing the Agrarian Party, and became party leader in 1949. Two years later, he led his party into a coalition Government with the Social Democrats and became Interior Minister.
        In 1957, the Agrarian Party left the Government, but Mr. Hedlund remained popular. In his last election as party leader, in 1970, the party, which changed its name to the Center Party, won 20 percent of the vote, making it the largest party in the opposition.
