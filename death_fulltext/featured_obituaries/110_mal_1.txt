        Dr. David Rosenthal, an expert on schizophrenia and the role that genetics play in the disorder, died on Monday at a nursing home in Rising Sun, Md. He was 77, and had previously lived in Bethesda.
        Dr. Rosenthal, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, worked for the National Institutes of Health from 1955 until retiring in 1981. He first won professional recognition in 1963 with his study of the lives of four siblings known as the Genain Quadruplets, all of whom suffered from the disease.
        His subsequent studies of psychiatric genetics were documented in "Genetic Theory and Abnormal Behavior" and "The Transmission of Schizophrenia," co-written with Seymour Kety. Dr. Rosenthal discovered substantial evidence of genetic transmission, but he was always careful to note that heredity was not the only cause of schizophrenia.
        Dr. Rosenthal, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Akron University. He  received a master's degree in psychology at George Washington University and a doctorate in the same discipline at the University of Chicago.
        He is survived by his wife, Marcia Rosenthal of Bethesda; two daughters, Laura Rosenthal L'Italien of Brookline, Mass., and Dr. Amy Rosenthal of Chester, Va.; a son, Scott, of Glenelg, Md.; three brothers, Arthur of Akron, Ohio, Fred, of Lake Arrowhead, Calif., and Melvin of Cleveland; and six grandchildren.
