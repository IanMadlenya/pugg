        Bill D. Ross, a Marine Corps combat correspondent in World War II who wrote books on two Pacific-island campaigns, died on Aug. 30 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 73 and lived in Somerset, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Dorothy.
        Mr. Ross's book "Iwo Jima: Legacy of Valor" (1985) was praised by one critic as the first single book that "caught the flavor of the fighting" there, "the sounds and sights that confronted the marines as they moved ashore, the confusion, the brutality of battle."
        His 1992 book, "Peleliu: Tragic Triumph," was about a lesser-known campaign with a high Marine casualty toll and was written, another critic said, "with sad pride." Both books were published by Random House.
        Mr. Ross was born in Iowa. He was a civilian newsman before he joined the Marines and went ashore at Iwo Jima with a rifle and a typewriter. After the war he went back to journalism and then worked in public relations and as a freelance writer.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Jeff, of Somerset, and Bill, of New Brunswick; a daughter, Rita Ross of Fallsburgh, N.Y., and three grandchildren.
