        Mac Gache, a former publisher who popularized the tan and green volumes of Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedia sets with door-to-door canvassing and supermarket sales, puzzle contests and dishware prizes, died on Aug. 14 at his home in Bal Harbour, Fla. He was 93 and had been retired from publishing for more than three decades.
        He died of cancer, a son, Peter D. Gache of Manhattan, said.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Gache learned the rudiments of the publishing business while working in the circulation department of The New York Post, where he created give-away promotions to increase newspaper sales. Later, in the early 1940's, he put those sales skills to active use after he and a brother-in-law, Joseph L. Morse, acquired the publishing rights to the Funk & Wagnalls encyclopedias and dictionary.
        From a five-story brick mansion on East 77th Street in Manhattan, the two men nurtured the Standard Reference Works Publishing Company, which initially sold the encyclopedias in movie houses and supermarkets. After World War II, company salesmen started peddling the sets door to door to young families
        In 1963, Mr. Gache retired after selling the company to Corinthian Broadcasting of New York. He had a stable of thoroughbred horses in New York and Florida, and founded a retirement community in South Florida called Century Village.
        Mr. Gache was married for more than 50 years to his first wife, Rose, whom he first glimpsed on a New York subway. For a 25-cent payment, his younger brother followed her home and obtained her phone number, Mr. Gache's son recalled. Rose Gache died in 1979, and Mr. Gache married his second wife, Anne, in 1980.
        In addition to his wife and his son Peter, he is survived by another son, Donald, of Boca Raton, Fla.; two stepchildren, Pamela Newman and Hiliary Herbst, both of Chicago; four grandchildren, two step-grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
