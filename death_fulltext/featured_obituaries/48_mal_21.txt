        G. G. Campbell, an F.B.I. agent who took part in the ambush of the outlaw John Dillinger in 1934, died Tuesday after a heart attack. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Campbell, known as Jerry, retired in 1965 after 31 years with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was one of two surviving members of the team that killed Dillinger, according to the bureau.
        Dillinger, head of a gang that staged many bank robberies, was set up for the ambush at the Biograph, a Chicago movie theater, by Anna Sage, the so-called Lady in Red who was cooperating with Federal agents.
        Mr. Campbell also helped track down the gangsters Bonnie Parker, Clyde Barrow, Ma Barker and Pretty Boy Floyd.
        He is survived by his wife and a sister.
