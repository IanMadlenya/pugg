        John Wallace Griffin, who mixed archeology and history in exploring Florida's past, died yesterday at his home in St. Augustine, Fla. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, said Page Edwards, Jr., the executive director of the St. Augustine Historical Society, where Mr. Griffin worked as director from 1958 to 1971.
        In 1946, Mr. Griffin became the first archeologist employed by the State of Florida. He later worked as an assistant professor for the University of Florida before being appointed regional archeologist for the National Park Service, serving from 1958 to 1971. In 1977, he formed his own archeological and historical consulting firm.
        Mr. Griffin was perhaps best known for his work with the historian Mark Boyd in studying the remains of a Spanish mission at San Luis near Tallahassee. In 1951, a book written by the two men, "Here They Once Stood" (University of Florida Press), became a model for those interested in urban archeology, which merges archeology and history.
        The State of Florida published Mr. Griffin's "The Archaeology of Everglades National Park: A Synthesis" in 1989. He also wrote more than 125 articles.
        Born in Connersville, Ind., Mr. Griffin grew up in Daytona Beach. He graduated from the University of Florida and received a master's degree in archeology from the University of Chicago.
        Mr. Griffin is survived by his wife, Patricia; two daughters, Lona Griffin Flocke and Elizabeth Griffin Eigner; two sons, Douglas and Bruce, and eight grandchildren.
