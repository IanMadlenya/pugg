        Cantor Maurice Handel, who officiated at synagogues in New York, Los Angeles and St. Paul for more than 35 years, died on Oct. 7 at the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. He was 91 years old and lived in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn.
        He died of heart failure, a spokesman for the family said.
        Cantor Handel, who had gained international acclaim for his voice and for his collection of synagogue music, last year donated 5,000 manuscripts he had collected to the Philip and Sarah Belz School of Jewish Music at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, an affiliate of Yeshiva University.
        Cantor Handel came to the United States in 1920 from his native Latvia and began his cantorial career in 1930 after working as a bank teller. From then until 1941 he officiated at synagogues in Poland and Latvia and gave concerts in cities across Europe. He then joined the staff at the Elton Street Synagogue in the East New York section of Brooklyn and from 1942 to 1947 was the cantor at the Hebrew Institute of University Heights in the Bronx.
        He was with Congregation Ahavat Achim in Brooklyn from 1947 to 1956.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara.
