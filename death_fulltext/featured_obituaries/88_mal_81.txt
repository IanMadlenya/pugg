        At his death, Jose Enrique Trias, 49, was a prominent tax lawyer and a vice president and the general counsel of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, one of the nation's richest research institutes. He was in charge of all legal matters affecting the institute, which has 60 laboratories throughout the country and a scientific work force of more than 2,000.
        Mr. Trias was born in Hato Rey, P.R., five miles southeast of San Juan, and was the son of Jose Trias-Monge, a former Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court who helped shape the commonwealth's Constitution in 1952.
        The younger Mr. Trias graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire and was a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard College in 1966. He received his law degree from Yale Law School in 1969. Partner at Paul, Weiss
        For many years he worked in the international law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, at both its New York headquarters and its Washington office. He began to work full time for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 1992, but his association with the institute began several years earlier, when he served as outside counsel while he was a partner at Paul, Weiss.
        He represented the institute in the 1985 sale of the Hughes Aircraft Company's stock to the General Motors Corporation and the subsequent renegotion of parts of that sale. He also was a central figure in the settlement of a long-running dispute between the institute and the Internal Revenue Service in 1987.
        Mr. Trias, who was divorced from his first wife, married Julie Noel Gilbert in 1985.
        He is survived by two children by his previous marriage, Alex J. and Maggie K. Trias of Washington; his parents, Jose and Jane G. Trias-Monge of San Juan, and two brothers, Arturo and Peter, also of San Juan.
