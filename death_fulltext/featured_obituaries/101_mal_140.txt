        Alan R. Finberg, former vice president, secretary and general counsel of the Washington Post Company and a director of Human Rights Watch, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for the Post said.
        Mr. Finberg spent 20 years at the Post, retiring in 1991. Katharine Graham, chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, said: "Alan was a key figure both in helping the company go public and in contributing to its growth over the years..
        "Through his work with Human Rights Watch, he also was an important voice for human rights around the world."
        Human Rights Watch is a private organization in the United States that monitors human rights violations in Africa, the Americas, the Middle East and the 35 countries that signed the Helsinki Accords of 1975.
        Mr. Finberg acted as liaison between the United States Committee and the International Federation for Human Rights. He also helped organize a similar committee in Britain.
        Mr. Finberg graduated from Yale University and the Harvard University Law School. Before joining the Post, he was a lawyer in Manhattan and assistant general counsel at the General Dynamics Corporation.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and a brother, Donald, of McLean, Va.
