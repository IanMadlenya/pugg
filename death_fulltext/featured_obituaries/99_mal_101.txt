        Edward P. Gallogly, a political and judicial leader in Rhode Island for more than three decades, died on Tuesday at his home in Wakefield, R.I. He was 75.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a son, Robert E. Gallogly of Chicago.
        Edward Gallogly retired as chief judge of the state's Family Court in 1986 after 17 years.
        He started out in politics decades earlier as a precinct worker in his native Providence. Elected to the State Senate in 1954 as a Democrat, he became Lieutenant Governor in 1960 and was re-elected in 1962.
        In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him United States Attorney for Rhode Island. He became chief judge of the Family Court in 1969.
        He graduated from Providence College in 1942 and from Boston University Law School in 1949.
        Besides his son Robert, he is survived by his wife, Florence; seven other sons, E. Peter Jr., Paul V., Brian P. -- all of Providence -- William J., of Wakefield, John P., of Los Angeles, Mark T., of Manhattan, and Michael, of New York City; three daughters, Margaret R. Gallogly and Patrica E. Harris, both of Phoenix, and Mary G. Dickerson of Boston; two brothers, Vincent P., of Lincoln, R.I., and Raymond J., of Warwick, R.I.; three sisters, Mary A.
