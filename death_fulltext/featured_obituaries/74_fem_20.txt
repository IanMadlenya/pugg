        Regina Kiely Fox, a New York sportswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at her home in North Salem, N.Y. She was 87.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Fox was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was active in the Crescent Club in Huntington, L.I., where she once won the club championships in golf and tennis in the same year.
        Her husband, Frank, founded a development corporation based in Brooklyn that in the 1920's and 1930's built many homes in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. He died in 1976.
        Mrs. Fox oversaw the charitable work of the Fox family. Together with her son Terence she founded the annual Frank Fox Memorial Polo Tournament to raise money for public television, museums, youth groups and educational institutions. Since 1984 the proceeds of the annual polo match have gone to the scholarship fund of Marymount College.
        She also served as a judge at the North Salem Horse Show and the Piping Rock and Smithtown Horse Shows on Long Island.
        Mrs. Fox is survived by a daughter, Constance; two other sons, Frank and Michael; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
