        Ford Mason, whose penny gum ball machines have been a fixture in stores and service stations across the United States for the last half century, died Wednesday in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 95 years old.
        He founded the Ford Gum and Machine Company in the Buffalo suburb of Akron in 1934, and its 110 workers turn out 18 million gum balls a day.
        He sold the company in 1969 to the Automatic Service Company of Atlanta for $1 million.
