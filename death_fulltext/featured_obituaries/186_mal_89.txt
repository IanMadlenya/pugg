        Joe Derise, a former big band singer and a cabaret artist in New York for many years, died on June 24 in a hospice in Shelton, Conn. He was 76 and lived in Derby, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        At age 21 Mr. Derise became Tommy Dorsey's vocalist. Later he performed with the Claude Thornhill Orchestra as a guitarist, singer and arranger. He left the orchestra to form his own group, Four Jacks and a Jill, which performed throughout the United States for years. The Jill, Patty Easton, became his wife; they were later divorced.
        His last major appearance was as a singer and pianist at the Algonquin Hotel in New York in 1999.
        Mr. Derise's jazz-influenced style was popular in New York cabarets like the Ballroom and the Village Gate and he made several records. Together with the lyricist Marcia Hillman, Mr. Derise wrote some of his own songs, which he also recorded.
        From 1969 to 1978 he toured with the Diamonds as musical director and vocalist.
        Mr. Derise was a notable collector and performer of obscure songs. Ira Gershwin befriended him after hearing him sing one of the Gershwins' least-known songs, ''Blah, Blah, Blah.'' Those words make up most of the lyrics.
        He is survived by a son, James, of Yonkers, and a daughter, Faye Richardson, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
