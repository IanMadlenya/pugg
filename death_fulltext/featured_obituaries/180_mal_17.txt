        Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz Jr., a veteran of World War II and son of the World War II naval commander in the Pacific, died last Wednesday along with his wife, Joan, at their home in Needham, Mass. He was 86, and she 89.
        The couple committed suicide because of deteriorating health, said Elizabeth Van Dorn, one of their daughters.
        Admiral Nimitz was a native of Brooklyn and a graduate of Annapolis. He served for 12 years in naval submarines and was awarded a Navy Unit Commendation in 1944 for a patrol in which the submarine he then commanded sank a Japanese destroyer.
        He retired from the Navy in 1957, then spent four years with Texas Instruments Inc. before joining PerkinElmer Inc., a technology company where he became chief executive. He retired from PerkinElmer in 1980.
        Admiral Nimitz is survived by three sisters, Catherine Lay of Wellfleet, Mass.; Nancy Nimitz of Topanga, Calif.; and Sister Mary Aquinas of San Rafael, Calif. The couple leave three daughters, Ms. Van Dorn, of Boston; Frances Zehmer of Richmond, Va.; and Sara Smith of Milton, Mass.; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
        Mrs. Nimitz is survived by a sister, Barbara Beard of Devon, England.
