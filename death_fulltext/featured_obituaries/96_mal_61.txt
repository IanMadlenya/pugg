        Gordon P. Franklin, a former president of Saks Fifth Avenue, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 79 and lived in East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was complications from cancer of the esophagus and stomach, his family said.
        Mr. Franklin, who was born on Staten Island, spent 38 years with the specialty fashion chain. He started out in 1933 as a package wrapper, spending his nights studying marketing at New York University for three years.
        He worked as an assistant manager at two stores and was managing the Miami Beach outlet when he entered the Navy in World War II.
        After the war he returned to the store in Miami Beach and advanced in merchandising posts. In 1963, he was elected a vice president, and he became president in 1969.
        During his tenure, Saks began to promote American fashion designers with their own labels. They included Geoffrey Beane, Bill Blass, Anne Klein, Norman Norell and Mollie Parnis.
        Saks, the largest chain of its kind, then was a division of Gimbel Brothers, and was a heavy earner for the parent company. Mr. Franklin was elected to Gimbel's board in 1969. He resigned in 1972, citing "basic merchandising differences."
        The move surprised other Fifth Avenue merchants, especially when he moved up the avenue just weeks later to become vice president and general merchandise manager at Bergdorf Goodman. Bergdorf, a family business, had recently been acquired by the West Cost retail chain Broadway-Hale.
        He retired in 1976. At the time, he was in charge of overseas purchasing for the chain.
        Mr. Franklin is survived by his wife of 38 years, Gwen Randolph Franklin, a former fashion editor of Harper's Bazaar; two stepsons, Haughton F. Randolph Jr. of Chesterfield, Mo., and Christopher F. Randolph of Oyster Bay Cove, L.I., and four grandchildren.
