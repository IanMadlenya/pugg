        Warren F. Stanion, who spent 58 years with Tiffany & Company before retiring as vice president of operations in 1977, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, he was 87.
        The cause was pneumonia, a company spokeswoman said.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Stanion started as a 14-year-old page and worked his way up to become manager of Tiffany's Fifth Avenue flagship store at 57th Street.
        Commissioned in the Army Reserve, he was activated during World War II and taught military tactics at New York University. Later, as a lieutenant colonel, he commanded a battalion of the 94th Infantry Division in the Battle of the Bulge.
        Mr. Stanion is survived by his wife, the former Veronica Fitzpatrick, a senior jewelry buyer at Tiffany whom he met while both were working for the company.
