        Ronald Monchak, a longtime creative executive in the Detroit advertising industry, died on June 26. He was 65 and lived in Rochester, Mich.
        The cause was leukemia, his former agency said.
        Mr. Monchak, known as Ron, was a copywriter who spent more than four decades at the agency now called D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, a division of the Bcom3 Group. He created campaigns for clients including the Cadillac and Pontiac divisions of General Motors; FTD, the flower delivery company; and Whirlpool.
        Mr. Monchak was best known for writing ads for the Pontiac ''muscle cars'' of the 1960's and 1970's, like GTO and the ''wide track'' Pontiac Bonneville and Catalina. He was the managing director of the Detroit-area office of D'Arcy from the early 1980's until 1992, when he was named chairman. Mr. Monchak, who also served on the agency's worldwide board, retired from D'Arcy in 1993.
        Mr. Monchak was a founding partner, with William Haney, of Momentum Books, a publishing company in Troy, Mich. He had also been a member of the board of the Cranbrook Institute of Science in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
        Mr. Monchak is survived by his wife, Virginia; and two daughters, Leslie Monchak and Natasha Stranger.
