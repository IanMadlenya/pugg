        Ira Leonard Mintz, a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who wrote extensively on eating disorders afflicting children, died on Tuesday at his home in Closter, N.J. He was 72.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        Dr. Mintz, who had his private practice in Englewood, N.J., was a supervising child psychoanalyst at the Columbia University Psychoanalytic Training Center and an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry. He retired about two years ago.
        He edited three basic textbooks for specialists and medical students: ''Fear of Being Fat: The Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia,'' ''Psychosomatic Symptoms: Psychodynamic Treatment of the Underlying Personality Disorder'' and ''Psychodynamic Technique in the Treatment of Eating Disorders.''
        A native of Paterson, N.J., Dr. Mintz studied at Brooklyn College before being drafted into the Army Air Forces toward the end of World War II. He obtained his medical degree at New York University College of Medicine in 1950 and trained at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital.
        He received his adult psychoanalytic training at Columbia and completed his studies in child psychiatry at the New York University Psychoanalytic Institute. He served as deputy chief of psychiatry at the United States Public Health Service Hospital in Stapleton, N.Y., early in his career. Returning to Columbia, he started as a lecturer at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
        Dr. Mintz is survived by his wife of 42 years, Nancy Donnenfeld Mintz; two daughters, Susan Berger of Englewood and Karen Mintz of New Hope, Pa.; a son, Robert, of Pennington, N.J.; a sister, Diane Klein of Woodmere, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
