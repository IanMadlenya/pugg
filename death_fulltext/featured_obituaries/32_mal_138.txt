        Miguel (Papa Mike) Manteo, a puppeteer and the patriarch of the Manteo Familiy Sicilian Marionette Theater, died Sept. 13 in Clove Lakes Nursing Home on Staten Island. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Manteo built the puppets and was one of the voices. Through him, the puppets told stories passed down to him from his father and grandfather.
        The marionette programs were based on two traditional Sicilian stories of chivalry, ''Un Avventura d'Orlando Furioso'' and ''L'Amore di Isabella e Zervino.'' The tales, told in Italian, consisted of 394 episodes.
        Mr. Manteo's grandfather, Agrippino Manteo, brought some 50 near-life-size puppets from Argentina to the United States in 1919 and established Papa Manteo's Life-Sized Marionettes in Little Italy.
        Mr. Manteo enlarged his grandfather's puppet collection, which eventually reached 200, making new wooden figures out of mahogany, oak and cherry, which he preferred. Some of the puppets were nearly five feet tall and weighed close to 100 pounds.
        Mr. Manteo was particularly proud of the costumes for the puppets; some were adorned in silk and satin, others in home-made armor. ''They're works of art,'' he told an interviewer. ''No machine can make them. They were made with the hands and with the heart.''
        Mr. Manteo was given a National Heritage Award for his contribution to American culture. In 1986 he received an Award of Honor for Arts and Culture from Mayor Edward I. Koch.
        He is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Catherine Gordon; a sister, Ida Manteo Grillo; six grandchildren and three great grandchildren.
