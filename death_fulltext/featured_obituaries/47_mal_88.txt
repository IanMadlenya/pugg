        William A. Owens, a folklorist and author who taught at Columbia University for 28 years, died on Saturday at the Ramapo Manor Nursing Center in Suffern, N.Y. He was 85 years old and lived in Nyack, N.Y.
        He died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, a spokesman for the family said.
        He joined the Columbia faculty as an English teacher in 1945 and became a full professor in 1966. He was director of the school's summer session from 1959 to 1969, when he was named to the new post of dean of the summer session. He retired in 1974 with the titles of dean and professor emeritus.
        He was writer in residence at Texas A & M University in 1976 and visiting professor at the University of Texas in Austin in 1978.  Folk Songs and Slave Mutiny
        Professor Owens was the author of 16 books, on subjects that include the origins of American folk songs, the beginning of the slave trade and his own youth in East Texas. "This Stubborn Soil" (Scribners, 1966), an autobiographical memoir of a boy growing up to become a teacher, won the Texas Institute of Letters award. "Slave Mutiny: The Revolt on the Schooner Amistad" (John Day, 1953) told of the 1839 revolt of 54 Africans on a slave ship and the process by which they were captured, tried for piracy and murder and then exonerated by the United States Supreme Court.
        Mr. Owens, who was born in Blossom, Tex., graduated from Southern Methodist University in 1932 and received an M.A. in 1933. In 1941, he received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa. En route to academe, he was a Baptist preacher, stockboy for Kress variety stores, magazine salesman, reporter, hash slinger and cotton picker.
        From 1942 to 1945, he served in the Army and was awarded the Legion of Merit. His most recent book, "Eye-Deep in Hell" (Southern Methodist University Press, 1989), dealt with his experience in the Counter Intelligence Corps in the Philippines during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ann Slater Wood; a daughter, Jessie Ann, of Medford, Mass., and a son, David Edward, of Manhattan.
