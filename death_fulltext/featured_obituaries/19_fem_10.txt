        Mrs. Coney, born in Gallatin, Tenn., grew up in Indianapolis, where she lived for the rest of her life. A graduate of Butler University, she taught in the Indianapolis public school system for 35 years, retiring in 1965.
        She was active in a variety of neighborhood causes and, in 1964, with her husband, Elmo Cooney, founded a neighborhood group, Citizens Forum, to combat housing discrimination against blacks. The group disbanded in 1984 because of the Coneys' poor health. Mr. Coney died that year.
        There are no immediate survivors.
