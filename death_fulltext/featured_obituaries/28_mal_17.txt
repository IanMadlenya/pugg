        Giuseppe Cardinal Siri, the Archbishop of Genoa and a frequent candidate for the papacy, died of a heart ailment today, an official at the diocesan chancellery said. He was 82 years old.
        Cardinal Siri, who gained that rank in 1953, attended four conclaves, the meetings in which popes are elected. He was described as Pope Pius XII's choice to succeed him, and in the last two conclaves was a leading vote-getter in early balloting.
        He was frequently depicted as an archconservative who opposed many of the changes of Pope John XXIII and who tried to block progressive initiatives during the Second Vatican Council from 1962-65.
        But Cardinal Siri rejected the conservative label in an interview with the Genoa newspaper Il Lavoro.
        ''If I had to describe myself, I would describe myself as an independent, a man who walks alone and is not a member of any group,'' he said.
        Cardinal Siri was born in Genoa on May 20, 1906, the son of a stevedore. He attended the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he earned a doctorate in theology. Ordained a priest at 22, his early career was mainly in the framework of Catholic Action, a church organization that seeks to involve laymen in church activities.
        As auxiliary bishop of Genoa during World War II, he negotiated with Nazis surrounding the city and met secretly with partisan leaders, eventually arranging a Nazi surrender that avoided further bombardment of the city.
        He became Archbishop of Genoa in 1946. At the time of his resignation in July 1987, he was the last remaining active cardinal named by Pope Pius XII.
