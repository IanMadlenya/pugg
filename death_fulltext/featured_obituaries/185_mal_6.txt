        Alfred Fleishman, a public relations executive who helped found the firm Fleishman-Hillard and was an eyewitness to the horrors of the Holocaust, died on Tuesday at his home in Creve Coeur, Mo. He was 96.
        Mr. Fleishman helped lay the foundation for Fleishman-Hillard, which is based in St. Louis and has billings estimated at $345 million and offices in 21 countries. Under John D. Graham, the current chairman and chief executive, the firm's clients now include Procter & Gamble, the United Parcel Service and Yahoo.
        Mr. Fleishman founded Fleishman-Hillard with Robert E. Hillard, a former reporter for The St. Louis Star-Times, in 1946. Mr. Fleishman was chairman when he retired from the firm in 1975. Mr. Hillard retired as senior partner in 1982 and died in March 2000.
        Before opening Fleishman-Hillard, Mr. Fleishman served as a major in the Army Air Corps and spent World War II primarily as a public information officer. He was sent in October 1945 to Austria and Germany to lead a survey committee studying the needs of displaced Jews. His report was sent to the American Jewish Congress and the United States government.
        Mr. Fleishman, who also lectured throughout the United States about what he learned, continued to be involved with various Jewish causes and organizations throughout his life.
        Mr. Fleishman also wrote three books on semantics.
        Mr. Fleishman's wife, Lucylle Magid Fleishman, died in 1987. He is survived by his sister, Dorothy Schucart, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; two nephews, Robert Banashek and Edmund Banashek, of Olivette, Mo.; and three nieces: Margaret Gates, of Gorham, Me.; Joan Banashek, of Edina, Minn.; and Susan Mitchell, of New London, N.C.
