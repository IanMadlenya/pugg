        Bruno F. Straub, a scientist who was President of Hungary in the waning days  of Communism, died on Thursday, the state radio said. He was 82.
        Mr. Straub served as President, a largely ceremonial role, in 1988 and 1989,  when he was replaced by Matyas Szueroes, who declared the end of Communist rule in October 1989.
        Mr. Straub, who was born in what is now Romania, studied chemistry and worked as a research assistant to the Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gyoergyi, who  isolated vitamin C. He became a biology professor after World War II, wrote several books on chemistry and twice won the most prestigious award in Hungary,  the Kossuth Prize, for his work.
        He did not enter politics until 1985, when he was elected to Parliament.
