        Charles Rothenberg, a lawyer specializing in divorce and child custody cases who supported changes in the laws, died on April 20 at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 88 years old and lived in Delray Beach.
        He died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Rothenberg practiced law for 60 years in New York City. Among the celebrities he represented in various cases were Lana Turner, Lena Horne, David Garroway, Mary Travers and Grace Metalious.
        In numerous articles, he urged that child custody cases be removed from the courts and placed in the hands of experts in child care and psychology. He also urged the liberalization of New York's old divorce law, which until 1966 recognized only adultery as grounds for divorce. He argued for a standard giving both spouses equal claim to the assets acquired during their marriage.
        Mr. Rothenberg was a trustee of the Brooklyn Bar Association and editor of its journal. His books included "Postscript to Marriage: A Practical Guidebook on Divorce" (Greenberg, 1946) and "The New York Law of Alimony."
        He was born in New York City, graduated from City College and received his law degree from New York University in 1924.
        He is survived by his wife, Sylvia Rabinof, a musician, whom he married in 1978. He was married about 40 years to the former Minna Rudisch, who died in the 1970's. Also surviving are his daughter, Cathee Dishy of Van Nuys, Calif.; two grandchildren and a great-grandson.
