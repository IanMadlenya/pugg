        Mason Hammond, an authority on Latin and the history of Rome and its empire, died on Oct. 13 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 99.
        Some writings by Professor Hammond, formerly of Harvard, have proven highly durable. His book ''City State and World State'' (Biblo & Tannen) is still in print 51 years after it was first published as ''City-State and World State in Greek and Roman Political Theory Until Augustus.'' His book ''The Antonine Monarchy'' (Books on Demand) is still available 43 years after it first appeared in bookstores.
        He joined Harvard's faculty in 1928 and was its Pope professor of the Latin language and literature from 1950 until he retired from the post in 1973.
        He was an intelligence officer in the Army Air Forces in Europe in World War II and became one of a group of art scholars assigned to protect valuable artwork.
        He received a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Harvard and also studied at Oxford, where he was a Rhodes scholar.
        His wife, Florence Pierson Hammond, died in 1999.
        He is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Llewellyn of London, Florence Phillips of Cos Cob, Conn., and Anstiss Krueck of Chicago; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
