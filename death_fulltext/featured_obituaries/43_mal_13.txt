        Frederick Carl Gloeckner, a New York horticulturist, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Gloeckner died of pneumonia, a spokesman for Fred C. Gloeckner and Company, a horticultural products distributor, said.
        Mr. Gloeckner founded the company in 1934 and remained president until a stroke earlier this year. In 1961, he founded the Fred C. Gloeckner Foundation, which gave over $2 million in grants to support horticulture research and education this year.
        In 1984, he received an award from Michigan State University for 50 years of service to horticulture.
        He was born in Hoboken, N.J., and worked closely with flower-seed breeders in California from 1917 to 1920 before returning to New York.
        His closest survivors are a niece, Jeanne Gearey of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a nephew, Raymond N. Zimmerman Jr. of Largo, Md.
