        Moses Zucker, Professor Emeritus in Rabbinics at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, died Friday at a nursing home in Miami, Fla. He was 85 years old and lived in Miami.
        A member of the seminary faculty for 33 years, he was an expert in Arabic and Hebrew and was perhaps best known for his two-volume work in Hebrew on the works of Saadia Gaon, a writer who lived from 982 to 1042. He also published in various scholarly journals, including the Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research.
        For many years, he traveled widely to examine documents from the enormous storehouse of Jewish miscellany called the Cairo Geniza papers, with material from the ninth century to the 13th century that was discovered in 1896 in an old Cairo synagogue by Solomon Schechter, the second president of the seminary. After the discovery the papers, many of them mere scraps, found their way into various collections around the world.
        Born in Kopeczowka, Poland, he studied philosophy at the University of Vienna and came to the United States in 1937. He served as rabbi of the Avenue N Jewish Community Center in Brooklyn from 1938 to 1946.
        Professor Zucker is survived by his wife, the former Mania Kuperwaser.
