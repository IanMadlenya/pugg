        Born in Oxford, England, Mr. Whigham became a visiting lecturer at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1966. In 1969 he joined the comparative literature department at the University of California at Berkeley. He had recently completed a year as a visiting professor at Claremont College.
        Mr. Whigham published many volumes of poetry, and his poems appeared in several anthologies, including ''The Penguin Book of Love Poems.'' His translation of the ''Poems of Catullus'' was published by Penguin Books in 1971, and at his death he was working on a new translation of Dante's ''Divine Comedy.''
        Mr. Whigham was well known as an Ezra Pound scholar, said Gary H. Brown, professor of art at the University of California at Santa Barbara. ''In the 1950's, he helped Pound relocate and re-establish himself in Europe,'' Professor Brown said.  Mr. Whigham is survived by his wife, Margaret, of San Francisco, and by three children from a previous marriage: a son, Guy Whigham, of Klamath River, Calif., and two daughters, Charlotte Whigham, of Italy, and Frances Whigham Hunt, of Santa Barbara.
