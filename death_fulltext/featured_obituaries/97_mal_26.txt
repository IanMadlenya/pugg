        Gregory Smith, an executive of Music Theater International, the stage-production licensing agency founded by the composer Frank Loesser, died last Saturday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was facial cancer, said Freddie B. Gershon, chairman of the company.
        Mr. Smith, a native of Allentown, Pa., came to New York City in 1970. As president and managing director of Music Theater International, he supervised the marketing of such shows as "Annie," "Fiddler on the Roof," "West Side Story" and "Guys and Dolls," as well as all of Stephen Sondheim's musicals. He helped develop study guides and video instruction kits for the scripts and scores of licensed musicals.
        He also worked to establish the international recognition of authors' intellectual property rights, known as "grand rights."
        He is survived by his companion, Insoo Koo.
