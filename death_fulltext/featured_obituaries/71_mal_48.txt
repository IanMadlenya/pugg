        Bill Filante, a California Assemblyman for 14 years who often parted ways with his Republican colleagues, died of brain cancer at his home in Terra Linda, Calif., today. He was 63.
        Dr. Filante was a medical doctor. He had been at home recovering from surgery performed in August, but a representative said he apparently suffered a stroke last week.
        Despite his illness with cancer, Dr. Filante refused to withdraw as the Republican candidate for the Congressional seat vacated by Barbara Boxer, a Democrat who was running for United States Senator. He was defeated on Nov. 3 by Lynn Woolsey, a Democratic City Councilwoman from Petaluma.
        A moderate Republican, Dr. Filante served a predominantly Democratic district just north of San Francisco.
        Though he was a fiscal conservative, his votes on issues like the environment and gay rights often went against those of fellow party members. His term expired Nov. 30.
        He was born in Brooklyn and received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees from the University of Minnesota. A flight surgeon in the Air Force from 1955 to 1957, he went into private practice in Marin County in 1960.
        Dr. Filante is survived by his wife, Margaret; two sons, David and Steven; one daughter, Janet Sanders; four grandchildren and one great grandson.
