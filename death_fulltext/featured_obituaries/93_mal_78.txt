        Andrew D. Kopkind, a political journalist whose work appeared in The New Republic, The New York Review of Books and The Nation, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He was 59 and had homes in Manhattan and Guilford, Vt.
        The cause was bladder cancer, said JoAnn Wypijewski, the managing editor of The Nation.
        Mr. Kopkind was born in New Haven, Conn., and had degrees from Cornell University and the London School of Economics. He began his career at The Washington Post, then was a reporter at Time magazine. In 1965 he joined the staff of The New Republic, covering the civil rights movement and the birth of the New Left on college campuses. He was also the American correspondent for The New Statesman in London.
        In 1968 he and James Ridgeway founded the underground newspaper Mayday (later renamed Hard Times), which covered the antiwar, black-power and student movements. He also wrote about the Vietnam War in the magazine Ramparts, where he was a contributing editor.
        In the 1970's, Mr. Kopkind also wrote for The Village Voice, The Boston Phoenix and The Real Paper in Boston. Many of his articles dealt with the emerging gay-rights movement. With John Scagliotti, he was the host of "Lavender Hour," a gay radio program on WBCN in Boston.
        In 1982, he joined the staff of The Nation, where he wrote many of the magazine's unsigned editorials, as well as articles on politics and foreign policy.
        He wrote "America: The Mixed Curse" (1969) and, with Mr. Ridgeway, he edited "Decade of Crisis: America in the 60's" (1972). At the time of his death, he was working on "The Thirty Years' Wars," a collection of his journalism, to be published by Verso next year.
        He is survived by Mr. Scagliotti, his companion of 24 years.
