        Peter Dean Forsch, a retired vice president and former director of marketing services for the Nestle Company USA, died on Monday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. He was 72 years old.
        He died of complications from a stroke, a family spokesman said.
        He joined Nestle as director of advertising and sales promotion at the company's United States headquarters in White Plains in 1964. He was credited with creating the name Taster's Choice for the freeze-dried coffee brand. Before joining Nestle, he had been an account executive with Young & Rubicam in Manhattan. He graduated from Princeton and served in the Navy in World War II as a lieutenant commander. After the war he began his career in advertising after taking a training program at Macy's.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Barbara Terry Booth, and a daughter, Patricia, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
