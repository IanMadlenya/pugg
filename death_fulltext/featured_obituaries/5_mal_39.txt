        Maurizio Vitale, the Italian entrepreneur who introduced the manufacture of jeans to the Soviet Union, has died in Turin. He was 42 years old.
        The Turin daily La Stampa said Mr. Vitale died of an incurable disease on Thursday. The Rome daily La Repubblica said today that Mr. Vitale had died of AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
        In 1979, Mr. Vitale signed a $100 million agreement to produce his Turin-based Jesus jeans in the Soviet Union. The move led to a significant decline in black market trading of jeans in the Soviet Union.
