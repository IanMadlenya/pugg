        Felix Grant, a jazz disk jockey in Washington for more than 40 years, died on Thursday at his home in Washington. He was 74.
        The cause was liver cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Grant's "The Album Sound," on WMAL in Washington, helped to introduce American listeners to Brazilian music and reggae. The program, which he started in 1953 after working as host of an all-night radio broadcast from jazz clubs, was on the air for more than 30 years.
        Although many of the first stations for which he worked in the late 1940's discouraged him from playing jazz, he said he had managed to play it anyway in the middle of sets of more conventional music and had avoided saying the word jazz on the air.
        He was one of the first disk jockeys to play bossanova regularly. In 1974, he became interested in reggae and went to Jamaica to hear Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff. Later, he played their music on the air. He also helped promote the careers of jazz musicians like Mose Allison and George Benson.
        Born in New York City, he started his career in radio after serving with the Coast Guard in the South Pacific during World War II. In 1943, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal for helping to save more than 200 sailors from a sinking Navy destroyer in the North Pacific near the Aleutian Islands.
        He was then sent to give motivational talks to workers at military plants in the United States. That led to a job after the war as host of a weekly radio program in Washington. He joined radio station WWDC in the early 1950's and WMAL in 1953.
        Mr. Grant is survived by his wife of 39 years, June; two brothers, Peter, of New York, and Raymond, of Yonkers, and a sister, Mary Smith of New York.
