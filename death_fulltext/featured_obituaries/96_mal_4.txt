        Warren Caro, a retired executive of the Shubert Organization and a former executive director of the Theater Guild, died yesterday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. He was 87 and had lived in Norwalk, Conn., before moving to the Actors Fund Nursing Home in Englewood two years ago.
        Mr. Caro was the director of theater operations and then projects development director for the Shubert Organization, which is based in Manhattan, from 1967 until he retired in 1980. From 1946 to 1967, he was the executive director of the Theater Guild-American Theater Society.
        He was born in Brooklyn and received a bachelor's degree and a law degree from Cornell University. He practiced law in New York from 1929 to 1939 and was assistant general counsel of the Federal Works Agency in Washington from 1940 to 1942. He was in the Coast Guard from 1942 to 1945.
        He was a member of the advisory committee of what is now the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the chairman of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and a member of several other theatrical and television organizations.
        He received two Tony Awards.
        A brief early marriage ended in divorce, as did his 1955 marriage to Nancy Kelly, an actress.
        He is survived by his third wife, the former Elizabeth Rehill; a daughter from his second marriage, Kelly Caro-Rosenberg, and three granddaughters.
