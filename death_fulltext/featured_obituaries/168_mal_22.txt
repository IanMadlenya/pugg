        Francis Sumner Merritt, the founding director of Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Deer Isle, Me., who helped to give the study and practice of crafts an international aspect, died on Dec. 27 at his home in Belfast, Me. He was 87.
        Last September Mr. Merritt and his wife, Priscilla, were honored by the American Craft Museum for having led a revolution in craft education by augmenting four-year curriculums with summer programs, among other things.
        Lois Moran, editor and publisher of American Craft magazine, said that Mr. Merritt brought to the school as visiting masters people like the English weaver Peter Collingwood, the Columbian textile artist Olga de Amaral, the German sculptural fiber experts Ritzi and Peter Jacobi and the Dutch jeweler Emmy van Leersum.
        Born in Danvers, Mass., on April 8, 1913, Mr. Merritt studied art at the Vesper George School of Art, the San Diego Academy of Fine Arts, the Massachusetts School of Art and the Yale University School of Fine Arts.
        Before starting the Haystack School, he taught for 15 years while working as a painter and print maker. The schools where his refined his teaching techniques included Bradford Junior College, where he was head of the art department.
        In 1951, Mr. Merritt became Haystack's first director, staying in the post until he retired in 1977 to work as a professional studio artist.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Merritt is survived by a brother, the Rev. Richard A. Merritt of Nagoya, Japan; two sons, Dr. Alfred M. Merritt of Gainesville, Fla., and Steven H. Merritt of St. Isadore, Ontario; six grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
