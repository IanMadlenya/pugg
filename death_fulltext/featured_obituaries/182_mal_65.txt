        James J. Dunn, the publisher of Forbes magazine for 20 years, died on Monday at his home in North Palm Beach, Fla.
        He was 81 and formerly lived in Greenwich, Conn.
        Mr. Dunn was publisher of Forbes magazine, as well as vice president of Forbes Inc., from 1966 to 1988. He moved to Forbes in 1966 from Life magazine, where he had risen to advertising sales director.
        He was the third publisher of Forbes, which was founded in 1917, and the first who was not a member of the Forbes family.
        In the decade and a half ending in 1985, the magazine's annual advertising revenues rose to more than $115 million from under $10 million. When he stepped down as publisher in 1988, its circulation was 735,000; it is now more than 900,000.
        From 1989 to 1992, he was the magazine's vice chairman.
        James Joseph Dunn was born in Manhattan, grew up there and graduated from Manhattan College. He served in the Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.
        He was an advertising salesman for Redbook magazine from 1946 to 1950, and held a series of advertising jobs at Life magazine from 1950 to 1966.
        He is survived by his wife of 58 years, Elinor; a daughter, Patricia Dunn Bibb, of North Palm Beach; four sons, Kevin, of Marietta, Ga.; Gregory, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; Sean, of North Palm Beach; and Christopher, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
