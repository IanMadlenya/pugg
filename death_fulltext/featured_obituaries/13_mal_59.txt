        John Jennings, who sang out the songs from his show ''Riverwind'' on a flatbed truck in Shubert Alley when a newspaper strike kept people from reading the reviews, died on Feb. 4 at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, Ind. He was 54 years old and lived in Evansville.
        Mr. Jennings died of cancer, according to his sister, Mrs. Joan Ellen Greif, also of Evansville.
        Mr. Jennings was the lyricist, composer and producer of ''Riverwind,'' a sentimental musical set in a rural Indiana hotel. He took five years to write it and two more to raise the show's $20,000 budget before opening Off Broadway at the Actors' Playhouse on Dec. 12, 1962 - just as the strike was getting under way. In a mostly favorable review that appeared two days later in the Western Edition of The New York Times, Howard Taubman wrote that '' 'Riverwind' comes to life when it breaks into song,'' though he took issue with its noticeably weak book.
        ''John was an open-faced, generous person who pounded the piano and sang from the tips of his toes,'' Adrian Hall, who staged ''Riverwind,'' said yesterday in a telephone interview from Dallas. ''Its success totally depended on word of mouth, and it caught on like wildfire.'' The musical ran for more than a year.
        Mr. Jennings was a graduate of Vanderbilt University, in Nashville. His songs were recorded by such singers as Glen Campbell and Greta Keller. He also performed his work in nightclubs and was working on another musical, ''Old Money,'' at the time of his death.
        Mr. Jennings is survived by his sister.
