        Edward Esty Stowell, a former president of Oglivy & Mather and an environmentalist, died on June 23 at his home in New Vernon, N.J. He was 81.
        His wife, the former Helen d'Olier, said the cause was cancer.
        Mr. Stowell, who was known as Esty, was with the agency, now known as Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, for 12 years. He was a member of the board in 1966 when the firm decided to go public. He retired in 1968.
        After retirement, he was vice president of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation and a founder of Scenic Hudson Inc., an environmental group based in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
        Mr. Stowell was born in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard in 1934. He began his career in advertising that year as a mail clerk with Benton & Bowles Inc. He was vice president from 1948 until he joined Oglivy in 1956.
        He was captain of Harvard's swimming team and, at the age of 60, was certified in scuba diving. He then took up underwater photography and lectured on the subject.
        Besides his wife, survivors include two sons, Edward Esty Stowell Jr. of Manhattan and Franklin d'Olier Stowell of Bainbridge Island, Wash.,; two daughters, Alice Fellowes Stowell of Somerville, Mass., and Jenepher Stowell of Bolinas, Calif., and a brother, Lonsdale Stowell of Manhattan.
