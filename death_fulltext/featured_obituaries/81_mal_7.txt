        Harold C. Hinton, an expert on Asian history and a former professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, died on Sept. 24 at the Estes Park Medical Center in Estes Park, Colo. He was 66.
        His wife, Carolyn, said he died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Hinton, who lived in Washington most of his life until his retirement last year, was a widely consulted authority on Asian politics. In 1966 he was one of two experts called to offer advice to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on how the United States could soften China's militant foreign policy.
        He was born in Paris, the son of Harold B. Hinton, a correspondent for The New York Times, graduated from Harvard University and did post-graduate research at Cambridge University in 1952 and 1953.
        Mr. Hinton served as a military intelligence specialist in the Pacific in World War II and helped write a history of the Korean occupation.
        At George Washinton, where he was a professor for more than 20 years, he wrote several books on the history and politics of Asia, including "An Introduction to Chinese Politics" and "China's Turbulent Quest." He also edited a seven-volume documentary survey of the People's Republic of China.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Hinton is survived by a son, John R., of Miami; a daughter, Page Bridges of Juneau, Alaska, and three granchildren.
