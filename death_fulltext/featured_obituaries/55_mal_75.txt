        Robert W. Purcell, a philanthropist and business adviser to the Rockefeller family, died on Friday at his home in New York City. He was 79 years old.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Wendy, said.
        A lawyer by training, Mr. Purcell became an investment adviser to the Rockefeller family in the 1950's, after almost 20 years of legal and financial work for railroad companies. His mentor was Robert Young, the flamboyant chairman of New York Central Railroad, who often clashed with the staid barons of the railroad industry.
        In 1955, Mr. Purcell became a financial adviser to Rockefeller Family and Associates, a position he held until 1979. Four years later, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller named him a special consultant on commuter-railroad problems. During his tenure, Mr. Purcell developed proposals that helped ease the railroads' tax burden and helped them buy or lease air-conditioned cars.
        Mr. Purcell received his bachelor's and law degrees from Cornell University and served on the university's Board of Trustees from 1959 to 1981, spending 10 years as chairman. In 1970, he presided over an unprecedented public meeting between the trustees and 2,200 students and faculty members to reduce racial tensions on the Ithaca, N.Y., campus.
        Mr. Purcell was a Life Governor of New York Hospital and served on the joint board of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He also was a member of many corporate boards.
        In addition to his wife, of New York City, Mr. Purcell is survived by one niece and four nephews.
