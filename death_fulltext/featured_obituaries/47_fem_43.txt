        Portland Hoffa, a comedian and the widow of the humorist Fred Allen, died Tuesday at her home in Los Angeles.
        Her niece, Frances Hershkowitz of New York City, gave Miss Hoffa's age as 83 or 84 and said her aunt had died in her sleep.
        In the 1920's, Miss Hoffa danced in the choruses of several Broadway productions, including "Bombo" and "Earl Carroll's Vanities." She met Allen in 1922 when they both appeared in "Passing Show," a Broadway revue. Miss Hoffa assisted Allen when he was a juggler in vaudeville, and by the time Allen began his half-hour comedy broadcast in 1932, the two were married. Her high-pitched voice was heard on the program regularly as she and Allen figuratively strolled down Allen's Alley, talking to the resident characters.
        After Allen's death in 1956, Miss Hoffa married Joseph W. Rines, a band leader and advertising executive. He died in the mid-1980's.
        In addition to her niece, Miss Hoffa is survived by her sisters, Lastone Hershkowitz of New York and Los Angeles and Frederika Bond of Bellingham, Wash.
