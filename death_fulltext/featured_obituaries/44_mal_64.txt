       Earle H. Harris, a physician and a founding director of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, died on Sunday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens, at the age of 84. He had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Harris was a retired medical director of the LaGuardia Medical Group in Queens, a health maintenance organization with more than 120,000 members.
        Shortly after World War II, Dr. Harris helped start the Queensborough Medical Group, and in 1947 he was a founder of the Health Insurance Plan.
        Dr. Harris was born in Yonkers and was a graduate of the University of Maryland Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Maria Rheinday; a daughter, Jean Torres of Santa Monica, Calif.; a son, Dr. Andrew Harris of Fort Worth; four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
