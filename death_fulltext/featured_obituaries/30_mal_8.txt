        Mr. Brister died of complications of AIDS, his family said.
        One of his first films, ''Spanish Peanuts,'' is a stop-action animated film in which a chorus line of peanuts dances across a stage to a Latin rhythm. A winner of the Silver Cup Award at the Cannes International Film Festival, it has been shown on the NBC-TV program ''Saturday Night Live'' and HBO.
        His ''Mandarin Oranges'' was distributed by the National Endowment for the Arts Short Film Showcase program. It won an award at the International Tournee of Animation and received a silver medallion at the Chicago Film Festival and a gold medallion at the Miami Film Festival.
        His latest work, ''Punch Film,'' won first prize at the Houston Film Festival.
        A native of Dover, Ohio, Mr. Brister graduated with honors from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design in 1973. He was an artist-in-residence at numerous schools and taught filmmaking and animation techniques.
        Survivors include his mother, Ruth Brister of Bloomington, Minn., and a sister.
