        Francis J. Sugrue, a writer for The New York Herald-Tribune for a quarter-century before the newspaper closed in 1966, died on Friday at the Ozanam Hall of Queens Nursing Home in Bayside. He was 72 years old and had lived in Flushing, Queens.
        The nursing home said he died after a series of strokes.
        Mr. Sugrue, who was born in Naugatuck, Conn., was a graduate of Washington & Lee University. He joined the Herald-Tribune in 1940 but left to serve as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II. After the war he was a feature writer and reporter for the paper. When it closed, he went to work for The World Journal Tribune until it, too, closed in 1968. He then worked in public relations for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Connolly; two sons, Thomas, of Alexandria, Va., and Steven, of Flushing; a daughter, Betsy Malesardi of Garden City, L.I., and four grandchildren.
