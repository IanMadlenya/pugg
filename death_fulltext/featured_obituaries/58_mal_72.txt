        Willard Swire, for many years an official of the Actors' Equity Association, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old.
        His death was apparently caused by a heart attack, said Dick Moore, the union's press representative.
        At his death, Mr. Swire was a consultant for Equity; a member of the board of the American Theater Wing, the sponsor of the Tony Awards; treasurer of the Associated Actors and Artists of America, the parent body of all the performer unions; president of the Theater Authority, the clearing house for theatrical benefits; adjunct professor of drama at the University of Miami, and a member of the board of the American Educational Theater Association.
        Mr. Swire was born in Philadelphia in 1910. He started his career as an actor, but soon became assistant executive secretary of Actors Equity, serving from 1948 to 1954. For the next nine years, he acted as executive director of the American National Theater and Academy. In 1971, after several years in private business, he returned to Equity as assistant executive secretary.
        Mr. Swire is survived by his second wife, Janet Katherine Dickson; a son, R. Derek Swire of Los Angeles, and two grandsons.
