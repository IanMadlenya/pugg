        George Haines, a renowned coach who helped develop some of the greatest swimmers of recent decades, including the Olympic champions Mark Spitz and Don Schollander, died Monday in Carmichael, Calif. He was 82.
        His death was announced by the Santa Clara Swim Club, which he founded. The club said he had a severe stroke four years ago.
        When he retired in 1988, Haines had coached 53 Olympians, who won a total of 44 gold, 14 silver and 10 bronze medals, the Santa Clara Swim Club said.
        Haines was head coach of the United States Olympic team three times (1960 women, 1968 men and 1980 combined) and an assistant for the 1964, 1972 and 1976 Games.
        He began coaching many of his Olympians in California at Santa Clara High School and the Santa Clara Swim Club. Besides Spitz and Schollander, he coached, among others, the Olympic gold medalists Chris von Saltza, Donna de Varona, Claudia Kolb, Steve Clark, Lynn Burke, John Hencken, Dick Roth and Pablo Morales. They, and Haines, have all been inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame.
        In 2000, Swimming World and Junior Swimmer magazine named Haines the sport's outstanding coach of the 20th century.
        To many, he seemed a dour disciplinarian with a biting sense of humor. When Spitz, who won seven gold medals at the 1972 Munich Olympics, broke three world records in one night in the Santa Clara pool, Haines was asked if the main reason was a fast pool.
        ''Yes,'' he said. ''The water flows downhill in both directions.''
        His athletes, who swam 10,000 to 15,000 meters in practice daily, were intensely loyal.
        Schollander, who won four Olympic gold medals in Tokyo in 1964 and one in Mexico City in 1968, said of Haines: ''He suggests. He doesn't prescribe. He knows as much about training and mechanics as anyone, but he is truly great because he knows each swimmer.''
        He added, ''Whenever he says I can do a job, I know I can.''
        Haines made fun of his reputation for toughness. At a swimming clinic in Birmingham, Ala., he upbraided the visiting coaches for talking with such reverence about Bear Bryant, the University of Alabama's legendary football coach.
        Haines wrote on a blackboard, ''Bear Bryant is not God.''
        When the snickers died down, he wrote, ''I am.''
        George Frederick Haines was born March 9, 1924, in Huntington, Ind. He swam on the perennial powerhouse teams of the Huntington Y.M.C.A., coached by Glenn Hummer.
        After serving in the Coast Guard during World War II, Haines entered Kalamazoo College in Michigan. He had expected the college to build a pool and hire Hummer as coach, but when that did not happen, he moved after two years to San Jose State. He received a degree in 1950 and was hired by Santa Clara High School to coach swimming and football.
        In 1951, he formed the Santa Clara Swim Club at the high school. But the school was still building a pool, so his swimmers initially worked out in a reservoir overrun by frogs. His teams prospered. From 1951 through 1974, the school won 213 dual meets and 19 conference and 11 unofficial national championships. From 1968 through 1970, it held the national high school record in every stroke at every distance.
        His club swimmers won 43 national team championships and broke more than 200 world records. Typically, he coached more than 300 school and club swimmers at a time.
        He later coached the men's team at U.C.L.A. (1974-78) and the Stanford University women through much of the 1980's.
        He is survived by his wife, June, four daughters and a son, The Associated Press said.
