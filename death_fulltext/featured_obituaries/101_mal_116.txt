        Brett Averill, who was the editor of The New York Native, a gay newspaper, during the early years of the AIDS epidemic, died on Tuesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 37.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Bill Weintraub.
        Mr. Averill began editing The Native in 1981, when the first cases of an apparently gay-related cancer, which would later be understood as a complication from AIDS, were coming to public attention.
        Mr. Averill left the Native in 1984 and worked as a typesetter and freelance writer until 1989, when he became editor in chief of The Bay Area Reporter, a weekly gay newspaper in San Francisco. He stepped down in 1990, too sick to continue working.
        In addition to Mr. Weintraub, he is survived by his parents, Robert D. and Louise H. Averill, of Newport News, Va.; a sister, Carol, of New York, and a brother, Alan, of Newport News.
