        Richard M. Paget, a management consultant whose studies led to reorganization of the Navy and of other areas of the Federal Government, died on Saturday at his home in Naples, Fla. He was 78 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J., before moving to Naples in 1989.
        He died of complications of a stroke, a family spokesman said.
        He was a founder of the firm of Cresap, McCormick and Paget in 1946. Before that he was a captain in the Navy, where he organized a management consulting group for the Secretary of the Navy. The group became the Office of Management Engineer and did studies that led to postwar reorganization of the Navy. He was awarded the Legion of Merit.
        In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization to advise on changes in the Government's organizational structure.
        Mr. Paget was a 1934 graduate of Northwestern University. He was a partner in the consulting firm of Booz, Allen & Hamilton before joining the Navy in 1941 and had done studies for the Army, the Navy and the War Production Board. He was a life trustee of Northwestern and helped establish the J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management there.
        He also served as a director of many companies, including the Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, The Washington Post Company and Union Dime Savings Bank. He had also been a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and had been president of the Association of Consulting Management Engineers.
        He is survived by his wife, Inez; a son, Richard, of Short Hills; a daughter, Nancy Ginocchio of Wilmette, Ill.; seven grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
