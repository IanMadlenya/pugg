        Richard Morris, who wrote the book for the musical "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and the screenplay for the film "Thoroughly Modern Millie," died on Saturday at the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. He was 72 and lived in Sherman Oaks, Calif.
        The cause was cancer, said Dick Scanlan, a colleague.
        Mr. Morris was born in Burlingame, Calif., and attended the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles for a year before serving with the special services division of the Army during World War II. After the war, he studied acting under Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan. At the same time, he wrote sketch comedy for fledgling performers like Kaye Ballard. One of his sketches was spotted by a talent scout from Universal Studios, and Mr. Morris moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote the screenplays for "Finders Keepers" (1951) and "Ma and Pa Kettle at the Fair" (1952).
        In the mid-50's he started writing for television, including episodes of "Private Secretary," with Ann Southern. In 1955 he became the head writer and director of "The Loretta Young Show," for which he received an Emmy nomination.
        Mr. Morris left "The Loretta Young Show" in 1960 when "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" was produced on Broadway. The show, with music and lyrics by Meredith Willson, was an enormous hit, and a film version was made in 1964, starring Debbie Reynolds.
        He returned to film and television in the mid-1960's. His greatest success was the screenplay for "Thoroughly Modern Millie" (1967), which starred Carol Channing and Julie Andrews. The script won the Writers Guild Award for best American musical. At the time of his death Mr. Morris was writing a stage adaptation of the film with Mr. Scanlan. His other screen credits include "A Change of Habit," with Mary Tyler Moore and Elvis Presley.
        He is survived by a brother, Walter, of Hillsboro, Calif.
