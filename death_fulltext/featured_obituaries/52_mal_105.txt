        Dr. Michael L. Lewin, a pioneer, innovator and educator in reconstructive surgery, died on Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 81 years old and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.
        He died of brain cancer, a family spokeswoman said.
        Dr. Lewin, who sought especially to correct deformities in children, was the founding chief of plastic surgery at the Montefiore Medical Center for 18 years and then the director of plastic surgery at the hospital of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine for more than a decade.
        He was a native of Warsaw, studied medicine at the University of Zurich and interned in Switzerland and New York. During and after World War II, as an Army major, he performed surgery in many medical centers around the country.
        Dr. Lewin was a leader of many professional societies and the author of scores of articles. Overseas, he aided Israel, South Vietnam and Indonesia and, in recent years, the Soviet Union, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
        He is survived by his wife, Berta; a son, Robert, a psychiatric social worker, of Brooklyn; a daughter, Dr. Barbara Lewin-Tankel, a clinical psychologist, of Philadelphia; a brother, Stephan Lewar of Toronto, and two grandchildren.
