        A high school teacher for 10 years and the author of several history books, he was appointed to the Board of Education by Mayor Robert F. Wagner in 1961. In that role, he frequently spoke out in support of greater benefits for teachers.
        Earlier in his career Mr. Byrne was an editor of Facts magazine and other publications. During the 1960's he was executive director of the American Heritage Foundation, a nonpartisan philanthropy that encouraged voter registration, and a vice president of the Valley Forge Foundation. He also was a consultant on philanthropy.
        In later years he worked with Queens merchants to improve the economic well-being of the area and served as president of the Richmond Hill Development Corporation.
        He is survived by two daughters, Patricia, of Manhattan, and Judith, of Alexandria, Va., and a son, Michael, of Lake Tahoe, Calif.
