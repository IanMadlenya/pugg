        Bernard Edwards, the pop producer and member of one of disco's most popular bands, Chic, died on Friday in Tokyo. He was 43 years old and lived in Connecticut.
        The cause was still unknown yesterday, pending an autopsy, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Edwards was found dead in his hotel room by Nile Rodgers, his band mate. Mr. Edwards told friends he felt ill earlier in the day, said David Millman, a spokesman for Mr. Edwards's management company, but he was not  known to have any major health problems.
        Mr. Edwards and Mr. Rodgers met in a post office in New York in the early 1970's, and they performed in small rhythm-and-blues groups before forming the Big Apple Band with the drummer Tony Thompson. The group changed its name to Chic to avoid being confused with another disco band, Walter Murphy and the Big  Apple Band.
        Chic's first single on Atlantic Records, "Dance, Dance, Dance," climbed to No. 7 on the pop charts. With Mr. Edwards's meticulous production and arrangements, and his bass playing, Chic moved to the forefront of disco, recording some of the era's few hits with staying power, like "Everybody Dance," "Le Freak" and "Good Times," which provided the instrumental background for one  of hip-hop's first hits, "Rapper's Del'ght," by the Sugarhill Gang.
        As disco waned in the late 70's, so did Chic's album sales. But its influence lingered on as new wave, rap and dance-pop bands found inspiration in Chic's club anthems.
        In 1982, after releasing six albums, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Rogers parted. Mr. Edwards released a solo album, "Glad to Be Here," formed a group with Mr. Thompson called the Distance and produced music for Robert Palmer, Diana Ross, Sister Sledge, Rod Stewart and the Power Station, whose latest album he completed this month. Chic reunited in 1992, and the band was performing in Japan at the time of Mr. Edwards's death.
