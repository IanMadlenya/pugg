        Elizabeth Moffat White, an environmentalist and former trustee of the Wildfowl Trust of North America, died on Thursday at the Anne Arundel Hospital in Annapolis, Md. She was 94 and lived in Chester, Md., and New York City.
        She died after a heart attack, said her son-in-law, W. Tapley Bennett Jr., president of the Atlantic Treaty Association, a private group that supports the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and a former Ambassador.
        Born in Rye, N.Y., Mrs. White grew up in New York City and graduated from Miss Chapin's School. In 1921, she married John Campbell White, a career diplomat, and accompanied him to postings around the world, including ambassadorships in Haiti and Peru.
        Upon his retirement in 1945, the Whites settled on Kent Island, Md., where she took part in conservation efforts of groups like the Nature Conservancy and in campaigns to protect Chesapeake Bay.
        In 1992, Mrs. White was awarded an honorary doctorate of public service by Washington College in Chestertown, Md. A few weeks before her death, she attended a conference of the Society of Woman Geographers in San Francisco, where she received a distinguished service award.
        She is survived by a daughter, Margaret R. Bennett of Washington; a brother, Abbot Low Moffat of Hights town, N.J.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
