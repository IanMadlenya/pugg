        Lieut. Col. Leofric Boyle, a retired British Army officer who played an important role in saving from extinction the Arabian oryx, a type of antelope, died on March 21. He was 100.
        His death was reported on April 2 by The Times of London, which did not say where he died or where he had lived.
        Colonel Boyle was born in Trivandrum, India, where his father taught at the Maharajah's College. He attended King's School in Canterbury, England, entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, near London, in 1917, became an officer in the Royal Artillery and retired in 1949.
        His military years in India left him with a passion for wildlife conservation. The Times of London said, ''Service in India, with its rich fauna, stimulated a natural interest in animals of all sorts.''
        Colonel Boyle went on to become secretary of a conservation group, the Fauna Preservation Society (now called Fauna and Flora International), from 1950 to 1963. In those years he threw himself into numerous campaigns to safeguard various species of wildlife.
        Notable among the campaigns was a successful effort, named Operation Oryx, to keep the Arabian oryx from being killed off. That exotic pale-bodied animal has long, straight horns that sprout in a narrow V from its head.
        In the early 1960's, tireless poachers were whittling away the Arabian oryx's numbers and threatening its survival. But with Colonel Boyle overseeing Operation Oryx, as The Daily Telegraph reported, the campaign succeeded in ''capturing, with great difficulty, four oryx and transplanting them to the Phoenix Zoo, in Arizona. There they were successfully bred, and the species has since been reintroduced to its natural habitat.''
        Colonel Boyle was awarded British and Dutch decorations for his services to wildlife.
        He is survived by his wife of 48 years, Valerie, and four daughters from his first marriage.
