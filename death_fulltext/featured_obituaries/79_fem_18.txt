        Alison Smithson, a British architect who was prominent in the modern movement, died on Monday in London. She was 65 and lived in London.
        Miss Smithson worked in partnership with her husband, Peter, for the last 43 years. Their position in the history of architectural modernism was summed up in The New York Times in June by Herbert Muschamp, who wrote that with the passage of time, "the pioneers of the modern movement (Gropius, Le Corbusier, Mies van der Rohe)" were still active and vocal, but were "joined in the forum by younger colleagues with ideas of their own (Peter and Alison Smithson, Louis Kahn, Aldo van Eyck)."
        The Smithsons' first widely noted building, a large glass-and-steel school built in the early 1950's in Norfolk county in eastern England, was considered a paramount example of the formal, symmetrical style inspired by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886-1969), the German-American who was a founder of modern architecture.
        The Smithsons' other designs include the original Economist building in London, considered a prime example of modern British architecture, and a housing project in London's East End that used rough-cast concrete in an architectural idiom that became known as the New Brutalism.
        In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1949, Miss Smithson is survived by a son and two daughters.
