        Phyllis C. Coffey, a philanthropist who supported many causes in New York City and Israel, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A resident of Manhattan, she was believed to be in her late 80's.
        She had been ill for several months and died of natural causes, a hospital spokeswoman said.
        With her husband, Lee, an insurance executive, Mrs. Coffey was a major contributor to the Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Center and its Brenner Pavilion and to Mount Sinai Medical Center, where the couple established the Phyllis and Lee Coffey Outpatient Geriatrics Clinic and the Phyllis and Lee Coffey Non-Invasive Cardiology Area.
        Other beneficiaries included Long Island Hospital, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. The couple also helped found the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra and Boys Town Jerusalem, and they sponsored a clinic for hemophiliacs at Tel Hashamir Hospital in Jerusalem.
        Mrs. Coffey's husband died in June. She is survived by a niece, Hannah H. Schneider.
