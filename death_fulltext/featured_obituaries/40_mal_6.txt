        Irving L. Fiske, a freelance writer who founded a community for artists, writers and freethinkers in Rochester, Vt., died of a stroke Wednesday at Monroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala, Fla., where he was on vacation. He was 82 years old and lived in Rochester.
        In 1946, he and his wife, the former Barbara Hall, a painter, bought a 200-acre farm in central Vermont. Today the privately owned alternative community, known as Quarry Hill, numbers 80 to 100 people, including 30 children. It operates the North Hollow School, an accredited ''school without walls'' that opened in 1980, and the Top Drawer Stamp Company, a rubber-stamp maker established in 1979.
        The community, largely made up of individual and separate households, is child-centered, consistent with Mr. Fiske's abhorrence of violence against the young. Among its features is a court operated by and for children.
        Mr. Fiske, a native of Brooklyn, was a graduate of Cornell University. He worked with the Federal Writers Project of the Works Progress Administration in the Depression. He also wrote numerous magazine articles and several plays, including ''Hamlet in Modern English,'' a translation of ''Hamlet'' into colloquial speech.
        Mr. Fiske is survived by a daughter, Isabella Fiske-McFarlin, who is in charge of Quarry Hill; a son, William Fiske of Rochester; a brother, Robert Fishman, and a sister, Miriam Gillison, both of Miami, and four grandchildren.
