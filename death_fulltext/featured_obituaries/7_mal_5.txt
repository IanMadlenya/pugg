        Carlo Ludovico Ragghianti, an Italian art historian who championed modernism and fought Fascism during the war, died Sunday. He was 77 years old. Mr. Ragghianti was born in Lucca in Tuscany in 1910, and studied art in Florence and Pisa. He collaborated with Benedetto Croce, an Italian philosopher and critic, and in 1935 founded ''Critica d'Arte,'' a magazine promoting avant-garde art.
        At the beginning of World War II, he was dismissed from his teaching position at the University of Pisa for refusing to join Italy's Fascist Party. He later became a leader of the resistance in Tuscany. After the war, he resumed teaching at the University of Pisa, and was later elected to the Italian Parliament and served as state secretary for the arts.
