        Alastair A. Stair, a leading dealer in English antique furniture, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his son, A. John.
        Stair & Company was founded in 1912 in London as Stair & Andrews by Alastair Stair's father, Arthur, and Valentine Andrews. It opened a shop in New York in 1914. Alastair Stair left London for New York in 1935 to work in the shop, and a year later he became head of the New York operation when his family bought out Andrews.
        Mr. Stair counted among his clients members of the Whitney, Vanderbilt, Ford and Chrysler families and such major collectors of English furniture as Paul Mellon; Judge Irwin Untermyer; Van Cliburn; Claus and Martha von Bulow; Benjamin Sonnenberg; Dr. Jules C. Stein, the founder of Music Corporation of America, and David H. Murdock, the Los Angeles financier.
        Mr. Stein became a half owner of Stair in 1952. After his death in 1981, Mr. Murdock acquired the concern. Mr. Stair retired from Stair in 1983 and joined Sotheby's auction house in New York as a consultant.
        Many of the 17th- and 18th-century English antiques that Mr. Stair sold to collectors ended up in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Art Institute of Chicago.
        Mr. Stair was born in London, graduated from Rugby and served in the Royal Horse Artillery. He was a founder of the British Art and Antiques Dealers Association in London, the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America in New York City and the Winter Antiques Show in Manhattan.
        In addition to his son, of Manhattan and Claverack, N.Y., who is the president of Sotheby's Restoration, he is survived by his wife, Phylis; a daughter, Nancy Harris of Pawling, N.Y.; a stepson, William Musser of New York, and several grandchildren.
