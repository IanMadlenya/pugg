        Morgan E. Lane, a retired judge of the New York City Civil Court, died on Tuesday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died of complications from a stroke, his son, Ronald, of Manalapan, N.J., said.
        He was elected to the Civil Court bench in 1964 and retired in 1977. One of his most celebrated cases involved a Legal Aid lawyer who was also a Roman Catholic priest and wanted to wear his clerical collar in court. Judge Lane, sitting in Criminal Court, ruled that the priest could not wear clerical garb because it could influence a jury. The 1974 ruling prompted a walkout by the 44 Legal Aid lawyers assigned to the Criminal Court. Higher courts upheld the ruling.
        In 1979, a State Supreme Court justice in Brooklyn ruled in a later appearance by the priest that it was an unconstitutional denial of his right to freedom of religion.
        Judge Lane, a 1929 graduate of St. John's University Law School, was in private practice until he was appointed an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn in 1950.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Adelaide; another son, Stuart, of Morganville, N.J.; a sister, Mildred Lovins of Bloomfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.
