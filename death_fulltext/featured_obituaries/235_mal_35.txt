        Victor del Corral, a Cuban émigré whose Manhattan restaurant, Victor's Cafe, was a celebrated gathering place during its heyday in the 1960's and 70's, died on Friday in Miami. He was 84.
        Mr. del Corral's family announced the death. No cause was given.
        Victor's Cafe, which Mr. del Corral founded in 1963, was originally at 240 Columbus Avenue, at 71st Street. Featuring robust Cuban food at affordable prices, the restaurant was routinely packed with an assortment of New Yorkers, including graying beatniks and Lincoln Center concertgoers as well as Cuban expatriates.
        In 1980, the restaurant moved to West 52nd Street, reopening as Victor's Cafe 52. It is now run by Mr. del Corral's daughter and granddaughter.
        Victor del Corral was born in Guanabacoa, Cuba, east of Havana. He operated restaurants in and around Havana before moving to New York with his family in 1957.
        His survivors include his wife, Eloína Ruíz de Ugarrio; a daughter, Sonia Zaldivar; and three grandchildren. Information about other survivors could not be immediately confirmed.
