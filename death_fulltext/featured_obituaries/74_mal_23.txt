        Harry Braus, a scientist who developed a method to identify and measure organic pollutants in air and water but was forced from Government service at the height of McCarthyism, died on Monday at a hospital in Cincinnati, where he lived. He was 78.
        The cause of death was pneumonia, his family said.
        While working for the United States Public Health Department in the early 1950's, Mr. Braus used activated carbon to filter large quantities of air or water and then analyzed the collected contaminants. The method made it possible to detect pollutants that were significant even though dispersed over large areas.
        Mr. Braus's Government career ended at the height of the Communist-hunting crusade led by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin during the mid-1950's. Mr. Braus was accused of being a Communist, an accusation he denied.
        Joining the U.S. Industrial Research company in Cincinnati as a senior research chemist, he invented more than 50 products and methods that were granted patents.
        Mr. Braus was born in Chicago and grew up in an orphanage after his mother died when he was 12. He worked his way through the University of Illinois.
        He was active in civil rights, peace and environmental causes. After retiring in the early 1980's, he was a volunteer for the homeless.
        Surviving are his wife of 48 years, the former Bettye Loeb; three sons, Robin, of Manhattan, Leonard, of Salt Lake City, and David, of Great Falls, Va.; a daughter, Judy Braus of Oakton, Va.; a sister, Rose McClanahan of Cincinnati, and two grandchildren.
