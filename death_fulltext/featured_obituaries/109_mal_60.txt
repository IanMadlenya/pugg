        Dr. Lester L. Luntz, a pioneer in the field of forensic dentistry, died on Tuesday at his home here. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Luntz helped to develop the science of examining teeth, dental structures and bite marks so they could be submitted as legal evidence for murder and other cases.
        In 1973, he became the first forensic dentist to use a search warrant to examine a suspect's mouth for evidence. An Illinois roofer was convicted of murdering a 14-year-old girl after Dr. Luntz made plaster casts of the suspect's teeth and compared them with a bite mark on the girl's thigh.
        Forensic odontology is now routinely admitted in court. Dr. Luntz and his wife, Phyllys, wrote the first American textbook on the subject, "Handbook for Dental Identification."
        A Hartford native, Dr. Luntz began his dental practice in 1947. For more than 20 years, he was director of the State Dental Association's Dental Disaster Squad, a group of dentists who used dental records to help identify victims of mass disasters. He founded the odontology section of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences and was co-founder of the American Society of Forensic Odontology.
        He was also a consultant to the State Medical Examiner's office for more than 20 years.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Dr. Frank I., of Arlington, Va.; a daughter, Mona R., of Hartford, and two sisters, Gladys Ruddie of Baltimore and  Rosalie Lappen of Suffield, Conn.
