        Milton T. Goldfine, who oversaw the test and launching operations for the spacecraft Galileo in the 1980's, died on June 21 at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. He was 74 and lived in Tellico Village, Tenn.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, his family said.
        Mr. Goldfine retired in 1990 after 36 years at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, an arm of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Pasadena, Calif.
        He began his career with NASA working on missiles at the White Sands Proving  Grounds in New Mexico and was later involved with the development of space probes.
        In the early 1980's, Mr. Goldfine headed preparation of the Galileo probe. Launched in 1989, it went into orbit around Jupiter last December and continues  to relay information.
        Mr. Goldfine, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College with a degree in physics and mathematics.
        Mr. Goldfine is survived by his wife, Vivian; a son, Bernard, of Acworth, Ga., and a brother, Howard, of Merion Station, Pa.
