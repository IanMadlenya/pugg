        Ron Christopher, an AIDS educator, died on Sunday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lymphoma, said his companion, Philip Williams.
        Mr. Christopher helped develop the curriculum at the AIDS Training Institute of the New York City Health Department, where he worked for almost four years. He started his AIDS work in 1983, helping patients as an early volunteer in the Gay Men's Health Crisis "buddy" program. He was also a volunteer AIDS educator for the American Red Cross.
        His earlier career was in advertising and public relations, working with the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Chelsea Theater Center in Brooklyn, Ballet Hispanico in Manhattan, the Houston Ballet, the Chicago Art Institute and the Goodman Theater in Chicago.
        His survivors include a sister, Joyce Hay, of Arlington Heights, Ill.
