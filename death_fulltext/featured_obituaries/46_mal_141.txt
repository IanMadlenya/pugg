        Robert L. Rabe, 62, a retired assistant chief of the Washington police and an authority on dealing with hostage takers and other terrorists, died Thursday at his home in Derwood, Md.
        His death was caused by cancer, a family spokesman said.
        Mr. Rabe negotiated more than a dozen hostage takings in the decade before his retirement in 1979. The most dramatic, in 1977, was the release of 134 hostages who had been held by 12 Hanafi Moslems for two days in Washington's City Hall, the Islamic Center and the national headquarters of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. One man was killed and several were injured, including Marion S. Barry Jr. who was then a member of the City Council and later became Mayor.
        Mr. Rabe was a native of Queens, a Navy veteran and a 28-year member of the Washington police who rose from captain in the department's Youth Division to assistant chief in charge of internal affairs and intelligence.
        Surviving are his wife, Martha; two sons, Gregory of Lake Ridge, Va., and Robert of Alexandria, Va.; three sisters, Elizabeth Lazio of Huntington, L.I., Doris Steffens of Northport, L.I., and Marilyn Burk of Singapore and five grandchildren.
