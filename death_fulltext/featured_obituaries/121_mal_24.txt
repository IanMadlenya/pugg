        David Berger, the longtime host and producer of the WQXR-FM radio program ''Music From Germany,'' died on Sunday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 81.
        Mr. Berger's career in broadcasting began shortly after World War II when as a representative of the State Department he helped to re-establish radio stations in Germany. He went on to work for the Voice of America  as an editor and commentator on political and cultural matters. When the Association of German Broadcasters asked him to represent it in the United States, he created ''Music  From Germany'' and ''Germany Today.'' ''Germany Today'' was heard primarily on university radio stations in the United States.
        ''Music From Germany,'' a half-hour broadcast, was heard weekly on WQXR and was widely syndicated.  Many German compositions were played for the first time in America on the program. Both of Mr. Berger's programs went off the air when he retired 13 years ago.
        Mr. Berger was born in Berlin and fled to the United States in 1939. He served in Army intelligence during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Mali; two sons, Myron, of New York City and Roger, of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Ralph, of Fort Lee, N.J., and three grandchildren.
