        Joseph Michael Waters, a retired food industry executive who started as a 14-year-old errand boy for the A.&P. in Jersey City, died on Wednesday at his home in the Village at Manor Park, a retirement community in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 89.
        He died of natural causes in his sleep, his family said.
        The second of six children, Mr. Waters was born in Manhattan. In 1917, he was hired by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company as a messenger and to do odd jobs. He advanced quickly, and by the time he left in 1939 he was director of sales promotion and advertising at company headquarters in New York.
        After a stint as vice president of sales with C. D. Kenny Company, a Baltimore wholesale grocer, he became a director and vice president for merchandising of McCormick & Company, the spice producer, in Baltimore. He returned to New York in 1949 as a vice president of Clinton Foods Inc. and executive vice president of its Snow Crop division.
        Mr. Waters is survived by a daughter, Mildred Harford of Princeton, N.J.; a son, Dr. Roger Waters of Ballston Lake, N.Y.; two sisters, Mildred Doehler of Cary, N.C., and Emma Rubel of Tequesta, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
