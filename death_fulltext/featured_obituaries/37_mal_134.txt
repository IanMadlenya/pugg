        Norman Parkinson, a society photographer who specialized in photographing women and won fame for his pictures of members of the British royal family, died on Thursday in Singapore at the age of 76, his family reported.
        Mr. Parkinson collapsed on Feb. 2 with a brain hemorrhage in his hotel room in Sabah, Malaysia. He had been working in the Malaysian jungle with an American model, Debra Harris, for the magazine Town and Country.
        His illness was complicated by bronchial pneumonia and heart problems, hospital officials said.
        Twiggy, the model, described Mr. Parkinson as ''one of the great eccentrics of the photographic world.''
        ''He was a perfect gentleman and an amazing creative photographer,'' she said.
        Among Mr. Parkinson's best-known portraits are those of Princess Anne, daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, for Anne's 21st birthday, in 1971, and the Queen Mother, in 1980.
        An eccentric dresser with a military-style mustache, he listed his hobbies as sun worshiping, bird watching, breeding racehorses and pig farming. His home for much of the last 25 years was on the Caribbean island of Tobago.
        Mr. Parkinson was married for 42 years to Wenda Rogerson, a model and biographer who died in 1987. He is survived by his son Simon.
