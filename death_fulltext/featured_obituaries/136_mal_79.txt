        Harold Orenstein, an entertainment lawyer who helped redefine the copyright status of musical theater, died on May 15 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan.
        In 1945 Mr. Orenstein became the head of nonradio licensing for Broadcast Music Inc., which represents songwriters and publishers. His duties included visiting nightclubs, taverns and state fairs where the company's music was performed and explaining the need to pay royalties.
        In 1950 Mr. Orenstein began a private practice focusing on copyright law. During the early 50's, he was introduced to the Broadway composer Frank Loesser, who hired him to investigate his renewal copyrights. The project led to a lifelong collaboration during which Mr. Orenstein developed various techniques to improve protection of creative work. Foremost among these was the legal treatment of a musical and all its songs as a single dramatic-musical work.
        Besides Loesser musicals like  ''Guys and Dolls,'' Mr. Orenstein represented productions including ''The Music Man,''  ''The Unsinkable Molly Brown,''  ''Kismet'' and ''The Wiz.'' In 1968 he produced Joe Orton's ''Loot'' for its first Broadway run, during which he is credited with introducing credit-card ticketing.
        He is survived by his wife, Indira, of Manhattan; a daughter, Donna Kerner of Norton, Mass.; a brother, Joseph Orenstein of Roslyn, N.Y., and a granddaughter.
