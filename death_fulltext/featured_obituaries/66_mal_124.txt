        Elder J. Olson, a poet, critic and Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Chicago, died on July 25 at his home in Albuquerque, N. M. He was 83 years old.
        Professor Olson died of pneumonia, said a spokesman for the University of Chicago, Jeff Makos.
        Professor Olson was one of the founding members of what became known as the Chicago School, a group of critics, literary scholars and philosophers associated with the university from the 1930's to the 1950's.
        He published one volume of poetry while an undergraduate at the University of Chicago and five more volumes during his professional career. They included "The Scarecrow Christ" (1955) and "Collected Poems" (1964). He also wrote three volumes of literary criticism, including "The Poetry of Dylan Thomas" (1954).
        He received many prizes for his writing, including the Poetry Society of America Award.
        Professor Olson began teaching at the University of Chicago in 1942, became a full professor in 1955 and Distinguished Professor in 1973. He retired in 1977.
        He is survived by his wife, Jerri Hays; three daughters, Shelly DeAbreu, of Albuquerque; Livy Strong, of Sewickley, Pa., and Annie Goldberg, of Providence, R.I.; a son, Elder Jr., of St. Simon's Island, Ga.; and 10 grandchildren.
