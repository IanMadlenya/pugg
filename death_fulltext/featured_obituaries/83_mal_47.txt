        Eugene B. Power, a pioneer in the use of microfilm for the storage and reproduction of scholarly information, died on Monday at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 88.
        He had Parkinson's disease, said Bernie DeGroat, a spokesman for the University of Michigan.
        During World War II, Mr. Power directed the microfilming of thousands of rare books and other printed materials in British libraries and took the film to the United States for preservation.
        In 1938, he founded University Microfilms, which is widely credited with having invented the collection on film of information that could be used in publishing. By merging microfilm with xerography, the company helped overcome the scarcity of books that were out of print while cutting the cost of such scholarly publications as doctoral dissertations.
        University Microfilms, begun at Ann Arbor, was acquired by the Xerox Corporation in 1962 for $8 million.
        In 1967 Mr. Power created the Power Foundation for philanthropy. He gave the Power Center for the Performing Arts to his alma mater, the University of Michigan, endowed a scholarship program at the university and helped to buy the site of the Battle of Hastings in England to preserve it from real estate speculation.
        He served two terms as a regent of the University of Michigan.
        In 1970 he was elected president of the National Association of College Governing Boards.
        He is survived by his son, Philip, of Ann Arbor, and two grandsons.
