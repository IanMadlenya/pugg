        H. Don Reynolds, whose career in commercial aviation spanned the days of propeller planes to those of supersonic airliners, died on Monday at his home in Phoenix. He was 83.
        The cause was cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        A specialist in aviation and transportation law, Mr. Reynolds was house counsel for Pan American World Airways in the early 1950's and assistant director of the International Air Transport Association from 1961 until 1972. At the association, based in Montreal, he often found himself mediating differences over contentious issues like fares and deregulation.
        He was the first director of the United States Tour Operators Association from 1976 to 1979, when he became the association's counsel on legal and government affairs. He was with the tour operators group, whose members package  domestic and international tours for bus companies, travel agencies and airlines, until 1991.
        Howard Donald Reynolds was born in Greeley, Colo. He graduated from Simpson College in Indianola, Iowa, in 1932 and from the Law School of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., in 1936. In 1942, he joined the Civil Aeronautics  Board as chief of economic regulation, and after service in the Navy he returned to the C.A.B., where he headed its first office of enforcement and litigation.
        After his brief tenure as house counsel for PanAm, he continued to provide legal representation for the carrier, as well as for Butler Aviation and American Express. At other points in his career he worked for Northwest Orient Airlines and American Airlines.
        Mr. Reynolds is survived by his wife, Imogene, who lives in Phoenix and in Scarsdale, N.Y., where he also lived part of the year; a daughter, Donogene Mealie of Kansas City, Mo.; a sister, Jane Ellen Morgan of Placerville, Calif.,  and three grandchildren.
