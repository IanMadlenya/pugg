        Reginald Pollack, a painter and printmaker, died on Dec. 6 at his home in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 77.
        Mr. Pollack was born in New York and first studied art with Moses Soyer at the High School of Music and Art. During World War II he served in the 87th Mountain Infantry and afterward studied in Paris on the G.I. Bill. He lived in France until 1961.
        From the early 1950's he exhibited regularly at the Peridot Gallery in New York, where he lived briefly in the early 1960's, teaching at Cooper Union and Yale University. He settled in Los Angeles in 1963, where he exhibited at the Felix Landau and Jefferson Galleries.
        Mr. Pollack worked in a representational style influenced by CÃ©zanne and Bonnard, loosely Impressionistic and brightly colored. His subjects ranged from portraits, still lifes and landscapes to more metaphysical images that included angels, animals or circus performers. He also did sculptures and in the early 1960's developed a faster, less ponderous way of making lithographs, using a specially treated plastic base instead of stone.
        In 1968 he did the drawings for ''O Is for Overkill, a Survival Alphabet,'' an antiwar book written by his twin brother, Merrill, who died in 1989.
        Reginald Pollack's work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Stanford University Museum of Art, the Skirball Cultural Center and Museum in Los Angeles and the Palm Springs Desert Museum. The New Orleans Museum of Art recently acquired two of his paintings and 81 drawings about the death of President John F. Kennedy.
        Mr. Pollack is survived by his wife, Kerstin Pollack; his daughters, Jane Henricksen, Maia Newman and Maria Klette-Ketchum, and three grandchildren.
