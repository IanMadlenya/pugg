        John S. Linakis, a real-estate and insurance broker in Jamaica, Queens, drowned on Wednesday in Highland Beach, Fla., said his wife, Yorka S. Linakis, a State Supreme Court justice in Queens. Mr. Linakis was 73 years old and had homes in Jamaica and Highland Beach.
        He was born in New York and educated in Athens. He attended Columbia University and served with the Army Air Forces in Europe during World War II. Afterward he became a real-estate broker and insurance agent and opened his own business in Jamaica.
        Mr. Linakis was president of the Jamaica Real Estate Board, the Queensboro Council for Social Welfare, the Queensboro Lung Association and a Rotary club. He was on the boards of the National Council of Christians and Jews, Jamaica Hospital, the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce and the Jamaica YMCA.
        He was also a benefactor of the Greek Orthodox Leadership 100. In 1978 the Greek Orthodox Church conferred on him the title of archon, the church's highest honor awarded to a lay person.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Linakis is survived by a sister, Phyllis Simitopoulos of Jamaica.
