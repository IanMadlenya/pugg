        Peter M. Hirsch, a former partner at Calet Hirsch & Spector, an advertising agency, died on July 29 at the Jacob Perlow Hospice in New York. He was 65.
        The cause was thyroid cancer, according to his wife, Patti.
        Mr. Hirsch was a chairman and a creative director, with Neil Calet, at Calet Hirsch. The agency's accounts included Kmart, Talon zippers, Ricoh, Getty Oil, Remington shavers, PepsiCo wines and spirits and Johnson & Johnson.
        Among the campaigns developed by Mr. Hirsch were the Muriel Cigars commercials in which Edie Adams sang, ''Why don't you pick one up and smoke it sometime?'' as well as a series of advertisements for Kmart, Toshiba and Stolichnaya vodka.
        In 1989, Mr. Hirsch developed a television spot promoting early cancer screenings from the American Cancer Society for the Advertising Council, which creates public service campaigns. In the spot, a middle-aged man is seen from his grave going back in time to a point where he dismisses his wife's suggestion that he be tested for colon cancer.
        Mr. Hirsch studied graphic design at the Pratt Institute in New York, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1956. He began his advertising career as an art director at Douglas Simon and joined Delahanty, Kurnit & Geller as a principal partner and creative director. That agency, which changed its name to DKG, became Calet Hirsch & Spector in 1983. It was bought in 1986 by the Ross Roy Group and renamed Calet, Hirsch & Ferrell. Mr. Hirsch retired in 1996.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hirsch, who lived in New York, is survived by a daughter, Julie Rosenblatt, of New York; his mother, Ida Moskowitz, of Los Angeles; and a sister, Sue Kogen, of Los Angeles.
