        Sylvan Geismar, retired chairman of the Manhattan Shirt Company, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 97 years old.
        Mr. Geismar died of congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        A native of Paterson, N.J., he was employed by the Manhattan Shirt Company for over 50 years, beginning as a messenger in 1907 at the age of 14. The company's original factory was in Paterson, where the Passaic River would frequently overflow and force the company to move merchandise and machinery to upper floors.
        As he rose in the company, Mr. Geismar became interested in the flooding problem and devoted considerable time to flood control. He became president of the company in 1955, and in 1956 he was named to a life term as honorary chairman of the Passaic Valley Flood Control Bureau.
        He retired as president and chief executive of the company in 1960. He remained chairman until 1964 and was a consultant until 1966.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Marjorie D. Leeser; two sons, Richard L., of Riverside, Conn., and John L., of London; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
