        Robert Van Scoyk, a writer and producer of television whodunits like the CBS series ''Murder, She Wrote,'' died on Aug. 23 in Los Angeles. A resident of the city since the late 1960's, he was 74.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, his family said.
        Mr. Scoyk wrote and produced episodes of the popular mystery show starring Angela Lansbury from its debut in 1984 until its run as a weekly series ended in 1996. He continued to write specials based on the series after that. Over the years he also wrote many other detective and crime shows as well as scripts for comedies and musicals.
        Robert Elseworth Van Scoyk was born in Dayton, Ohio. He attended Columbia and New York Universities and started in television as a pageboy at NBC studios.
        He earned his spurs in the 50's as a writer on ''The Ann Sothern Show'' and ''The Imogene Coca Show.'' He moved to Los Angeles to write for ''The Virginian,'' the first 90-minute Western series.
        He wrote the pilot for ''Young Maverick'' in 1979, another western, on CBS and was its executive producer. In 1979 he won an Edgar Allan Poe Award from the Mystery Writers of America for ''Murder Under Glass,'' a ''Columbo'' drama starring Peter Falk and Louis Jourdan.
        Mr. Van Scoyk is survived by his wife of 30 years, Leona Plotkin Van Scoyk; three sons, Robert, of Los Angeles; Andy, of Smith River, Calif.; and Matt Tyrnauer of Manhattan; his father, also Robert, of Daphne, Ala.; and a sister, Lois Harley of Winter Haven, Fla.
