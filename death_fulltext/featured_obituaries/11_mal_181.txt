        In 1970, he joined the Cinema International Corporation, a joint foreign film-distribution venture of three American motion picture companies, and later became a vice president of United International Pictures, a successor to Cinema International. He joined the Motion Picture Export Association in December 1983.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Katherine Rapp; a son, Michael, of Manhattan; two daughters, Judy, of Manhattan, and Amy, of Queens, and a sister, Doris Masters of Manhattan.
