        Dr. Lawrence Kuskin, an authority on children's rheumatic fever, died on Thursday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie. He was 92.
        The cause was injuries sustained in a car accident on Oct. 18 near Red Hook, N.Y.
        Dr. Kuskin was a former director of the Pediatric-Cardiac Clinic at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He directed the Pediatric-Cardiac Clinic from 1974 until his retirement in 1987. Before that, he was chief of pediatric cardiology at Coney Island Hospital, which he had joined in 1964. Under his direction, the hospital re-established a separate pediatriac program.
        Throughout the 1950's and 1960's, Dr. Kuskin was also a professor of environmental health at Downstate Medical Center, now called the Health Sciences Center-Brooklyn of the State University of New York.
        Born in Boston, Dr. Kuskin received his medical degree from Tufts Medical School and then served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy in the Philippines during World War II.
        Besides medicine, he maintained a lifelong interest in chamber music and was an accomplished violinist who played with many leading chamber music ensembles. With his wife, Sarah, who died in 1988, he was one of the founders in 1951 of the Chamber Music Associates, a workshop for non-professional chamber musicians in Manhattan. After his retirement, he studied philosophy at Columbia University.
        He is survived by his companion, Hazel Rublin; two sons, Charles of Manhattan and Anton of Cornwall Bridge, Conn.; a sister, Sybil Frumson of Castro Valley, Calif.; three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.
