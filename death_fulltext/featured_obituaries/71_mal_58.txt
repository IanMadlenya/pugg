        Bill Shockley, the place-kicker who scored the first points for the New York Titans, now known as the New York Jets, died on Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 55, and his family said he died of cancer.
        A graduate of West Chester State College in Pennsylvania, Mr. Shockley joined the Titans of the new American Football League in 1960.
        His 15-yard field goal in the second quarter of the team's opening game, a 27-3 victory over the Buffalo Bills at the Polo Grounds on Sept. 11, 1960, represented the first points ever scored by the franchise.
        He is survived by his wife, Joyce; four daughters, Kenya Gordon and Cory, Indira and Deborah Schockley; a son, William, and two grandchildren.
