        Roger B. Sammon, a former executive at chemical and plastics companies and a scholar of Napoleon's military strategies, died on Saturday in Huntsville, Ala. He was 75.
        He died of complications from heart disease, said his son, Richard.
        When he retired in 1983, Mr. Sammon was the general manager of the North American plastic operations of Imperial Chemical Industries, a British company. Before joining Imperial Chemical, Mr. Sammon was an executive at Stein, Hall & Company, a chemical manufacturer. He served as president of Stein, Hall's operations in Toronto and vice president of the company's operations in New York City.
        Mr. Sammon once owned more than 3,000 books and journals on Napoleonic military history, which he donated to the University of Delaware. He wrote articles and gave lectures on the military strategies used by Napoleon, techniques he thought businesses could use.
        He was a chief petty officer in World War II, serving in many battles in the Pacific, including Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He graduated from Columbia College in 1947.
        Mr. Sammon is survived by his wife, Mary B. Sammon, nine children and 22 grandchildren.
