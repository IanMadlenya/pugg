        Alfred Toefield, the first vice president of the United States Cycling Federation and a former manager and coach of the United States cycling team, died last Tuesday at his home in Floral Park, Queens. He was 68 years old and had been suffering from stomach cancer.
        As a longtime cycling enthusiast, Mr. Toefield, who coached American teams in the Pan American Games and managed United States squads that won a team bronze medal in the 1968 Olympics and an individual gold medal at the 1972 Games, was a man who lived a double life. For most of his career in cycling, he was a member of the New York City Police Department, from which he retired with the rank of sergeant in 1983 after 37 years of service.
        Mr. Toefield also served as state and regional cycling chairman for the Empire State Games, organized a series of 24-hour bike races, was instrumental in the construction of the velodrome in Kissena Park in Flushing, Queens and was an owner of the Kissena Cycle Shop.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine; three daughters, Patricia Quail, Kathryn Striebel and Marie Horowitz; a brother, Joe Kantor, and eight grandchildren.
