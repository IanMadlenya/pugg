        Yizhar Smilansky, a revered Israeli writer known as S. Yizhar, best known for his stories of the 1948 war of independence, died Monday of heart failure. He was 89.
        Mr. Smilansky was given his pen name in 1938 and was considered an innovator in modern Hebrew literature, combining difficult, elegant prose and street slang.
        His story about the 1948 war, ''Hirbet Hizah,'' was among the first to describe the expulsion of Arab villagers and was later made into a movie. ''The Captive,'' about an Arab prisoner of that war, created controversy for questioning Israeli ethics. He served as an intelligence officer in that war.
        In 1959, only 43 years old, he won the Israel Prize for Literature for a two-volume novel of the war called ''Days of Ziklag.''
        Mr. Smilansky stopped publishing fiction in the mid-1960's for some 30 years, before resuming in the 1990's. He was a professor of education and Hebrew literature at Hebrew University and later at Tel Aviv University. He was elected a member of Parliament in 1949 in David Ben-Gurion's Mapai party and served for six terms.
        He was born in 1916 and raised in Rehovot. He studied at Hebrew University and Harvard University and was awarded a Ph.D.
