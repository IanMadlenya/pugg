        Stefan Martin, an artist noted for his wood engravings, drowned on Oct. 7 in Assunpink Lake in Millstone Township, N.J. He was 58 and lived in Roosevelt, N.J.
        He was in a rowboat that apparently capsized, said his brother, Tony Martin of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Martin, who was also a painter, printmaker and illustrator, was a son of the illustrator David Stone Martin and Thelma Durkin Martin, who painted murals before becoming a photographer. He received a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Art Institute of Chicago. His work was exhibited at a number of galleries and museums.
        In addition to his brother, he is survived by three daughters, Debra, of Columbia, S.C., Cheryl, of Missoula, Mont., and Tanya, of Long Branch, N.J.; two sons, Christopher, of New Egypt, N.J., and Ian, and a half-sister, Rio Parfrey of Los Angeles.
