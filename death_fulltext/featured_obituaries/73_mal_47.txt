        Heinz H. Bender, the pastry chef to three Presidents, died Thursday at his home on Longboat Key, outside Sarasota. He was 83.
        Before retiring in 1979, Mr. Bender worked for 11 years in the White House, baking cakes and cookies for Presidents Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.
        He also made the wedding cake when Mr. Nixon's daughter, Tricia, was married in 1971 to Edward Cox. A mix-up led the White House to release a garbled recipe for it to the public.
        "The phones were ringing off the hook," recalled Mr. Bender's wife, Shirley, who was the executive housekeeper at the White House from 1971 to 1979. "When the people opened their ovens all they found was this hot soup that was supposed to be a cake."
        Born in 1909 in Solingen-Ohligs, Germany, Mr. Bender came to the United States in the early 1930's after working as an apprentice in his father's bakery. Mr. Bender came to the White House in November 1969, after he was recommended by a colleague in the restaurant industry.
        Besides his wife, to whom Mr. Bender was married in 1971, survivors include a daughter, Margaret W. Bailey of Arlington, Va.; a son, Howard H. Bender of East New York, N.J., and four grandchildren.
