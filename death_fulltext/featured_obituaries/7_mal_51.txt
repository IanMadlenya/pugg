        Archbishop Antonio Jose Plaza, a controversial leader of Argentina's conservative Roman Catholic Church, died here Tuesday night after a heart attack. He was 77 years old.
        From 1955 until 1985 he was Archbishop of La Plata, 35 miles south of Buenos Aires, and one of Argentina's main exponents of fundamentalist Catholic doctrine.
        The Archbishop was a firm supporter of the military Government's ''dirty war'' against leftist guerrillas in the 1970's, and he criticized so-called liberation theology as the preserve of Communists and pseudo-Catholics.
        Human-rights groups accused him of witnessing torture sessions in secret detention centers during the military regime of 1976 to 1983, when 9,000 people disappeared at the hands of the security forces.
        A witness in the trial last year of Gen. Ramon Camps for human-rights abuses said he saw the general and Archbishop Plaza visit such a detention center together. General Camps is serving a life term on dozens of counts of torture.
        Archbishop Plaza was born in Mar del Plata, 250 miles south of Buenos Aires, on Dec. 21, 1909.
