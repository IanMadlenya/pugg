        Michael Matthews, a theater writer, performance artist and one of Ping Chong's principal collaborators in the experimental theater, died in Amsterdam on Jan. 11. He was 37.
        The cause was AIDS, said Bruce Allardice, managing director of Ping Chong & Company.
        Mr. Matthews wrote the text and lyrics to Mr. Chong's "Chinoiserie," presented in 1995 in the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, and contributed to the text and performed in Mr. Chong's earlier work, "Deshima." He was also a performer in productions by Robert Wilson, Robert Longo and others. His own plays include the "Monster Trilogy" ("Frank," a solo performance piece based on Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein; "Dracula" and "Hyde") and the "Dictator Trilogy" ("Idi Amin Dada," "Cambodia Mon Amour" and "Baby Doc  Ceausescu").
        He was born in New York City and graduated from Temple University. In 1984 he moved to the Netherlands, where he was a writer, director and performer. He recently won an award from the Dutch Ministry of Culture for "best play/performance of the 1994-95 season" for "Hyde" and "Cambodia Mon Amour."
        He is survived by his companion, Peter Sas of Amsterdam; his mother, Dorothy  A. Matthews of Queens, N.Y.; his father, Carlton M. Matthews of the Dominican Republic, and a sister, Rita Matthews-Niles of Chicago.
