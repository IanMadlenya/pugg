        Gordon W. Gilkey, an artist, teacher, collector and for 22 years the curator of prints and drawings at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon, died Oct. 28. He was 88.
        Mr. Gilkey was born in Scio, Ore., in 1912 and became the first graduate to earn a fine arts degree in printmaking at the University of Oregon. He began collecting prints by trading his own work with other students. He expanded his knowledge of the medium after World War II, when he worked for the War Department in Europe, helping to locate and return artworks confiscated by the Nazis.
        In 1947 Mr. Gilkey joined the faculty of Oregon State University in Corvallis, retiring in 1978 as dean of the College of Liberal Arts. That year he became curator of prints and drawings at the Portland Art Museum and professor and printmaker in residence at the Museum Art School, now known as the Pacific Northwest College of Art, in Portland.
        The college organized a retrospective of his work in 1999.
        Over the years Mr. Gilkey amassed a large collection of prints spanning the period from the 15th century to the present, with particular emphasis on Mexican, French 19th-century and German Expressionist works. Starting in 1978, he donated more than 10,000 prints, and some drawings, to the museum, which established the Vivian and Gordon Gilkey Center for Graphic Arts in 1993.
        Mr. Gilkey's wife, the former Vivian Moore, died in 1995.
        He is survived by a son, Gordon Spencer Gilkey; a sister, Grace Gilkey Dawson of Woodinville, Wash.; and a granddaughter.
