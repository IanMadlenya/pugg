        Jerry Girard, a sports broadcaster for WPIX-TV in New York from 1974 to 1995, died Sunday in Hawthorne, N.Y. He was 74.
        He died of esophageal cancer at Westchester Medical Center, his family said.
        Girard, originally Gerard Alfred Suglia, was born Aug. 6, 1932, in Chicago. He was reared in the Bronx and attended Manhattan College.
        He was a disc jockey in Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Gary, Ind.; and Altoona, Pa., before returning to New York as a record librarian at WNEW radio. He moved to WPIX as a news writer before becoming the station's sports voice.
        His nightly television appearances to describe the day's sports happenings were characterized by frequent acidic commentary, invariably delivered with a straight face.
        He is survived by two sisters.
