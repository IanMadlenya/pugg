        Dr. John W. Alexander, a pediatrician and educator who helped develop the first neonatal intensive-care unit in Newark, died of a heart attack on Sunday at his house in Orange, N.J. He was 71 years old.
        Dr. Alexander was a prime mover in developing Children's Hospital as a fully staffed pediatric division of the United Hospital Medical Center in Newark. In the late 60's he established a neonatal intensive-care unit at Babies Hospital, the forerunner of Children's Hospital.
        He had been in private practice in Orange and in Newark since graduating from Meharry Medical College in Nashville in 1943 and had taught at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and at the New Jersey Medical School. In the mid-60's he was the first black to be elected president of the Orange Board of Education and developed a desegregation plan for the town.
        Surviving are his wife, Emmy Lou; three sons, John Jr., and Kevin, both of Orange, and Robert, of Atlanta.; a brother, Walter, of South Orange, and four grandchildren.
