        George Seewagen, the tennis coach at St. John's University for 49 years, died yesterday at Booth Memorial Hospital in Flushing, Queens. He was 82 years old.
        His daughter, Barbara Steger, said he had died of a heart attack.
        Mr. Seewagen was a competitive player in the amateur and professional ranks. He coached at St. John's until 1986, when he suffered a stroke. Among those at the tennis clinics he frequently ran were John McEnroe.
        His son, George, who is known as Butch, is the teaching pro at the Bayside Tennis Club.
        Besides his daughter and his son, Mr. Seewagen is survived by his wife, Clella; a sister, Estelle, and one grandson.
