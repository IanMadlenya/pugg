        Air Vice Marshal John Astley Gray, who as a pilot was instrumental in the defeat in 1920 of an African rebel known as the Mad Mullah in what was Britain's cheapest war, has died at the age of 87, his family announced today.
        In British Somaliland, on the Horn of Africa, John Gray and fellow pilots flying two-seat DH-9 bombers took just three weeks to defeat the forces of the rebel chieftain, Mohammed bin Abdullah, who had been fighting British soldiers since 1900.
        In the 1920 campaign, the airmen were assisted by a small camel force and about 800 men of the King's African Rifles.
        John Gray, who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, won the George Medal in World War II for helping in the rescue of crewmen from a bomber that had crashed and caught fire on landing at its base in England. He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1954.
        He died Saturday at his home in Saxmundham in eastern England. The cause of death was not given.
