        Mark F. Hawkins, a humorist whose essays on human foibles spanned 50 years, died on Oct. 7 at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco. He was 82 years old and lived in San Francisco.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Hawkins started his career as a columnist for the newsletter of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union in San Francisco, where he was an organizer. Later his work ran in The San Francisco Chronicle, Ladies Home Journal, Daily People's World, The New York Times, New West magazine and other publications.
        He also fired off frequent missives to friends and to celebrities like Robert Gottlieb at The New Yorker and Katharine Hepburn, musing on issues and foibles, his own included.
        Mr. Hawkins's politically radical youth generated a thick Federal Bureau of Investigation file. He fantasized about "the deportation order -- 1/8 of me to Switzerland, 1/16 to Spain, 1/4 to Scotland, 1/4 to England, 1/32 to Bavaria, 1/64 to Ireland and other parts to France, Belgium and Luxembourg -- I don't mind, except for that part of me going to Spain."
        He ranted at death: "I've kicked a cat in my day; I've lied, lechered, gambled, played the fool and the coward, goofed off and cheated one time at Scrabble. But I've done nothing to deserve the death penalty."
        His mourners, he predicted, "will gather in our kitchen to drink up all my scotch." In fact, that gathering is set for Saturday.
        Mr. Hawkins was born in Spokane, Wash., and attended the University of Washington.
        Surviving are his wife of 56 years, the former Charlotte Mangelsdorf; a son, Mark F. Hawkins of Palo Alto, Calif.; a daughter, Julia Hawkins of Marin County, Calif.; a brother, Forrest Hawkins of Portland, Ore.; a sister, Quail Hawkins of Pacific Grove, Calif., and four grandchildren.
