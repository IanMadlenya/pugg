        Donald Wyckoff, former president of the American Crafts Council, a national organization of artists and crafts people, died of Hodgkins disease Friday at his home in Amagansett, L.I. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Wyckoff joined the council, now the American Craft Museum, as executive vice president in 1967 and in 1968 became president, serving until 1976. In 1976 he opened a crafts consulting firm, Donald Wyckoff Associates in Manhattan, and from 1976 to 1980 was coordinator of cultural projects for the National Parks Service in Washington.
        Most recently he had been involved in the restoration of the family homestead in Brooklyn, built around 1650 and one of the oldest frame houses in New York State. The site is now the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House, a museum of early Dutch life.
        Mr. Wyckoff was born in Greenlawn, L.I., and graduated from George Washington University. He held a master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University.
        He is survived by a brother, William, of Greenlawn, L.I.; two daughters, Joanna Struk of Amagansett, and Jennifer Shore of Greenlawn, and two grandsons.
