        Marshall P. Safir, a businessman and former shipping executive who long opposed government subsidies to the industry, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 75 and lived in Floral Park, L.I.
        The cause was a heart attack during recovery from surgery for colon and liver cancer, a family spokesman said.
        From 1939 to 1968, Mr. Safir was president of the Atlas Moving and Storage Company and, from 1955 to 1968, he was president of the Weissberger Moving and Storage Company, which was one of the largest moving companies in New York.
        In 1965, he founded Sapphire Steamship Lines, a North American shipping concern. The company went out of business in 1968. For more than 30 years, Mr. Safir was an active foe of a subsidized shipping industry as inefficient and anticompetitive.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Gladys; his three sons, Peter, of Washington, Andrew, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Kenneth, of Highland Park, N.J.; his brother, the New York Times columnist William Safire of Washington, and four grandchildren.
