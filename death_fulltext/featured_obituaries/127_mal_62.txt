        Frank Bertino, the former teacher, football coach and athletic director at Riverdale Country School who ranks second in victories among high school coaches in New York State, died last Sunday at his home in Yorktown, N.Y. He was 77.
        The cause was heart failure, said Bob Clark, a close friend who was an assistant coach for Bertino for 15 years.
        Before Bertino took over the football program at the Bronx prep school in 1944, the team had not won a game in two years. By the time he retired 40 years later, Bertino's football teams had won 247 games (with 47 losses and 6 ties) and 13 Ivy Prep School League titles. Over a span of 51 games from 1958-65, no team beat Bertino's.
        Bertino, who grew up in Port Chester, N.Y., displayed enough talent on the football field that he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles after graduating from Albright College in Reading, Pa.
        He chose teaching over football, though, and after a brief stint as a police officer in Port Chester, he began his career at Riverdale in 1944, teaching history and coaching baseball, basketball and football.
        It was as football coach that he made his mark. ''Coach Bertino taught me that there was no shortcut to work; he teaches about life,'' one of his top players, Calvin Hill, once said. Hill went on to glory as a running back at Yale and with the Dallas Cowboys.
        ''Frank never raised his voice to be heard,'' Clark said.
        Bertino founded the Riverdale Country School day camp in 1959 and, 11 years later, purchased the Nabby Day Camp in Mohegan Lake, N.Y., which he was directing until his death with the help of his son, Joseph.
        Besides Joseph, of Ossining, N.Y., Bertino is survived by his wife, Florence; and three daughters: Madeline Graham of Lake Wildwood, Calif.; Gemma Bertino of Mohegan Lake, and Jean Baumgartner of Ossining; two brothers, and five grandchildren.
