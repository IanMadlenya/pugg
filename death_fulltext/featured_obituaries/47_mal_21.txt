        Maurice G. Gurin, an author and fund-raising consultant, died on Saturday at Forbes Hospice in Pittsburgh. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cancer, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. Gurin, who retired in 1987, had been president of The Gurin Group Inc. from 1972 to 1986. From 1959 to 1971, he headed firms that eventually became Bowen, Gurin, Barnes, Roche & Carlson Inc., with offices in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
        He served with many professional organizations, including the National Society of Fund Raising Executives and the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.
        In 1970, at the request of the Ford Foundation, he developed a program to train fund-raising officers for predominantly black colleges. He wrote "Confessions of a Fund Raiser," (1985, Taft Group) and "Advancing Beyond the Techniques in Fund Raising," to be published in 1991 by the Taft Group. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force in World War II.
        He is survived by two brothers, Louis M. Fushan and Norman Gurin, both of Pittsburgh.
