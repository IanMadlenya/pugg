        Stuart Symington Janney Jr., one of the nation's leading horse breeders and the owner of Ruffian and Private Terms, was killed in an automobile accident Thursday while driving home to Locust Hill Farm in Glyndon, Md. He was 81 years old.
        His son, Stuart S. Janney 3d, said Mr. Janney apparently suffered a heart attack just before the accident.
        Mr. Janney, a member of the Jockey Club and a former chairman of the Maryland Racing Commission, enjoyed much success in racing. His darkest moment in the sport came on July 6, 1975. Ruffian, his undefeated filly champion, suffered a broken leg during a nationally televised match race against Foolish Pleasure at Belmont Park and had to be destroyed.
        This spring, Private Terms, a colt related to Ruffian, won the Wood Memorial at Belmont. He was the favorite in the Kentucky Derby but finished ninth.
        Mr. Janney, who was born in Baltimore, was a graduate of Princeton University and the Harvard Law School, where he was editor of The Harvard Law Review. He rode winners of the Maryland Hunt Cup steeplechase four times, and continued to ride until this year.
        Besides his son, Mr. Janney is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Rufus Williams of Glyndon; Mrs. William Trimble of Owings Mills, Md., and Mrs. Boykin Rose of Washington, and nine grandchildren.
