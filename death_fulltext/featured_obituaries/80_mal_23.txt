        Louis Archibald Gillies, a retired rear admiral who commanded the New York Naval Militia until he retired in 1962 after 42 years of service, died on Aug. 31 in Warwick, R.I. He was 90 years old.
        He had suffered a brief illness, his family said.
        Admiral Gillies, a native of New York, was educated at Cooper Union and New York University. He graduated from the Naval War College.
        He started his naval career in 1920 as an apprentice seaman in the New York Naval Militia. The unit -- like the Army National Guard and Air National Guard -- is part of the State Division of Military and Naval Affairs.
        He was commissioned an ensign in 1929. On active duty as an intelligence officer in World War II, he served on the staff of the Commander of the United States Fifth Fleet and saw action in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He won a Bronze Star.
        In 1952, as a captain, he was placed in command of the Naval Militia, with about 4,000 Navy and Marine Corps officers and militiamen based throughout the state. Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller nominated him to be a rear admiral in 1960.
        After leaving the militia, he joined the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Puerto Rico as district manager for the Virgin Islands. He retired to Newport, R.I., in 1973.
        Admiral Gillies is survived by his wife, Mary R.; a son, Archibald L. of Manhattan; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
