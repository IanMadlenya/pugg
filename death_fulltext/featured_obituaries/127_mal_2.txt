        Mohammed Mahdi al-Jawahri, the most famous contemporary Iraqi poet in the Arab world, who was forced to flee his country as an opponent of the Baghdad regime, died in exile in Syria on Sunday. He was 97.
        The Arab News Agency of Syria said he died in a hospital in Damascus. He fled to Syria in 1979 amid a wave of internal strife and a crackdown on dissidents by the Iraqi Government.
        Mr. Jawahri was considered the last of the classical Arab poets, and was known among his admirers as the Singer for the Sunlight. ''He was a poet, a writer and a warrior for liberty and justice,'' said Saad el-Din Wahab, president of the Egyptian Writers Union.
        He was the author of ''Between Passion and Feeling'' (1928). Perhaps his best-known work was ''Al-Jawahri's Divan,'' published in 1935 and reissued in 1949.
        He was born in Najaf in southeast Iraq in 1900. Brought to fame by his poetry, he won the favor of the royal court of Iraq. But he then turned to independent journalism and in 1945 founded a newspaper, Al Rai al Am,  and took a seat in the Iraqi Parliament three years later.
        He used his paper as a platform to oppose the royal regime and to promote close relations between Arab countries and the Soviet Union. In opposing the monarchy, he also railed against the British interests that propped it up.
        The monarchy was overthrown in a military revolution in 1958, and King Faisal II was killed. Mr. Jawahri was repeatedly jailed and forced into exile. He returned for a time after the army coup of 1958.
        Mr. Jawahri's survivors include two sons and three daughters. He expressed a wish to be buried in Najaf, but reports from Cairo said there was no word whether the Iraqi Government would permit it. Another report said a funeral was held in Damascus on Monday.
