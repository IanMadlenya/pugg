        The Rev. Sylvio Roderique Gilbert, the oldest living member of Maryknoll, the popular name for the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America, died on Monday at the Maryknoll residence in Maryknoll, N.Y. He was 95 years old.
        Father Gilbert died of cancer of the colon and liver, said Joseph Ferguson, a spokesman for the society.
        Father Gilbert, a native of Grosvenor Dale, Conn., was the last living member of the society to have known its founders, the Rev. James A. Walsh and the Rev. Thomas F. Price. He was educated in the Maryknoll seminary and ordained in 1927. That year he was assigned to missionary work in China, in several regions of Manchuria, and in 1930 was appointed pastor of the mission parish at Tunghwa, Budding Flower Village.
        Father Gilbert remained there until 1941, when he was arrested by Japanese forces who occupied Manchuria and who imprisoned him in a concentration camp until they expelled him from the country in 1943. Father Gilbert returned to the United States and was appointed a chaplain at an internment camp for Japanese-Americans in Arizona, where he spent the remainder of the war.
        Father Gilbert is survived by two brothers, Lozaise, of Dudley, Mass., and Lionel, of Worcester, Mass.
