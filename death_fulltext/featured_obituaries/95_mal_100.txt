        Walter J. Blum, an expert on tax law and corporate reorganization, died last Sunday at his home in Chicago. He was 76.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Wendy Coggins of Minneapolis.
        Mr. Blum taught courses in tax law and corporate finance at the University of Chicago for 42 years, becoming the Edward H. Levi Distinguished Service Professor in 1985. He retired in 1988.
        He was a consultant to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service in the 1960's.
        Throughout his teaching career, he wrote about tax law. He was the co-author, with Harry Kalven, of "The Uneasy Case for Progressive Taxation" (1953), a critique of income tax policy.
        He was born in Chicago, and received a bachelor's degree in 1939 and a law degree in 1941 from the University of Chicago.
        Professor Blum's wife, the former Natalie W. Richter, died in 1987. Besides his daughter Wendy, he is survived by another daughter, Catherine Ann Scott of Burney, Calif., and three grandchildren.
