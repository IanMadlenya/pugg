        August Howard, founder of the American Polar Society and the editor of a newsletter for polar explorers and researchers, died of heart disease Sunday. He was 78 years old and lived in Rego Park, Queens.
        Mr. Howard was a public affairs officer of the National Council of Boy Scouts of America from 1928 to 1970, but he was better known for his voluntary efforts to further exploration and understanding of the Arctic and Antarctica. The year after Mr. Howard joined the Boy Scouts staff, Rear Adm. Richard E. Byrd selected a scout, Paul Siple, to accompany an Antarctic expedition. Mr. Howard helped publicize the selection, and his passionate interest in polar activities dated from that time.
        In 1934, Mr. Howard founded the American Polar Society as a forum for people involved or interested in polar exploration and research. In 1935, largely at his own expense, he began publishing The Polar Times, a semiannual compendium of articles about the poles culled mostly from newspapers, magazines and scientific journals. The newsletter was distributed free to members of the society, who paid annual dues of $2.
        Most leading polar explorers, scientists and expedition members of the 30's and 40's joined the society. Mr. Howard was its secretary and administrative officer until his death.
        Although Mr. Howard never visited either polar region, his work on behalf of professionals won the praise of such explorers as Admiral Byrd, Lincoln Ellsworth and Mr. Siple.
        Two landmarks in Antarctica, Cape Howard on the Wedell Sea and the Polar Times Glacier, were named in his honor by the expeditions that placed them on the map.
        Surviving are his wife, Rose, and two children, Alan and Doris.
