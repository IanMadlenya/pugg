        Mr. Corbin, a native of Winnepeg, Manitoba, moved to the United States in 1935. He became actively involved in John F. Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign after meeting Robert Kennedy in Wisconsin in the late 1950's.
        Mr. Corbin was active in the Wisconsin and West Virginia primary campaigns and in New York State in the general election of 1960.
        He became a special assistant to the national Democratic chairman and worked in Robert Kennedy's campaign for the Senate in 1964.
        After Robert Kennedy's assassination in 1968 Mr. Corbin moved to Nashville, where he operated the Country Music Wax Museum. He returned to the Washington area in 1970 and opened a political consulting business. He retired because of illness last fall.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gertrude McGowan; a daughter, Darlene Corbin of Marina del Rey, Calif.; and two sisters, Irene Cutler of Winnepeg and Frida Shankman of Suissan, Calif.
