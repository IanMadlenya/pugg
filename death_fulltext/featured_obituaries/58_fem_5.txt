        Mary Vandergrift, a founder and longtime executive of Parke-Bernet Galleries auction house and for many years a major figure in international auctions, died in her sleep on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.
        Her daughter, Joan Sweeney of Manhattan, said the cause of death was heart failure.
        Ms. Vandergrift was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 4, 1901, and attended college there. Pursuing an interest in art and antiques, she worked for American Art Galleries, later known as American Art Anderson Galleries, a well-known auction house in New York. In 1937, she left American Art with a group of employees that included Hiram H. Parke, Otto Bernet, Leslie A. Hyam and Lewis Marion. Together they formed Parke-Bernet Galleries, which came to dominate New York City's art and antiques auction scene.
        Throughout her assocation with the house, Miss Vandergrift oversaw press relations and the design and production of catalogues. When Parke-Bernet was acquired by Sotheby & Company, an English auction house, in 1963, she was named executive vice president of the new firm, Sotheby Parke Bernet. When she retired in 1971, she was succeeded by John Marion, who is now chairman of the firm, which changed its name to Sotheby's Inc. in 1985.
        Miss Vandergrift was on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development. Her first husband, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Sr., a career officer in the Army, died in the early 1950's; in 1968 she married E. Swift Newton, an Irish businessman, who died in 1974.
        She is survived by her daughter; a sister, Katherine, of Manhattan; her step-son, Charles Wilson Kingsbury Jr., of Orlando, Fla., and three granddaughters.
