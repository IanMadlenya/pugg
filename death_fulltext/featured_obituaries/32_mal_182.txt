        Peter Bommarito, who headed the United Rubber Workers Union from 1966 to 1981, died of cancer Monday at the Akron General Medical Center in Ohio. He was 74 years old and lived in Mogadore, on the outskirts of Akron.
        Mr. Bommarito served as an international vice president of the United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum and Plastics Workers of America from 1960 to 1966, when he won control of the 180,000-member union from George Burdon, who resigned in the face of strong opposition after three terms.
        Soon after, Mr. Bommarito led his union into a three-month strike against the five major tire producers, the B. F. Goodrich Company, Uniroyal, the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, General Tire and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The strike lasted three months and gained the union some major concessions.
        In 1976 his union, which then had 190,000 members, staged a four-month strike against four major rubber companies, Firestone, Goodyear, Goodrich and Uniroyal, winning a 35 percent wage increase over three years.
        In 1980 Mr. Bommarito led about 8,000 workers at Uniroyal in a 40-day strike that gained wage increases in excess of Federal wage guidelines. But a year later he asked his members to take a pay cut to keep the company from foundering.
        He was active in promoting safety because many of his union's members were in contact with chemicals identified with a variety of diseases, including cancer.
        Mr. Bommarito joined Local 101 of the union in the early 1940's while he was a machinist in Detroit at the United States Rubber Company, which later became Uniroyal. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1942 and served in the South Pacific.
        Returning to Detroit in 1946, he was elected to the executive board of Local 101 and became president of the local in 1957.
        When he retired as president of the union in 1981 it had dwindled to 140,000 members because of plant closings. There are now about 109,000 members.  Mr. Bommarito is survived by his wife, Dorothy.
