        Michael Raoul Duval, an investment banker and lawyer who served in the Nixon and Ford White Houses, died Friday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 62.
        The cause was multiple sclerosis, his wife, Janice Mahan Duval, said.
        Mr. Duval was a lawyer at the Federal Aviation Administration in 1970 when he joined President Richard M. Nixon's support team, planning and scheduling foreign trips. From 1972 to 1975 he was on the domestic council staff dealing with economic and energy policies.
        He was a member of the intelligence coordinating group under President Gerald R. Ford and helped prepare Mr. Ford for a debate with Gov. Jimmy Carter, his Democratic opponent in the 1976 presidential election. He left the White House as special counsel to Mr. Ford.
        He joined the Mead Corporation in Dayton, Ohio, in 1977, and rose to senior vice president. He moved to the First Boston Corporation in New York in 1984 and was a member of its management committee.
        In 1990 he formed the Duval Group, a New York investment banking firm specializing in international mergers. Moving to Santa Fe, he opened an investment banking firm, Michael Duval & Associates, and was chairman until he retired two years ago.
        A native of San Francisco, Mr. Duval graduated from Georgetown University in 1961 and received his law degree at Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco in 1967.
        Besides his wife, a psychotherapist, Mr. Duval is survived by their son, Jack, and a sister, Diane King of San Francisco.
