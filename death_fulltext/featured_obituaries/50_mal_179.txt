        Jacques Koopman, a British silver dealer, died yesterday at his London home. He was 60 years old.
        A nephew, Michael Koopman, said yesterday by telephone from London that Mr. Koopman had died after a short illness. He declined to disclose the cause of death.
        Born in Amsterdam, the son of an antiques dealer, Jacques Koopman was 9 years old when he escaped from a train that was taking him and his parents to a concentration camp. Both his parents died. He spent four years in hiding and, after the war, joined an older brother, Edward, in Manchester, England.
        The Koopmans' flourishing silver business, known as E. & C. T. Koopman & Son, operates in a small shop in Manchester and in a sprawling establishment on the main floor of the Silver Vaults on Chancery Lane in London, where Mr. Koopman went to work on weekdays until a month ago. 'Dominant Force' in Market
        "He was one of the great dealers in the postwar period in the silver field," said Kevin Tierney of Sotheby's in New York. "He became the dominant force in the world silver market."
        Mr. Koopman outbid many of his competitors for -- or bought with them -- many of the silver treasures auctioned or sold privately in the last 20 years in London and New York. He helped form the Georgian silver collection of Mohamad Mehdi al-Tajir, former Ambassador to London of the United Arab Emirates, one of the finest holdings assembled since World War II. And he sold major 18th- and 19th-century silver to the Royal Scottish Museum in Edinburgh, Brighton Pavilion, the National Maritime Museum of London and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elisabeth Kuiper; three daughters, Susan Kyle, Elisabeth Hamilton and Sophia, all of London; two brothers, Edward, of Manchester, and Maurits, of Amsterdam; and a sister, Rita Schyf, of Ostend, Belgium.
