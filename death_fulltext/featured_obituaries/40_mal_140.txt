        Bruce W. Nichols, a senior partner in the law firm of Davis Polk & Wardwell, died of prostate cancer yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Nichols, a specialist in banking law, played a major role in many important cases. He was instrumental in the merger in 1958 of J. P. Morgan & Company and the Guaranty Trust Company, and he became the principal legal adviser to the merged Morgan Guaranty.
        As an adviser, he dealt with, among other events, the ''salad oil scandal'' of 1963, involving false warehouse receipts for nonexistent oil in storage tanks in New Jersey; the failure of the Herstaat Bank in Germany in 1974 and the financial negotiations relating to the release of the American hostages in Iran in 1981.
        Mr. Nichols, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Princeton and from the Harvard Law School, where he was articles editor of The Harvard Law Review.
        He joined Davis Polk upon graduation from Harvard in 1954 and became a partner in 1961. He served for several years as president of the New York Law Institute.
        He is survived by his mother, Marjorie, of Manhattan, and a brother, William, of Boston.
