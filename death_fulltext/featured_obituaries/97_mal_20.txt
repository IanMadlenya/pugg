        Howard Liss, the author of scores of books about sports for adults and children, died on Jan. 15 at his home in Manhattan. He was 72.
        Mr. Liss, who was born in Brooklyn, worked as a factory hand and a shipping clerk before he made writing his career. He worked as a play doctor in the 1940's, contributed continuity for syndicated comic strips and wrote comedy material for radio and television shows. He began writing books in the early 1960's.
        A number of his books were written with or about sports stars, among them Y. A. Tittle, Yogi Berra, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Mickey Mantle and Rocky Graziano. He wrote about baseball, boxing, soccer, lacrosse, fishing, skiing, hockey and football.
        Among his books for young readers was "Playoff" (1966), a re-creation of 10 outstanding football championship games. His other books include "The Giant Book of Strange but True Sports Stories" (1976) and "The Giant Book of More Strange Sport Stories" (1983).
        He is survived by two daughters, Jodi Liss and Jennifer Kukafka, both of Manhattan.
