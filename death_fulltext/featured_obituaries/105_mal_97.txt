        Donald Crawford Stone, an educator and Federal planner in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations, died on Thursday at the Robin Run Health Center in Indianapolis. He was 92 and most recently lived in Indianapolis.
        He served as executive director of the Public Administration Service and, later, as assistant budget director for the White House from 1933 to 1948. His main task was to see to it that Government agencies like the Public Works Administration were run as efficiently as possible and to recommend reorganization or new procedures where necessary.
        He next served as director of administration for the Economic Cooperation Administration and the Mutual Security Administration. He helped to organize the Marshall Plan for Europe, United States assistance programs in Asia and Unesco,  the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
        A native of Cleveland, Mr. Stone graduated from Colgate University and the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. In 1953 he left Government service to become president of Springfield College in Massachusetts.
        He then became dean of the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs at the University of Pittsburgh. More recently, from 1975 until 1990, he taught as Distinguished Public Service Professor at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
        Mr. Stone is survived by his wife of 67 years, Alice Kathryn Biermann Stone;  three daughters, the Rev. Nancy Leland Stone Dickinson of Indianapolis, Dr. Alice Stone Ilchman, the president of Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., and Elizabeth K. Stone of Newark; a son, Donald C. Jr., of Oakland, Calif.; a brother, Harold A., of Arlington, Va., and 10 grandchildren.
