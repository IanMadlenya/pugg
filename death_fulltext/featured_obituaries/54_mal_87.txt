        James Revson, a society columnist for Newsday, died yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 38 years old and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, L.I.
        Mr. Revson died of AIDS, a spokeswoman for Newsday said.
        In recent years, Mr. Revson, who had been on leave from Newsday since last fall, had been active in fund-raising events to benefit AIDS patients.
        He joined Newsday in 1984 as architecture and design writer, and in 1988 began writing the paper's society column, "Social Studies." That year he became celebrated himself after reporting that a lot of celebrities reported by Suzy, the gossip columnist of The New York Post, to have attended a gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art had not been there at all.
        Suzy later acknowledged her absence, but called Mr. Revson a "a jerk," turning the clash of columnists into a summer week's worth of national stories.
        Before joining Newsday, Mr. Revson had been arts and weekend editor of The Stamford Advocate and Greenwich Time and had been managing editor of The Bridgehampton Sun on Long Island.
        He was a graduate of Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio, and received a master's degree from the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University.
        Mr. Revson was the son of the late Joseph Revson, who was co-founder, with his brother Charles, of Revlon, the cosmetic company.
        He is survived by his mother, Elise, of Manhattan, and a brother and sister.
