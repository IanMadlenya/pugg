        M. Lawrence Noyer Jr., a former Federal prosecutor who headed the mail fraud case against Armand P. D'Amato, the brother of former Senator Alfonse D'Amato, died July 7 at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in the Bronx. Mr. Noyer, who lived in Larchmont, N.Y., was 40.
        The cause was a pulmonary embolism, his mother, Mary Noyer, said.
        Mr. Noyer was best known for his four-year-long investigation of Armand D'Amato, a Long Island lawyer and the younger brother of the Senator. Armand D'Amato was convicted in 1993 of mail fraud, but the conviction was later overturned on the ground of insufficient evidence. Senator D'Amato was never a defendant in the case, which nonetheless prompted a two-year Senate Ethics Committee investigation of allegations that he engaged in influence peddling.
        Mr. Noyer was born on Aug. 11, 1958, in Manhattan, a son of Maurice L. Noyer, a lawyer, and Mary Noyer, a real estate broker. A 1980 graduate of Georgetown University, Mr. Noyer was editor of the law review at Fordham Law School and a clerk for Joseph McLaughlin, then a judge for the Eastern District.
        In 1986, Mr. Noyer joined the United States Attorney's office for the Eastern District, where he spent eight years. In 1994, he returned to private practice, and eventually became general counsel of Barclays Bank P.L.C.
        Mr. Noyer is survived by his mother, Mary Noyer of Westhampton Beach, N.Y.; his wife, Pamela Davis; a son, Griffin; a daughter, Claire; his brother, Charles Noyer of Larchmont, and four sisters, Christine Seaver of Palo Alto, Calif., Elizabeth Feld of Plandome, N.Y., Mary Ann Noyer of Westport, Conn., and Nadine Rote of Larchmont.
