        George T. Douris, a New York public relations executive whose clients benefited from his prominence in the city's Greek-American community and the extensive contacts he cultivated during his years as a newspaper reporter covering City Hall, died on Friday at the Roosevelt Hospital Division of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 67 and lived in Manhattan.
        His family said the cause was prostate cancer.
        Whether he was covering city affairs for the old Long Island Star-Journal and The Long Island Press, or representing clients like the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade and the Chipwich ice cream sandwich company, Mr. Douris often wore two hats at the same time.
        As the only person at City Hall who spoke Greek during the administration of John V. Lindsay in the 1960's, he became a valuable link between the Mayor and his Greek constituents even as he was covering both for his newspapers.
        One of the results was the Hellenic American National Action Committee, now Hanac, Inc., which Mr. Douris established in 1972 to use government money to help the city's growing population of Greek immigrants.
        Her served as president of two major press organizations, the New York Reporters Association, now the New York Press Club, and the Inner Circle.
        Mr. Douris, who grew up in Astoria, Queens, came to journalism early, working as a sports assistant for The Star-Journal while in high school. After a fling as a radio and television commentator for the Roller Derby in 1949, Mr. Douris served with the Army in Korea, where he started a camp newspaper, then attended Long Island University and joined The Star-Journal full time in 1952.
        He remained in journalism until 1977, leaving only because his newspapers had folded.
        He is survived by his wife, Evangeline; a son, Tom, of Manhattan; a daughter, Litsa, of Bayside, Queens, and one grandson.
