        Alfred Matthew Lee, a professor of English and the humanities at New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, died on Saturday at his home in Maplewood, N.J. He was 56.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Professor Lee was born in Louisville, Ky., and graduated from Yale University in 1960. He became a professor at the institute 17 years ago.
        Professor Lee was the author of a book of poems, and the editor of an anthology of young poets.
        He is survived by his wife, Karen Tobias Lee, and a son, Alexander, of Maplewood.
