        Howard Merrill, a writer for radio and television who began his career as a child film actor and later produced a play on Broadway, died on April 20 at a hospital in Los Angeles, his family said. He was 85 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.
        Mr. Merrill, who was born in New York City, made it into ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for being in 58 silent movies before he was 11 years old and for making 487 radio broadcasts on 38 shows by the time he was 14. His mother, Fannie Merrill, an assistant to the character actress Gertrude Berg, got him started in acting at age 3.
        As a teenager he began to write a syndicated newspaper column called ''This Minute'' and contributed scripts to radio. He wrote for some of television's early programs, including CBS's documentary reenactment series ''You Are There'' and ''Newsweek Views the News.'' He also wrote for comedy shows, including ''I Love Lucy,'' ''The Odd Couple,'' ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' and ''Gilligan's Island.''
        With Allan Sherman, Mr. Merrill created the game show ''I've Got a Secret,'' which ran from 1952 to 1967.
        He also produced the Broadway musical ''Oh Captain!,'' a comedy based on the book ''The Captain's Paradise,'' about a man who kept wives in both Paris and London. The show starred Tony Randall and ran from February to July of 1958.
        Mr. Merrill is survived by his wife, Toni Gilbert, and a daughter, Adrienne Merrill, of Beverly Hills.
