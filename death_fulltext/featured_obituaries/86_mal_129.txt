        Tommy Benford, who played the drums for such early jazz stars as Jelly Roll Morton, Willie (The Lion) Smith, Fats Waller and Sidney Bechet, died on Thursday at Mount Vernon Hospital in Mount Vernon, N.Y. He was 88.
        Mr. Benford was born in Charleston, W.Va. He started playing in an orphanage band and in the early 1920's joined the Green River Minstrels with his brother, Bill, a tuba player and later a band leader. For the next 60 years, Mr. Benford undertook a jazz musician's odyssey. In the 1920's he worked with the band leader Elmer Snowden and the pianist Charlie Skeete, and he played on some of Jelly Roll Morton's more famous recordings, including "Kansas City Stomp" and "Shreveport." He helped Chick Webb learn to play, and along with Sid Catlett shaped early jazz drumming.
        For nine years, beginning in 1932, he worked in Europe, first with Sy Devereaux's band, then as part of the community of expatriate jazz musicians who worked with all the top players as they came through on tours. He performed and recorded with the violinist Eddie South, the guitarist Django Reinhardt, the saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the trumpeter Bil Coleman and the singer Joe Turner.
        When he returned to the United States in 1941, jazz had changed. But Mr. Benford continued working with band leaders associated with older styles, including Snub Mosley, Noble Sissle, Bob Wilber and Jimmy Archey. He toured Europe in a revue called the Jazz Train, directed by the saxophonist Eddie Barefield.
        For the last several decades of his life he worked with the Harlem Blues and Jazz Band, which toured Europe regularly, and with Bob Greene's World of Jelly Roll Morton.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, a son, Tom, and two daughters, Cynthia and Lisa.
