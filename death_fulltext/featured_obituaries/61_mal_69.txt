        John M. Burns, a former state legislator, advertising and broadcast executive and officer of several nonprofit agencies, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Burns, a liberal Republican, was the president of the New York Young Republicans Club in the late 1950's. He promoted the idea of a fusion candidate to defeat the Tammany Hall Democrats, which came to fruition with John V. Lindsay's election as mayor in 1965.
        From 1964 to 1968 Mr. Burns was an Assemblyman from the Upper East Side. He campaigned unsuccessfully to raise New York's legal age for drinking alcohol from 18 to 21, as in other states. His elective career ended when he lost a primary to Roy M. Goodman for a state Senate vacancy.
        Joining Group W Broadcasting, the broadcasting subsidiary of the Westinghouse Corporation, for 15 years, he became its vice president of urban affairs, was a member of the board of directors and served as director of editorials at WINS radio.
        He had been president and board chairman of the Third Church of Christ, Scientist in Manhattan, vice chairman of the Alcoholism Council and Fellowship Center of New York and a board member of the Fortune Society, Friendly Homes and the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.
        He was born in Grosse Point, Mich. After serving in the Army Air Force from 1943 to 1946, he earned his bachelor's degree from Syracuse University in 1950 and in 1951 graduated in its first class for a master's degree in radio and television. He moved to New York and worked in advertising at NBC and Young & Rubicam.
        Surviving is his sister, Janet Allen of Grosse Point.
