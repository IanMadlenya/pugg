        Patric Knowles, a patrician British actor who was a co-star of the 1936 film  "The Charge of the Light Brigade" and had roles in more than 80 other movies, died on Saturday at a hospital in suburban Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 84.
        He was born Reginald Lawrence Knowles in 1911 in Horsforth, England. He left  school to enter his father's publishing house and eventually joined the repertory group of the Playhouse Theater in Oxford.
        After touring with various companies he went to London and appeared in "By Appointment," where he was spotted by Irving Asher of Warner Brothers and signed as a contract player at the Warner studio in Teddington, outside London, for more than two years.
        In March 1936 he was brought to Hollywood to play Errol Flynn's brother and win the heart of Olivia de Havilland in "The Charge of the Light Brigade."
        He and Flynn were co-stars again in "The Adventures of Robin Hood." After appearing with George Brent in the film "Give Me Your Heart," Knowles became interested in flying, which led him to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Because of an eye ailment, he became a flying instructor.
        He returned to Hollywood and resumed his film career in the Oscar-winning "How Green Was My Valley" (1941), directed by John Ford. After signing a contract with Universal, he appeared in several films and then joined the Army Air Forces as a civilian instructor.
        He appeared in "Of Human Bondage" (a 1946 remake with Eleanor Parker) and went on to play romantic leads in films including "The Bride Wore Boots" (1946)  with Barbara Stanwyck, "Ivy" (1947) with Joan Fontaine and "Isn't It Romantic?"  (1948) with Veronica Lake.
        He is survived by his wife, Enid, whom he met when both appeared at the Playhouse Theater in Oxford, England; a son, Michael; a daughter, Antonia Vaughn; four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
