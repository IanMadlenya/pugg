        Christopher Wells Hobler, an aspiring musician who founded the fund-raising organization Hope Happens for Neurological Disorders in 2001 when he learned he had Lou's Gehrig's disease, died of the illness on Feb. 16 in St. Louis, his hometown. He was 39.
        His death was announced on the Hope Happens Web site by Mike Schroeder, executive director of the organization.
        Mr. Hobler was a member of a prominent Missouri family and the third member of it to be stricken with the disease, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
        Told in mid-2001 that he had A.L.S. and that there was no hope for him, he founded A.L.S. Hope- The Chris Hobler/James Maritz Foundation, later changed to Hope Happens, to fight for better ways to raise money and conduct research on A.L.S. and related disorders. The organization has raised nearly $3 million and worked with other groups concerned with neurological disorders.
        Mr. Hobler helped establish the Hope Center of Neurological Disorders, which became a part of the Department of Neurology at Washington University in St. Louis last October. Others on the list of beneficiaries included the A.L.S. Therapy Development Foundation in Boston and its associated A.L.S. Hope Drug Development Center.
        Christopher Hobler grew up in St. Louis. He graduated from Bates College in Lewiston, Me., and settled in Milton Mills, N.H., to pursue a career in music.
        He led a rock band, Sonic Joyride, with which he toured nationally and recorded albums on the Anomaly label. The band was popularized on college radio stations in the mid-1990's.
        Mr. Hobler is survived by his wife of seven years, Jennifer Taylor Hobler; two sons, Aidan and Trevor; a daughter, Ella; his mother, Jean Maritz Hobler; and two sisters, Leigh H. Gerard and Linnard Hobler, all of St. Louis; and two brothers, Peter W. of Jackson, Wyo., and Edward A., of Portland, Me.
