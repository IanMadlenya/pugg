        Robert L. Edgell, retired chairman of Edgell Communications Inc., a publisher of business magazines and a producer of trade shows, died Tuesday in a fall from the balcony of his seventh-floor condominium in Longboat Key, Fla. He was 68 years old.
        Chief Wayne McCammon of the Longboat Key police said several witnesses had seen Mr. Edgell straddling the railing of the balcony of his condominium before he fell. The police chief said he had been told that Mr. Edgell had been experiencing business problems.
        Mr. Edgell spent his career in business publishing and related enterprises. Edgell Communications was formed in 1987, when he engineered a $334-million leveraged buyout of HBJ Publications, a business magazine publisher, from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. He retired from Edgell last April but continued to serve as a consultant.
        The business had its roots in Ojibway Press of Duluth, Minn., which Mr. Edgell co-founded in 1960. In 1968 the company was bought by Harcourt's predecessor, Harcourt Brace & World. Mr. Edgell left Ojibway when it was acquired but returned in 1970, and within a decade he expanded the business, renamed HBJ Publications, from 16 to 100 journals.
        In 1985 he became vice chairman of Harcourt and served in that capacity until the buyout in 1987. The buyout was the largest sale of business publications up to that time.
        Mr. Edgell served two terms as chairman of the American Business Press, a trade group, and was a director of the Advertising Council.
        He was born in Port Huron, Mich., and was a graduate of Michigan State University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Yvonne de Clairmont Richardson; four daughters, Robin Davis of South Hamilton, Mass., Sara Edgell of Manhattan, Debbie Oberg of Denver and Jane Edgell of Manhattan; a son, Douglas, of Brookside, N.J., and nine grandchildren.
