        Michael B. Ross, a retired textile executive, died on Thursday at his home in Tamarac, Fla. A former resident of Hewlett Bay Park, L.I., he was 83.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Ross used the works of artists like Picasso and Miro in fabric design. He brought together new fabric and new ideas and was known in the industry as the man who first put unusual designs on boxer shorts, starting with a heart-shaped print for Valentine's Day sales.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Ross began his career as a 13-year-old receiving clerk at Macy's in Herald Square. By the time he was 24, he was a chief buyer for Macy's textile department.
        Mr. Ross later joined Cohn, Hall, Marx as head of the print-goods department, working with a variety of new fabrics. Then he started his own business, which eventually merged with Fuller Fabrics.
        His first wife, the former Ruth Berlin, died in 1983.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence Molomut Ross; a son, Steven T., of Newport, R.I., and a grandson.
