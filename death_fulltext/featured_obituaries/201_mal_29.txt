        Carl Fontana, a jazz trombonist whose effortless-sounding virtuosity became widely known through his tenure with the Woody Herman and Stan Kenton bands, died on Thursday in Las Vegas, where he lived. He was 75.
        He had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Fontana was born in Monroe, La. As a teenager, he played in the jazz band led by his father, Collie Fontana. After graduating from Louisiana State University, he was hired by Herman for his Third Herd band; at the time, the trombone section included the brothers Urbie and Jack Green. Mr. Fontana then joined bands led by Lionel Hampton and Hal McIntyre.
        In 1955 he was hired by Kenton, with whom he recorded 11 albums; his plangent playing on ''Fuego Cubano,'' from ''Cuban Fire!'' (1956), is some of his best-known. Mr. Fontana also played in Kai Winding's four-trombone band in 1956 and 1957.
        In 1966 he joined Woody Herman again for a State Department tour. In the late 1970's he toured Japan with the bandleader Georgie Auld, and worked with Supersax and the World's Greatest Jazz Band.
        Mr. Fontana invented a technique he called ''doodle-tonguing,'' in which a trombonist creates legato by mouthing ''doodle doodle'' in the mouthpiece. He developed it, he once said, ''in self-defense against tenor saxophone players.''
        ''They were playing breakneck tempos,'' he said, ''and I came to the conclusion that if I didn't learn to play fast, I would not be able to keep up with the times. So I started practicing a fast way of articulating.''
        Mr. Fontana is survived by a daughter, Felicia Valenty, and two sons, Mark and Scott, all of Las Vegas; two brothers, George and Michael, of Monroe, La.; and eight grandchildren.
