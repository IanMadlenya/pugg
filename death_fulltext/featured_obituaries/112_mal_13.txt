        Donald Cammell, a screenwriter and director who was best known for his 1970 film, "Performance," which starred Mick Jagger, died on April 24 after shooting  himself at his home in Hollywood. He was 62.
        Mr. Cammell was born in Edinburgh and attended Westminster School in London,  which he left at 16 to study at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. After graduating from the Royal Academy School of Art, he led a bohemian life in Chelsea, painting portraits and presiding over a glamorous salon.
        In 1961 he moved to Paris to paint, but was drawn to film. His first screenplay, "Duffy," was produced in England in 1968, starring James Fox, James  Coburn, James Mason and Susannah York.
        By bringing his friend Mick Jagger into his next project, he was able to persuade Warner Brothers to let him direct. "Performance" had Mr. Jagger in the  role of a reclusive fallen rock idol who becomes involved with a violent gangster, played by Mr. Fox. As few other films have, "Performance" captured the spirit of the 1960's counterculture. Nicholas Roeg, the cinematographer, shared  directing credit.
        After "Performance," Mr. Cammell lived mainly in Los Angeles, writing screenplays, doctoring scripts, directing music videos, developing various projects and repeatedly turning down offers to direct mainstream films. He wrote two screenplays for Marlon Brando that were never made. Through Mr. Brando he met China Kong, who became his wife and collaborator.
        Mr. Cammell also directed "Demon Seed" (1977), with Julie Christie in the role of a woman impregnated by a computer, and "White of the Eye" (1988), about  a woman who unknowingly lives with a serial killer. His last film, "The Wild Ride," with Christopher Walken and Joan Chen, was completed last year but has not been released.
        He is survived by his wife and a son from his first marriage, to a Greek actress, Maria Andipa.
