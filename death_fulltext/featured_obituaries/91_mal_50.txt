        Walter W. Braznell, a commercial airline pilot who started flying open cockpit biplanes in 1927 and retired as the commander of a fleet of jetliners 40 years later, died on Thursday at his retirement home in Longboat Key, Fla. Mr. Braznell, a longtime resident of Manhasset, L.I., was 86.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter Carole Carlin.
        Mr. Braznell learned to fly in the Missouri National Guard, soloing at the age of 18. He began his career in commercial aviation as an airmail pilot with Robertson Aviation, flying between St. Louis and Chicago. Robertson was one of the regional carriers that merged into what became American Airlines.
        While with American, Mr. Braznell served as chief pilot, director of flight and vice president for flight. He also played a pioneering role in leading the company into computerized navigation, instrument landings and improved flight-safety standards.
        Mr. Braznell was a founding member of the Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots' union. He retired to Florida in 1967.
        Mr. Braznell's wife of 64 years, Celeste Braznell, died on Aug. 4. He is survived by two daughters, Beverly Hartley of Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Carlin of Plano, Tex.; a son, William Braznell of San Francisco, and a brother, John of St. Louis.
