        The Rev. Joseph Donceel, a scholar of psychology, philosophy and theology at Fordham University, died on Dec. 15 at the Jesuit infirmary on the university's Rose Hill campus. He was 88.
        He suffered a long illness, Fordham said.
        Father Donceel, a native of Belgium, joined the faculty in 1944. For nearly three decades he taught both rational and experimental psychology at Fordham College, Fordham's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Social Service. He was named professor emeritus of philosophy in 1972.
        But he remained active into the 1990's, continuing to write, translate theological books from French and German, and teach philosophy to Jesuit scholastics.
        From 1983 to 1990, he also continued pastoral work, helping out in different parishes.
        Father Donceel was born in Antwerp and entered the Jesuit order in 1924. He was ordained to the priesthood at Louvain, Belgium, in 1938.  He began his teaching career at Loyola College in Baltimore.
        His work made Fordham a principal source from which the thought of European philosophers and theologians like Karl Rahner, Joseph Marechal and Pierre Rousselot spread to North America. His translations included an early Rahner work, "Hearers of the Word."
