        Andrew Schenck, the music director of two New York ensembles, the Nassau Symphony Orchestra and the Atlantic Sinfonietta, died on Wednesday at his home in Baltimore. He was 51 years old.
        He died of melanoma, said Marvin Schofer, his former manager.
        Mr. Schenck was best known for his performances and recordings of American music, particularly the works of Samuel Barber. With the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, he recorded several obscure works by Barber in recent years, including "The Lovers," an orchestral song cycle, and the Second Symphony. His recordings also include works by Randall Thompson, Paul Hindemith, Kurt Weill and Aaron Copland.
        He was born on Jan. 7, 1941, in Honolulu. He studied at Harvard, and privately with Pierre Monteux and Leonard Bernstein, and he took his Master of Music degree at Indiana State University.
        In 1988, he became music director of the Nassau Symphony Orchestra, which performs at Hofstra University. He became music director of the Manhattan-based Atlantic Sinfonietta in 1989. He was also the founding music director of the Baltimore Chamber Opera Theater and an associate conductor of the Baltimore and Honolulu Symphony Orchestras.
        He is survived by his wife, Lois, and two sons, Timothy and Matthew, all of Baltimore, and a sister, Miriam Elia of Jerusalem.
