        I. A. Lewis, who in the late 1960's was one of the first poll takers to predict election results by surveying voters leaving polling places, died Aug. 18 at the Glendale Adventist Medical Center in California. He was 68 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        Mr. Lewis, director of The Los Angeles Times Poll since 1979, died of liposarcoma, a rare form of cancer, the newspaper said.
        In 1966 Mr. Lewis took charge of polling for NBC News and three years later he was made manager of election analysis. He used the exit poll, as it came to be known, to produce Election Day forecasts far more accurate than were possible with any previous sampling method.
        Criticism of Polls
        The polls are now widely used and have attracted some criticism, particularly in national elections. Critics say voters in Western states are encouraged to stay home when they learn that an election has been decided by projections of results in Eastern time zones.
        Before joining NBC as a writer for the original ''Today'' show with Dave Garroway, Mr. Lewis was with United Press International and with the Armed Forces Radio Network in West Germany.
        Mr. Lewis, whose given names were Irwin Albert and who was known as Bud, left NBC in 1976 to join The New York Times/CBS News Poll. The following year he joined the Roper Organization, where he remained until he went to The Los Angeles Times in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alison Cummings; four daughters, Tracy, of Chino, Calif., and Alison, Catherine and Jennifer, all of Los Angeles, and a sister, Jean Newson of Rochester, N.Y.
