        Barry Sadler, a former combat medic with the United States Special Forces in Vietnam who recorded ''The Ballad of the Green Berets,'' died today. He was 49 years old.
        Mr. Sadler, who suffered brain damage and was partly paralyzed in a shooting in Guatemala in 1988, died at the Alvin C. York Medical Center, a hospital spokesman, Albert Archie, said. The cause of death was not given. Mr. Archie said an autopsy would be performed.
        Mr. Sadler had been hospitalized since he was critically wounded in what a companion said was a robbery. The companion said at the time that Mr. Sadler had been training Nicaraguan rebels in Guatemala and had received death threats.
        Using his military title of staff sergeant, Mr. Sadler, co-wrote and recorded ''The Ballad of the Green Berets,'' a narrative tribute to the Special Forces. The song No. 1 in the country for five weeks in 1966 and sold nine million singles and albums.
        He recorded other similar songs and wrote more than 20 adventure books featuring a mercenary.
        Survivors include his wife, Lavona; two sons, Thor and Baron, and a daughter, Brooke.
