        Mr. Wohlworth built more than 2,000 houses on Long Island in the early 50's, along with apartments, centers for the elderly and commercial buildings in the metropolitan region. His scatter-site housing development in Greenburgh, N.Y., won an award from the American Institute of Architects.

Mr. Wohlworth was a past president of the Long Island Builders Institute and a member of the energy committee of the architects' institute.
