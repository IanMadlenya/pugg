        Bob Shepard, a radio and television announcer of a generation ago, died on Dec. 17 on a visit to Manhattan. He was 76 and had homes in Boca Raton, Fla., and Wilmington, Vt.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter, Carolee Shepard.
        After graduating from the City College of New York, Mr. Shepard became a staff announcer for WOR in 1941 and over the next two decades was the announcer, master of ceremonies or commercial voice of hundreds of programs.
        He was the announcer for the NBC radio show "Mr. District Attorney" in the 1940's, and in the early days of television worked on the "I Love Lucy" show, "The Jackie Gleason Show" and "The Ed Sullivan Show," among others.
        He stopped announcing in the 1960's and opened an antiques store in Bronxville, N.Y. He later became an appraiser of antiques and jewelry, maintaining offices in Boca Raton and Wilmington.
        Mr. Shepard is survived by his wife, Suzanne; a son, Jonathan, of Boca Raton; his daughter, of Manhattan, and a brother, Dick, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J.
