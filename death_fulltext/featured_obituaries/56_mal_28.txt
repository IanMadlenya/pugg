        Dr. Earle W. Brauer, the senior vice president for medical affairs at Revlon Inc., died Thursday at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 72 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, company officials said.
        Dr. Brauer, who received his medical degree from New York University in 1943, was a dermatologist in private practice when Charles Revson hired him in 1962. He conducted research for the cosmetics company and was responsible for the safety of its brands.
        He remained with N.Y.U. Medical School as an associate professor in clinical dermatology and an attending physician at the skin and cancer unit of N.Y.U. Medical Center.
        Dr. Brauer is survived by his wife of 41 years, the former Regina Berke; two daughters, Lisa Brauer of Marblehead, Mass., and Amy Brauer-Hoyt of Concord, Mass.; a son, Henry G., also of Marblehead, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Paul H. of New York City, and five grandchildren.
