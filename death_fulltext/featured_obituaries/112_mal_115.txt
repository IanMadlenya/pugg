        Howard Chapnick, who headed Black Star, a leading worldwide picture agency based in Manhattan, from 1964 until his retirement six years ago, died on Monday at his home in Somers, N.Y. He was 74.
        The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, his family said.
        Mr. Chapnick, a native of Manhattan, joined the agency in 1940 after graduating from New York University. Black Star Publishing Company had been founded five years earlier and, with a stable of legendary photojournalists, contributed photographs to Life, Look, Collier's and other magazines.
        Mr. Chapnick saw wartime duty in the Air Force and returned to Black Star in 1946. As his responsibilities rose, he began to widen the agency's focus toward  photo essays and books and maintaining a network of photographers on call to cover the globe.
        In 1964, he bought out the founders and became the agency's president. In 1994, he published "The Truth Needs No Ally: Inside Photojournalism" (University of Missouri, 1994), summing up a life's worth of experience and giving practical guidance to novices.
        He also taught at annual workshops at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.
        He was a principal founder of the W. Eugene Smith competition and Memorial Fund, which awards grants for projects in humanistic photography.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Jeannette Ebenstein Chapnick; two daughters, Ilene Todd of Williamsville, Vt., and Denise Ploetz of Newark, Ohio,  and two grandchildren.
