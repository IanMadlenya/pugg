        Dr. Richard Wilson Page, a dental surgeon and inventor who developed the first high-speed dental drill, died of bone cancer last Tuesday at Columbia Memorial Hospital in Hudson, N.Y. He was 76 years old and lived in Churchtown, N.Y.
        Dr. Page, a 1933 alumnus of the New York University dental school, practiced in Chappaqua, N.Y., for more than 30 years. He sold his practice in 1967, but continued to work as a technical consultant for the Chayes Dental Instrument Company.
        As a pacticing dentist, Dr. Page added innovations that eased patients' pain and made the practitioner more comfortable, too. He introduced his high-speed drill in his practice in the 50's.
        Operating at four speeds, the drill rotated five to 40 times faster than conventional drills. Known as the Page-Chayes handpiece, it came to be used by thousands of dentists across the country within a few years.
        Dr. Page also developed an air-and-water sprayer for his drill to cool, flush and dry the tooth being treated, so the dentist could clearly observe the surface. Another invention was a hydraulic chair he built and rebuilt over the years. It featured a revolving platform that allowed the dentist to sit while working.
        Surviving are his wife, Helen Ostrander Page; two sons, Peter, of Upton, Mass., and Stephen, of Great Barrington, Mass.; three daughters, Denise Matarese of Copake, N.Y., Diane P. Moore of Charleston, W. Va., and Dawn P. Zadeh of Manhattan; a sister, Virginia Quinby of Copake; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
