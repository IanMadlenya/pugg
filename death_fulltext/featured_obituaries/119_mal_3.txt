        John O. Williams, a jazz saxophonist and composer, died on Nov. 24at the Westminster Thurber Community nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. He was 91.
        Mr. Williams first drew notice as the lead alto and baritone saxophonist with the Andy Kirk band, the Clouds of Joy, a popular band of the 1920's and 30's, and he wrote many of the pieces the band recorded. His first wife, the pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams, was also a band member. Mr. Williams left the Kirk band in 1939 and began playing saxophone with Cootie Williams (no relation) in 1942. He is best remembered for his 1930 composition ''Froggy Bottom,'' part of the score for the Robert Altman film ''Kansas City.''
        He is survived by a stepson, Robert Duncan of Columbus.
