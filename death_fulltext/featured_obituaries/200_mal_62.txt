        Ralph M. Rourke, director of what many from the Bronx proclaim to be the original and greatest Hall of Fame, died on Aug. 28 at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, according to Bronx Community College, where the hall is located. He was 80.
        The Hall of Fame for Great Americans, on West 181st Street in University Heights, was designed by Stanford White and opened in 1901 on what was then a campus of New York University.
        The neo-Classical colonnade has 98 larger than life busts of great -- or once-great -- Americans, ranging from Washington and Lincoln to the actress Charlotte Cushman and the legal scholar James Kent.
        Mr. Rourke was a constant promoter of the hall, proclaiming the motivational benefits of a pantheon of Americans who rose to fame, and he often gave tours to schoolchildren.
        Ralph Martin Rourke was born in New Haven, Conn., and graduated from Fordham University. For 30 years he worked for N.Y.U., retiring from the school's public affairs office in 1986. In that office, he was sometimes called upon to answer questions about the hall, which was on N.Y.U. property until 1973, when the campus was sold to Bronx Community College.
        In 1987, the community college invited him to become director of the hall.
        He is survived by his companion, Mary Ellen Lyons, of Manhattan; a son, Michael, of Long Island; and two grandchildren.
