        John Barkham, a prolific book reviewer who could deliver a stream of four, five or six reviews a week in his heyday, died on April 15 at a nursing home in Sarasota, Fla. He was 90.
        Mr. Barkham reviewed thousands of books over half a century. He concentrated on contemporary history and books about Africa, particularly about his native South Africa.
        His reviews appeared frequently in The New York Times Book Review, The New York World-Telegram, The New York Post and in syndication across the country. He also published interviews with writers.
        He typically chose a book to review at about 3 in the afternoon and sat back in an Eames leather chair with a footrest in his book-lined library. Taking notes, he would finish reading that night or the next morning. Then he wrote the review in longhand at his desk, rewrote it on his typewriter and sent it off.
        He grew up on an ostrich farm in Cape Province, South Africa. Time magazine hired him as a stringer at the start of World War II, made him Cairo bureau chief and brought him to New York as a writer of foreign news.
        He started his second career in 1950 at The Saturday Review. As a book reviewer he fostered a generation of South African writers and counted Alan Paton and Nadine Gordimer among his friends.
        He was a Pulitzer Prize juror for 20 years, heading juries for fiction, nonfiction and biography.
        He was also governor of the Overseas Press Club and at his death was a trustee of the Carnegie Fund for Authors.
        Mr. Barkham is survived by his wife, Margot Buirski Barkham; a son, Graham, of Larchmont, N.Y.; a daughter, Jennifer Weininger, of Worcester, Mass.; and four grandchildren.
