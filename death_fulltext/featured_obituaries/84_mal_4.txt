        Martin Rubenstein, a former business executive of three major broadcasting networks, died on Friday at his home in Washington. He was 58.
        The cause was heart disease, said his daughter, Deborah Rubenstein.
        For nine years, starting in 1969, Mr. Rubenstein was vice president and general manager of ABC News. Previously, beginning in 1961, he was a lawyer for the network and its director of legal and business affairs.
        In 1978 Mr. Rubenstein became executive vice president of the Mutual Broadcasting System, the operator of the Mutual radio network, and the next year he was named Mutual's president and chief executive officer. He remained with Mutual until 1984, and in 1986 he served as president and chief executive officer of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
        After that period, he was an international communications consultant based in Washington. Mr. Rubenstein was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Brooklyn College and the Columbia University Law School.
        Mr. Rubenstein is survived by his wife, Cora, and his daughter, both of Washington, and one son, William of Los Angeles.
