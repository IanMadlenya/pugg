        Stanley Cohen, a graphic artist who created Moppet greeting cards, T-shirts and other merchandise, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 66 and lived in Mount Kisco, N.Y.
        The cause of death was lymphoma, his family said.
        In the late 1950's, when greeting cards were largely limited to hearts and flowers, or cartoon characters spouting caustic humor, Mr. Cohen found a niche -- cards featuring cartoon children delivering lines that were sometimes funny and always sweet.
        "Life is wonderful when you can hold someone you love," read one, depicting two of Mr. Cohen's Moppets doing just that.
        The cards, which Mr. Cohen drew and composed, became so successful that the Moppet company became the first to license greeting-card characters for use on T-shirts, dishes, posters and other products, his wife, Marilyn Cohen, said yesterday.
        After years of commercial coexistence with Jim Henson's Muppets, the Moppet name was sold to Disney, which also owns the Muppet rights.
        Among other things, Mr. Cohen invented a board game, Chutzpah, an early takeoff on Monopoly featuring schlemiel cards and other Yiddishisms, and a line of check-list stationery for children too busy to write full reports home from camp.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Cohen graduated from New York University with a degree in fine arts. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Paul, of North Salem, N.Y., and a daughter, Julie, of Manhattan.
        Correction:  May 11, 1995, Thursday
        An obituary on May 3 about Stanley Cohen, who created Moppet greeting cards and other merchandise, misstated the ownership of the rights to an unrelated name, the Muppets. The Muppet rights are owned by Jim Henson Productions, not by the Walt Disney Company.
