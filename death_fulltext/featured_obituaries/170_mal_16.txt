        Ken Kiff, an English painter known for his bright, fantastical figurative painting, died on Feb. 15 in London. He was 65.
        Mr. Kiff was born in Essex, England, in 1935 and attended the Hornsey School of Art in northern London. He had his first gallery show at the Nicola Jacobs Gallery in London in 1980. By then he had evolved a style in which elves, gnomes and other mythological creatures cavorted in vague landscapes that seemed made, foremost, of radiantly colored, loosely applied paint.
        His work was first seen in New York in 1981 in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, and it seemed in step with the current tendency of Neo-Expressionist painting. His style reflected an admiration for  Dubuffet but was also profoundly English, combining the robust brushwork of School of London painters like Frank Auerbach with playful  narratives that seemed descended from the Victorian Fairy painters.
        Mr. Kiff exhibited at the Edward Thorp Gallery in Manhattan in the 1980's and was represented in London by the Marlborough Gallery. He had a retrospective at the Serpentine Gallery in 1986 and was elected to the Royal Academy in 1991. He taught at the Royal College of Art and the Chelsea School of Art.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane, and a son and a daughter.
