        Morton Stevens, a composer of television music including the theme for "Hawaii Five-0," died on Monday at his home in Encino, Calif. He was 62 years old.
        He died of pancreatic cancer, said a spokeswoman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, of which he was a longtime member.
        Mr. Stevens received two Emmy Awards for "Hawaii Five-0" and seven other nominations for his work on series including "Gunsmoke" and "Police Woman."
        Born in Newark, Mr. Stevens studied composition at the Juilliard School. He became the arranger and later the musical director for such stars as Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Liza Minnelli. He was a music director for CBS and served on the board of governors of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
        He is survived by his wife, Annie, and daughter, Lisa, both of Encino, and his son, Mark, of Moorpark, Calif.
