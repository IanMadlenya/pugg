        Morton Brautman, the founding president of Hemisphere Forwarding Inc., international shipping agents, died on Tuesday. He was 64 years old and lived in West Nyack, N.Y.
        He suffered a heart attack after taking ill in the company's offices near Kennedy International Airport, a company spokesman said.
        Mr. Brautman spent 43 years in the sea- and air-freight business and started Hemisphere Forwarding in 1983 to succeed a company he had set up in 1966 and then sold.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith; two sons, Joseph, of Niagara Falls, N.Y., and Daniel, of West Nyack; two daughters, Nancy DeMarco of Houston and Deborah Brechbiel of Haverstraw, N.Y., and eight grandchildren.
