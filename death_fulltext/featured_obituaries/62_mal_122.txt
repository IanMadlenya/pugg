        Sheldon Wasserman, a wine writer and internationally recognized authority on Italian wines, died on Tuesday at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Lyons, N.J. He was 51 years old and lived in Piscataway, N.J.
        He died of cancer, said his former wife, Pauline.
        The second edition of "Italy's Noble Red Wines," a 762-page book that he and Mrs. Wasserman spent 18 years preparing, was published by Macmillan last month. He also wrote "The Wines of Italy." Together they wrote "White Wines of the World," "Sparkling Wine," "The Wines of the Cotes du Rhone" and "Guide to Fortified Wines."
        Mr. Wasserman, a contributor to many publications and member of the Wine Writers Circle in New York, was wine consultant at Mondrian, the Manhattan restaurant.
        He is survived by two brothers, Joseph of Columbia, Md., Louis of Hollywood, Fla., and a sister, Gerri Wasserman of Hoboken, N.J.
