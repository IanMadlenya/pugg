        Richard P. Selchow, former president and chairman of the Selchow & Righter Company, the Long Island game manufacturer that distributed Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit before it was acquired by Coleco, died Wednesday at Danbury (Conn.) Hospital. He was 67 years old and lived in West Bay Shore, L.I., and Brookfield, Conn.
        Mr. Selchow was a grandson of the founder of the company, the oldest privately held manufacturer of games and puzzles in the country. Founded in 1867, it was originally a box company that acquired the rights to its first game, Parcheesi, in lieu of a debt payment.
        In 1983, Mr. Selchow negotiated the license agreement for the American distribution of Trivial Pursuit. It was an immediate success, and the company's sales rose, from $20 million to $345 million, by 1984. After the sale to Coleco in 1986, Mr. Selchow retired.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Mary Elizabeth Rixford; a daughter, Mary Alice Proudfoot of Brookfield; a sister, Catherine Weeks of Pompano Beach, Fla.; a brother, Roger, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
