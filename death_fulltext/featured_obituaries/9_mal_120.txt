        Pal Gabor, a Hungarian film director whose best-known film, ''Angi Vera,'' was released in 1979, died Wednesday of a heart attack, in Rome. He was 54 years old.
        Mr. Gabor, who lived in Budapest, made several gently satirical movies about the concerns of youth and workers. He was born in Budapest in 1932 and studied at the University of Budapest and at an art school before joining the Mafilm studios and co-founding the Bela Balazs film studio.
        His feature films in the 1960's and 70's included ''Forbidden Ground,'' ''Visit'' and ''Horizon,'' although ''Angi Vera'' was his first work to achieve renown outside Hungary. The film, about a nurse in a political re-education camp in postwar Hungary, was hailed for its delicate depiction of a young woman's political and sexual coming of age.
        He also directed ''Brady's Escape,'' a 1984 Hungarian-American co-production about an American flier shot down over Hungary during World War II, and ''The Bride Was Beautiful,'' an Italian-Hungarian collaboration that was filmed in Sicily last year. Mr. Gabor was in Rome to take part in a forum on Hungarian films.
