        Hans Weigel, a leading literary figure in Austria and a critic of anti-Semitism, died today at his home here. He was 83 years old.
        He died of heart disease, Austrian state television reported.
        Mr. Weigel, a prolific novelist, playwright, essayist, translator and theater critic, was born in Vienna in 1908, when the city was still the hub of the Hapsburg Empire.
        He began writing for a Berlin literary magazine and for Vienna's satirical cellar theaters between the world wars.
        Forced to go to Austria after it was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, Mr. Weigel then lived in exile until 1946 in Zurich, where he produced many of his best-known works, including a play, "Barrabas." In one story, "Der Grune Stern" ("The Green Star"), Mr. Weigel painted a grotesque parody of Hitler's Nazi rule. Among his later works was "One Can't Talk About It Quietly," a study of anti-Semitism.
