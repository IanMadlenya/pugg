        Claudio Teehankee, the representative of the Philippines at the United Nations and former Chief Justice of the nation's Supreme Court, died of cancer on Monday in Manhattan. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Teehankee gave the oath of office to President Corazon C. Aquino in 1986. As Chief Justice, his rulings frequently contradicted those of President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
        Born in Manila, he practiced law for 25 years until he was appointed Under Secretary of Justice in 1966. In 1968, he was appointed to the Supreme Court and in 1979 he became Senior Justice. Mrs. Aquino called him back from retirement to serve at the United Nations in 1988. He received many honors, including a resolution of the Philippine Senate that commended his service in ''helping restore'' civil liberties.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Pilar Javier; 9 children and 20 grandchildren.
