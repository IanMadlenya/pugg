        Prof. George H. Forsyth Jr., an architectural historian who directed archeological expeditions in France, Turkey and Egypt, died Saturday at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. He was 89 years old and lived in Ann Arbor and Chatham, Mass.
        He died of an embolism, his family said.
        Professor Forsyth was chairman of the art history department at Michigan from 1947 to 1961, when he became director of the university's Kelsey Museum of Archeology. In 1969 he returned to teaching as research professor of archeology. He retired in 1972.
        He was a graduate of Princeton University, from which he also received a master of fine arts degree. He taught at Princeton from 1927 to 1942 and served three years as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II.
        Beginning in the 1920's, Professor Forsyth conducted extensive archeological studies abroad. From 1930 to 1936 he led groups that discovered rare religious relics in the ruins of the Church of St. Martin at Angers, France, built in the ninth century by a son of Charlemagne.
        Later he excavated the monastery of St. Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai. St. Catherine's, dating to the sixth century, is the oldest existing Greek Orthodox monastery in the world. In 1955 Professor Forsyth was awarded the Haskins Medal for outstanding distinction in medieval studies.
        He is survived by his wife, Ilene H. Forsyth, professor of the history of art at the University of Michigan, whom he married in 1960; two daughters and a son: Blaikie Worth of Manhattan and Hope Platt of Bethesda, Md., and George A. Forsyth of Manhattan; a half-sister, Mary Jane Forsyth of Evanston, Ill., and eight grandchildren.
