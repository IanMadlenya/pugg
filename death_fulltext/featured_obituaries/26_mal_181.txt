        Walter E. Klotzback, retired assistant chief inspector of the New York City Police Department, died of pneumonia Wednesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 88 years old and lived in Fort Lauderdale.
        Inspector Klotzback was a member of the police force for 39 years. For most of that time he was commander of the Police Emergency Service Division, which deals with such misfortunes as a child's foot caught in a turnstile, a car driven into a river, an elevator stuck between floors, a train wreck, someone threatening to jump from a bridge or a cat up a tree.
        Big (6 feet tall) and burly (220 pounds) in his prime, he was known as ''Mr. Emergency'' and his files were filled with letters of gratitude. He retired in 1963.
        His formal education ended at 14 when he left school for work as a pipe fitter. At age 24 he joined the police force and two years later, in 1926, he was picked to help staff the newly organized Emergency Service Squad.
        Asked once in an interview if there were such a thing as a routine emergency, he reponded with a hearty ''Yes - ring jobs.''
        ''Since the E.S.D. came into being we've cut an average of four rings a week off people's fingers,'' he said. ''We've cut off thousands and haven't lost or hurt a patient yet.''
        A widower, Inspector Klotzback is survived by four grandchildren.
