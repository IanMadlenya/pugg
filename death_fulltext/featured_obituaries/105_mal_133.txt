        David Healy, an American actor who won acclaim in London for his performance  in a 1980's revival of the musical "Guys and Dolls," died on Wednesday here. He  was 64.
        He had undergone several heart operations in recent years, said his agent, Meg Poole.
        As Nicely-Nicely Johnson, the zestful and portly sidekick to the gambler Nathan Detroit, Mr. Healy led the "Guys and Dolls" ensemble in one of the show's most rousing numbers, "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat." He won the London equivalent of the Tony Award in 1982 when the production opened at the Royal National Theater. In 1985, "Guys and Dolls" moved to the West End here for a nine-month commercial run.
        Mr. Healy also starred with Jerry Hall in "Bus Stop," and in 1987 he appeared with Diana Rigg in Stephen Sondheim's "Follies," about two middle-aged couples whose marriages have gone sour.
        His last appearance in the West End was in Arthur Miller's play "The Last Yankee" in 1993. He performed last in New York City at the Roundabout Theater in 1992 in a revival of two one-act plays by Tom Stoppard, "The Real Inspector Hound," in which he played a critic named Birdboot, and "The 15-Minute Hamlet."
        His film appearances included "Stardust," "Patton" and several James Bond movies. On television, he had roles in "Dallas," "Vegas," "Harry O" and "Charlie's Angels."
