        Mr. Morris was the president of the agency, which his father founded in 1898, until 1952. He was a director until 1969, by which time major talent agencies had become highly influential in the film and television industries. The William Morris Agency, which is now among the world's largest talent agencies, was the first to represent performers and writers.
        He had no survivors.
