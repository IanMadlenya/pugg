        William A. Condron Jr., who for more than 40 years owned and operated Billy's, an East Side restaurant founded by his grandfather 122 years ago, died on March 4 at his home in Manhattan.
        He was 81 years old. He died of natural causes, his family said.
        Billy's calls itself the oldest continuously operated family-owned restaurant in New York City. Bryan Miller, the restaurant critic for The New York Times, described Billy's as "one of the oldest and most enduring" of the city's "neighborhood haunts."
        Michael Condron founded the restaurant in 1879 as Mickey's on First Avenue near 56th Street. In 1880 it moved to the southeast corner of 56th Street. In 1966 it moved three blocks south to its current location at 948 First Avenue, near 53d Street. The restaurant's name also changed to reflect Mr. Condron's father, William Sr.
        Many of Billy's employees and patrons date their association with the restaurant in decades rather than years.
        Mr. Condron was born in Manhattan. He started working in Billy's at the age of 12. He eventually took it over in 1944 and did not retire until about four years ago.
        Surviving are his wife of 54 years, the former Mildred Pratt; a daughter, Joan Marie Condron Borkowski, who now runs Billy's, and one granddaughter.
