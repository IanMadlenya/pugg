        Jeffrey K. Feldman, an executive with an investment firm who was one of Connecticut's leading bridge players, died on Wednesday in Greenwich Hospital.
        He was 32 and lived in Norwalk.
        The cause was cancer, a family member said.
        Mr. Feldman had risen to the top ranks among the state's bridge players at a very young age, having won 2,679 master points, far more than most players in the large and important Northeast region. Almost half of those points were won in major events and therefore gave Mr. Feldman multiple qualifications for the Blue Ribbon Pairs Championship.
        He twice qualified to represent New England in the national final of the North American Pairs Championship and was ranked in the country's top 500 players for the last five years.
        Mr. Feldman was a managing director and a member of the management committee at Rogers, Casey & Associates, an investment firm in Darien, Conn., that specializes in institutional clients.
        He was born in Lansing, Mich., and graduated from Yale University in 1984 with an undergraduate degree in economics.
        He is survived by his parents, Dorian and Ann Feldman of East Lansing, Mich.; a sister, Sharon, of Okemos, Mich., and two brothers, Brian and Mark, both of San Francisco.
