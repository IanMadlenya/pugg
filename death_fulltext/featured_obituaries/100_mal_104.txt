        Charles Falkiner Reade Sr., former head of a 222-year-old family business dealing with special metals, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, died on May 16 at Martin Memorial Medical Center in Stuart, Fla. He was 79 and lived in Stuart and Morehead City, N.C.
        The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Reade was president and chief executive of the Reade Manufacturing Company, now Reade International, from 1956 to 1983.
        The company, based in East Providence, R.I., dates to 1773, when it was founded as Reade Brothers in Wolverhampton, England. In the 1950's, Mr. Reade developed it into a manufacturer of metals used in foundries and steel mills.
        He is survived by his wife, Marilyn; a son, Charles F. Reade Jr. of Barrington, R.I., the company's current president and chief executive; three daughters, Sandra R. Bound of Seattle, Judith R. Rygiel of Long Valley, N.J., and Nancy R. Forster of Morehead City; a sister, Jane R. Holsapple of Califon, N.J., and five grandchildren.
