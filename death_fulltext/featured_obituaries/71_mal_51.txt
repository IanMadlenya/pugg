        The Rev. Joe B. Love, a retired Methodist minister who served on 16 college campuses, was co-author of a theater piece and assembled an art book, died Friday at the Anna Jaques Hospital in Newburyport, Mass. He was 88 years old and lived in Newburyport.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Love, who stressed the importance of religion in education, devoted his ministry to 16 campuses in nine states. His last post was at Boston University, from 1961 to 1970. He kept in touch with hundreds of former students.
        After his retirement, he and his wife of 60 years, Ruth, wrote a theater piece, "Only Clocks Stop." The autobiographical work traced the couple's life through the changing decades of the 20th Century. They performed it 80 times across the United States and in Canada.
        The couple also produced an unusual book, "Love Album -- Texas Childhood, 1904-1914." The book, of which 10 copies were made, was assembled accordion-style and unfolded to a length of 53 feet. It featured childhood artifacts.
        Mr. Love was born in Chriesman, Tex. After graduating from Southwestern University, he earned a master's degree in church history and a bachelor of divinity from Southern Methodist University and a master of divinity from Yale.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two sons, Larry P., of Newburyport, and David W., of Ipswich, Mass.; a brother, Robert A., of Manhattan; a sister, LaNelle Love Donaldson of Houston, and two grandchildren.
