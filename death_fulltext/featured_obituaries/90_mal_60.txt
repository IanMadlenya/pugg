        Daniel L. Blum, who worked for 30 years in the news departments of The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune, died June 26 at the Clinica Biblica in San Jose, Costa Rica. Mr. Blum, who lived in Atenas, Costa Rica, was 69.
        The cause was pulmonary edema, said his wife, June.
        In 20 years with The Herald Tribune, Mr. Blum, who used a wheelchair for most of his life, rose to assignment editor on its metropolitan desk. After the paper went out of business, he joined The Times as a copy editor in 1967. In 1976, he retired as an assistant to the metropolitan editor.
        On his retirement, Mr. Blum moved to Costa Rica, where he operated a small farm, growing winged beans and fruit.
        He is survived by his wife of 45 years; five sons, Daniel Blum of Burke, Va., Donald Blum of Mesa, Ariz., Dennis Blum of San Francisco, Douglas Blum of Atenas and Dave Blum of Sacramento, Calif.; two daughters, Dian Blum Conrad of Monmouth, N.J., and Dale Blum Consiglieri of Seattle, and nine grandchildren.
