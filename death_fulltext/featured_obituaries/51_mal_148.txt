        Benjamin Lipton, a pioneer in establishing training programs for the disabled and a founder of sports programs for wheelchair-bound athletes, died yesterday, at his home in Malverne, L.I. He was 79 years old.
        He died of Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, the former Anne Earl.
        Mr. Lipton was director emeritus and former chairman of the National Wheelchair Athletic Association. He was also the former director of the Joseph Bulova School of Watchmaking in Elmhurst, Queens, and in 1957 started sponsoring sporting events for the handicapped. The events grew into national and international competitions, were sometimes held at the sites used for the Olympic Games and pitted wheelchair-bound athletes, who were either paraplegics, quadriplegics or amputees, in weight lifting, archery, table tennis, track and field and in swimming. Mr. Lipton was also a member of the United States Wheelchair Sports Fund and a founder of the Pan American Wheelchair Games.
        A graduate of Alfred University, Mr. Lipton, who was not disabled himself, was the recipient of numewrous awards, including the Marion Mill Preminger Medallion from the People-to-People Committee for the Handicapped in 1976 "for his work in guiding and promoting wheelchair athletics and for his work in the rehabilitation of the handicapped."
        He is also survived by two daughters, Carole Lois Soldinger of Dix Hills, L.I., and Joan F. Lipton of Briarwood, Queens; a brother, Albert of Forest Hills, Queens; a sister, Trudy Stone of Briarwood, and two grandchildren.
