        Ray Vicker, an author and former foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, died on Wednesday at a nursing center in Tucson. He was 82 and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Margaret.
        Mr. Vicker was the London bureau chief for The Journal from 1960 to 1975, covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He joined the paper in 1950 and retired in 1983.
        His books, many drawn from the headline news of the day, included ''Those Swiss Money Men'' (1973), ''Kingdom of Oil -- The Middle East: Its People and Its Power'' (1974), ''Realms of Gold'' (1975), ''This Hungry World'' (1975), ''Dow Jones-Irwin Guide to Retirement Planning'' (1985) and ''The Informed Investor'' (1990).
        Born in Wisconsin, Mr. Vicker attended Wisconsin State University and Los Angeles City College before serving in the United States merchant marine. He attended Northwestern University in the late 1940's.
        His wife of 56 years, Margaret Ella Leach Vicker, is his only immediate survivor.
