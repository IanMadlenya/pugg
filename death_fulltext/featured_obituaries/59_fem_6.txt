        Gabriella Pessl Sobotka, a harpsichordist, pianist and organist who performed as Yella Pessl, died on Sunday at her home in Northampton, Mass. She was 85 years old.
        She died of a heart attack, said her sister, Margit Cartwright of Northampton.
        Known for her interpretations of Bach, Miss Pessl was an active performer for more than half a century. As founder and director of the Bach Circle, a New York group specializing in lesser-known works of Bach and other Baroque composers, she helped introduce 18th-century music to a wide audience.
        Miss Pessl was born in Vienna and studied there at the State Academy of Music. Before immigrating to the United States in 1931, she had a busy career performing in Europe.
        In America, Miss Pessl toured extensively, playing solo recitals and with orchestras under conductors like Arturo Toscanini and Bruno Walter. In 1938 she accompanied the Trapp Family Singers, whom she had known in Vienna, at their Town Hall debut. She had her own radio program on WQXR, made recordings for the RCA Victor label and was on the faculty of Columbia University.
        Her husband, Dr. Harry Sobotka, a biochemist at Mount Sinai Hospital, died in 1970.
