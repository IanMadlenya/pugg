        Charles F. Wagner, a founder of Caymus Vineyards, producer of some of the greatest California cabernet sauvignons, died on Feb. 20 in Rutherford, Calif. He was 89.
        Caymus is best known for its Special Selection Napa Valley cabernets, intense, deeply flavored wines. In 1998, 10 vintages of Special Selection in Melchiors, rarely seen huge bottles each holding the equivalent of 24 standard bottles, sold for $46,000 at Sotheby's in New York.
        The 1998 edition, released last September, costs about $136 a bottle.
        Mr. Wagner's career began in 1941, when he bought 73 acres and began planting grapes.
        In 1972, at age 60, he grew tired of selling his first-class grapes to wineries like Inglenook, where they vanished into blends. With his wife, Lorna, and their son, Chuck, he created Caymus. From 1984 on, his son directed its operations.
        Caymus's first regular cabernet sauvignon, 240 cases from vines planted in the mid-1960's, was dated 1972. The regular 1998 cabernet, released last April, costs $70 a bottle.
        Caymus's first Special Selection, from choice lots given extended barrel aging, was made in 1975.
        Special Selection, created only in top vintages, came to rival such standard-setting cabernets as Heitz Cellars's Martha's Vineyard, Beaulieu Vineyard's Georges de la Tour Private Reserve and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars's Cask 23.
        In 1989, the influential Wine Spectator magazine named Caymus's 1984 Special Selection cabernet its wine of the year, and in 1994 it awarded that honor to the 1990 Special Selection.
        Mr. Wagner, a ruddy, crusty farmer who preferred Italian opera (especially tenors), his three dogs and long hours on a tractor to wine-world celebrity, did not let Caymus's international fame go to his head. He would amble into the estate's former tasting room and greet visitors.
        Frank Altamura, a Napa winery owner, recalled Mr. Wagner's style. ''Here was the guy who made the wines, standing behind a board stretched between two barrels, pouring them for you,'' he said. ''That was the picture people had of Caymus.''
        Mr. Wagner's roots in the area go back to 1906, when his Alsace-born father and German-born mother bought a ranch in Rutherford, where he was born, and taught him to cultivate grapes and cherries. He died in his home, about 150 yards from that ranch.
        In addition to Mr. Wagner's wife and son, survivors include two daughters, Marlene Wagner Fisher and Connie Wagner Beitler; and nine grandchildren.
