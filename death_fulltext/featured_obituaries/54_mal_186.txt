        Oron J. Hale, a historian and former professor of history at the University of Virginia, died Friday at the Medical College of Virginia Hospital in Richmond. He was 88 years old and lived in Richmond.
        Dr. Hale died of congestive heart failure, according to a former colleague.
        He was on the Virginia faculty 43 years, retiring in 1972. His career, in which he specialized in 20th-century German history, was interrupted twice, by World War II and the Korean conflict.
        In 1945, as a lieutenant colonel attached to military intelligence, he joined in interviewing captured Nazi leaders, including Hermann Goring and Joachim von Ribbentrop.
        In the early 1950's he returned to Germany as state commissioner for Bavaria.
        A native of Goldendale, Wash., he was a graduate of the University of Washington and received a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1969 he was awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit by the West German Government.
        Both his wives, Annette Van Vinkle and Virginia Zehmer, predeceased him. There are no immediate survivors.
