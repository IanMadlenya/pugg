        Rockets Redglare, a comedian, actor and longtime fixture on the Lower East Side of Manhattan who played characters not unlike himself in many movies, died on May 28 in Manhattan. He was 52.
        The cause was complications of kidney failure, liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatitis C, said his cousin, Madeline Schuster.
        Rockets Redglare's rugged good looks and rollicking nature made him a recognized figure on the Lower East Side, where he hung out and often lived. In the early 1980's he began performing as a comedian in neighborhood clubs like the Pyramid and Club 57, where for a few years he staged a string of performances called the Taxi Cabaret.
        In the mid-80's he began acting in films, appearing in nearly two dozen over a 15-year period. He played a sushi-hating cabby in ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' and a poker player in Jim Jarmusch's ''Stranger Than Paradise'' and appeared as himself in ''Basquiat.'' Although his parts were often small, his colorful presence impressed viewers.
        ''When Rockets was on screen, you couldn't take your eyes off him,'' said the actor Steve Buscemi, who met him on the downtown comedy club circuit in the 80's, appeared in 1992 with him in ''In the Soup,'' then directed him in 1996 in ''Trees Lounge'' and last year in ''Animal Factory.''
        Born Michael Morra, Rockets Redglare grew up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, and in Lindenhurst, on Long Island, sometimes living with Ms. Schuster's family. No immediate family members survive him.
        While growing up on Long Island,  he worked as a roadie for a band called the Hassles, which included Billy Joel. It was his first brush with the life of show business.
        In the late 70's he worked for a time as a bodyguard for the Sex Pistols and later for Sid Vicious, that group's bass player, who split with the band.
