        Lambert Davis, a former director of the University of North Carolina Press who helped publish books of social criticism by many Southern authors, died yesterday in Hill Haven Nursing Home in Chapel Hill, N.C. He was 88 and lived in Chapel Hill.
        The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Isabella Symmers Davis, said.
        During his 22-years with the publisher, from which he retired in 1970, Mr. Davis encouraged writers who focused on national problems that often stemmed from Southern life and tradition, like discrimination, race relations and the education of blacks.
        Between 1938 and 1949, Mr. Davis worked in New York as an editor with the publishing houses Bobbs-Merrill and Harcourt, Brace & Company. While in New York he edited "All the King's Men," the best-selling novel by Robert Penn Warren. During that period he also worked with Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, Jean Stafford, Randall Jarrell and Wright Morris, among other writers.
        A native of Lynchburg, Va., Mr. Davis graduated from the University of Virginia and for a decade, starting in 1928, worked on the Virginia Quarterly Review. During 1955 and 1956, Mr. Davis was the president of the Association of American University Presses, a period in which he urged them to expand into the publication of literary as well as scholarly works.
        Mr. Davis is also survived by two daughters, Martha King of Brooklyn and Charlotte Furth of Los Angeles; a son, W. Minor Davis of Denver; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
