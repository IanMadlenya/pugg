        Lewis S. Kraft, a retired New Jersey builder, died on Thursday at the Medical Center of Princeton, N.J. He was 72 and lived in Princeton.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Kraft's company, Longridge Builders, worked on residential developments in and around Princeton and in central New Jersey. They included Princeton Ridge in Rocky Hill, Carnegie Ridge in Kingston and Longacre in Lawrenceville.
        Born in Wheeling, W.Va., Mr. Kraft was a graduate of Princeton University. After his retirement in 1974, he did volunteer work for the North Princeton Development Center and the Carrier Foundation, a psychiatric hospital in Belle Meade.
        Mr. Kraft is survived by his wife, Eve Friedmann Kraft; two sons, Kenneth, of Haverford, Pa., and Robert, of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
