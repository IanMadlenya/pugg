        Johnny Mize, the hulking Hall of Fame first baseman who moved with feline grace and carried a very big stick during 15 major league seasons in St. Louis and New York in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, died in his sleep yesterday at his home in Demorest, Ga. He was 80.
        The cause of death was cardiac arrest, according to the McGahee-Griffen Funeral Home in Demorest.
        Mize, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1981, holds several hitting achievements, the most notable being his major league record of six times hitting three home runs in a game.
        Although he was a lumbering fielder who played first base as a right-hander but batted from the left, Mize, who was 6-2 and weighed 215 pounds, moved with such grace at the plate that he was known as the Big Cat. He also spoke with such a pronounced Georgia drawl that he was called Big Jawn.
        He broke in with the Cardinals in 1936, was traded to the Giants after the 1941 season and was sold to the Yankees during the 1949 season. He retired after the 1953 season with a .312 career batting average, 359 home runs and a .562 slugging average that is the eighth highest in major league history. 4-Time Home-Run Leader
        Among other feats, Mize, a pull hitter who took special pleasure in laying a perfect bunt down the third-base line, led the National League with a .349 batting average in 1939 and led or tied for the lead in home runs four times (28 in 1939, 43 in 1940, 51 in 1947 and 40 in 1948).
        He also led the National League with 16 triples in 1938 and 39 doubles in 1941. In 1940, he led the league with 137 runs batted in, and in 1947 he led the majors with 138. With the Yankees, he led the American League in pinch-hits three times, and he played with five World Series champions.
        John Robert Mize was born in Demorest on Jan. 7, 1913. Before he was a teen-ager he had demonstrated a remarkable athletic ability -- for tennis.
        Although baseball eventually displaced his early passion, Mize always attributed his fabled hand-eye coordination to the hours he spent as a youngster batting a tennis ball against the barn with a broomstick.
        The drills served him well at the plate, where he struck out far less often than most power hitters. Indeed, he is the only major leaguer to have hit 50 home runs in a season while striking out fewer than 50 times, as he did in 1947 with 51 home runs and 42 strikeouts.
        As a high school baseball star he caught the eye of the coach of the local Piedmont College team and was recruited as a ringer. Or, as his wife, Marjorie, put it yesterday, "He played college ball in high school."
        Although he had heart bypass surgery in 1982, Mize, who loved golf, card shows and signing autographs at children's hospitals, had been in good health. A long-time resident of Florida, he moved back to Demorest in 1974 and settled in his grandmother's house, which had been his boyhood home. It is across the street from the city park, where his major league career is memorialized by a bronze plaque.
        In addition to his wife, Mize is survived by a son, Jim; a daughter, Judi Chapell, and two grandchildren.
