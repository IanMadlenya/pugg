        Philip B. Hofmann, a former chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson, died of a heart attack Tuesday at the Miami Heart Institute in Florida. He was 77 years old and lived in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and Surfside, Fla.
        Mr. Hofmann, a towering, cigar-smoking native of Iowa, joined Johnson & Johnson in 1931 as a shipping clerk. In 1963 he became the first non-family member to head the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical concern, succeeding Robert Wood Johnson. He served as chairman and chief executive officer until his retirement in 1974.
        Mr. Hofmann, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Commerce and Finance, also owned Wycombe House Stud, a thoroughbred horse farm in Reddick, Fla. Among the horses he bred was the sprinter Gold Beauty, winner of a 1982 Eclipse Award. For many years he competed in horse shows, driving a four-horse team and carriage known as a four-in-hand.
        In 1968, Mr. Hofmann helped set up the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, one of the nation's largest philanthropic organizations. He served briefly as a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, resigning because of a disagreement with Gov. Brendan Byrne over mass transportation policy.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Georgia Felhaber; two daughters, Judy Richter of Bedford, N.Y. and Carol Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J., and two grandchildren.
