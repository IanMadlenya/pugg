        Howard Davis, founder and coach of the Harlem Wizards comedy basketball team, died on Thursday at Palisades General Hospital, in North Bergen, N.J. He was 73 years old and lived in North Bergen.
        Mr. Davis died of a heart attack, said a son, Todd.
        A native of Queens, Mr. Davis never stopped indulging the love of baseball, football and basketball he had cultivated as a youth. He played semi-pro baseball briefly and then found that his real talent lay in organizing teams to entertain others.
        In the 1930's he promoted games with teams from the National Basketball League, the predecessor to the National Basketball Association, and formed a team called the Kokomo Clowns, which played basketball and baseball in clown faces and costumes. During World War II Mr. Davis put his talent to patriotic use while serving with the Army's public relations staff in the United States: his job was to organize softball, baseball and basketball events for combat pilots who were on leave. In the late 1940's he barnstormed with semi-professional football teams.
        Mr. Davis's founding of the Wizards in 1961 stemmed from his long friendship with Goose Tatum, a former star of the Harlem Globetrotters. In 1960 Mr. Tatum quit the Globetrotters and asked Mr. Davis to organize a tour for a new team he had formed. The tour was a success, but Mr. Tatum's declining health made it impossible for him to continue to manage the team. Mr. Davis took it over and named it the Harlem Wizards. The team, whose roster over the years included such former National Basketball Association stars as Connie Hawkins and Nate (Tiny) Archibald, tours throughout the world.
        Mr. Davis's wife, Lillian, died in 1979. He is survived by two sons, Alan of Olney, Md., and Todd of North Bergen, N.J.; a daughter, Marilyn, of Baltimore; a sister, Doris Marks, of San Diego, Calif., and two grandchildren.
