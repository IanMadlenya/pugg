        Herbert Carr, former chairman of the Nassau County Liberal Party, died on Tuesday at Long Island Jewish Hospital in Manhasset. He was 70 years old and lived in Cedarhurst, L.I.
        He died of complications following surgery, his son, Michael, said.
        He was chairman of the Liberal Party in Nassau for 22 years, until 1984, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo appointed him to the State Industrial Board of Appeals, a quasi-judicial board that reviews rules and orders on wages, labor standards and occupational safety not covered by Federal standards.
        Mr. Carr, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from City College, St. John's University and New York Law School. Before joining the Board of Appeals he was a lawyer in private practice.
        He is survived by three sons, Jed, of Alexandria, Va., Scott of Sunrise, Fla., and Michael of Freeport, L.I.; his mother, Rose Goldberg of Brooklyn; a brother, Robert, of Tel Aviv, and five grandchildren.
