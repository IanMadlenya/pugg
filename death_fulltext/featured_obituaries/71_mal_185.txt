        Anthony C. Mottola, an educator and a retired dean of the Fordham University Graduate School of Education, died on Saturday at Lehigh Valley Hospital in Allentown, Pa. He was 77 and lived in Caldwell, N.J.
        He died of heart failure while visiting his family, said his son, Paul.
        Joining Fordham in 1950 as an instructor of modern languages, Dr. Mottola became dean in 1977, a post he held until his retirement in 1981.
        He introduced a program in 1967 that gave college seniors on-the-job training in the city's public schools. And in 1969, he was named head of Fordham's Urban Teacher Corps Program to train auxilliary school personnel to qualify as elementary school teachers. This was a cooperative effort with West Side and Harlem community organizations.
        He was born in Nashville. He graduated from the Catholic University of America and received a doctoral degree in romance languages from Fordham.
        Besides his son Paul, of Newton, N.J., he is survived by his wife, Jean Giangulano Mottola.
