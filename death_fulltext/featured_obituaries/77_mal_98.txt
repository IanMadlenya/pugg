        Leon Zawisza, a conductor at Radio City Music Hall for 30 years until his retirement in 1979, died yesterday at his home in Harrington Park, N.J. He was 79 years old.
        The cause was lung and liver cancer, his family said.
        A graduate of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, Mr. Zawisza started his career as a violinist with the Minneapolis Orchestra and in 1938 was appointed concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. During World War II he conducted Gen. Douglas MacArthur's military band, the "Manila Symphony."
        Mr. Zawisza is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Adela Adams; two daughters, Bamb Tascarella of Manhattan and Anne Georges of Springfield, Ill.; a son, Gregory, of West Lafayette, Ind., and three grandchildren.
