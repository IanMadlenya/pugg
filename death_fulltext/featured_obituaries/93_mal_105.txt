        Sydney Walker, a stage and screen actor whose career spanned nearly five decades, died on Sept. 30 at the home of friends in San Francisco. He was 73 and lived in San Francisco.
        He suffered a brief illness, said Nick Kaledin, a friend in New York.
        In the 1992 film version of Craig Lucas's "Prelude to a Kiss," Mr. Walker played the old man (a role originated onstage by Barnard Hughes).
        Mr. Walker was a familiar figure on Broadway in the 1960's when he assumed a wide range of character roles in revivals of the classical and contemporary plays. He appeared in over 200 stage productions.
        He toured nationally in "Long Day's Journey Into Night," as well as "Mary Stuart" and "Elizabeth the Queen," with Eva La Gallienne.
        In 1974, he joined the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and took part in 60 productions, notably as Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol." His final appearance there came in Moliere's "Learned Ladies" last year.
        Mr. Walker was born in Philadelphia and studied mime at the Conservatoire Nationale de Musique in Paris. He then trained with Jasper Deeter at the Hedgerow Theater, a repertory company for which he portrayed a wide variety of characters in the late 1940's.
        In New York, he was first associated with the APA-Phoenix repertory troupe performing at the Phoenix and Lyceum Theaters. Before his move to San Francisco, he was a member of the repertory company at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, playing Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice," among other roles.
        Mr. Walker's film work began with "Love Story" in 1970. In addition to "Prelude to a Kiss," his more recent film credits include "Mrs. Doubtfire" and "Getting Even With Dad." In earlier years, he was often seen on television programs, including "The Phil Silvers Show" and "Play of the Week."
        Mr. Walker is survived by two sisters, Dorothy Walker of Denver and Barbara Shive of Philadelphia."
