        Peter Ripps, a former marketing executive in cosmetics and advertising, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Ripps was born in Manhattan and attended City College. Over the years, he held various management positions at Helena Rubenstein, Clairol, Revlon, Max Factor and Ogilvy & Mather, the advertising agency. More recently, in the 1970's and 80's, he worked as a consultant for Seiko Time.
        He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Rose; a son, Richard, of Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Wendy Weinstein of Scarsdale, N.Y.; three brothers, Harry, of Yonkers, Morris, of Queens, and Jack, of Long Beach, L.I., and six grandchildren.
