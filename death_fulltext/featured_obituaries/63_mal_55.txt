        Arthur Nelson, a retired art professor, died April 4 at his home in Spring Valley, N.Y. He was 79 years old.
        He died of a lung ailment, his family said.
        For 32 years Mr. Nelson taught design, drawing, painting, art history and art education at City College in Manhattan.
        Born in Vestra Karup, Sweden, he came to the United States as a child with his family. He worked in the Civilian Conservation Corps in the Depression, then studied painting, lettering and design at Cooper Union. He graduated from City College in 1945 but had started teaching there part time in 1943 while still a student. His family said he was the first student there to sit with the faculty at his own graduation.
        Surviving are his wife of 52 years, the former Freda Rapaport; four sons, Lars-Erik of Bethesda, Md., the Washington bureau chief of The Daily News, Nils-Peter of Martinsville, N.J., Axel of Point Reyes, Calif., and Linde of Congers, N.Y., and nine grandchildren.
