        Eric Barton Meyers, a trial lawyer who was a senior partner in the Miami firm of Shutts & Bowen, died of colon cancer on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was 47 years old and lived in Miami.
        Mr. Meyers, representing a Palm Beach hospital in 1984, won a decision by the Florida Supreme Court that recognized an individual's living will as a legally binding document, enabling a terminally ill or comatose patient to be allowed to die without the use of extended life-support systems. Under the decision, prior court approval is not required, and physicians, hospitals and family members are relieved of liability.
        Born in Scarsdale, N.Y., Mr. Meyers was a graduate of Trinity College and the George Washington University Law School. He was with the New York firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed before joining Shutts & Bowen in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gail Sloane; two daughters, Hilary and Katie; his parents, Shirley and Ernest Meyers of Rye, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.; his grandmother, Tess Scheuer of Miami Beach, and a sister, Nancy Ferdinand of Manhattan.
