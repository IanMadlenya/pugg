        Walter Foy Prude, who helped to direct the careers of Arthur Rubinstein, Marian Anderson, Isaac Stern and many other artists during his more than four decades in concert management, died of heart failure Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital after a long bout with emphysema. He was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Prude, who was married to the choreographer Agnes de Mille, began his work in management in the late 1930's in Chicago, overseeing Martha Graham's career. He joined Hurok Concerts in 1945 after serving as an Air Force officer in Europe during World War II, and remained with the organization for 31 years, becoming a vice president. After Sol Hurok's death, Mr. Prude joined ICM Artists in 1976 as a vice president; he later became executive vice president of the company, from which he retired in 1981.
        Among the other artists Mr. Prude represented over the years were Martha Graham, Andres Segovia, Roberta Peters, Emanuel Ax, Jan Peerce, Gina Bachauer, Leonard Warren and Victoria de los Angeles.
        He also negotiated the initial agreements with Sadler's Wells Ballet and handled tours in the United States of the Old Vic, the D'Oyly Carte company, the Bolshoi Opera and other international theater, music and dance organizations.
        Mr. Prude is survived by Miss de Mille; by his son, Jonathan, of Atlanta, and two grandsons, David and Michael.
