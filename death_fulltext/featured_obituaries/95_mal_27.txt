        William McConway Hiscock, a retired public-health specialist who helped to draft the legislation that created Medicaid and other Federal health programs in the 1960's, died on Nov. 29 at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. A resident of Towson, Md., he was 71.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Hiscock worked in the Health, Education and Welfare Department's Office of the Surgeon General in the early 1960's when he became involved in writing legislation that ultimately led to Medicaid and health programs for children and the elderly. In 1967 he received a superior-service award for "major contributions to the improvement of health legislation and to the development of the comprehensive health planning programs."
        More recently he was cited for having started a program for mothers and children, and for his work on the child health program at the Medicaid bureau.
        He retired earlier this year as a program analysis officer for the Medicaid bureau in Baltimore.
        Born in New Haven, Mr. Hiscock was a graduate of Phillips Andover Academy and received a bachelor's degree in political science from Yale University in 1943. He earned a master's degree in public administration at Wesleyan University in 1952.
        Before working for the Federal Government, he directed studies in public-health training at the Yale University School of Medicine and at the Central Maryland Health Systems Agency.
        Mr. Hiscock is survived by his wife, Barbara Strangmann Hiscock; his son, Robin M. of Silver Spring, Md.; his daughter, Susan C. of Los Angeles; a sister, Margaret H. Weatherly of Mount Laurel, N.J., and a granddaughter. Also surviving are two stepsons, William M. and David M. Donovan of Baltimore, and a step-granddaughter.
