        Arnold M. Miller, who began his career as a hair stylist and later founded Matrix Essentials Inc., one of the nation's leading makers of hair-care products, died on Saturday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where he had been receiving treatment for cancer. Mr. Miller was 60 years old and lived in Beechwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland.
        He died of pneumonia and other complications of cancer, which he had been battling for about a year, said Dennis Lubin, senior vice president of marketing at Matrix Essentials.
        Mr. Miller had most recently served as president of Matrix Essentials, a Solon, Ohio, company that he co-founded in 1980 with his wife, Sydell. The company, with annual sales that exceeded $150 million last year, sells shampoos, hair sprays, cosmetics and other products under the brand names Matrix Essentials, Systeme Biolage and Vavoom!
        Mr. Miller opened his first salon in 1955 in South Euclid, Ohio. In 1971, he and his wife made their first foray into manufacturing, founding Ardell Inc., which made and sold artificial eyelashes and cosmetics.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Eve Porris, of Cleveland Heights, and two daughters, Lauren Spilman and Stacie Halpern, both of Cleveland.
