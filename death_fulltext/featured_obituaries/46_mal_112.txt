        Leo Gross, a scholar in international law who taught at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University for four decades, died last Thursday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 87 years old and lived in Belmont, Mass.
        Dr. Gross died of pneumonia, his family said.
        He was born in Austria-Hungary and earned a doctoral degree in political science from the University of Vienna. He came to the United States in 1930 as a Rockefeller Fellow and received a law degree from Harvard University in 1931.
        He served for five years in Paris as chief of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, an arm of the League of Nations, before joining the Tufts faculty in 1941. He became a full professor at the Fletcher School in 1944 and retired in 1980.
        Dr. Gross was the author of many books and articles and was book review editor of The American Journal of International Law. His two-volume "Essays on International Law and Organization" was published in 1984.
        He served as a consultant to the United Nations and to the State Department and advised government officials in many countries.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gerda Fried; two daughters, Elisabeth Morse of Narberth, Pa., and Marilyn Rinzler of Berkeley, Calif.; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
