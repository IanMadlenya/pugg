        Flavio Rodriguez da Costa, the Brazilian soccer coach whose 23-year professional career was overshadowed by his national team's loss to underdog Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup final, died on Monday at a hospital in Rio de Janeiro. He was 93.
        Da Costa, a native of Rio, began his soccer career in 1924 as a player for a Rio team, Helenico. One year later, he signed with Flamengo, one of Brazil's greatest teams, playing with that squad until 1934, when he became its coach. In 1942, Da Costa coached Flamengo to the first of three consecutive state championships. He went on to coach Vasco da Gama, winning state titles in 1945, 1947, 1949 and 1950 and the South American club championship in Chile in 1948.
        Amid all his success, Da Costa endured a singular moment of failure: Brazil's 2-1 loss to Uruguay on July 16, 1950, in the World Cup final at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. A crowd of 200,000 packed the stadium to watch a heavily favored Brazilian team. Brazil had 1-0 lead at the end of the first half, but Uruguay rallied for the victory, the final goal coming with only one minute left to play. The Brazilian national publication O Globo called the loss ''a major trauma of the sports history of Brazil.'' Da Costa, who was blamed for the defeat, often told friends and professional colleagues that he spent the rest of his life having to explain that failure.
        In a 1976 interview with the Brazilian sports magazine Placar, Da Costa, who was working as a supervisory coach of a regional soccer team in Rio, talked about the infamous World Cup game.
        ''I left Maracana shaken, but walking firmly, step by step,'' he said. ''Without wavering, deaf to the generalized insults because no one had the courage to curse me personally. I sat down in my car, went home, hugged and kissed Florita, my companion, my wife, a saint. I didn't want to have dinner, I drank some whiskey. Before one hour passed two friends arrived, we spoke about the game for an hour and a half, then changed the subject. The World Cup was finished and lost.''
        Da Costa returned to coach the national team from 1955 to 1957, leaving the year before Brazil won the first of its four World Cup titles.
        Between 1944 and 1957, teams coached by Da Costa won 42 games, tied 13 and lost 12.
        He is survived by a daughter, Elaina de Almeida Macalhaes and a grandson.
