        Edward J. Meade Jr., an educational expert at the Ford Foundation who sought for almost 30 years to improve the quality of public schools, died on Friday at Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. Mr. Meade was 63, and lived in Montclair.
        The cause of death was cancer, said his wife, Miriam.
        Mr. Meade began at the Ford Foundation in 1960, directing its efforts to improve the professional abilities of teachers. From 1966 to 1977 he directed a public education program that encouraged innovative practices by schoolteachers. Until his retirement in 1989 he was the foundation's chief officer for its urban poverty program.
        He is survived by his wife, of Montclair; three sons, Edward Jr., of Boulder, Colo., Jonathan, of Portland, Me., and Timothy, of Seattle; two stepdaughters, Ellen Linder of College Station, Tex., and Rebecca Linder of Manhattan; and a stepson, Steven Linder of Los Angeles.
