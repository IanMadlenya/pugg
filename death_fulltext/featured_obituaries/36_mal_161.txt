        Donold B. Lourie, former chairman of the Quaker Oats Company, who served briefly as Under Secretary of State in the Eisenhower Administration, died of heart failure Monday in Longwood, Fla., where he lived in retirement. He was 91 years old.
        Mr. Lourie began his career with Quaker in 1922 after graduation from Princeton University, where he was an All-America quarterback in his junior year and a broad jumper who won the championship of the United Kingdom.
        At Quaker he rose to become president in 1947. Six years later he took a one-year leave of absence when President Dwight D. Eisenhower, newly elected, asked him to head a reorganization of the State Department as Under Secretary of State for Administration.
        He resumed the presidency of Quaker in 1954 and became chief executive officer two years later and chairman in 1962. He retired in 1970.
        In addition to serving as a director of Quaker for 25 years, Mr. Lourie was a director at various times of the Northern Trust Company, International Harvester, Illinois Central Industries (now the Whitman Corporation) and the International Paper Company.
        Mr. Lourie was a native of Decatur, Ala., and went to Phillips Exeter Academy before Princeton. He was named to several All-America teams after the 1920 football season. In the fall of 1922 he returned to Princeton to serve as backfield coach of its football team after having declined an offer to play professionally with the Chicago Bears.
        Mr. Lourie married Mary Edna King in 1923. She survives, along with a son, Donold K. Lourie of Manhattan and Nantucket, Mass., 11 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
