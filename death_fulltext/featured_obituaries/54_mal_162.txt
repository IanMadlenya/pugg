        Robert McKean, a New York industrial designer known for his elegant, spare furniture designs, died July 13 at the Community Hospital in Troy, Pa. He was 86 years old and lived in Troy.
        Mr. McKean died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        One of his best-known designs was called "Uni-Dapt," a line of modular upholstered furniture, manufactured by Lewittes and Sons of New York, whose components could be used interchangeably for a variety of purposes. The copywriter who wrote the ads for the furniture, Elizabeth Granberry Hill, later became his wife. She died in 1972.
        A 1930 graduate of Pennsylvania State University, with a bachelor's degree in landscape architecture, Mr. McKean was a designer of municipal parks in Harrisburg, Pa., from 1930 to 1934, and for the National Park Service in Washington from 1934 to 1937.
        Susequently he worked for the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Corporation in Philadelphia, Union Carbide Corporation in Manhattan and for Gilbert Rohde, a design studio in Manhattan, before opening his own firm in 1947. In 1954 the firm merged with Sherburne Designers to form Sherburne Associates, of which he was a principal.
        He retired in 1968 and moved to Troy, but continued to work as a consultant.
        Mr. McKean is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
