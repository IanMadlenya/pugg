        William Piel Jr., a leading corporate lawyer of his time, died Sept. 13 at his home in Sherman, Conn. He was 88.
        Mr. Piel joined the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell in 1935 and became a partner in 1946. At his retirement in 1980 he was the firm's senior litigating partner.
        Born in New York City on Nov. 28, 1909, Mr. Piel graduated in 1932 from Princeton University. He entered Harvard Law School and joined Sullivan & Cromwell soon after graduation.
        Mr. Piel served as lead counsel at trial and on appeal for a lengthy roster of corporate America, including the Phillips Petroleum Company  and the Eastman Kodak Company.
        When Kodak was assessed $112.8 million by a Federal court jury in 1978, after accusations by Berkey Photo Inc. that Kodak used its technological dominance to restrict competition, Kodak turned to Sullivan & Cromwell to overturn the verdict.
        Mr. Piel led the appeal in what was widely regarded as an uphill fight. In 1981, eight years after the antitrust suit was filed, a settlement was reached in which Kodak agreed to pay $4.8 million in cash and $2 million in credits to be applied toward the purchase of Kodak goods.
        Mr. Piel is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Eleanor Green, a novelist and short-story writer; three sons by a previous marriage, Michael, of Longwood, Fla., Anthony, of Crassy-Divonne, France, and Joel Thomas, of Sherman, and by his former wife, Mary Loomis, of Sharon, Conn.
