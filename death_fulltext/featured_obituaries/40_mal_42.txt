In 1964, he worked on ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,'' NBC's weekly spy series that spoofed the James Bond phenomenon and that ran for nearly four years.
        Mr. Gelman wrote for many other shows, including ''Bonanza,'' ''Route 66'' and ''Quincy.'' ''One Man's Hero,'' a film he wrote, is in production. As an agent, Mr. Gelman at one time represented the writer Paddy Chayevsky.
        Mr. Gelman was the head of the writing division of the Communication Arts department at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, where he taught until his retirement in 1987.
        Mr. Gelman is survived by his wife, Gloria, and a daughter, Maggi, both of Van Nuys, Calif., and a sister, Edith Gelman of Milwaukee.
