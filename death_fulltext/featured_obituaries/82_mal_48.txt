        Gordon Ramsey, an actor and a singer, died on Friday at his home in Grymes Hill, S.I. He was 63.
        The cause was cancer, said a family friend, who did not wish to be named.
        Mr. Ramsey was born in Minneapolis. After earning a bachelor's degree in drama at Hamline University in St. Paul and serving in the Army during the Korean War, he began acting in the Minneapolis Theater Company. He settled in New York in 1958 to perform Off Broadway in "The Man Who Never Died," a play about the union organizer Joe Hill.
        Mr. Ramsey won critical praise as Walter Braddock in the 1979 Lerner and Loewe musical "Carmelina." On television, he appeared on "The Bell Telephone Hour," "The Doctors," "The Defenders" and other series. His film credits include "A Thousand Clowns" and "Two for the Seesaw."
        He performed frequently in recent years in the "Lyrics and Lyricists" series at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; his mother, Dorothy Lupelow of St. Paul, and a son, Gordon, of New York; three daughters, Joanna, of New York, Elyssa Ramsey-Doub of Washington and Donna Mayo of Boston, and his mother, Dorothy Lupelow of St. Paul.
        Correction:  November 17, 1993, Wednesday
        An obituary last Wednesday about Gordon Ramsey, an actor and singer, misidentified the authors of the 1979 musical "Carmelina," in which he appeared. Alan Jay Lerner wrote it with Joseph Stein and Burton Lane, not with Frederick Loewe.
