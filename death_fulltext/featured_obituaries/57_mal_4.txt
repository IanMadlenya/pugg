        Roger J. Robach, the deputy majority leader of the New York State Assembly, died on Sunday in Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester. He was 57 years old and lived in Rochester.
        Mr. Robach, who had a history of heart trouble, died after going into cardiac arrest while waiting in line to exit the New York State Thruway at Victor, N.Y., the state police said.
        Mr. Robach was a nine-term Democratic Assemblyman whose district included northwest Rochester and the town of Greece. He was the senior member of the Monroe County delegation to the Assembly and was appointed deputy majority leader in 1987 by Speaker Mel Miller.
        Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, relied on Mr. Robach to help him gauge the more conservative members of the Democratic majority in the Assembly. Many of those members live in upstate New York. Mr. Robach also served in a kitchen cabinet convened regularly by Mr. Miller when the Legislature was in session.
        A native of Rochester, Mr. Robach was a longtime employee of the Eastman Kodak Company. He attended Sacred Heart Seminary in Girard, Pa., for five years before deciding against entering the priesthood. He later attended Indiana University and the University of Rochester, from which he graduated in 1966 with a degree in business administration.
        Mr. Robach, an Army veteran, entered politics by winning a seat on the Monroe County Legislature in 1971. He won his first term in the Assembly in 1974.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Terri Fallocco, a son, Joseph, of Greece, two daughters, Kathy Coughenour and Patti, both of Rochester, and six grandchildren. The funeral will be at 11 A.M. Thursday at Holy Cross Church in Rochester.
