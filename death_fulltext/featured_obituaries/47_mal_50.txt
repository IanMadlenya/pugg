        Bill Hardman, a jazz trumpeter, died Dec. 6 in Paris. He was 57 years old. He died after a cerebral hemorrage, his wife, Roseline, said.
        A fiery but lyrical improviser, Mr. Hardman was one of the last surviving major trumpeters to come out of the 1950's. A third-generation be-bopper, he fit easily into the hard-bop style of playing, which incorporated stylistic elements of the trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie, Fats Navarro, Miles Davis and Clifford Brown.
        Mr. Hardman was born in Cleveland and began playing as a professional early in life. While a teen-ager he worked with the composer and band leader Tadd Dameron, and he toured with Tiny Bradshaw, the rhythm and blues band leader, during the mid-1950's. He was constantly in demand with some of the more adventurous composers and group leaders of the 1950's as well, being a part of Jackie McLean's group.  Groundbreaking Bands
        He was also a member of the bassist Charles Mingus's groundbreaking bands in the 1950's and 60's. His other associations during that period were with Lou Donaldson, Horace Silver and Art Blakey, with whom he regularly appeared and recorded during the 1960's and 70's. In a review in The New York Times of one of Mr. Hardman's performances in 1977, Robert Palmer praised the "clean fluidity and grace" of his playing.
        In the 1970's and 80's Mr. Hardman was a co-leader of an adventurous hard-bop group with the saxophonist Junior Cook. He was also a founder, with Bill Lee and Billy Higgins, of the Brass Company, a large group known for its elaborate arrangements.
        In 1988 Mr. Hardman moved to Paris and appeared regularly all over Europe.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Nadege, also of Paris.
