        John J. Ducas, a communications consultant with the Chase Manhattan Bank who in the 1950's and 60's was a principal adviser in the public relations program for the nation's first intercontinental ballistic missiles, died Sunday at his home in Manhattan. Mr. Ducas, 70 years old, died of a heart attack, said his son, Paul.
        A native of Cleveland and a graduate of Marquette University, Mr. Ducas entered the Army Air Corps in 1941 and attained the rank of captain, working in weapons procurement. After the war, he went to work in Manhattan for Hill & Knowlton, the international public relations concern. He was a vice president when he left to help form the public relations and advertising firm of Gaynor & Ducas.
        When the Air Force decided to start lifting the secrecy on the four-year-old missile program in 1957, Mr. Ducas's concern received a contract to help with public relations from the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, the advanced-technology company working with the Air Force on missile development that is now part of TRW Inc. While with Gaynor & Ducas and later working independently, Mr. Ducas consulted closely with the head of the missile program, Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, now retired.
        Mr. Ducas was a consultant for 20 years to The Minneapolis Star and Tribune, now The Star Tribune.
        Besides his son, who lives in Atlanta, he is survived by a daughter, Helene M. Viall of Des Moines; two sisters, Mary Pavic and Helen Rusnov, and two brothers, George and Paul, all of Cleveland, and four grandchildren.
