        Jacques Traubee, a real-estate developer who was also an investor in a number of Broadway productions, died last Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 77 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, said a friend, Ward Morehouse.
        Mr. Traubee was born in Lutz, Poland, and came to the United States as a boy. At one time he owned the Castaways in Daytona Beach, Fla., and a Bronx apartment complex, Parkway Gardens. "Golden Boy" was one of many theatrical productions in which he invested.
        There are no immediate survivors.
