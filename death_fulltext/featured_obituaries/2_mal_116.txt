        Former Representative Tim Lee Carter, a Republican who called for the withdrawal of United States troops from Vietnam in 1967, died of anemia Friday, his doctor said. He was 76 years old.
        Dr. Carter, a physician, represented the Fifth Congressional District from 1965 to 1980, when he retired from Congress and returned home to practice medicine.
        In 1966 he gained national attention as the first Republican Congressman to seek withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. However, he never wavered in his support of the troops fighting there. He voted against efforts to cut off funds for the war and in 1972 backed the saturation bombing of North Vietnamese cities as a way of saving American lives.
        He was a staunch defender of President Nixon in the Congressional impeachment hearings in 1974, rising to denounce what he saw as attacks by the ''liberal limousine press'' on the President.
        In Kentucky he was known for efforts to improve one of the nation's poorest districts, which allied him with President Johnson's Great Society programs for schools, water systems, libraries, airports, roads and recreation.
        Dr. Carter, who was a major contributor to health and hospital legislation, graduated from Western Kentucky University and earned a medical degreee three years later from the University of Tennessee.
        Survivors include his wife, Kathleen, a brother and a sister.
