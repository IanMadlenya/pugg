        Carlos Alfonzo, a painter who emigrated from Cuba to the United States during the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and earned recognition here as a major artist, died on Tuesday at South Miami Hospital. He was 40 years old and lived in Miami.
        A family spokesman, Peter Menendez, said Mr. Alfonzo, who was HIV positive, died of a cerebral hemorrhage associated with a blood disease.
        After Mr. Alfonzo landed in the United States, he was held in Federal detention for two months. He then did odd jobs and traveled across the United States until 1984, when he returned to Miami and to painting.
        Amada Cruz, a curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, in Washington, said Mr. Alfonzo "made expressionistic canvases; passionate, colorful works, with strong black outlines and Cuban Santerian symbols." Much of his work, she said, was autobiographical.
        Mr. Alfonzo, who was also a sculptor, was represented in the 1987 touring show "Hispanic Art in the United States," and was to be included in the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial Exhibition later this year.
        He is survived by his mother, a sister and a son, all of whom live in Cuba.
