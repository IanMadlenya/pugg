        Dr. Meihan Nonoyama, co-founder and president of the Tampa Bay Research Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., died on March 24 at his home in St. Petersburg. He was 57.
        The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the institute, Dr. Raymond Lau.
        As a researcher, Dr. Nonoyama had particular interests in molecular biology and viral oncology, subjects his institute engaged in under contract with the National Institutes of Health and other Government agencies. He was widely published in scientific journals.
        He was especially known for his original studies of the Epstein-Barr virus, the herpes virus that causes mononucleosis. He was a past treasurer of the International Association of Epstein-Barr Virus and Related Diseases and served on various boards of the health institutes, the Department of Agriculture and the National Cancer Institute.
        Born in Tokyo, Dr. Nonoyama graduated from the University of Tokyo, where he also received a doctorate in molecular biology. He came to the United States in 1966 as a Fulbright Scholar. He then held research positions at various institutions and was director of molecular virology at the Life Sciences Research Laboratory in St. Petersburg in 1981. That was the year he and a colleague, Dr. Akiko Tanaka, founded their own institute.
        The Tampa Bay Research Institute is affiliated with the University of South Florida Medical School and with Salem-Teikyo University in West Virginia, where it helped to establish a graduate program in biotechnology and molecular biology. The institute's government research covers molecular genetics, virology, cellular biochemistry, AIDS, cancer and related matters.
        Dr. Nonoyama is survived by his wife, Keiko; a son, Akihisa, of St. Petersburg; and a sister, Michiko Nonoyama of Tokyo.
