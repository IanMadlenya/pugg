        Vincent R. Fitzpatrick, a retired lawyer, law professor and twice an unsuccessful candidate for Congress in the 1950's, died yesterday. He was 75 years old.
        His family said he had a heart attack at his home in Grasmere, S.I.
        Mr. Fitzpatrick was born in Waltham, Mass. He was a graduate of Manhattan College and Catholic University Law School. He moved to Staten Island in 1947 and was a member and partner for 30 years in the Manhattan law firm of Willkie, Owen, Farr, Gallagher & Walton. The senior partner was Wendell Willkie, the Republican Presidential candidate in 1940.
        Mr. Fitzpatrick ran for Congress as a Democratic-Liberal candidate in 1954 and 1958.
        He was appointed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame to the Board of Higher Education in 1974 and served for two years until he quit in protest rather than agree to a proposal imposing tuition at City University.
        Mr. Fitzpatrick served as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia Collins; five sons, Vincent Jr., Rory, Richard, Mark and Christopher; a daughter, Mary Fitzpatrick Rodal, and nine grandchildren.
        Correction:  October 28, 1992, Wednesday
        An obituary on Saturday about a law professor who lived in Staten Island and was twice an unsuccessful candidate for Congress in the 1950's rendered his name incorrectly. He was Vincent R. FitzPatrick.
