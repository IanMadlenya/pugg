        Mrs. de Rothschild and her husband, James A. de Rothschild, were longtime supporters of Israel, active in pressing the British Government for what became known as the Balfour Declaration, the 1917 commitment to work toward a Jewish homeland in British-administered Palestine.
        When Mr. de Rothschild died in 1957, he bequeathed to Israel the money for a new building for the national Parliament, which Mrs. de Rothschild dedicated in 1966. Toward the end of her life she gave Israel a new Supreme Court building.
        Born Dorothy Pinto in London, she married Mr. de Rothschild in 1912.
        After her husband's death, their home at Waddesdon Manor, a 6,000-acre estate in Buckinghamshire, was left to the National Trust for Historic Preservation, along with a considerable art collection. Mrs. de Rothschild continued to be associated with the manor, working for its improvement and upkeep.
        In recent years she divided her time between her home in London and Eythrope, her country estate near Waddesdon Manor.
        There are no immediate survivors.
