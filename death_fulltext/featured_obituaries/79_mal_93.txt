        Giner E. Mendez, a high-wire performer for 30 years in circuses and for television and films, died at his home in Orlando, Fla., on Aug. 11. He was 56.
        The cause was believed to be a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Mendez, known as Gene, prided himself on never working with a safety net or balancing pole, his family said. He performed his feats on a steel cable, five-eighths of inch in diameter, 45 feet above the ground. He suffered one fall in San Antonio in 1977, for which he blamed faulty rigging. The accident broke his wrist and elbow.
        Performing in the United States and Europe, he appeared frequently in the Ringling Brothers Circus, as well as in the Clyde Beatty Circus, Circus Circus and Circus Scott. He gave command performances for the Queen of England, Princess Grace of Monaco and the Shah of Iran, his family said.
        His television appearances included the "Ed Sullivan Show" and "Circus of the Stars." He had nonspeaking roles in several movies, including "The Greatest Show on Earth," "Ring of Fear," "The Horizontal Lieutenant" and "The Amazing Dobermans," his family said. He was also a double for Pee Wee Herman in "Pee Wee Herman's Big Top."
        Mr. Mendez, a native of Moca, P.R., moved to Brooklyn as an infant with his family.
        As a teen-ager he trained as a body builder and gymnast. The Flying Wallendas saw him on a televised amateur talent show in Philadelphia and recruited him to join their act. Soon he formed his own act.
        His survivors include a sister, Nilda Corvo of Staten Island.
