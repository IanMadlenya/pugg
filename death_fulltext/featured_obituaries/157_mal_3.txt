        Alfred R. Zipf, a pioneer in computer technology and electronic banking and a former executive at the Bank of America, died on Jan. 1 in Oroville, Calif. He was 82.
        Mr. Zipf headed the equipment research department at Bank of America when he worked with the Stanford Research Institute and General Electric to create the first large-scale, general purpose computing system for the banking industry. The system was called ERMA, or the electronic recording method of accounting.
        Mr. Zipf also led a team at the bank that together with Stanford Research Institute developed magnetic ink character recognition, which reads the string of numbers on the bottom of each check. The system reduced check processing time by 80 percent. As a member of the American Bankers Association's check-processing committee, he also recommended magnetic ink character recognition as the standard for nationwide check handling, a system that is still in use today.
        He was awarded several patents for banking equipment, including an early fax machine and an automatic receiving teller, a forerunner of the automated teller machine.
        Mr. Zipf was born on Oct. 13, 1917, in Buffalo. He attended the University of California at Los Angeles and the Harvard Business School's advanced management program.
        He joined Bank of America in 1936 as a transit clerk sorting checks by hand, rose to executive vice president and retired in 1976 as senior administrative officer for the California branch system and computer system.
        Mr. Zipf served on the National Commission on Libraries and Information Services in 1971. In 1992, Bank of America named its technology center in Concord, Calif., the Al Zipf Building.
        He is survived by his wife, Rena; a son, Robert, of Stockton, Calif.; a brother, Irving Briggs, of Chatsworth, Calif.; a sister, Beata Hefler, of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.
