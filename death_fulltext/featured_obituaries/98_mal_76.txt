        Leroy B. Kellam, a former State Supreme Court justice in Queens who was a founder of a bar association for minority lawyers, died on March 7 in the North Carolina Baptist Hospital in Winston-Salem, N.C. He was 76 and had lived in Pinnacle, N.C., since his retirement in 1988.
        The cause was complications from leukemia, said a daughter, Geneva Grace Kellam.
        Mr. Kellam set up a private practice in Queens and helped to found the Macon B. Allen Black Bar Association. The group, which has about 200 members, is named after the first black lawyer admitted to the bar in Maine, in 1854. It remains active in representing minority lawyers.
        In 1979, Mr. Kellam was appointed to the New York City Criminal Court by Mayor Edward I. Koch. In 1982, he was elected to the State Supreme Court.
        He was born in Pinnacle and received an undergraduate degree from West Virginia State College Institute in 1941 and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1961.
        Besides his daughter, of Southfield, Mich., he is survived by his wife of 48 years, Claree Virginia Kellam; a son, Bernard, of Manhattan; another daughter, K. Leesa Stringer of Brighton, England; three sisters, Mildred Sawyer of Rockville, Md., Helen Foman of Washington and Lillian Scales of Greensboro, N.C., and three grandchildren.
