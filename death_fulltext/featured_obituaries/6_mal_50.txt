        Ahnahkaq Henson, the half-Eskimo son of the American polar explorer Matthew A. Henson, has died, relatives said today. He was 80 years old.
        Mr. Henson, who returned home three weeks ago from his first trip to the United States, died of cancer June 29, his son Ajako said by telephone from the family's village, Moriusaq, 60 miles south of Thule.
        Matthew Henson, Robert E. Peary's American assistant, joined the United States Navy officer and four Eskimos on the first trip to the North Pole in 1909.
        On an earlier Arctic expedition, in 1906, both men fathered children by Eskimo women in this area, the world's northernmost inhabited spot.
        Karree Peary, Robert Peary's son, accompanied Ahnahkaq Henson on his trip to the United States, which included stops at the Peary grave at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., and meetings with Henson and Peary relatives in Maine and Maryland. Mr. Henson's five sons also accompanied him.
        In addition to his sons, Mr. Henson is survived by 23 grandchildren.
