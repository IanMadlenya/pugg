        William J. De Lancy, who ran the Republic Steel Corporation during some of its toughest times, died from complications of Parkinson's disease Friday at his home in Shaker Heights, Ohio, his family said.
        He was 82.
        Born in Chicago in 1916, Mr. De Lancy earned both bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Michigan. After graduation in 1940, he was hired by the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. He served as a Naval intelligence officer on the aircraft carrier Bennington in World War II, and returned to the firm after the war.
        In 1952, he joined Republic Steel in Cleveland as assistant counsel. He rose through several positions including general counsel, and became the company's president in 1973 and its chief executive in 1974. He added the title of chairman in 1979.
        Republic, then the fifth-largest steelmaker, suffered, as did the entire steel industry, from heightened competition from more efficient producers abroad at a time of weak demand induced by the recession and high interest rates in the late 1970's and early 1980's.
        By 1980, for example, the industry was operating at little more than half of capacity, and shipped only 84 million tons of steel, down from 100 million tons the year before. Steel industry employment was at its lowest level since 1933.
        In 1980, Mr. De Lancy became president of the industry's trade group, the American Iron and Steel Institute, and he led a lobbying effort aimed at strengthening the existing government restrictions on imports of steel.
        The industry contended that European and Asian steelmakers were ''dumping'' steel in the United States; that is they were selling the steel at artificially low prices, possibly for less than their cost of production.
        In 1982, Mr. De Lancy turned 65, and he retired both from Republic and the steel institute.
        The company and industry continued to suffer. Steel production hit a postwar low of 75 million tons in 1982, and production did not return to 1980 levels until 1994. In 1984, Republic merged with Jones & Laughlin Steel to form the LTV Corporation.
        Mr. De Lancy is survived by his wife, the former Sally Roe, and his children, Ann of Seattle and Mark of Chicago.
