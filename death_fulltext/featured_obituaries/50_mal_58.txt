        Johnny Revolta, a golfer who won 19 Professional Golf Association tour events and 22 state tournaments between 1932 and 1952, died on Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Revolta, who taught himself to play golf with a homemade club, began as a caddy in his hometown of Menominee, Mich., and eventually rose to a level of the game where he was competing as a professional with Walter Hagen, Byron Nelson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead and Ben Hogan.
        He gained national attention at the age of 23 by winning the Professional Golfers Association championship of 1935 at Oklahoma City. After his retirement from the tour in 1952, he became the head professional at the Evanston Golf Club in Skokie, Ill., and taught golf at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was elected to the P.G.A. Hall of Fame in 1963.
