        Mr. Sweeney was on the staff of the Ford Foundation from the late 1960's until 1981. During that time he traveled extensively in developing nations, helping their governments to set up family planning programs.
        A native of Philadelphia, he received his law degree at the University of Pennsylvania. He worked for Newsweek magazine and the Cursillo Movement of the Roman Catholic Church before he joined the foundation. After leaving the foundation, he was executive director, in turn, of both the International Institute of Communications, in London, and the International Advertising Association, in New York.
        He is survived by a brother, Dr. Francis J. Sweeney, of Wynnewood, Pa.
