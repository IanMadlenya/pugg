        Russell W. Raitt, an oceanographer who helped define the structure and evolution of the sea floor, died on March 6 in the Pacific Regent Health Center in San Diego. He was 87 and lived in San Diego.
        The cause was heart failure, the family said.
        A professor emeritus of geophysics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, Dr. Raitt was a leading participant in the ocean surveys of the 1950's and 1960's that shed light on the formation of the sea floor through spreading from mid-ocean ridges, where molten rock wells up.
        The field observances he helped gather became central to the development of the theory of plate tectonics, which deals with the origin, structure and movement of the earth's crust. In mapping the sea floor and the rocks beneath it, he adapted seismic techniques used for oil exploration on land.
        The thickness of sediment layers and crust below the oceans were a geological gauge to its age; the thinner the crust, the younger. The shipboard investigations he made over 25 years in large sections of the Indian and Pacific Oceans revealed that the crust beneath the oceans was much thinner than the crust under land.
        A native of Philadelphia, he received his bachelor's and doctoral degrees in physics from the California Institute of Technology.
        In World War II he worked on research in sound reflections of the sea floor that were used in advancing submarine detection techniques.  After the war, he joined the newly formed Marine Physical Laboratory at Scripps. He retired in 1976.
        Dr. Raitt's wife of 40 years, Helen, died in 1976. He is survived by a daughter, Martha Harrison of Miami; three stepchildren from his wife's earlier marriage, Alison Gist and Craig Biddle, both of Sacramento, Calif., and Charles Biddle of San Diego; 12 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.
