        Nina Tikanova, a ballet teacher who had danced in the companies of Bronislava Nijinska, Ida Rubinstein and Boris Romanov, died on Wednesday at her home in Paris. She was 84.
        Born in St. Petersburg, Russia, Miss Tikanova trained in France with the great Russian teachers Olga Preobrazhenska and Nicolas Legat. George Balanchine invited her to join his first company, Les Ballets 1933, but she chose to join the Ballets Russes de Nijinska in Paris, where she became a leading dancer.
        Miss Tikanova made her debut at 15 with the Theatre Romantique Russe, founded in Berlin by the Russian experimental choreographer Romanov. In 1928, she joined Rubinstein's avant-garde troupe, for which Nijinska was the main choreographer. She was also a principal dancer with the Nouveaux Ballets de Monte Carlo from 1942 to 1944.
        After World War II, she taught dance at orphanages for children whose parents had been killed by the Nazis and directed her own ballet school in Paris.
        Miss Tikanova belonged to a literary and artistic family, which she wrote about in her memoir, "The Girl in Blue," published in 1991 in France and Russia.
