        Clifton R. Read, a retired media and information director of the American Cancer Society, died on Sunday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. He was 86 and lived in Cornwall Bridge, Conn.
        The cause of death was heart failure, the society said.
        Mr. Read, a native of St. Paul, was a history honors graduate of Princeton University and worked in New York as a radio writer and publicity representative for the American Civil Liberties Union during the Depression. In 1936 he became the first publicity director of the American Society for the Control of Cancer.
        In World War II he served with the Office of War Information in New York and with the Psychological Warfare Branch in the Mediterranean. After the war he established and directed a United States Information Service center in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
        He rejoined the reorganized American Cancer Society in 1948 and was named national publicity director the next year. He built up a staff of broadcast, science and news writers and directed educational campaigns against smoking, for Pap tests, for breast self-examination and for early diagnosis. He retired in 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Alice Winslow Meade; two daughters, Alison Read of Greater Barrington, Mass., and Sheila Botein of Washington, and two granddaughters.
