        Pier Luigi Samaritani, a director and set designer for opera, theater and ballet, died on Wednesday in Rome at a private clinic where he had been hospitalized for some time. He was 51.
        The Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that the cause was a tumor.
        Mr. Samaritani directed at, and designed sets for, many of the world's leading opera houses, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, La Scala in Milan and the Teatro dell'Opera in Rome. He also designed productions for American Ballet Theater, including Natalia Makarova's 1980 staging of "La Bayadere," and other American and European ballet companies.
        Mr. Samaritani, who was born in Novara, Italy, studied painting at the Academy of Brera in Milan and then in Paris, where he also studied stage design.
        A frequent collaborator with the composer Gian Carlo Menotti, he designed the sets for many productions at Mr. Menotti's Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, and Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C.
        Mr. Samaritani was also a theater director, staging the 1984 premiere of Giuseppe Manfridi's "Scrutatore d'Anime" at the Sala Casella della Filarmonica in Rome.
