        Brother Enright was a member of the Brothers of the Christian Schools for 62 years. He was appointed provincial consultor in the North American Province for a six-year term in 1954. He was also treasurer for the Western American Province from 1981 to 1984, when he retired. He was a former board member of Iona College in New Rochelle and a teacher at Iona Preparatory School and other parochial high schools.
        He is survived by a brother, James, of Grey Eagle, Minn.
        Correction:  February 18, 1989, Saturday, Late City Final Edition
        An obituary last Saturday about Joseph J. Enright, a Christian Brother who was a retired teacher, misidentified his order. He was a member of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, not the Brothers of the Christian Schools.
