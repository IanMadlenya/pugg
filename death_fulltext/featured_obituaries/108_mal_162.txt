        Joseph De Rugeriis, an opera conductor and administrator, died on Jan. 23 at  St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 48 and lived in San Francisco.
        The cause was AIDS, said William Purves, a friend.
        Mr. De Rugeriis, who was a native of Philadelphia and a graduate of Columbia University, performed a variety of administrative roles in the course of his career at opera houses in Baltimore, Chicago, San Antonio, San Francisco and San Diego. In 1971-72 he was executive assistant to the composer Gian Carlo Menotti.
        He also conducted operas in the United States and abroad, including productions at the Washington Opera and at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy.
        He is survived by his stepmother, Virginia, of Philadelphia, and two half-brothers, Mark and James, both of New York City.
