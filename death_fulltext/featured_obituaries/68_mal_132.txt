        Samuel N. Greenspoon, a lawyer, died at his home in Manhattan on Sept. 19. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Greenspoon died of a heart attack, said Elaine Zweibel, a spokeswoman for the New York Law firm of Carb, Luria, Glassner, Cook & Kufeld, where Mr. Greenspoon was of counsel.
        During his career, Mr. Greenspoon had a varied practice that drew many prominent clients, among them, Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress. He also represented the Mark Rothko Foundation in the early 1970's against a suit brought by the painter's daughter, Kate, to rescind the sale of 100 Mark Rothko paintings.
        Mr. Greenspoon, a native of Harrisburg, Va., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1945. In 1948, he graduated from the University of Michigan law school, where he had been a member of the law review and was elected to the Order of the Coif, the honor society for law school graduates.
        He practiced with Milton Pollack, now a judge of the Federal District Court, for nearly 20 years. In the late 1960's he became a partner in the firm of Eaton, Van Winkle & Greenspoon, where he practiced for 12 years.
        Then Mr. Greenspoon became a member of the firm of Grutman Miller Greenspoon & Hendler. In the early 1980's Mr. Greenspoon became of counsel to the law firm of Dunnington, Bartholow & Miller, and later founded the firm of Greenspoon, Gaynin, Daichman & Marino. In March of this year he had become of counsel to the firm of Carb, Luria.
        He is survived by his wife, Doris; two sisters, Bee Brill of Bethesda, Md., and Gertrude, of Chevy Chase, Md., and two brothers, Benjamin of Chevy Chase, and Joel.
