        Fay Stanley Shulman, former chief advertising writer for Faberge Inc. and a novelist, died on Friday at the New England Baptist Hospital in Boston. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of breast cancer, said her daughter, Diane Stanley Vennema of Houston.
        Mrs. Shulman was chief advertising copywriter for Faberge from the early 1970's until she retired in 1985.
        Under the name of Fay Stanley, she wrote several books, the first of which was a mystery, "Murder Leaves A Ring," published in 1950 by Holt Rinehart & Winston Inc. Her last book, a joint venture with her daughter, an illustrator of children's books, is titled "The Last Princess: Kaiulani of Hawaii." It is scheduled for publication in the spring by MacMillan/Four Winds Press Inc.
        Mrs. Shulman, a native of Haskell, Tex., was in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. She joined the Navy Women's Air Raid Division and worked on the newly developed radar system tracking aircraft carriers in the Pacific throughout the war.
        Besides her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Nancy Sayles of Abilene, Tex., and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 8, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final
        An obituary on Tuesday about Fay Stanley Shulman, an advertising writer and novelist, misstated her wartime activity. She was a member of the Women's Air Raid Defense, an Army unit composed initially of civilian women who tracked aircraft in the Pacific.
