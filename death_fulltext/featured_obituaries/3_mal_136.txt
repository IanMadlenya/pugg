        His wife, Genevieve, said by telephone that Mr. Favre Le Bret died at their home in Bougy-Villars of cancer.
        Mr. Favre Le Bret was a journalist for the Paris daily Le Temps and later headed France's General Commissariat for Tourism and Artistic Expansion.
        He founded the festival in the Riviera resort town of Cannes in 1947 and saw it evolve from a small art competition to the world's largest movie marketplace, attracting thousands of actors, industry leaders, film buffs and reporters. This year's festival runs from May 7 through 19.
        Mr. Favre Le Bret ran the festival as general delegate from 1947 to 1970, when he was named president, a post he held until 1984.
