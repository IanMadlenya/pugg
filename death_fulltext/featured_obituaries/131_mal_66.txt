        Newbold Noyes Jr., who as editor of The Washington Evening Star from 1963 to 1975 was the last member of four generations of his family to lead the newspaper, died yesterday in Sorrento, Me. He was 79.
        Mr. Noyes had heart problems, said a son, Newbold Noyes 3d.
        The Noyes family co-owned The Star from 1867 to 1975, when control of its parent company was sold to Joe L. Albritton, a Houston businessman. The paper ceased publication in 1981.
        Mr. Noyes's great-grandfather, Crosby S. Noyes, joined The Star as a reporter soon after its founding in 1852 and bought a one-third interest in the paper. Frank B. Noyes, his grandfather, served as president of The Star and was one of the founders of The Associated Press, and Newbold Noyes Sr. served as associate editor of the paper.
        After graduating from Yale University in 1941, Mr. Noyes joined The Star as a reporter, then served as an ambulance driver in the American Field Service from 1942 to 1944. He rejoined The Star as a foreign correspondent covering American troops in Italy, filing dispatches on the invasion of southern France and the Allied advance into Germany.
        Mr. Noyes served as president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors from 1970 to 1971, as a director of The Associated Press and as a member of the Pulitzer Prize advisory board.
        In addition to his son, Newbold, of Sorrento, Mr. Noyes is survived by his wife of 53 years, the former Beatrice Spencer, of Sorrento; another son, Howard Baldwin Noyes of Bodyke, County Clare, Ireland; two daughters, Alexandra Noyes Koenig of Plainfield, Vt., and Elizabeth Noyes, also of Sorrento, and 12 grandchildren.
        Correction:  December 20, 1997, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about Newbold Noyes Jr., a former editor of The Washington Evening Star, misspelled the surname of the Houston businessman who bought control of The Star's parent company in 1975. He is Joe L. Allbritton, not Albritton.
