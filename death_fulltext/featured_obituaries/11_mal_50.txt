        Emanuel Saxe, dean emeritus of the School of Business and Administration of the Bernard M. Baruch College of the City University of New York, died Saturday, apparently of a heart attack, at his home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. He was 88 years old.
        Dr. Saxe, who was born in Manhattan, was a certified public accountant. He joined the Baruch faculty in 1937 and became dean in 1956, a post he held until 1968. From then until he retired in 1973 he held two named chairs: the Martin Wollman Distinguished Professorship and the City University Distinguished Professorship, both in accounting.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Lubell; a son, David, a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan; a brother, Alfred, of Boca Raton, Fla., and two grandchildren.
