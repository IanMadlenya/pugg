        David Novick, an economist who was an outspoken analyst on the horse-racing industry, died Tuesday at St. Luke's Hospital in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 85 years old and lived in Santa Monica, Calif.
        He died of complications after a stroke, said his nephew, Roger Levin of Bethlehem, with whom he had been staying.
        Mr. Novick headed the cost-analysis department of the Rand Corporation, a research institution in Santa Monica, from 1950 to 1970.
        His work in the horse racing field was independent from Rand. Besides breeding and raising thoroughbred horses, he carried out studies for industry and Government organizations involved in horse-racing and other sports, testified before racing commissions and wrote a book-length essay on his specialty, "Economic Study of Harness Horse Racing."
        In the 1960's and 1970's he also wrote economic analyses that appeared in The Blood-Horse, a magazine about thoroughbred horse racing and breeding.
        One occasion in which Mr. Novick contended that the sport was overgrown was a speech to leaders of the Thoroughbred Racing Association in 1976. "Instead of filling the tub to overflowing, it would be better to open the drain a little, and have less quantity and more quality," he declared.
        Mr. Novick was born in Easton, Pa., and studied at Lafayette College and Brown and New York Universities. He is survived by his wife, Mary Bateman Novick, and a sister, Dora N. Levin of Houston.
