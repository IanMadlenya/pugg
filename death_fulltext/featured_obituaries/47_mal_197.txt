        Sigurd Anderson, a former Governor of South Dakota who was later a member of the Federal Trade Commission, died Friday at Lake Area Hospital in Webster, S. D., where he lived. He was 86 years old.
        He died of prostate cancer and pneumonia, his daughter, Kristin, said.
        Mr. Anderson, a moderate Republican, served two terms as Governor, from 1951 to 1955. During his tenure, the income of state employees was increased about 10 percent while the state sales tax was reduced to 2 percent from 3 percent.
        Mr. Anderson, a lawyer, was appointed to the Federal Trade Commission by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955 and served on the panel until 1964. Earlier, he was Attorney General of South Dakota. He later became a state circuit court judge, retiring in 1975.
        He was brought to this country from Norway at the age of 2. He earned bachelor's and law degrees cum laude at the University of South Dakota and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and the Delta Theta Pi legal fraternity, where he was elected chapter president. In World War II, he served in the Navy in the Philippines, rising to lieutenant commander.
        Mr. Anderson received an Americanism award from the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1958 and last year his hometown's airport was renamed in his honor.
        His only immediate survivor is his daughter, of Brookings, S.D.
