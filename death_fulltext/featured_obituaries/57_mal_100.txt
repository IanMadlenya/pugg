        Henry M. Schachte, a former president and chairman of the executive committee of J. Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 78 years old and lived in Sherman, Conn.
        He died after a series of strokes, his daughter Susan Swift said.
        Mr. Schachte (pronounced SHACK-tee) was president of Thompson in 1972 and 1973. He joined it in 1963, after being advertising vice president and executive vice president at a client, Lever Brothers, the manufacturer of consumer products.
        He became chairman of the executive committee of Thompson in 1969. Mr. Schachte stressed efficiency and foresight. In 1971 he said, "We are rapidly developing a new breed of futurists who peer into the future and come up with visions that vary from apocalyptic to paradisaical."
        Mr. Schachte continued to head the executive committee when he became chief operating officer as well as president in 1972. He retired in 1974.
        Bert Metter, a former chairman of J. Walter Thompson USA who is now a consultant, said Mr. Schachte had "added strong administrative qualities which helped the agency very much" after being "brought to Thompson to add client perspective and package-goods discipline." Package goods like toothpastes or foods are sold in packages as opposed to products like automobiles or services.
        Mr. Schachte was chairman of the Association of National Advertisers, the Advertising Research Foundation and the Advertising Council.
        He was born in Pittsfield, Mass., and attended Williams College. He was married in 1933 to Marie Hill. She died in 1986.
        Surviving are a sister, Marion Cutler of Sanford, N.C.; two daughters, Mrs. Swift, of Fairfield, Conn., and Judith, of Coromandel, New Zealand; two sons, Peter and Henry Jr., both of Vancouver, British Columbia; 13 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.
