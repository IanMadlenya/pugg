        Mahalia Jackson, Clara Ward, Queen C. Anderson and his own group, the Brewster Ensemble, popularized most of his more than 200 compositions. Many of them, including ''Tomorrow,'' ''How Far Am I From Canaan?'' and ''God's Amazing Love,'' became gospel standards.
        Mr. Brewster had been pastor of the East Trigg Avenue Baptist Church in Memphis from 1930 until last June. He had also been a leading influence on young black ministers in the South as a longtime staff member of the American Baptist Theological Seminary. He was a native of Somerville, Tenn., and an alumnus of Roger Williams College in Nashville.
        ''A gospel song is a sermon set to music, and it must have sentiment and doctrine,'' he said in an interview in 1970. ''It is good news, glad tidings and the story of salvation through Christ.''
        Surviving are a daughter, Juanita Crenshaw of Memphis; three sisters, a brother, a grandson and a great-granddaughter.
