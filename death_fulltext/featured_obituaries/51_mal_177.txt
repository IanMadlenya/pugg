        Jack (Kid) Berg of England, the world junior-welterweight boxing champion for 14 months in 1930 and 1931 and a whirlwind puncher who was popular in the New York area throughout the 1930's, died on Monday in London. He was 81 years old. British newspapers reported that his death came after a long illness.
        Born Judah Bergman, he began boxing in small arenas in London in 1923 and became the junior-welterweight champion on Feb. 18, 1930, when he knocked out Mushy Callahan, a fellow Englishman, in London. Berg lost his crown on April 24, 1931 to Tony Canzoneri, an American who scored a third-round knockout in Chicago. Berg also lost a 15-round decision for the world lightweight title to Canzoneri at the Polo Grounds on Sept. 10, 1931.
        His career ended in 1945 with a record of 157 victories in 192 fights, 57 of which he won by knockout.
