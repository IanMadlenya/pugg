        Hughes Rudd, a former television correspondent for CBS News and ABC News noted for his deft, sardonic touch, died yesterday in a hospital in Toulouse, France. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Rudd died of complications from an aneurysm of the aorta he suffered in August, said Tom Goodman, a spokesman for CBS News. Mr. Rudd had lived in Valence d'Albigeois, a village near Toulouse, since his retirement in 1986.
        Mr. Rudd worked for CBS News for two decades, reporting from around the world, including tours as a correspondent in Bonn, Berlin and Moscow. He was an anchor of the CBS Morning News program from 1973 to 1977.
        He was sent to Moscow in 1965. A 1966 article in Time magazine described him as a "dark, scowling observer" who "goes unhindered about his offbeat reporting." Mr. Rudd, it said, "concentrates on ordinary matters: synagogues and supermarkets, the horseradish gap." In that same year, George Plimpton called him "a wonderfully cynical student of human matters."  Honored for His Writing
        Mr. Rudd asked to be relieved of his CBS anchor duties in 1977, but continued to do features and humorous essays for the program until mid-1979 when he joined ABC News as a correspondent for "World News Tonight" and other ABC news programs.
        Mr. Rudd, a native of Waco, Tex., attended the University of Missouri from 1938 to 1941 before enlisting in the Army as an artillery spotter in Africa and Europe.
        Mr. Rudd's book, "My Escape From the C.I.A. and Other Improbable Events," was published in 1966 by E. P. Dutton & Company. The awards he won included a George Foster Peabody Award for his creative writing on the CBS Morning News in 1977.
        Mr. Rudd is survived by his wife, Ann; a son, Jon, of Bethesda, Md., and a grandson.
