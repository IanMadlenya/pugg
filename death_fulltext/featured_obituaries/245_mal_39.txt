        William C. Mercer, the former president and chairman of the New England Telephone Company, died on June 6 in Westwood, Mass. He was 88.
        The cause was heart failure, his son Robert said.
        Mr. Mercer started his career as an auditor and eventually climbed up the ranks to become president and chairman of the telephone company, New England's largest, which served 3.7 million customers at the time he retired.
        William Crawford Mercer was born on Jan. 13, 1919, in Philadelphia and grew up in New Jersey. He graduated from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College in 1940. He served in the Army Air Force for five years, rising to the rank of captain.
        In 1947, he joined the Bell System as an auditor. The company paid for Mr. Mercer to further his education as a Sloan fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he graduated with a master's degree in management in 1956.
        He held several positions in the company before becoming president in 1971.
        He served as a trustee of the Boston Museum of Science and of Colby-Sawyer College in New London, N.H., the alma mater of his wife, Ramona, who died in 2005, and was a director of the United Way of Massachusetts.
        Mr. Mercer, a strong advocate for women in the business world, was the first to appoint a woman to his company's board. He was later appointed by Presidents Nixon and Ford to serve on commissions studying women's issues.
        Mr. Mercer retired in 1982 after a federal antitrust ruling broke up AT&T, the parent company of New England Telephone.
        In addition to his son Robert, of Old Mystic, Conn., Mr. Mercer is survived by two other sons, Lee, of Arlington, Va., and John, of Barre, Vt.; a stepson, Raymond Ilg III, of Wilmot, N.H.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.
