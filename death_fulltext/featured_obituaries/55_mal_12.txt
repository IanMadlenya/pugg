        Mr. Waters was born in Leavenworth, Kans., and received the first graduate degree in musicology given by the Eastman School of Music in Rochester in 1928. Before his appointment to the Library of Congress in 1931, he was an organist and a teacher at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa.
        Mr. Waters was president of the Music Library Association, secretary of the American Musicological Society and president of the D.C. Library Association. In 1971 he was appointed to the editorial board of the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.
