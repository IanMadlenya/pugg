        Alfred L. Scheinberg, a private dealer in African art, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 43 years old.
        He died of brain cancer, said Walter Perini, his companion.
        Mr. Scheinberg sold African art to many prominent collectors and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Birmingham Museum of Art in Alabama. He was an adviser to the Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown University.
        Mr. Scheinberg, who was born in Baltimore, graduated from New College in Sarasota, Fla., and did graduate work in art history at Columbia University. In the 1970's he traveled widely in Africa, studying beadwork and sculpture.
        He is survived by his mother, Erma, and a sister, Diana Stanley, both of Baltimore.
