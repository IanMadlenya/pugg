        Edward Woods Doherty, a retired Foreign Service officer and foreign affairs adviser to the United States Catholic Conference, died on Friday at Washington Hospital Center. He was 77 years old and lived in West River, Md.
        His family said he died of a heart ailment.
        Mr. Doherty was born in St. Louis, worked as an investment counselor on Wall Street in the 1930's and was an economist for the Office of Price Administration before he joined the Navy in 1942. He saw action in the Atlantic and Pacific as a commissioned officer in World War II.
        Mr. Doherty joined the State Department as an economist after the war and became a Foreign Service officer in 1955. His postings included West Berlin, Tokyo and Seoul. He was a member of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff from 1966 to 1969, when he became consul general in Munich, a post he filled until his retirement in 1974.
        From then to 1986 he held the advisory position at the Catholic Conference, the social action arm of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, and wrote widely in Catholic publications.
        Mr. Doherty is survived by his wife of nearly 45 years, the former Georgie Hazard; a son, Christopher, of Munich; a daughter, Moira Doherty Ridenbaugh, of Tracys Landing, Md., and two grandsons.
