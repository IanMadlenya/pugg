        Raymond Field Kravis, a philanthropist and oil and gas consultant whose clients included Joseph P. Kennedy and Chase Bank, died on Monday at his home in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 92 and lived in Tulsa, Okla., and West Palm Beach.
        He died of natural causes, his family said.
        Mr. Kravis incorporated his business in 1962 after working as a freelance consultant and engineer for oil and gas companies. By the time he retired in 1987, he had built his company into a leading consulting and engineering firm. He was also an authority on mergers and acquisitions and estate evaluations.
        He was known for building his business in the late 1930's by pioneering the procedure under which oil and gas properties were purchased with a loan that was paid back with the proceeds of oil or gas produced from that property.
        He advised Mr. Kennedy, the father of President John F. and Robert F. Kennedy, on oil investments.
        Mr. Kravis was a board member of the St. John Medical Center Foundation of Tulsa and on the executive committee of the Boy Scouts of America. He was also a major benefactor of Lehigh University, where he received his engineering degree in 1924.
        A $52-million performance center named in his honor in West Palm Beach opened last year. The center was built with $16 million in public money and the rest from private contributions from Mr. Kravis's friends.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, the former Bessie Roberts; two sons, Henry R., of Manhattan, a principal of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, the leveraged-buyout firm, and George R., of Tulsa, owner of several radio stations, and two grandchildren.
