        Roger John Tayler, who helped advance modern understanding of stellar evolution and served for 18 years as secretary, treasurer and finally president of the Royal Astronomical Society in Britain, died on Jan. 23 in a London hospital. He was 67 and lived in Lewes, England.
        The cause was cancer, the society said.
        Dr. Tayler was a leading investigator of stars, following up on the pioneering work of Sir Fred Hoyle of Britain and Martin Schwarzschild of Princeton University. His contributions furthered the knowledge of stellar structures, plasma stability, nucleogenesis and cosmology.
        Besides many scientific articles, he wrote and edited textbooks used by students worldwide. His recent works included ''The Sun as a Star'' (1996), ''The Hidden Universe'' (1995), ''The Structure and Evolution of Galaxies'' (second edition, 1993) and ''Stellar Astrophysics'' (1992).
        Also still in print are ''The Stars: Their Structure and Evolution'' (second edition, 1994) and ''The Origin of the Chemical Elements'' (1977).
        Dr. Tayler was educated at Clare College, Cambridge, where he received his master's and Ph.D. degrees. He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Moya Elizabeth Fry Tayler, and a brother, Judge Harold Clive Tayler of Tamworth, England.
