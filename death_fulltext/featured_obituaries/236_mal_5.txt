        Roy Tobias, a ballet dancer known for his large repertory at the New York City Ballet and an internationally known teacher, died on Aug. 16 in Seoul, South Korea. He was 78.
        Mr. Tobias, who had had a chronic condition for 13 years that made it difficult for him to eat, died in the hospital after collapsing at home, according to In-hee Kim, director of the Seoul Ballet Theater, where Mr. Tobias worked through 2003.
        Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Tobias joined Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) at 16, two years after he had begun training in ballet with Catherine Littlefield and other teachers. He performed there from 1944 to 1946 and then danced in Broadway musicals, including ''High Button Shoes'' and ''Carousel.''
        After a season performing in Paris with the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas, he returned to New York for additional training, at the School of American Ballet. He performed with the Ballet Society, a precursor to the New York City Ballet, with which he danced from 1950 to 1960.
        At City Ballet, he became a leading soloist, originating roles in ballets that included George Balanchine's ''Agon,'' ''Nutcracker'' and ''Divertimento No. 15,'' Jerome Robbins's ''Fanfare'' and Todd Bolender's ''The Still Point.''
        Mr. Tobias taught ballet in Japan from 1961 to 1963. He returned there periodically to work with various companies there into the 1980's, when he relocated to Korea to live full time.
        After settling there, he worked with the Korean National Ballet Company, Universal Ballet and Seoul Ballet Theater, three of South Korea's major companies.
        He helped to establish ballet in Korea as a teacher and choreographer of many ballets, including ''Coppélia,'' ''La Fille Mal Gardée'' and ''The Nutcracker.''
        Mr. Tobias is survived by his companion, Jae-Soo Lee, of Seoul.
