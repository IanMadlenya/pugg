        Dr. Richard B. Wearn, a retired chemical researcher and former executive of the Colgate-Palmolive Company in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at the South Carolina Episcopal Home in West Columbia, S.C. He was 77.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said Anne Crawford, a spokeswoman for Colgate-Palmolive.
        Dr. Wearn worked for Colgate-Palmolive for 30 years before retiring in 1978 as the vice president for research and development of Colgate-Palmolive International. He was a longtime resident of Short Hills, N.J.
        He graduated from Clemson University, receiving a doctorate from the University of Illinois, and served as a captain in the Army Chemical Corps during World War II.
        Dr. Wearn is survived by his wife, Edith; a brother, Wilson C., of Greenville, S.C.; five children, Dr. Richard B. Jr., of Seattle, Dr. Frederick G., of Portland, Ore., George F., of Graham, Wash., Mary W. Wiener of Short Hills, N .J., and Dolly Higgins of Lake Forest, Ill., and 10 grandchildren.
