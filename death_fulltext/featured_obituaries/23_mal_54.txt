        John Canning, a managing editor of the New York Post since 1980, died suddenly yesterday while on vacation in Ixtapa, Mexico. He was 56 years old and lived in Guttenberg, N.J.
        Mr. Canning, whose newspaper career spanned 35 years, was one of the newspaper's two managing editors. He was in charge of the front page, responsible both for story selection and design.
        Eric Fettmann, an assistant city editor, said the cause of death remained undetermined, pending an autopsy. He quoted a report from friends that Mr. Canning suffered a heart attack in his hotel room, followed by complications from a bleeding ulcer.
        Mr. Canning was at work until last Monday. He then went on vacation with his wife, Odette, and another couple.
        ''John Canning was a great editor and beloved friend to all of us,'' Jane Amsterdam, the Post's editor, said last night in a statement. ''His contribution to this paper was enormous. John's intelligence and wit were displayed to our readers each day on the front page.''
        Mr. Canning went into journalism in his native New Zealand. He moved to Australia in 1955 to work for The Sydney Sun but returned home to become the founding editor of the New Zealand Sunday News, the country's first Sunday paper.
        Returning to Australia in the 1960's, Mr. Canning joined Rupert Murdoch's Sydney Daily Mirror. He was named editor of the paper in 1978, but he was transferred to New York to work for Mr. Murdoch's newspapers.
        Before taking the managing editor's job at the Post in 1980, he held the same position at the weekly tabloid The Star.
        In addition to his wife, his survivors include a son by a previous marriage, Simon, a journalist in Melbourne, Australia.
