        Rubin Blanck, an author and theorist in the field of ego psychology, died on Wednesday in Durham, N.C., where he had lived for the last two years. He was 81.
        The cause was cancer, said Pam Rhodes, assistant manager at the Cape Fear Crematory in Fayetteville, N.C.
        Mr. Blanck, a retired psychoanalyst, had practiced in New York City for 45 years. He championed ego psychology, in which great weight is placed on ego processes such as reality perception, conscious learning and voluntary control in techniques of psychotherapy. .
        With his wife, Gertrude, he wrote textbooks that have been widely used to train psychoanalysts and psychotherapists and have been translated into nine languages. In 1961, he and his wife founded the Institute for the Study of Psychotherapy in New York City, where they trained hundreds of psychotherapists.
        Mr. Blanck was a visiting professor at New York University and the Smith College School for Social Work. He often lectured in the United States, Europe and East Asia.
        Mr. Blanck graduated from St. Lawrence University with law degrees. But after serving in World War II, he became interested in psychoanalysis, specializing in clinical practice at the Columbia University School of Social Work.
        In addition to his wife of 55 years, he is survived by a daughter, Dr. Susan A. Franzen, and two grandsons.
