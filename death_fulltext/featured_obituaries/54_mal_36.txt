        Frank H. Ilchuk, a choral conductor and music educator, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife, Grace Cohen Ilchuk, said.
        For 50 years Mr. Ilchuk was the conductor of the Ukrainian Leontovich Folk Chorus, which, under his direction, appeared at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall and Madison Square Garden. He also served as president of the Ukrainian American League and the Ukrainian section of the International Workers Organization and was editor of the English edition of The Ukrainian Daily News.
        Born in the southwestern Ukraine, Mr. Ilchuk came to the United States in 1912. Before moving to New York in 1934, he was a violinist with the Detroit Symphony. He was a founder and director of the Downtown Music School, which later became the Metropolitan School of Music, and also taught at the Little Red School House/Elizabeth Irwin High School in Greenwich Village.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, David and Daniel, a grandson, Brandon, and a brother, Walter, all of New York City.
