        Alfred Frauenknecht, a Swiss engineer found guilty in 1971 of selling Mirage jet-engine secrets to Israel, has died at the age of 64, his family said today.
        They said he succumbed to a heart attack on Jan. 8.
        Mr. Frauenknecht was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison by the Supreme Court in what was then Switzerland's biggest spy trial since World War II. At his trial, Mr. Frauenknecht, who was not Jewish, said he felt morally obliged to help the Jewish people after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
