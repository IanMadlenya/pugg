        Mohammed Dib, an award-winning Algerian novelist and poet who wrote in French, the language in which he had learned to read as a child, died on Friday at his home outside Paris. He was 82.
        He had suffered from diabetes, Le Monde reported in Paris.
        Mr. Dib moved from Algeria to France in 1959. His 1952 novel, ''The Big House,'' about rural Algeria in the late 1930's, was part of a trilogy that included ''L'Incendie'' (''The Fire''), in 1954, and ''Le Métier à Tisser'' (''The Loom''), in 1957. The trilogy became the best known of his more than 20 works. Much of his poetry was in short unrhymed lines.
        He was born on July 21, 1920, in Tlemcen, in northwestern Algeria, where his father enrolled him in a French school. In 1994 he received the Francophone Grand Prix, the highest literary prize awarded by the Académie Française.
