        James Daniel Blanc, a modern dancer who performed with Pilobolus and other troupes, died on May 11 at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 36.
        The cause was AIDS, said a friend, Peter Pucci.
        Mr. Blanc was born in Jefferson City, Tenn. He began his dance training at Texas Christian University. In New York, he studied on scholarship at the Merce  Cunningham Dance Studio and performed with several small groups before joining Pilobolus, where he performed from 1987 to 1989.
        He also danced with the Jacob's Pillow Men Dancers company and with Peter Pucci Plus Dancers, performing a duet with Mr. Pucci at the Serious Fun Festival in 1990.
        He is survived by his companion, Leo Vigil of Fort Lauderdale; his parents, Henry and Betty Gay Blanc of Jefferson City, and three sisters, Linda Gay Blanc, also of Jefferson City, Nancy Dalton of New Market, Tenn., and Jenny Malone of Wingate, N.C.
