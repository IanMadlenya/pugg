        Lt. Gen. Timothy L. Maude, the Army's deputy chief of staff for personnel, died on Sept. 11 in the attack on the Pentagon, the Department of Defense confirmed yesterday. He was 53 and lived in Fort Meyer, Va.
        General Maude was appointed to the position and promoted to his current rank in May 2000. His chief focus recently was improving recruitment, which began to lag in the 1990's.
        Early this month, he reported that the new ''Army of One'' recruiting campaign, which began in January with major advertising on television and on the Internet, was succeeding in drawing young people to military service.
        On Sept. 4 the Army announced that it had attained its recruiting goals for active-duty Army personnel ahead of schedule and that the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard would fulfill their recruiting targets by the end of the month.
        General Maude was born in Indianapolis, attended the Latin School, a seminary high school there, and was a graduate of Ball State University in Muncie, Ind. He went through officer candidate school in the Army, was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1967 and started out as a postal officer.
        He served a year in Vietnam and won the Bronze Star. His later duties involved personnel matters in Germany, South Korea and the United States.
        He is survived by his wife and two daughters.
