        Emmanuel Jacquin de Margerie, a former French Ambassador to the United States and national museum administrator, died on Monday in Paris. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. de Margerie was posted in Washington from 1984 to 1989. He was Ambassador to Britain from 1981 to 1984 and Ambassador to Spain from 1977 to 1981.
        In all three countries, he had a larger presence in diplomatic circles than France's economic or military standing might have normally commanded. Mr. de Margerie was known for making good use of all the tools of the diplomatic trade, entertaining elegantly, networking brilliantly and talking persuasively. Involved in Musee d'Orsay
        But even on the diplomatic circuit, he loved to talk about his non-diplomatic job, as the head of France's national museum administration from 1975 to 1977, not least because the post came with an apartment in the Louvre. He was involved in the creation of the Musee d'Orsay, a museum devoted to 19th-century art that opened in 1986 in a restored railroad station in Paris.
        He was appointed to the board of Christie's International and named chairman of Christie's in Europe last year, and had recently been appointed president of the World Monument Fund in France.
        Born on Dec. 25, 1924, Mr. de Margerie was the son of an Ambassador and the grand-nephew of the poet and playwright Edmond Rostand. He attended the French Jesuit University in Shanghai and the Sorbonne, and received a degree in law and a diploma from the Institut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris.
        After graduating from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration in 1951, he joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was an embassy secretary in London from 1954 to 1959, first secretary in Moscow from 1959 to 1961 and was the under secretary for East European Affairs, a post he held until he was named minister to Tokyo in 1967.
        In 1972 he was named to head the Department of European Affairs, a rank equivalent to an Assistant Secretary in the State Department.
        He is survived by his wife, Helene; a son, Gilles, and a daughter, Laure.
