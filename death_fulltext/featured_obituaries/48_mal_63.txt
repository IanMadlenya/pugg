        Alan Wiggins, a once promising major league baseball player who undermined his career with drugs, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Sunday night. He was 32 years old.
        Tony Attanasio, his agent during his playing days, said that Mr. Wiggins died from tuberculosis. He was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia on Nov. 29, said Ron Wise, a hospital spokesman.
        An outfielder and second baseman, he played in the major leagues from 1981 through 1987, with the San Diego Padres and the Baltimore Orioles. He finished his career with a .259 batting average and 242 stolen bases.
        Mr. Wiggins underwent drug rehabilitation three times and was suspended indefinitely on Aug. 31, 1987.
        He is survived by his wife, Angie, two daughters and a son.
