        Anna Carter Gordon Davis, a gospel music pioneer as a member of the Chuck Wagon Gang and the widow of Gov. Jimmie Davis of Louisiana, died on March 5 in Fort Worth. She was 87 and lived in Fort Worth.
        The cause was acute respiratory failure, her son William Gordon told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
        Governor and Mrs. Davis, who were married from 1969 until his death in 2000 at the age of 101, were one of music's more remarkable husband-and-wife pairs.
        He wrote ''You Are My Sunshine,'' had five Top Five country singles during his first term as Louisiana's governor from 1944 to 1948, served as governor again from 1960 to 1964, and was voted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1972. Mrs. Davis's pure alto was an essential part of the uplifting sound of the Chuck Wagon Gang, which was formed in 1936, spent over 40 years on Columbia Records, sold more than 30 million records, and was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in 1999.
        She was born Anna Carter on Feb. 15, 1917, in Shannon, Tex. The severe case of pneumonia she had in the mid-1930's prompted her father, David Parker Carter, known as Dad, to induce a Lubbock radio station to hire his family quartet, so he could afford Anna's medicine. When she recovered, she joined the ensemble. In 1936 they were hired by WBAP in Fort Worth for a daily 15-minute radio show, adopted the name the Chuck Wagon Gang and were huge radio and recording stars for the next 15 years.
        For gospel fans, their appeal has never faded: more than 50 years after the act formed, the Chuck Wagon Gang was named Gospel Group of the Year five straight times by Music City News in the late 1980's.
        Her first husband, Howard Gordon, was the band's electric guitarist from the 1950's until he died in 1967.
        In addition to her son William, Mrs. Davis is survived by another son, Greg Gordon; her daughter, Vicki Owens; a brother, Clyde Carter; her sisters Bettye Goodwin, Ruth Ellen Yates and Anne Everett; and nine grandchildren.
