        Andrei A. Gromyko, the former Foreign Minister whose enigmatic scowl was the face of Soviet foreign policy for most of the postwar period, died on Sunday, two weeks short of his 80th birthday.
        President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced the news this morning to the Supreme Soviet, a few days after the press agency Tass reported that Mr. Gromyko had undergone surgery after ''a fit of vascular pathology,'' apparently a stroke.
        Beginning with his assignment to Washington as a junior diplomat in 1939, Mr. Gromyko served every Soviet leader except Lenin, and conferred with every American President from Franklin D. Roosevelt on.
        He was Foreign Minister for 28 years. He weathered five changes of power in the Kremlin, but was edged gracefully from the stage by age and by Mr. Gorbachev's preference for a younger generation of leaders and a new doctrine of international relations.
        Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told reporters that Mr. Gromyko would be buried Wednesday afternoon at Novodevichy Cemetery. He said President Gorbachev would miss the funeral rather than delay his departure Tuesday for Paris, where he is to meet with President Francois Mitterrand.
        Mr. Gorbachev paid his respects to Mr. Gromyko today in words that were proper but uneffusive.
        ''All his life was connected with history, with our achievements, with our problems, with everything that falls on the shoulders of a man who is in the thick of events for the course of decades,'' he told the Supreme Soviet.  Obituary, page 8.
