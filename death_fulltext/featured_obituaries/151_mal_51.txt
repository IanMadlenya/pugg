        Dr. Sidney Q. Cohlan, a New York pediatrician long affiliated with the New York University School of Medicine, died Thursday at the university's Tisch Hospital. He was 84 and lived in Manhattan, Ocean Beach, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.
        Dr. Cohlan retired in 1990 from private practice and as a professor of pediatrics at what is now Tisch Hospital. He was a past chief of its Department of Pediatrics.
        Among Dr. Cohlan's scientific achievements was the discovery in the early 1950's of the birth-deforming effects of an excess of vitamin A in a pregnant woman's diet. His curiosity was piqued by previous research on the need for the vitamin in the regimen.
        He demonstrated that an overdose of it led to deformities in newborns and, published his findings in the journal Science in 1953. He also did work on the impact of the broad-spectrum antibiotic tetracycline on developing bones and teeth, and provided insights into the effects of nutritional deficiencies in young children.
        Dr. Cohlan, who was born in Brooklyn to immigrant parents, graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935 and from New York Medical College four years later. He spent World War II with the Army Medical Corps in Europe and finished his residency at Beth Israel Hospital, where he served as a research fellow from 1947 to 1950.
        Dr. Cohlan is survived by his wife of 49 years, Dr. Shirley Stone; two daughters, Dr. Barbara Cohlan Perlmutter of St. Louis and Deborah Cohlan of Manhattan; a son, John L., of Palm Beach, Fla.; two brothers, Harold and Irving Cohen, both of Los Angeles, and three grandchildren.
