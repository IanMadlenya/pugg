        Dr. Paul Kirkpatrick, a developer of the X-ray reflection microscope and a retired professor at Stanford University, died Saturday at his home in Palo Alto, Calif. He was 98.
        He died of natural causes, said Joel Shurkin, a spokesman for Stanford.
        In 1948 Dr. Kirkpatrick and his graduate student Albert Baez developed the X-ray reflection microscope, which could examine living cells. The imaging technique is still used, particularly in astronomy to take X-ray pictures of galaxies and in medicine, Mr. Shurkin said.
        Dr. Kirkpatrick was born near Wessington, S.D., and earned a bachelor's degree from Occidental College in Los Angeles in 1916. He earned his doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley in 1923. Before joining the Stanford faculty in 1931, he taught at the University of Hawaii and pursued research at Cornell University.
        Dr. Kirkpatrick is survived by his wife, Mary Rose; two daughters, Pauline Abbe of Santa Barbara, Calif., and Nancy Morrell of Brunswick, Me.; nine grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.
