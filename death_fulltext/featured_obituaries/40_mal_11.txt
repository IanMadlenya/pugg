        No other vehicle was involved in the crash on the M4 highway in Berkshire, west of London, the Thames Valley police said. Three other people in the car were injured, including Mr. Fuller's wife, Stephanie, and his 3-year-old son, Laurence, the police said.
        Last year Mr. Fuller was appointed art critic of The Sunday Telegraph, which carried his final review on Sunday. In 1987, Mr. Fuller founded and edited the quarterly Modern Painters, principally to bring attention to British artists.
