        Leo Lowenthal, a retired professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley who analyzed the role of literature in society, died Thursday at Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley. He was 92 and lived in Berkeley.
        He died of pneumonia, colleagues at Berkeley said.
        Reviewing his book "Literature and the Image of Man" (Beacon, 1957) in The New York Times Book Review, the sociologist C. Wright Mills wrote that Professor Lowenthal made "wonderfully evident" the images of man and society as portrayed by writers like Shakespeare, Cervantes and Ibsen.
        Mr. Lowenthal was born in Frankfurt, Germany andreceived his Ph.D. at the University of Frankfurt.
        His first marriage, to Golda Ginsburg, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Marjorie Fiske. He is survived by his third wife, the former Susanne Hoppmann, to whom he was married in 1977; a son from his first marriage, Daniel, of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Francesca Liecty Viarnes of San Francisco, and four grandchildren.
