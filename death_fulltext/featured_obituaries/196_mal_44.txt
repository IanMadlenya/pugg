        Israel E. Levine, a former public-relations director at City College and the American Jewish Congress and the author of many biographies for young readers, died on May 10 in Queens. He was 79 and lived in Flushing.
        The cause was complications after vascular surgery, his family said.
        A Brooklyn native who became a decorated airman in World War II, Mr. Levine graduated from City College in 1946 and joined its public affairs office. He was director from 1954 to 1977 and during that time also edited the alumni magazine.
        He later edited Health Care Week magazine, worked in public relations, and in the 1980's was the Jewish Congress's communications director. Recently he had his own firm, I. E. Levine Public Relations.
        From the 1950's to the 1970's, he wrote children's nonfiction and magazine articles as well as a dozen biographies for teenage readers.
        Mr. Levine is survived by his wife of 56 years, Joy Michael Levine; a son, David, of Jackson Heights, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Goldberg of Roslyn, N.Y; two grandchildren; and a great-grandson.
