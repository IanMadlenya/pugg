        Dale Earnhardt Sr., stock car racing's greatest star, died yesterday in a crash on the last lap of the Daytona 500, Nascar's premier event and its season opener. Earnhardt, 49 years old, was locked in a battle for third place when his Chevrolet grazed another car and hit a concrete wall. He was cut from his battered car and pronounced dead of head injuries at a hospital. Earnhardt's teammate Michael Waltrip won the race, and his son, Dale Jr., was second.
