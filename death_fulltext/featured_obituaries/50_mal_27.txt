        Howard Head, the inventor of the Head metal ski and the Prince tennis racket, died yesterday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. He was 76 years old and lived in Baltimore and Vail, Colo.
        A family spokesman said Mr. Head died of complications following heart surgery.
        A native of Philadelphia, Mr. Head graduated from Harvard in 1936 with a degree in engineering sciences. He moved to Baltimore in the early 1940's and went to work as an aircraft engineer for the Glenn L. Martin Company, which designed and built planes during World War II.
        When he first skied in 1947, he was frustrated by his heavy wooden skis and became convinced that he could build a better ski out of lightweight aircraft materials.
        The following year he formed the Head Ski Company and developed the aluminum sandwich ski. Head skis began winning wide public acceptance, and the skiers using them won medals -- the first at the 1964 Winter Olympics. Broader Tennis Racket
        In 1971 he sold the company to AMF and took up a new pursuit, tennis, and the quest for a better tennis racket. The result was a patent for a broader racket. With four times the effective hitting surface of traditional rackets, the new design soon proved popular.
        Mr. Head retired again in 1982 when he sold Prince Manufacturing to Chesebrough Pond's.
        He was noted in recent years for his philanthropy. Center Stage in Baltimore recently dedicated the Head Theater, named for the inventor and his wife, Martha, as a tribute to their many years of support.
        Besides his wife, Mr. Head is survived by a daughter, Nancy Thode of Greenwich, Conn; a sister, Jean Cooper of Boerne, Tex.; three stepdaughters, Lynn Fritzlen of Vail, Guerin Olsen of Darien, Conn, and Marla Croke of Telluride, Colo., and five grandchildren.
