        Mel Harder, the Cleveland Indians right-hander who was among the top pitchers of the 1930's and later became a renowned pitching coach in a major league career spanning 42 seasons, died yesterday at his home in Chardon, Ohio. He was 93.
        When the Indians played their first game at Municipal Stadium, on July 31, 1932, Harder faced Lefty Grove, losing to the Philadelphia Athletics, 1-0, before a crowd of 80,285. When the Indians played their last game at the stadium, on Oct. 3, 1993, Harder threw the ceremonial final pitch. By then, Harder's No. 18 had been retired by the Indians, whose uniform he wore for 36 seasons.
        Spending his entire 20-year pitching career -- 1928 to 1947 -- with the Indians, Harder had two 20-victory seasons and a record of 223-186. Only Bob Feller won more games (266) for the Indians and only Walter Johnson of the Senators pitched more consecutive seasons (21) for one team. (Ted Lyons's entire 21-year pitching career was with the Chicago White Sox, but it was interrupted by World War II service.)
        Pitching in four consecutive All-Star Games, from 1934 to 1937, Harder threw 13 scoreless innings.
        As the Indians' pitching coach from 1948 to 1963, Harder oversaw staffs that included the Hall of Famers Feller, Early Wynn and Bob Lemon, along with Mike Garcia and Herb Score.
        He never pitched on a pennant-winner but was the pitching coach for Indians teams that won the World Series in 1948 and a pennant in 1954, when Cleveland set an American League record for victories with 111.
        Melvin Leroy Harder was born in Beemer, Neb., on Oct. 15, 1909, and grew up in Omaha.
        By 1930, Harder was a starting pitcher for Cleveland, and four years later he was named to the American League All-Star team in a season when he had a 20-12 record and led the league in shutouts with six.
        The 1934 All-Star Game at the Polo Grounds is best remembered for Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants having struck out five straight Hall of Famers -- Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin -- in the first two innings. But the winning pitcher was Harder, who shut out the National League over the last five innings on one hit.
        In the 1935 All-Star Game in Cleveland, Harder pitched three scoreless innings and again yielded one hit.
        Harder's performance against the Yankees on May 14, 1941, provided a footnote to baseball history. That afternoon at Yankee Stadium, he stopped Joe DiMaggio, who went 0 for 3 with a walk in Cleveland's 4-1 victory. The next day, DiMaggio began his 56-game hitting streak.
        As a coach, Harder molded Indians staffs that produced seven pitchers who won at least 20 games in a season, and he later served as a pitching coach with the Mets, the Chicago Cubs, the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals before retiring at the end of the 1969 season.
        He is survived by a daughter, Penny Burns, of Little Torch Key, Fla.; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. His wife, Sandy, died in 1989.
        When Harder was dismissed by the Cleveland general manager, Gabe Paul, after the 1963 season, he was replaced by Wynn, who had won his 300th and final game that year.
        It was a case of the protégé taking over from the teacher. But Wynn paid tribute to the man who put him on the path to the Hall of Fame. As he once put it, ''Mel Harder made me a pitcher.''
