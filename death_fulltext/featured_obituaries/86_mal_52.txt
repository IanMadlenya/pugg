        Vincent Spagna, a painter, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 96.
        He died after a long illness, family members said.
        Mr. Spagna was born in Sicily in 1897 and moved to the United States in 1911. His family settled in Hartford, where he studied at the Connecticut League of Art Students. He had several exhibitions at the Midtown Galleries in the 1940's. In 1944, his landscape "New England Barn" won a prize in the "Portrait of America" competition sponsored by Pepsico. His work is in the collections of the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Mass., and I.B.M.
        He is survived by his wife, Belle, and a sister, Josephine Riccio.
