        John H. Calhoun, a civil rights leader in the South whose activism dated to the 1940's, died of respiratory failure in his sleep Friday at his home in Atlanta. He was 88 years old. Mr. Calhoun, who was an Atlanta City Councilman from 1974 until 1978, devoted most of his political energies to grass-roots organization among black people. To support himself and his family he held a variety of jobs, from janitor, dock worker and headwaiter to hospital administrator, insurance salesman and real estate broker. But his passion was politics.
        A native of Greenville, S.C., he was apprenticed at the age of 12 to a blacksmith, earning 50 cents a week in the school year. He was 23 years old by the time he graduated from high school at Hampton Institute in Virginia.
        His first civil rights activity came in 1940 when he and seveal others formed the Atlanta Negro Voters League at a time when few blacks were permitted to vote. He was also active in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and in 1956 became president of its Atlanta branch. In that capacity he initiated a number of lawsuits to broaden the rights of blacks, including one to desegregate the city's parks and golf courses.
        As a member of the City Council he set up neighborhood planning units, which in time became a strong political base and helped many blacks achieve public office.
        Mr. Calhoun leaves a son, Lieut. Col. John H. Calhoun 3d of Stone Mountain, Ga.; a daughter, Ninaking Anderson of Atlanta, a sister, Phyllis Wright of Cincinnati, and two grandchildren.
