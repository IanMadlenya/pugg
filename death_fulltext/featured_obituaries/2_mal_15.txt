        Louis P. Hammett, a retired Columbia University chemistry professor whose contributions to modern physical organic chemistry brought national recognition, died Feb. 23 at the Medford Leas retirement community in Medford, N.J. He was 92 years old.
        Dr. Hammett was the Mitchill Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at Columbia, where he joined in 1923 and retired in 1961.
        In 1961, Dr. Hammett received the Willard Gibbs Medal of the American Chemical Society for his contributions to modern physical organic chemistry and for his record as a teacher, administrator and researcher. In 1967, he was a recipient of the National Medal of Science, the nation's highest award for scientific achievement, from President Lyndon B. Johnson.
        Through Dr. Hammett's research, scientists now are able to mathematically predict the results of many chemical reactions that had previously been unclear. He also wrote ''Physical Organic Chemistry,'' ''Solutions of Electrolytes'' and ''Introduction to the Study of Physical Chemistry.''
        Dr. Hammett, who served four years as a rocket propellant researcher for the Government during World War II, was born in Wilmington, Del. He grew up in Portland, Me., and was a graduate of Harvard University. He received his doctorate from Columbia.
        He is survived by his wife, Janet Thorpe Marriner; a daughter, Jane Zwemer, of Kensington, Md.; a son, Philip, of Philadelphia; a sister, Helen H. Owen, of Friendship, Me., seven grandchildren and six great-granchildren.
