        Franklin Patterson, the first president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., died on Wednesday at his home in Framingham, Mass. He was 77.
        He died of natural causes, his family said.
        Dr. Patterson was president of the college from 1966 until 1971. Hampshire did not enroll its first students until 1970, and Dr. Patterson's tenure was largely devoted to supervising construction, hiring and fund-raising in preparation for the college's opening.
        From 1971 to 1976, he was chairman of the board of the college, which was founded as a center for educational innovation by its academic neighbors in central Massachusetts -- Amherst College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College and the University of Massachusetts.
        A longtime teacher of political science and government, he was a professor at UMass from 1971 into the 1980's. He was also secretary to the university board in 1973-74 and interim president of the university in 1977-78.
        He was born in Ellsworth, Iowa, and received his bachelor's degree from Occidental College, his master's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles and his doctorate from the Claremont Graduate School, in Claremont, Calif.
        His marriage in 1937 to the former Jessamy Longacre ended in divorce, as did his 1972 marriage to Emily Goldblatt.
        He is survived by his companion, Harriet Wittenborg; two children from his first marriage, a daughter, Shelley Katherine, of Cambridge, Mass., and a son, Eric, of Ithaca, N.Y.; and a son from his second marriage, Nicholas, of Boston.
