        Leslie John Adkins, a Congregational minister and a psychologist, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia, said his son Winthrop.
        Dr. Adkins graduated from Cambridge University and studied for the ministry at the Hartford Theological Seminary. After serving 10 years as a missionary in the Middle East, he was pastor at the Old South Church in Boston, the Second Congregational Church in North Beverly, Mass., and the West Andover Congregational Church in Andover, Mass. In 1949, he left the ministry and earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Teachers College and took further psychological training at the William Alanson White Institute.
        Over the next four decades he worked to integrate religion and psychotherapy. He wrote many articles and had just completed a book, "The Independent Self: Freedom and Determination in Science and Religion."
        In addition to Winthrop, of Greenwich, Conn., he is survived by his wife, Beatrice; a daughter, Sarah Ann Macfarlane of Kensington, Conn.; another son Douglas, of Washington; eight grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
