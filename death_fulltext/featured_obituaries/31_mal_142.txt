        Dr. Raymond Harris, founder and first president of the Council on Geriatric Cardiology, died of stomach and liver cancer yesterday at his home in Albany. He was 70 years old.
        Dr. Harris founded the Council on Geriatric Cardiology, a national organization, in 1986. At his death, he was a medical consultant to the New York State Department of Mental Health.
        Dr. Harris was among the first doctors to recognize that differences existed between the hearts of young adults and the elderly and to view geriatrics as a legitimate field, like pediatrics.
        He was chief of cardiology at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany from 1951 to 1986.
        He wrote several books on cardiology and geriatrics and was the editor of The Journal of the American College of Cardiology and of Geriatric Medicine Today.
        Dr. Harris was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Cornell University and Albany Medical College.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sara Richman, director of the Center for the Study of Aging; two daughters, Anita M. Harris of Cambridge, Mass., and Laura Hirsch of Lebanon, N.H.; two sons, Dr. Jonathan O., of Rockville, Md., and Alan M., of Albany, and five grandchildren.
