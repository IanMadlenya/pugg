        Christopher R. Sergel, the president of the Dramatic Publishing Company and a Broadway playwright, died on Friday at his home in Wilton, Conn. He was 75.
        The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Gayle.
        Mr. Sergel wrote more than a dozen plays, the best known of which were his adaptations of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" and Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio." In 1981, he wrote an adaptation of "Black Elk Speaks."
        Mr. Sergel worked on "Winesburg, Ohio" in his father's home, where Anderson had often been a guest. "I could hear Anderson's voice as I wrote this play," he said.
        Mr. Sergel was born in Iowa City in 1918, and graduated from the University of Chicago. He was an adventurer and a sportsman, and spent two years as the captain of a schooner in the South Pacific; he later lived for a year in the African bush while writing for Sports Afield magazine.
        During World War II, he served as a lieutenant commander in the merchant marine, where he taught celestial navigation. His chief interests, however, were writing plays and managing the play-publishing company founded in 1885 by his great-uncle, Charles Sergel.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Sergel is survived by five children from previous marriages: Christopher T. Sergel of Woodstock, Ill.; Andrea Summer of Ukiah, Calif.; Ingrid Cooperman of North Pownal, Vt.; Ruth Sergel of Brooklyn, and Kathryn Sergel of Boston. He had seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
