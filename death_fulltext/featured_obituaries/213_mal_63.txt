        Edward T. Cone, a musicologist, composer and pianist associated with Princeton University for many years, died on Saturday in Princeton, N.J. He was 87 and lived in Princeton.
        The cause was complications of open-heart surgery he had last month, his companion, George Pitcher, said.
        A member of the Princeton faculty from 1946 until his retirement in 1985, Mr. Cone taught music theory, history and composition. He was best known for two books about Western music, ''Musical Form and Musical Performance'' (W.W. Norton, 1968) and ''The Composer's Voice'' (University of California, 1974), which received an Ascap-Deems Taylor Award in 1975.
        ''The range of his writings, I think, reflects the range of his music,'' the composer Milton Babbitt, a longtime Princeton colleague, said in an interview. ''Not in any sense that it's a mixture of styles, but rather that it reflects all that he learned and assimilated.'' Mr. Cone's style, he added, ''can't be characterized, because really it cannot be compared with any other music.''
        Mr. Cone's compositions include works for solo piano, chamber music, a symphony and settings of poems by Paul Muldoon. Reviewing a performance of his string sextet in The Times in 1975, Peter G. Davis called it ''a skillful, frequently moving piece.''
        Edward Toner Cone was born on May 4, 1917, in Greensboro, N.C. In 1939 he received a bachelor's degree from Princeton, where he was a student of Roger Sessions. (Mr. Cone was the first undergraduate to be allowed to submit a musical composition -- a four-movement string quartet -- as his senior thesis.) He earned a master of fine arts degree from the university in 1942.
        Mr. Pitcher, his partner of nearly 48 years, is Mr. Cone's only immediate survivor.
