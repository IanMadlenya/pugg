        Princess Fatemeh Pahlevi, half sister of the Shah of Iran, has died in London, the Daily Telegraph reported today. She was 58 years old.
        The report did not give the cause of death or say when she died. She lived in London in recent years.
        The princess was estranged from the Shah, who died in exile in Egypt in 1980, for some time because of her marriage in April 1950 to an American, Vincent Lee Hillyer. The couple married in a civil ceremony in Italy. A month later they were married in a Moslem ceremony in Paris.
        Her husband converted to Islam and added Ali to his name. They had three children, one of whom, Rana, was killed in an accidental fall in 1954.
        The princess's first marriage ended in divorce in 1959. The same year, she married Iran's Air Force commander, Gen. Mohammed Khatami, and they had two sons. The general was killed in a flying accident in 1975.
        The princess was born in Teheran on Oct. 30, 1928, the youngest child of Reza Shah, an army officer, and his fourth wife. Reza Shah seized power in a coup in 1921. He was proclaimed Shah of Persia in 1925; the country's name was officially changed to Iran in 1935.
        He was succeeded by his son, Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution.
        The Daily Telegraph said the princess is survived by four sons.
