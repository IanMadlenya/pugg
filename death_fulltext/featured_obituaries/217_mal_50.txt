        Daniel Goodwin, a director of the Smithsonian Institution Press in the 1990's, died on Feb. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 57.
        The cause was cancer, his wife, Andrea Meditch, said.
        Mr. Goodwin, who joined the press in the mid-1980's as an acquisitions editor for anthropology and archaeology, was responsible for developing the Smithsonian Series in Ethnographic Inquiry, which now includes more than 40 titles, and the Smithsonian Series in Archaeological Inquiry, which has more than 20. He was the director of the press from 1995 to 1998.
        He received a bachelor's degree from Antioch College and a master's in anthropology from the University of Texas.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Alexandra, and a sister, Jane Duel of Cooperstown.
