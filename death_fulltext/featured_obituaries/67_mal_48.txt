        John Gutman, a former assistant manager of the Metropolitan Opera, died last Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. He was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of an abdominal disorder, said a nephew, Steven Allister.
        Mr. Gutman was one of four assistant managers of the Metropolitan Opera during the tenure of Rudolph Bing, the general manager from 1950 to 1972. He was in charge of the Metropolitan's national auditions and for several years of the company's ballet corps.
        Mr. Gutman established the Metropolitan Opera Studio, which developed many young singers for the Met and other opera companies around the world. He also translated many operas into English.
        After his retirement from the Metropolitan Opera in 1972, he opened a booking office that packaged concert versions of operas.
        A native of Nuremberg, Mr. Gutman fled Germany in 1933 for France and then England, where he and Mr. Bing first met. In 1938 Mr. Gutman and his wife, Hedy, immigrated to the United States.
        He is survived by his wife and by a sister, Hilde Rea of Minchinhampton, England.
