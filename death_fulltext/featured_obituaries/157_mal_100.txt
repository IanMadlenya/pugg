        Dr. Susumu Ohno, an influential figure in clinical genetics, died on Jan. 13 at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb. He was 71 and lived in the nearby city of Glendora.
        The cause was lung cancer, said the City of Hope National Medical Center, where he worked for four decades.
        Dr. Ohno, recognized internationally for his work with genes, provided a better understanding of just how they determine whether a mammal's embryo will grow into a male or female fetus.
        His earlier research, in the 1950's and 60's, delved into the theory that evolution occurs through duplication, rather than alteration, of genes. His innovative approach influenced investigators in that field.
        He was a former chairman of the division of biology at the City of Hope medical center and retired from its Beckman Research Institute in 1996 as a distinguished scientist emeritus.
        Susumu Ohno was born to Japanese parents in Seoul, Korea, and was educated in Japan. He received a doctorate in veterinary medicine at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology in 1949 and doctorates in pathology (1956) and cytology  (1961) from Hokkaido University. He was a researcher in pathology at Tokyo University until joining the staff at City of Hope.
        He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which gave him its Amory Prize for Reproductive Biology in 1981. He published some 350 papers in scientific journals.
        Dr. Ohno is survived by his wife of 48 years, Midori Aoyama Ohno; two sons, Azusa, of West Hollywood, Calif., and Takeshi, of Las Vegas; a daughter, Yukali Ohno-Davenport of  Hawaii; three brothers, Shimesu, Yasushi and Tasumaro, all of Japan, and a sister, Akiko Furusawa of Tokyo.
