        Dr. Alfred Jepson Bingham, professor emeritus in the humanities at the University of Maryland, died on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Md. He was 85 and a resident of Silver Spring.
        The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
        Dr. Bingham was an expert on Voltaire as well as a scholar of 18th century French literature. He taught at the University of Maryland from 1947 to 1979 and continued through the 1980's to contribute to a critical edition of Voltaire's complete works.
        Known as the Besterman Edition, it is a continuing project that has been published in England for some years at the rate of about one volume a year. Dr. Bingham also wrote frequently for scholarly journals and was the author of "Marie-Joseph de Chenier, His Political Life and Ideas," published in 1939.
        Dr. Bingham, a native of New Haven, graduated from Yale University in 1932 and received a doctorate from Columbia University in 1938. Before joining the faculty at Maryland, he taught French literature at Brown University.
        He is survived by his wife of more than 50 years, Eleanor; two daughters, Rosalind Smith of Takoma Park, Md., and Diana Albrecht of Highland Park, Ill.; a sister, Frances Bingham Dale of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
