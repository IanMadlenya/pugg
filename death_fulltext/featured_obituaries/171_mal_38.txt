        Sully Boyar, a character actor who worked in films, on television and in theater, died on March 23 while waiting for a bus in Whitestone, Queens, where he lived. He was 77.
        Reared as one of seven children in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, Mr. Boyar was an established lawyer when he started thinking about giving it all up and enrolling in acting classes.
        He eventually became a member of the Actors Studio. His career progressed from small parts in summer stock productions to Off Broadway, often in experimental works at places like Judson Poets Theater.
        Soon, movie parts began to come his way. He appeared in more than a score of films, including ''The Panic in Needle Park,'' ''Last of the Red Hot Lovers,'' ''The King of Marvin Gardens,'' ''Dog Day Afternoon,'' ''Car Wash,'' ''Fort Apache, the Bronx'' and ''Prizzi's Honor.''
        He appeared on Broadway in the 1977 revival of David Rabe's ''Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,'' which starred Al Pacino. His television credits included roles in ''Barney Miller,'' ''Kojak,'' ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''Law and Order'' and, most recently, ''The Sopranos.''
        He is survived by his wife, Jo; a daughter, Marianna Boyar Samperi  of Queens; a twin brother, Sam, of Buffalo; another brother, Alex, of Manhattan; a sister, Anne, of West Orange, N.J.; and a granddaughter.
