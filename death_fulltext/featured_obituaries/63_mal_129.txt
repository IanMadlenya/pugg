        Mr. Leibman was the driving force behind the 1972 merger of his former firm, Leibman, Williams, Bennett, Baird & Minow, and Sidley & Austin. He played a central role in directing the combined firm to national prominence.
        Mr. Leibman also founded the National Strategy Forum, a nonprofit private organization based in Chicago, for discussion of foreign affairs.
        In 1964 he was appointed a civilian aide at large to the Secretary of the Army and served in that advisory capacity until 1979. In 1984 he was appointed civilian aide emeritus. Among his many honors and awards was the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1981.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two sons, William, of Chicago, and Steven, of Cambridge, Mass., and a sister, Shirley Reizen of Chicago.
