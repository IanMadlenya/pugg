        Dick Manning, a composer, lyricist and songwriter, died on Thursday in Marietta, Ga. He was 79 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died of complications from diabetes, his daughter, Ruth Kramer, said.
        Mr. Manning wrote many popular songs, among them "Takes Two to Tango," "Fascination" and "Papa Loves Mambo." His works were published in 27 languages and sung by such artists as Perry Como, Jimmy Durante, Kate Smith and others.
        He was born in Gomel, U.S.S.R., and was named Samuel Medoff. His family moved to the United States when he was 6 years old, and he later studied music at the Juilliard School. In the early 1940's he had a radio program called "Sam Medoff and His Yiddish Swing Orchestra" on WHN (now WEVD) Radio. He changed his name in 1948. Mr. Manning was also the composer of "The Boys From Boise," the first full-length television musical, and "Nightbird," a symphonic work for piano and orchestra. He was also a vocal coach, an arranger and a radio jingle writer.
        In addition to Mrs. Kramer, of Plainview, L.I., he is survived by a son, Mitchell, of Marietta; a daughter, Phyllis Colk, of Brooklyn; two sisters, Mollie Rothenberg, of Manhattan, and Bella Flamm, of Brooklyn; six grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.
