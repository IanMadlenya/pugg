        Lieut. Gen. Sir Kenneth Graeme McLean, one of the planners of the D-day invasion, has died in Scotland, a family death notice said today. He was 90 years old.
        Sir Kenneth died Friday, the notice said. He helped draw up the plans for Operation Overlord, the code name for the Allied invasion of Europe on June 6, 1944, which led to the defeat of the Nazis 11 months later.
        In 1953-54, he headed a court of inquiry set up in Kenya to hear evidence that British Army units in that then colony had committed many human-rights violations in trying to suppress the Mau Mau rebellion.
        After retiring from the Defense Ministry in 1954, Sir Kenneth raised money to repair St. Paul's Cathedral in London. He was an organist and pianist and a botanist.
