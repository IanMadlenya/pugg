        Robert Veyron-Lacroix, a pianist and harpsichordist known for his collaboration with the flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal, died on Tuesday in Paris. He was 68 years old.
        He died after a long illness, said the Bureau de Concerts Marcel de Valmalete, his management company in Paris.
        Mr. Veyron-Lacroix and Mr. Rampal performed as a duo for almost 40 years, in concerts around the world and on many recordings, five of which were awarded the Grand Prix du Disque. They made their first American appearance at the Library of Congress in 1958 and last performed in New York in February 1981.
        Mr. Veyron-Lacroix was born in Paris and studied at the conservatory there. In 1967, he became a professor of music at the school.
        There are no immediate survivors.
