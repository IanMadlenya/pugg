        Harry Horner, an Academy Award-winning film designer who also worked in theater and opera, died on Monday at his home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. He was 84.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Joan.
        Mr. Horner designed numerous motion pictures, including "The Heiress" and "The Hustler," which earned him Academy Awards, and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?," for which he received an Oscar nomination. His other films include "The Little Foxes," "Stage Door Canteen," "Born Yesterday" and "Lady Sings the Blues."
        He was born in Czechoslovakia in 1910 but reared in Austria, where he graduated from the University of Vienna with a degree in architecture. He also studied acting and performed with the Max Reinhardt Theater Company. When the Reinhardt troupe came to New York in the late 1930's, Mr. Horner came with them to design and act in "Eternal Road," thus providing him an escape from the Nazis.
        He became an American citizen in 1940 and joined the Army. While in the service, he did the sets for "Winged Victory," Moss Hart's play about the training of pilots for combat, under the Army Air Forces' aegis.
        After the war, Mr. Horner designed sets for many Broadway plays and musicals, among them "Molly and Me," "Family Portrait" and "Lady in the Dark." He also designed and directed productions for the Metropolitan Opera, the San Francisco Opera and other companies, and directed and designed the North American premiere of Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream" in Vancouver.
        In Los Angeles, he worked on several plays for the Ahmanson Theater, including "Idiot's Delight."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Christopher, Anthony and James, and two granddaughters.
