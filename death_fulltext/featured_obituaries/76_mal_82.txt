        Dr. Lewis Katoff, a clinical psychologist on the staff of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, died on Saturday at his Manhattan home. He was 39.
        The cause was AIDS-related complications, the organization said.
        Dr. Katoff graduated from Vassar College and Kent State University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1978. In the early 1980's, he was an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry of Emory University School of Medicine.
        He joined the staff of the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York in 1986. He served as director of client services and, at the time of his death, director of the fellowship program, which trains AIDS-service professionals from around the country. He conducted classes on AIDS in the work place and coping with loss.
        He is survived by his mother, Adele Katoff; two sisters, Sheila and Ena, and his companion, Phillip Roselin.
