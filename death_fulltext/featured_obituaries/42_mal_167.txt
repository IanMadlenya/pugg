        Dr. Howard S. Grob, a professor of biology at Adelphi University whose laboratory work helped clear the way for in vitro fertilization, died on Friday on a research trip to Phoenix. He was 58 years old and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        His family said he apparently died of a heart attack.
        Dr. Grob began teaching at Adelphi in 1971, and was dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences from 1981 to 1985 and acting provost in 1984-85. He was also an adjunct professor at New York University.
        Dr. Grob grew up in the Bronx and Washington Heights. He entered City College, went into the Army for three years and completed his education in biology and chemistry at night, receiving his B.S. from City College in 1957.
        He earned his master's and doctorate at N.Y.U., where he specialized in endocrinology, studying how hormones affect cells and tissues. In 1966, research on ovarian cells helped lead to a technique for removing follicles - the egg and surrounding cells - from ovaries so that they could survive in a culture dish and be fertilized.
        Dr. Grob is survived by his wife, the former Helen Mandel; two sons, Matthew, of the Bronx, and Douglas, of Queens; a brother, Gary, of Manhattan, and a sister, Judith, of Brooklyn.
