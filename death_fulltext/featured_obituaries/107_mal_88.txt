        Robert I. Williams, an accountant, founding board member of the Joyce Theater and enthusiast of world travel, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. A lifelong resident of Manhattan, he was 82.
        Mr. Williams, who worked as an investment consultant until his death, was a founding partner in 1945 in the accounting firm of Schutte & Williams. The business merged in 1970 with what is now Pannel Kerr Forster. He became a partner of the firm and later a consultant to it.
        Starting in 1934, he taught accounting at New York University's Stern School of Business for more than three decades. He also wrote certified public accounting examinations and was a principal editor of the five-volume Encyclopedia of Accounting Systems, published in 1935.
        He graduated from New York University in 1934. He was a member of the Circumnavigation Club, founded in 1902, when a journey around the world meant steamer trunks and sailing ships. Any means of transportation will do today, as  long as the applicant has circled the globe. At his death, Mr. Williams was president of the club's foundation, which sponsors a round-the-world study program for students.
        Linda Shelton, executive director of the Joyce Theater, a dance theater in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, praised Mr. Williams for "providing invaluable financial and legal guidance during the theater's critical planning phase." He was also a benefactor of the Lighthouse, the Central Park Conservancy and the New York Botanical Garden.
        Mr. Williams is survived by his wife, Lucille B. Williams; four sons, David,  of Livermore, Calif., John J., of Flushing, Queens, Paul, of Glencoe, Ill., and  Arthur W., of Shelter Island, L.I.; a daughter, Rosemary Bagley of Overland Park, Kan.; a stepson, Donald Fisher of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Claire Sordoni of Newtown Square, Pa., and 14 grandchildren.
