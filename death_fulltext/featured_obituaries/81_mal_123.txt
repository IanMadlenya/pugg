        Dr. Ernest B. Howard, a retired executive for the American Medical Association, died on Friday at the Northwest Community Care Center in Arlington Heights, Ill. He was 83 and lived in Inverness, a suburb of Chicago.
        The cause was cancer, the association said.
        Dr. Howard joined the staff of the medical association in 1948 and held two other executive positions before he became executive vice president in 1969. He retired in 1974.
        A native of Boston, he graduated from Harvard College and Boston University Medical School. He also held a master's degree in public health from Harvard University. He worked for the Massachusetts Department of Public Health before serving in the Army in World War II, reaching the rank of colonel.
        After the war, the State Department sent Dr. Howard to Peru with a team of nurses and sanitary engineers to overhaul the country's public health system. For his work, Peru gave Dr. Howard its highest decoration, the Order of the Seal.
        After retiring as the A.M.A.'s chief spokesman, he was in private practice for a dozen years in Arlington Heights and Schaumburg, Ill.
        He is survived by his wife, Kris; two sons, Tom and Peter; three daughters, Janet, Barbara and Kathryn, and three grandchildren.
