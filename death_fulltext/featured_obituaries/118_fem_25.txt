        Ruth Ratner Miller, a Cleveland business woman and civic leader, died on Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic. She was 70 and a lifelong  resident of the city.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        At her death she was president of Tower City Center, part of a complex of buildings in downtown Cleveland. Topped by a 32-story structure, it contains office space, retail businesses, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and a multiscreen movie house.
        Tower City was built by her family's Forest City Enterprises, a national real-estate developer. Its New York affiliate, the Forest City Ratner Companies, is involved in several projects in Brooklyn, including Metrotech and the new Atlantic Center shopping mall.
        Mrs. Miller, a member of numerous civic and community groups, contributed to causes serving women's causes, Jewish philanthropies and the State of Israel. She was a board member of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the National Jewish Coalition and a trustee of Cleveland State University and the Western Reserve Historical Society.
        For her work in support of Israel Bonds she received its David Ben-Gurion Award in 1977. She received the American Jewish Committee's Human Relations Award and the Distinguished Community Service Award from Brandeis University.
        She graduated from Case Western Reserve University, where she earned a Ph.D. in guidance and counseling, and lectured in educational psychology at Case Western from 1969 to 1974. That year she joined the administration of Mayor Ralph J. Perk as director of community development and, later, director of public health and welfare.
        Mrs. Miller is survived by her second husband, Rabbi Philip Horowitz; three sons, Aaron Miller of Washington, Richard Miller of Boston and Abraham Miller of Cleveland; a daughter, Gabrielle Miller of Wellesley, Mass.; a brother, Albert B. Ratner, of Cleveland, and 13 grandchildren.
