        Dr. Sterling M. McMurrin, former United States Commissioner of Education, longtime University of Utah philosophy professor and influential Mormon intellectual, died on Saturday. He was 82.
        Dr. McMurrin died at Dixie Regional Medical Center, where he had been treated for lung and heart ailments.
        Dr. McMurrin became a professor of philosophy at the University of Utah in 1948. In 1961, he was appointed education commissioner by President John F. Kennedy, and was known for championing school desegregation and national initiatives for hiring women and minorities in education.
        He returned to the University after just one year in Washington, saying at his departure that his office suffered from a lack of financing from Congress and a slow-moving bureaucracy.
        He retired as dean of the university's graduate school in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, Natalie, two sons, three daughters and five grandchildren.
