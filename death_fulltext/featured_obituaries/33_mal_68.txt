        Edward G. Schumacher, a former merchant seaman who helped win veteran status for merchant mariners who served in World War II, died of a heart attack Saturday at his home in Dale City, Va. He was 66 years old.
        Mr. Schumacher, a scientific illustrator at the Smithsonian Institution for 30 years, was a prime mover in a legal battle with the Federal Government that resulted, in 1988, in veteran status for any seaman who served on oceangoing merchant ships during the war.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy; a son, Kurt, of Landover Hills, Md.; a daughter, Cheryl Reid, of Martinsburg, W. Va.; and two grandchhildren.
