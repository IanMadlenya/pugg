        Amy Ogden Welcher, a founder and first national president of Church Women United, a national ecumenical organization, died on Feb. 21 at her home at Avery Heights in Hartford. She was 104 years old.
        She died of heart failure, a family member said.
        In 1941, several women's church groups formed what was then called the United Council of Church Women and named Miss Welcher as president. Under her leadership, the organization became a strong advocate for peace and national unity, fighting against religious, racial and political bigotry.
        She was an active member of the Congregational Church's Foreign Mission Board for more than 60 years and was involved in organizational work, visiting missions in China, Japan, India and Lebanon.
        She is survived by a nephew, Richard Parke Welcher of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a niece, Jeanne Welcher Kleinfield of Glen Cove, L.I.
