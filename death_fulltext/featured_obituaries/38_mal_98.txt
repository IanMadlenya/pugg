        Rabbi Stuart E. Rosenberg, a spiritual leader of Canada's Jews and an author, died of cancer yesterday in West Palm Beach, Fla., where he had a winter home. He was 67 years old and also lived in Toronto.
        For nine years, until he retired last August, Rabbi Rosenberg led the Beth Torah synagogue in Toronto. Earlier, he was senior rabbi for 17 years at Beth Tzedec in Toronto, the largest Conservative congregation in Canada.
        Rabbi Rosenberg was one of the first Western religious leaders to focus on the plight of Soviet Jews, traveling to Moscow in 1961 and writing a series of newspaper articles on their problems.
        He was also a pioneer in Christian-Jewish dialogue in Canada. He wrote 20 books, including ''Christians and Jews: The Eternal Bond,'' published in 1985, and a two-volume study, ''The Jewish Community in Canada'' (1971). His last book, ''Secrets of the Jews,'' is scheduled to appear in the fall. He also worked as an editor for the Encyclopedia Judaica with responsibility for Canadian matters.
        Born in Manhattan, Rabbi Rosenberg was a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary and received a Ph.D. from Columbia University.
        Rabbi Rosenberg is survived by his wife, the former Hadassa Agassi; his mother, Kate, of Miami Beach; three daughters, Rachelle Taqqu, of Newton, Mass., Ronni, of Toronto, and Elissa, of Charlottesville, Va.; a brother, Marvin, of North Woodmere, L.I., and four grandchildren.
