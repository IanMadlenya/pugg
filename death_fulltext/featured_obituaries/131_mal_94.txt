        Frank Campbell Waldrop, an author and journalist who had been  editor in chief of The Washington Times-Herald, died on Sunday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 92 and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Waldrop wrote ''McCormick of Chicago'' (1966), a biography of the publisher Col. Robert R. McCormick. With Joseph Borkin, he wrote ''Television, A Struggle for Power'' (1938).
        Born in Veto, Ala., Mr. Waldrop studied at the United States Military Academy and Columbia University and started his journalistic career on The Tennessean in Nashville. He moved to Washington in 1933 to work as a reporter for The Herald.
        The paper merged with The Times of Washington, and Mr. Waldrop became executive editor in the late 1940's. He made journalism history in Washington, then a newspaper town of fierce competitors, on Dec. 7, 1941. When news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor rattled over the teletype, Mr. Waldrop marshaled the staff, and The Times-Herald beat the other newspapers with the first ''extra'' at a time when most people still got their news in print.
        He left The Times-Herald in 1953.
        Mr. Waldrop was later a consultant to the Department of State.
        He is survived by his wife of 67 years, Eleanor Lanier Waldrop; a daughter, Judith W. Frank, and a son, Andrew C., all of Washington; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
