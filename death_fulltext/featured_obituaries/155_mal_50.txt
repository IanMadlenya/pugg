        Venable Herndon, a playwright and screenwriter who taught dramatic writing at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, died on Dec. 8 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. He was 72 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was acute leukemia, said Louise Bernikow, a friend.
        His best-known screenplay was his 1969 collaboration with the director Arthur Penn on ''Alice's Restaurant,'' a film inspired by the hit recording by Arlo Guthrie and starring Mr. Guthrie. His plays included ''Until the Monkey Comes,'' which was produced Off Broadway in 1966 and revived earlier this year.
        Mr. Herndon was also the author of a book, ''James Dean: A Short Life'' (1974), and was the founding editor of the literary journal Chelsea Review in 1958.
        Born in Philadelphia on Oct. 19, 1927, Mr. Herndon graduated from Princeton in 1949 with a degree in French literature and received a master's degree in comparative literature from Harvard in 1950.
        From 1951 to 1966, he worked in advertising with clients including Gimbel's and Beefeater gin.
        He joined the faculty at New York University in 1975, becoming an associate professor in 1988.
        He is survived by his wife, Sharon Anson, and a daughter, Isabelle Molinaro of Manhattan.
