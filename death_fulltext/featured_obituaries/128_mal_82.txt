        James J. Houlahan, a former advertising executive at the William Esty Company, died on Sept. 18 at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 90 and had lived in Ocean Ridge, Fla. and Martha's Vineyard, Mass.
        As chief executive of William Esty from 1942 to 1960, Mr. Houlahan turned a small agency into a minor force in advertising, before it was acquired by Ted Bates Worldwide, a bigger ad agency, in 1982.
        William Esty was known for its print ads of men in suits and hats, and slogans like ''Winston tastes good, like a cigarette should.'' In addition to Winston cigarettes, the agency's accounts included another R. J. Reynolds brand, Salem cigarettes; Sun Oil; Union Carbide, and Colgate-Palmolive.
        After William Esty was bought by Ted Bates, the Bates agency was bought by Saatchi & Saatchi in 1986. Two years later, Saatchi merged Esty with Campbell Mithun, to form Campbell Mithun Esty.
        Mr. Houlahan was born in Milton, Mass., on Sept. 7, 1907, the son of working-class Irish immigrants. He graduated from Northeastern University in Boston in 1929, worked briefly for an accounting firm and then joined the consumer-products company Lever Brothers in its Cambridge, Mass., office.
        In 1941, he joined the William Esty Company, and a year later became its chief executive.
        Mr. Houlahan is survived by a son, Andrew P. Houlahan of Concord, Mass.; a daughter, Kathleen Houlahan of Arlington, Mass., and four grandchildren. His wife, Marion Lyons Houlahan, died in 1991.
