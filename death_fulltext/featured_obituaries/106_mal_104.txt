        Livingston Hall, Roscoe Pound Professor Emeritus and former vice dean at Harvard Law School, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Great Barrington, Mass. He was 92 and had lived in Great Barrington since retiring from Harvard in 1971.
        Mr. Hall graduated fourth in his class from Harvard Law in 1927 and worked briefly with a New York law firm and as a prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney in Manhattan. He returned to Harvard as an assistant professor in 1932, was promoted to professor in 1937 and, in 1939, was named vice dean of  the law faculty, a title he held for 20 years. He was named Roscoe Pound Professor, one of the most distinguished positions in his profession, in 1963.
        Two years later, he helped his wife, Elizabeth, a former headmistress of a private school, found the innovative Simon's Rock College in Great Barrington, an institution designed for students of high school age. Professor Hall was an original trustee of the school, which is now affiliated with Bard College.
        Professor Hall, known as Livy, was born in Chicago and graduated from the University of Chicago, where his father was dean of the law school. From 1941 to 1943, he was regional price and enforcement attorney for the Office of Price Administration in Boston. And for two years after that, he was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Air Forces, in charge of operations analysis for the 13th and 20th Air Forces, service that earned him a Congressional Medal of Freedom in 1946.
        He was a past president of the Massachusetts Bar Association and the author or co-author of books on criminal law and procedure.
        In addition to his wife, of 65 years, Professor Hall is survived by two sons, Thomas L., of San Francisco, and John K., of Jerusalem; two daughters, Margaret  R. Whitfield of Great Barrington and Elizabeth C. Richardson of Denver; a brother, James P. Jr., of Evanston, Ill.; 11 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.
