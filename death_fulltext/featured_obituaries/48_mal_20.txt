        Edmond Jabes, a writer known for his meditations on exile and Judaism, died on Wednesday at his home. He was 78 years old.
        His publisher said the cause of death was heart failure.
        Mr. Jabes recently finished a manuscript titled "The Book of Hospitality," to be published by Gallimard in April.
        Born in Cairo in 1912, Mr. Jabes was forced to leave Egypt in 1957 when President Gamal Abdel Nasser drove out the Jews. The traumatic experience inspired his meditations on exile and his Jewish identity. He settled in Paris and became a French citizen in 1967.
        Winner of the National Grand Prize for Poetry in 1987, Mr. Jabes wrote many books of poetry and essays, including "The Book of Questions," an anthology of philosophical musings over 10 years.
        Among his other works are "I Build My House," "The Book of Resemblances," "The Book of Margins" and "The Book of Shares."
        Writing about "The Book of Shares" in The New York Times Book Review, Mark Rudman praised Mr. Jabes's "passion and desperate urgency." He continued: "His is an art of angular thrusts, of juxtapositions carried to such an extreme that you can hear the scream at its center: the voice of the Holocaust, of the unredeemed and unredeemable. It is an art of incantation, ablaze with inner fire, consuming itself."
