        Burton H. Hall, a lawyer who specialized in representing employees against labor union officials and employers, died on Wednesday at his home in St. George, Staten Island. He was 61 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his law partner, Wendy E. Sloan.
        Mr. Hall represented employees in the National Maritime Union, the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the Laborers' International Union, the painters union and the carpenters union.
        In 1977 he was expelled from the Soviet Union when he tried to petition the authorities to review the conviction of a Ukranian political advocate, Aleksandr Serhiyenko.
        Mr. Hall was the editor of "Autocracy and Insurgency in Organized Labor," a collection of articles on issues of democracy in unions. It was published in 1970.
        Born in South Orange, N.J., he graduated from Williams College and earned his law degree at Yale University Law School. He was a partner in the Manhattan firm of Hall & Sloan.
        Mr. Hall is survived by a brother, Henry P., of Concord, Mass., and a sister, Harriet Dieterich of Winchester, Mass.
