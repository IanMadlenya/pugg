        Barry R. Gross, a professor of philosophy at the City University of New York who was known as one of the earliest scholarly critics of affirmative action programs, died last Friday in Princeton, N.J. He was 58.
        Professor Gross, who taught at CUNY's York College and lived in Manhattan, apparently had a heart attack while working at the headquarters of the National Association of Scholars. He was the group's national program director and treasurer as well as president of its New York City affiliate.
        The National Association of Scholars describes itself as dedicated to keeping outside political influences from tainting teaching and learning on campuses. Its predecessor organization, begun in 1982, was the Campus Coalition for Democracy, and Professor Gross was one of the organizers.
        Professor Gross's reputation as a skeptic of the effects, if not the motives, of affirmative action was established in 1978 with his book "Discrimination in Reverse: Is Turnabout Fair Play?" published by the New York University Press.
        In the years afterward, he spoke out in characteristically blunt language on what he saw as the bad effects of good intentions, and on whatever other issues stimulated his intellect.
        Professor Gross was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from New York University with a major in philosophy. He received a master's in philosophy from the University of Colorado and a doctorate from the University of Toronto.
        Professor Gross's wife, Laila, died in 1985. He is survived by his mother, Estelle Schoenfeld of Jackson Heights, Queens.
