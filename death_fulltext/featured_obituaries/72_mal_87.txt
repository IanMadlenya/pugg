        Riley V. Sims, who rose from poverty to success in the construction, concrete, telecommunications and cable television industries, died Wednesday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., his home town. He was 90.
        He had cancer, his family said,
        When Mr. Sims, a native of East St. Louis, Ill., was 12, his father died. The youth quit school after the seventh grade to support his mother by baling hay for 50 cents a day and shucking corn for 6 cents a bushel.
        During the Depression, after the family had moved to Florida, he formed a handshake partnership with a friend, Russell Burnup. Both were unemployed carpenters. They pooled $30 in cash and their tools and began doing repair jobs and transporting sand for construction.
        Eventually Sims & Burnup grew to become a major contractor, erecting office buildings, schools and shopping centers in West Palm Beach. The company introduced ready-mixed concrete to South Florida, and by the 1940's it operated 65 concrete plants across the southeast United States and the Caribbean.
        At Mr. Sims's initiative, the company shifted into the installation of lines for rural telephone service, and from that expanded into installing cable television.
        In time Sims & Burnup became the nation's largest cable television installer. Over the last 32 years, it has wired a quarter of the nation's 5,800 cable systems. Last years it reported $153 million in sales.
        Mr. Sims, who won the Horatio Alger Award from the American Schools and Colleges Association, remained chairman of the company until he retired in 1989.
        He is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Lillian Bamford; a daughter, Sandra Millspaugh of Asheville, N.C., and six grandchildren.
