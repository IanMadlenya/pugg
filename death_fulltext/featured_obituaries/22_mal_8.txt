        Thomas Cardinal Cooray, the former Archbishop of Colombo, Sri Lanka, died on Saturday in Sri Lanka, the Vatican said today. He was 86 years old.  The Vatican did not give the cause of death.
        Thomas B. Cooray was born in Negombo, in western Ceylon, now Sri Lanka. Cardinal Cooray served as Archbishop of Colombo for 29 years, from 1947 until his retirement in 1976.
        During his time as Archbishop, Cardinal Cooray ''favored a respectful dialogue with the Buddhists and with other Christians,'' the Vatican said.
        ''During the years of suppression or limitation of religious freedom, Cardinal Cooray constantly affirmed the spirituality of his own mission and the loyalty of Roman Catholics'' to the Sri Lankan Government, the Vatican said.
