        H. J. Maidenberg, a former correspondent for The New York Times in South America and a specialist in commodities and money markets for the newspaper's business and financial news section, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Greenwich Village.
        The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said his brother, David Maidenberg.
        Mr. Maidenberg was a teen-ager when he joined The Times. In the late 1950's, he became a copy editor, and he spent several years editing financial news before becoming a reporter for the section. Retired in 1991
        Beginning in 1969, Mr. Maidenberg spent three years in South America as a correspondent for The Times, covering Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. He returned periodically to cover economic news in other South American countries.
        For the next two decades, he reported on New York commodities and money markets.
        Mr. Maidenberg retired from The Times in 1991. DeAngelis Scandal
        Among the major stories he reported was the collapse in 1964 of the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation of Bayonne, N.J. The bankruptcy of the giant concern headed by Anthony DeAngelis jolted the financial world and undermined a dozen companies in the United States and abroad.
        And in 1970 he covered the earthquake that killed about 30,000 people in Peru.
        Besides his brother David, Mr. Maidenberg is survived by three other brothers, Bernard, of Fort Lee, N.J., Jerome, of the Bronx, and Melvin, of Fair Lawn, N.J., and a sister, Sara Seltzer of North Bergen, N.J.
