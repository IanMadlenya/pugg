        Leonard Lewin, a sportswriter who wrote five books with Red Holzman, the onetime coach of the Knicks, died Monday in Tampa, Fla. He was 87.
        His death was announced by his son, John.
        From 1971 to 1980, Mr. Lewin and Mr. Holzman collaborated on ''The Knicks,'' ''Holzman's Basketball,'' ''Defense!'' and ''A View From the Bench.'' In 1993, in ''My Unforgettable Season,'' they created a fantasy game between the 1970 champion Knicks and Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls of the 1990's.
        Mr. Lewin wrote for The New York Mirror (1938-1963) and The New York Post (1963-1993). After retiring from The Post, he started the Knicks Alumni Association and had served as its director since then.
        In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, the former Phoebe Schuster; two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.
