        John H. F. Haskell, a retired banker and a former diplomat and officer of the New York Stock Exchange, died of heart failure Tuesday aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2 en route to New York on a visit. He was 83 years old and lived in Grasse, France.
        He was the son of a career officer, the late Lieut. Gen. William N. Haskell, former commander of the New York National Guard, and graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1925. After West Point he became a reserve officer in the National Guard and pursued a career on Wall Street.
        Mr. Haskell was a vice president of the New York Stock Exchange from the late 1930's until 1955.
        His most recent position was that of representative of the Bankers Trust Company in France and the Benelux countries, a job he held from 1960 until his retirement in 1969.
        In World War II, as an Army officer leading an intelligence-gathering mission in Germany, he received wounds that resulted in the loss of a leg.
        He took a leave of absence from the stock exchange in the late 1940's to spend a year as head of the United States Economic Cooperation Administration mission to Sweden. In the late 1950's he was defense adviser to the chief of the United States mission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, holding the rank of Minister.
        He is survived by his wife, Paulette; two sons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Paul, of Paris, and five grandchildren.
