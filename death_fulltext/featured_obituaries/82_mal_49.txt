        Dr. Terris Moore, a mountain climber and a former president of the University of Alaska, died on Sunday at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 85 and lived in Cambridge.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Katrina.
        In 1932 he was a member of a party of Americans who climbed the 24,900-foot Minya Konka in China near its border with Tibet. At the time, the group had climbed higher than any Americans on any mountain.
        Dr. Moore had already climbed the 20,577-foot Chimborazo in Ecuador, and in 1930 and 1931 he took part in the first ascents of the 16,420-foot Mount Bona and the 15,300-foot Mount Fairweather, both in Alaska.
        Dr. Moore was also an aviator who flew supplies to many expeditions climbing unexplored mountains in Alaska. To reach them, he would land light planes on upland glaciers.
        Dr. Moore was president of the University of Alaska from 1949 to 1953 and later was a consultant to a variety of Federal and state academic and research groups. He graduated from Williams College and received a doctorate from Harvard University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Katrina Smathers of Los Altos, Calif.; a sister, Marilynn Ridland of Sun Valley, Idaho, and three grandchildren.
