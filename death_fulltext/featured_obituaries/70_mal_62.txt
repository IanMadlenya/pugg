        Richard Hartshorne, professor emeritus of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of an enduring university textbook, died Thursday at his home in Madison. He was 92 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Professor Hartshorne specialized in economic and political geography as well as the philosophy of geography. He was president of the Association of American Geographers in 1949.
        The association, which gave him its top award in 1960, first published "The Nature of Geography" in 1939. An important methodological work, it is still in print. The association also published a follow-up book, "Perspectives on the Nature of Geography," which first appeared in 1959.
        A native of Kittaning, Pa., Professor Hartshorne graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton University in 1920 and took a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1924. He then spent 16 years on the faculty of the University of Minnesota before arriving on the Madison campus as an associate professor in 1940. He became professor of geology the following year and reached emeritus status in 1970.
        Professor Hartshorne's first wife, the former Lois Huntington Wilde, died in 1972. He is survived by his wife, Donna Taylor Hartshorne; three daughters: Penny Jones Barbera and Marguerite Udell, both of Manhattan, and Harriet Strobel of Denver; a brother, Charles Hartshorne of Austin, Tex.,; four grandchildren; five stepchildren and eight step-grandchildren.
