        Vittorio Cassoni, a senior executive of the Xerox Corporation, died on Sunday in the Capitanio Hospital in Milan, Italy. He was 49 years old and lived in New Canaan, Conn.
        Mr. Cassoni died of a brain tumor six weeks after the tumor was discovered, said Judd Everhart, a Xerox spokesman. It was at that time, shortly after being named executive vice president of operations for Xerox, that Mr. Cassoni returned to his native Italy for treatment.
        Born and educated in Milan, where he graduated from the Politecnico di Milano, Mr. Cassoni was widely considered an expert strategist in marketing advanced technological equipment, particularly computers. Before joining Xerox, he was managing director of the Olivetti Group from 1988 to 1992 in Ivrea, Italy.  Held Top Executive Positions
        From 1980 to 1986, he held several executive positions with Olivetti. He then served as president of the Data Systems Group for the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in Morristown, N.J. In the early 1980's A.T.& T. bought a substantial stake in Olivetti, which develops and manufactures personal computers, in hopes of improving its personal computer sales. Mr. Cassoni was credited with sharply reducing A.T.& T.'s computer losses and bolstering its credibility in the computer industry through strategic alliances with other high-tech companies. In 1988, Mr. Cassoni left A.T.& T. to return to Olivetti.
        Mr. Cassoni began his career in 1967 with the International Business Machines Corporation as an engineer in Vimercate, Italy.
        He is survived by his wife, Giovanna, and two children, Jonathan, and Tomaso.
