        David H. Wright, a former New York saddlery owner, died on Monday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Wright died from an infection, the cause of which was not yet known, his daughter Bonnie said yesterday.
        He was the owner and operator of M. J. Knoud Saddlery Inc. in Manhattan for 60 years until he retired in 1986. The business, at 716 Madison Avenue at 63d Street, was known for its custom craftsmanship. Family members operated the business after Mr. Wright's retirement and sold it recently.
        Mr. Wright was a director of the American Horse Show Association and a member of both the United States Equestrian Team and the Carriage Association of America. He was also a founding member and former president and secretary of the Professional Horseman's Association.
        He was born in Scarsdale, N.Y., and graduated from New York University in 1931.
        In addition to his daughter Bonnie, of Stamford, Conn., Mr. Wright is survived by his wife, the former Anne Marchand; another daughter, Nancy Grossman of Redondo Beach, Calif.; two sons, David M., of Manhattan and Andrew H., of Darien, Conn., and a grandson.
