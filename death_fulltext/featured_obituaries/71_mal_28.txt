        David B. Smith, a retired communications engineer and professor, died on Thursday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. He was 81 years old and lived in Gladwyne, Pa.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        A native of Newton, N.J., Mr. Smith was an honor graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He started his first career with the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company, later Philco, a leading producer of radios and home appliances. In 1939, at the age of 28, he became the company's director of research.
        At the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Smith helped develop a close relationship between Philco and M.I.T. that transformed Philco into a manufacturer of airborne radars, reconnaissance and communications equipment and other war materiel.
        After the war, as Philco continued to expand its military and commercial communications business, Mr. Smith was promoted to vice president of research and engineering.
        When the Ford Motor Company acquired Philco in 1964, he continued to work there until retiring in 1967.
        He then joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania as a professor of engineering and organized a new systems-engineering group at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering. Mr. Smith was next appointed professor of engineering management at Drexel University and director of its graduate program in engineering management.
        Mr. Smith is survived by a daughter, Joie Smith of New York City and Edmonton, Canada; three sons, David A., of Arlington, Va., George K., of Allentown, Pa., and Peter, of Cambridge, Mass., and six grandchildren.
