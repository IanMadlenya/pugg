        George A. Butler, a retired president of the Corestates Financial Corporation, died Aug. 22 at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He was 69 and lived in Blue Bell, Pa.
        He died of lymphoma, said a son, Thomas S. Butler.
        Mr. Butler spent his entire professional career as a banker. He joined the First Pennsylvania Bank Corporation in 1950 after graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
        ''My mother used to tell the story that when I was 5 years old I said I wanted to be a bank president,'' he once told an interviewer. ''I must admit I don't remember that.''
        Mr. Butler rose through the ranks at First Pennsylvania. In the late 1970's, the bank ran into trouble with a string of bad loans and an ill-timed gamble in the bond market. John R. Bunting, who at the time was First Pennsylvania's chief executive, resigned in 1979, and Mr. Butler took over.
        The next year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and a group of 25 banks assembled a $1.5 billion bailout.
        Mr. Butler continued as chairman and chief executive of First Pennsylvania until 1990, when the bank holding company was merged with Core states. At the time of the merger, he was named president of Corestates, a post he held until retiring in December 1991.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Butler served on the boards of several corporations, including Betz Dearborn Inc., the General Accident Insurance Company of America and Peirce-Phelps Inc.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara Thomas Butler of Blue Bell and Naples, Fla.; two sons, Thomas and William E. Butler, both of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; two daughters, Lynne B. Strange of Devon, Pa., and Pamela S. Berrard of Fort Lauderdale; two brothers, J. Richard Butler of Oreland, Pa., and Robert T. Butler of Devon, Pa., and seven grandchildren.
