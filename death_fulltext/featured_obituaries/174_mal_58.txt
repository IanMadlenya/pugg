        Hugh Randolph Wilbourn Jr., the founder and chairman of the Allied Telephone Company, now known as the Alltel Corporation, died on Thursday. He was 85.
        Mr. Wilbourn began his career in telecommunications as a lineman for Southwestern Bell Telephone in 1934. Ten years later, Mr. Wilbourn and a brother-in-law, Charles B. Miller, started their own telephone business with an initial investment of $60, which they used to buy tools and a pickup truck and to rent a post office box. They named it Communications Repair Service.
        As the business blossomed, Mr. Wilbourn and Mr. Miller moved the company's headquarters to a rented storefront in Little Rock, Ark., and changed its name to Allied Telephone and Electric Company. In 1949, they bought the Grant County Telephone Company and continued to acquire small telephone companies for more than 30 years.
        Mr. Wilbourn served as chairman of the company until 1977. He continued as chairman emeritus until 1983, the year Allied Telephone merged with the Mid-Continent Telephone Corporation to form Alltel. He remained a member of Alltel's board until his retirement in 1990.
        Mr. Wilbourn was born on Sept. 13, 1915, in Little Rock. He graduated from Ouachita Baptist University in Arkansas.
        He is survived by his wife, Edith, of Little Rock; a sister, Marion Lovett, of Little Rock; two daughters, Jo Ellen, of Little Rock, and Beverly Pascoe, of Conway, Ark.; a son, Hugh R. Wilbourn III, of Little Rock; 12 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
