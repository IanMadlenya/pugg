        Vincent Harris Jefferds, a creative marketing executive in the Walt Disney organization for three decades, died April 12 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 75 years old.
        A statement from Disney Consumer Products, a division of the Walt Disney Company in Burbank, Calif., said he died of a heart attack.
        In his 32 years with Disney, Mr. Jefferds helped spread the appeal of Disney characters through toys, books and ice skating shows, and expanded Disney's international book publishing in the 1970's. He also wrote about two dozen children's books, including "Disney's Elegant ABC Book" (Simon & Schuster, 1985), "Disney's Elegant Book of Manners" (Simon & Schuster, 1985) and a Rhyming Readers series.
        Mr. Jefferds, who was born in Jersey City, worked his way through Rutgers University as an artist and earned a B.A. in journalism. He served in the Army in World War II, rising to the rank of captain.
        Mr. Jefferds joined Disney's New York merchandising office in 1951 and was called to the Burbank headquarters in 1960 to head national merchandising operations. He was appointed director of marketing services in 1967 and became vice president for sales promotions in the domestic and foreign divisions in 1972. He retired from Walt Disney Productions as senior vice president of marketing in 1983.
        Mr. Jefferds is survived by his wife, the former Jean Macbride, a son, Vincent Jr., and two daughters, Jean and Jenny, all of Los Angeles; and a brother, Byron, of Edgewater Park, N.J.
