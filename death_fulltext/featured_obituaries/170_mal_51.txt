        Glenn Hughes, who sang in a leather biker outfit with the Village People, died on March 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 50.
        The cause was lung cancer, reported MTV.
        Mr. Hughes, who grew up in the Bronx, was working as a toll collector at the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel when friends dared him to respond to an advertisement seeking ''gay singers and dancers, very good-looking and with mustaches.''
        The French-born producer Jacques Morali placed the ad after watching a group of men dancing in a Greenwich Village nightclub and deciding to put together a disco group in which each member represented a different fetishized American male stereotype. So with an Indian, a  soldier, a construction worker, a police officer, a cowboy and Mr. Hughes as a biker, an improbable idea became a commercial blockbuster.
        The band released its first single, ''San Francisco (You've Got Me),'' in 1977 and, the next year, made its first hit, ''Macho Man.'' With a strong image, a good show and campy, suggestive (but not too suggestive) lyrics, the Village People managed to sustain their success in a genre of one-hit wonders. Soon this  band built for gay discos found itself performing for screaming women around the world.
        The band produced a quick string of hits, including ''Y.M.C.A.,'' ''In the Navy'' and ''Go West,'' helping them sell an estimated 65 million albums and singles combined. Mr. Hughes, also known as the ''leather man,'' with his black cap, hirsute chest and handlebar mustache, cut one of the band's most memorable images.
        In 1980 Mr. Hughes was featured in the band's autobiographical movie, ''Can't Stop the Music.'' But with the new decade, disco's star was waning. Mr. Hughes continued to play with the band until 1996, when he left to sing on his own in Manhattan cabarets.
