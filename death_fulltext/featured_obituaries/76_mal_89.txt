        Said Bey Kryeziu, a prominent Albanian exile in New York and a guerrilla leader in World War II, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was heart failure, the family said.
        Mr. Kryeziu was born into a noble family in Kosovo, today an autonomous province within Serbia, and thus within Yugoslavia, and then under Turkish rule. He fought with the Albanian resistance against Italian and German occupation forces during the war and against the Communist takeover at its end.
        As an exile in Rome, he was co-founder of a National Committee for a Free Albania, which had the support of the United States and Britain but disbanded when the United Nations admitted Albania in the 1950's. He came to the United States in 1959.
        Mr. Kryeziu is survived by his wife of 34 years, Makbule.
