        James L. Allen, the first managing partner and former chairman of Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc., an international management consulting firm with headquarters in New York, died on Thursday at his home in Gulf Stream, Fla. He was 87 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said Mary Duhon, a spokeswoman for the firm.
        Mr. Allen spent more than four decades at the firm. He first joined it in 1929 when it was Booz Hamilton and left it twice for corporate jobs. When he returned a third time in the mid-1940's, he became the firm's first managing partner. He was chairman of the governing board from 1947 to 1970, when he was named honorary chairman.
        Mr. Allen was a native of Somerset, Ky. A 1929 graduate of Northwestern University, he helped to found its Kellogg Graduate School of Management. The university's Allen Lectures and the James L. Allen Center are named in his honor, and he was made a university life trustee in 1975.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances O. Allen of Evanston, Ill.; three daughters, Ruth Hopfenbeck and Mary Carson, both of Denver, and Martha Park, of Wilmette, Ill.; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
