        Mark Saxton, an author and editor, died, apparently of a heart attack, last Thursday in his home in New York City. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Saxton worked as a book editor in New York at Farrar & Rinehart, William Sloane Associates and Whittlesey House, a division of the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. From 1950 to 1969, he was an editor at the Harvard University Press, and later he helped found Gambit Inc., a publishing company in Boston. Returning to New York in 1980, he remained a freelance editor until his death.
        At his death he was also a vice president and member of the board of trustees of the Joseph Collins Foundation of New York, which provides financial assistance to medical students. The World of 'Islandia'
        Mr. Saxton wrote eight novels, three of which - ''The Islar,'' ''The Two Kingdoms'' and ''Havoc in Islandia'' -are set in the imaginary world of Islandia. That world was invented by Austin Tappan Wright, a lawyer and a law professor, complete with a geography, a language, a detailed peerage and a bibliography.
        While at Farrar & Rinehart, Mr. Saxton helped Mr. Wright's daughter edit the original manuscripts, which were discovered at Mr. Wright's death, and the book, ''Islandia,'' was published posthumously in 1942. Mr. Saxton remained so fascinated with the subject that years later he wrote his own accounts of what was happening there.
        Mr. Saxton, born in Mineola, L.I., on Nov. 28, 1914, grew up in New York City where his father, Eugene F. Saxton, was for many years the editor of Harper & Brothers. He graduated from Harvard College in 1936 and served from 1943 to 1946 in the Navy, in both the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, in air combat intelligence.
        He is survived by a son, Russell, of Berkeley, Calif., and a daughter, Martha, of New York City.
