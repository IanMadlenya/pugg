        Kalim Siddiqui, a prominent British Muslim who backed Iran's call for the assassination of the writer Salman Rushdie, died of a heart attack on Thursday while on a visit to Pretoria, South Africa. He was 62.
        Mr. Siddiqui, who had heart-bypass surgery last June, was the leader of the Muslim Parliament of Great Britain, a 150-member organization. (Despite its name, it has no legislative powers.)
        Some British legislators had called for Mr. Siddiqui to be charged with incitement to murder after he said in a 1993 radio program about Mr. Rushdie, "We will just break every bone in his body." He was not prosecuted.
        Mr. Rushdie, a British writer born in India, went into hiding in 1989 after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran, issued a call for his death. Many Muslims say his book "The Satanic Verses" is blasphemous.
        Iranian officials have recently indicated that their Government will not hunt down Mr. Rushdie, but Mr. Siddiqui said last month that the death command "was and remains an order that must be carried out."
        Mr. Siddiqui worked as a journalist in Britain from 1954 until 1972, when he  quit to work full time for British Muslim causes.
        He has three surviving children, but the group gave no information on his wife.
