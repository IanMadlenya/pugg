        Charles Gillespie Jr., a retired Navy captain who was shot down over Vietnam and spent five and a half years in Hanoi as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese, was killed Tuesday in the crash of a civilian plane. He was 60 years old.
        Mr. Gillespie, who retired from active duty in June 1983, was flying a turboprop plane for Flight International Inc., a military contractor based in Newport News, Va., when the fatal accident occurred. The crash took place minutes after he finished maneuvers intended to simulate hostile aircraft in war games involving Navy air traffic control students tracking planes from ships.
        A native of Meridian, Miss., Mr. Gillespie graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1951. He was a pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Coral Sea when his F-4 Phantom jet was shot down over North Vietnam on Oct. 24, 1967. He bailed out and was captured.
        He spent five and a half years in North Vietnamese prisons before being released on March 17, 1973. In the years after, he sometimes talked about the harsh prison existence before church and civic groups.
        He is survived by his wife, Helen, a daughter and a son.
