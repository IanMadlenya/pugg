        Frank Ledlie Moore, a composer, filmmaker and author, died on Sunday at the home of his daughter Gabi Moore in Chester, Conn. He was 75.
        The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, his daughter said.
        Mr. Moore's compositions included 10 choral dramas, one of which, ''Wagadougou,'' had its premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1982. He also wrote the scores for a number of film and television documentaries, and served as producer or director for many educational documentaries.
        He was also the author of several books, including ''Handbook of Gilbert and Sullivan'' and, with Mary Varchaver, Dictionary of the Performing Arts.
        Mr. Moore was born in Newtonville, Mass., taught himself to read music, went on to study at the New England Conservatory of Music and eventually took master classes with  Stravinsky. In the 1970's and 80's he was general manager in the United States for Novello & Company, a British music publisher, and later served as a vice president for international business for G. Schirmer, the American music publisher.
        In addition to his daughter Gabi, he is survived by another daughter, Katen Moore, of Middlesex, N.J.; a son, Gordon, of Rochester, and four grandchildren.
