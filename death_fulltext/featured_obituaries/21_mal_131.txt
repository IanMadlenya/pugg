        William J. Campbell, a former chief judge of the Federal District Court in Chicago whose tenure encompassed a turbulent period in the city's law-enforcement history, died Wednesday of complications following surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 83 years old and lived in Lantana, Fla.
        Judge Campbell, named to the Federal bench in 1940, convened the grand jury that investigated disorders during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. Eight demonstrators and eight policemen were indicted, a result that was criticized by civil liberties groups as too politically tidy.
        Before he joined the Federal bench, Judge Campbell was the United States Attorney in Chicago. In that capacity, he obtained the conviction and jailing of M. L. Annenberg, the Philadelphia newspaper publisher, on charges of income tax evasion.
        He was born in Chicago and graduated from St. Rita College and Loyola University Law School. He was appointed to the bench by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and became a senior judge in 1970.
        Surviving are his wife, Marie; five daughters, Marie Cummings, Karen Reid, Heather Henry, Patty Fazio and Roxanne Sedlacek, and three sons, William Jr., Christian and Thomas.
