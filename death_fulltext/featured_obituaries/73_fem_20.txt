        Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.
        Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.
        Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.
        She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.
        Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.
