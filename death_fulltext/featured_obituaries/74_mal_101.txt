        Gordon A. Juel, a theatrical scenery designer and prop man, died on Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 39 and lived in White Plains.
        He died after a short illness, said his companion, Ralph Marash.
        Mr. Juel was a scene designer and prop person for "Late Night With David Letterman," on NBC, since 1984, and worked on the sets for the 10th anniversary of the Letterman show last year. He was also scenic designer for several PBS programs, including "Cuisine Rapide" with Pierre Franey, and worked for several years in the scene shop at the Metropolitan Opera.
        Mr. Juel studied set design at the University of Minnesota, the New School for Social Research and the Art Students League, and his silk screens have been displayed at several Manhattan galleries. He had a long association with the producer Lucille Lortel, and worked backstage at her theaters in Westport, Conn., and in New York.
        In addition to Mr. Marash, of White Plains, he is survived by his parents, Norman Juel of Scobey, Mont., and Vera Juel of Spokane, Wash.; three brothers, Donald, of Spokane; Paul, of Scobey; and Grant, of Boise, Idaho, and three sisters, Dorothea Puckett of Peerless, Mont., Cecelia Marko of Spokane and Teresa Heck of Sidney, Mont.
