        Edward S. Naumburg Jr., a stockbroker who carried on his family's patronage of music through his work with the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts and the international Naumburg competitions, died on Wednesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. He was 92.
        He lived in Manhattan until eight months ago, when he entered the Greenwich Woods Health Care Facility, a nursing home in Greenwich.
        For more than 25 years, he was president of the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, which have been given free in New York City since 1905. He also served for many years as the treasurer and a member of the board of the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation, which sponsors international competitions in piano, violin, voice and chamber music.
        Mr. Naumburg was a cousin of Walter W. Naumburg, a philanthropist who established the foundation. He was a nephew of Elkan Naumburg, who established the concerts and donated the Naumburg Band Shell in Central Park, which was designed by another of his nephews, William G. Tachau.
        A son of Edward S. Naumburg and the former Lotta Tachau, Mr. Naumburg was born in New York City. He was educated at the Trinity School, the Ethical Culture School and Princeton University, where he was a member of the class of 1924.
        Mr. Naumburg, an accomplished violinist, was also a member of the Grolier Club and the Century Association and was on the board of the library committee at Princeton for many years.
        He is survived by a sister, Eleanor N. Sanger of Manhattan, who with her husband, Elliott M. Sanger, helped found the classical music station WQXR. Mr. Naumburg is also survived by two nephews.
