        Walter Engel, an announcer and political commentator for the Voice of America and an American diplomat in West Germany, died of heart failure Saturday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Engel, who was born in Vienna, worked as a director and actor for the Austrian stage before immigrating to the United States in 1938. He joined the United States Army in 1941, and six years later he was hired by the Voice of America. He worked there until 1956, when he went to West Germany as a diplomat for the United States Foreign Service. He served first in Bonn and later in West Berlin, where he was cultural director of an American-sponsored radio station. Mr. Engel returned to Washington in 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Inge; three daughters, Toni Goncharoff of Aston, Va.; Vicki Engel of Bethesda, and Wendy Murphey of Poolesville, Md.; two sons, Tom of Chicago and Michael of Rockville, Md., and seven grandchildren.
