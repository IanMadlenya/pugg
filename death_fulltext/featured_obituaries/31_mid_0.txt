        To the Editor:
        On Saturday, July 15, at 2:30 on a sunny, lovely afternoon, my wife and I were walking on Madison Avenue at 63d Street, shopping, talking, looking at strolling people and in the store windows, when - and anyone who had read The New York Times on July 13 would have been forewarned - I became a victim. Tomato ketchup hit the back of my head and my shoulders. Two people immediately said they saw where it came from. They assisted my wife with her splattered dress, and offered tissues for my face and clothing. By the time they left, moments later, I had become a double victim. I was still covered with ketchup, and uncovered and gone was my wallet.
        Nice people found my wallet and credit cards and called. My money was gone. The taxi driver who drove us home, surrounded by the smell of two people covered with ketchup, was the first of many who told me about your article describing this and other pickpocket scams. The sad part is that a St. Christopher medal, given to me as a gift by Garry Moore (remember his television program?), which had been with me every day since Christmastime 1954, was gone.
