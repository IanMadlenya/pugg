        Gary Bertini, a conductor and composer who played a significant role in shaping the musical life of Israel, died on March 17 in Tel Hashomer, Israel. He was 77.
        The cause was complications from lymphatic cancer, his Swiss managers, Konzertgesellschaft Basel, told European newspapers.
        A former music director of the Israel Chamber Ensemble and the Jerusalem Symphony, Mr. Bertini was also active internationally, holding posts with the Scottish National Orchestra and Scottish Opera, the Frankfurt Opera, the Detroit Symphony, the Rome Opera and others. At his death he was the music director of the Teatro San Carlo in Naples and artistic director of the New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv.
        Born on May 1, 1927, in Brichevo, Bessarabia (in the present-day Republic of Moldova ), Mr. Bertini emigrated to Palestine with his family as a child and pursued musical studies there, in Milan, and in Paris, where he worked with Nadia Boulanger and Arthur Honegger. Returning to Israel, he founded his own choir and chamber group. He did not make his international debut until he was nearly 40, conducting at Yehudi Menuhin's festival in Bath, England; after initially refusing to work in postwar Germany, he eventually accepted Rolf Liebermann's invitation to conduct at the Hamburg Opera.
        Mr. Bertini ultimately conducted most of the major ensembles in the world, from the Berlin Philharmonic to La Scala in Milan. His wide-ranging repertory extended from the ancient -- Josquin -- to the contemporary -- Ligeti -- with plenty of stops along the way, including acclaimed recordings of Mahler, Berlioz and Brahms. A DVD of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' which he conducted at the Op√©ra National de Paris in 2000, was recently released.
        His final conducting roles, in January, constitued another debut: his first performances in Russia.
