        Pedro Collor de Mello, who made public the political scandal that forced his brother, Fernando, from the Brazilian presidency, died of brain cancer in New York today. His death, at 43, came a week after his brother was acquitted of corruption charges.
        In an epic clash between brothers, Pedro Collor single-handedly unveiled two years ago a multimillion-dollar kickback ring that operated at high levels of President Collor's Government.
        Faced with huge street protests, Mr. Collor resigned the presidency in December 1992. Despite the resignation, Brazil's Senate tried and convicted the charismatic politician of "lack of decorum," banning him from holding public office through the year 2000.
        But in a separate case, Brazil's Supreme Court voted last week to acquit Mr. Collor of charges of benefiting directly from the bribery ring.
        Within hours of hearing this verdict at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Pedro Collor lost his speech and slipped into a coma. He was declared brain dead on Saturday morning.
        "I mourn this new tragedy that has befallen our family," Fernando Collor said in a statement issued from his mansion in Brasilia. "I witnessed the suffering of my brother, I prayed for him, I suffered with him," the former President said. "May God in His infinite goodness grant him light and peace."
        Until the family was split by the allegations of Pedro Collor, he ran their considerable business interests, including a newspaper and radio and television stations, in Alagoas State in the northeastern part of Brazil.
        He broke with his brother early in 1992, in part because President Collor was trying to start a rival media group in Alagoas. Pedro Collar also said he had become outraged at the extortion he said was taking place.
        That same year he underwent a brain scan to disprove family claims that he was insane.
        He is survived by his wife, Tereza, and two sons.
