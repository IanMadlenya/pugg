        Jonathan A. Scoville, a landscape painter, died on Friday at the Geer Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Canaan, Conn. He was 58 years old and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.
        The cause was pneumonia following a long illness and surgery, his family said.
        Mr. Scoville, a descendant of Samuel F. B. Morse, was born in Manhattan and grew up in New York City, New Haven and Cornwall. He graduated from the Browning School in Manhattan and studied art at New York University and the Art Students League. His first solo show was at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston in 1971. His last show, a retrospective, was held in SoHo in 1995 at the Condeso-Lawler Gallery, which had represented his work since 1981.
        Often large and somewhat foreboding, Mr. Scoville's turbulent landscape images were more visionary than realistic. They sometimes emphasized mysterious expanses of sky that seemed to show the forces of nature at work. Other more expressionistic works featured mountains with small tormented figures almost hidden in the layers of paint and seemed to suggest the earth as a living thing mistreated by humans.
        Mr. Scoville was a winner of several fellowships and grants, including three from the MacDowell Colony. His work is represented in collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art in Washington and the Butler Institute in Youngstown, Ohio.
        He is survived by his mother, Laura Richardson Scoville of North Bennington, Vt., and two sisters, Virginia Scoville Sandy, also of North Bennington, and Sally Scoville of West Cornwall.
        Correction:  October 22, 1996, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about the landscape painter Jonathan Scoville, who died on Friday at the age of 58, partially misstated the cause of death. It was indeed pneumonia after a long illness, but no surgery was involved.
