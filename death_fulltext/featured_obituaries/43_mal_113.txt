        Dr. Ebaugh died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said. He had been on medical leave from the Veterans Affairs hospital since July 10.
        Dr. Ebaugh became the hospital's chief of staff in 1972. He recently stepped down as associate dean for veterans affairs and professor of medicine at Stanford University Medical School.
        He was named dean of the Boston University School of Medicine in 1964, and four years later became dean of the University of Utah School of Medicine.
        Dr. Ebaugh, a colonel in the Army Reserves, recently received two of the Department of Veterans Affairs' highest honors: the chief medical director's Commendation and the Secretary's Distinguished Physician Award.
        He was graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in 1944 and received his medical degree from Cornell Medical College in 1946.
        He is survived by his mother, Dorothy Ebaugh of Denver; three daughters, Jeanette Ebaugh of Atlanta, Sandra Ebaugh of Norwalk, Conn., and Patricia Ebaugh of Stonington, Conn., and a sister, Nancy Allen of Tulsa, Okla.
