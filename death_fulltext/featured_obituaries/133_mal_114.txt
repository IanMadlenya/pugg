        John A. Blum, who spent a long career as an advertising and public relations executive with R. H. Macy & Company, died on Tuesday in Colebrook, Conn. He was 82 and lived in Colebrook.
        The cause of death remained undetermined. Mr. Blum was found dead in his car after the vehicle ran off the road while he was returning to his home.
        Mr. Blum joined Macy's before World War II and, apart from a break for military service and a job with Lever Brothers, worked for the department store until 1969. At that time, he resigned and bought Feron's, a tennis shop in New York City that he subsequently expanded into a small chain of stores.
        In his years at Macy's, Mr. Blum rose from a sales job to vice president for advertising and public relations. In that post, he handled not only promotions for the company but also the department store's response to labor confrontations and other issues.
        He is survived by his wife, Nancy Phelps Blum of Colebrook, and two sons, Jonathan Phelps Blum of New York City and Timothy Alexander Blum of Los Angeles.
