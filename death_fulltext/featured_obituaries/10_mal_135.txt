        Irving Levitas, a scholar and lecturer in Jewish history, died yesterday of lung cancer at the Rosary Hill Home in Hawthorne, N.Y. He was 77 years old and lived in Yonkers.
        Since 1975, Mr. Levitas was scholar in residence at Temple Emmanuel in Yonkers. He also lectured in philosophy, Judaica and history at Sullivan County Community College in Loch Sheldrake, N.Y.
        Born in Russia near Kiev, he immigrated to Chicago in 1914. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees in history from the University of Chicago.
        He moved to Kansas City, Mo., where he was director of education for the Jewish Community Center and educational director at Temple B'nai Jehudah. From 1948 to 1962, he lectured in Semitic studies at the University of Kansas.
        In 1962, he came to New York, where he earned a doctorate in history from New York University. In an unusual path, Mr. Levitas was ordained a Reform rabbi by having three prominent rabbis attest to his scholarship and character, rather than attending seminary.
        He is survived by a brother, Robert Levitas of St. Petersburg, Fla.
