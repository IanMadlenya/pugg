        Emile Albert Berol, former president and chairman of the Eagle Pencil Company, later called the Berol Corporation, died at his home in Bedford Hills, N.Y., on Wednesday. He was 81.
        He died after a fall, his family said.
        Mr. Berol was the fifth generation of his family to run the corporation, which was founded by Mr. Berol's great-grandfather, Heinrich Berolzheimer, in Fuerth, Germany, and was moved to New York City in 1856.
        Mr. Berol worked for the company for 42 years, serving as director, treasurer, vice president and then president and chairman from 1936 until 1978. Based in Danbury, Conn., since 1959, the company changed its name from Eagle Pencil to the Berol Corporation in the late 1960's.
        Mr. Berol was appointed honorary chairman in 1979 and continued to help oversee the company until it was sold to the Empire Pencil Corporation of Brentwood, Tenn., in 1987.
        Mr. Berol's great-uncle, Philip Berolzheimer, helped run the company earlier this century before beginning a career in the 1920's in Tammany Hall Democratic politics, serving as the city's Parks Commissioner.
        Mr. Berol was born in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard College, Trinity College at Cambridge University and the Harvard Business School. During World War II, he served as a first lieutenant in the Army Ordnance Corps.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; two daughters, Wendy Gifford of McLean, Va., and J. Robin Bliss of Bedford Hills, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
