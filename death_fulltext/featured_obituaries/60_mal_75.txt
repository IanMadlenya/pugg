        Rodney Griffin, a dancer, choreographer and co-founder of the Theater Dance Collection company, died on Dec. 26 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 46 years old.
        He died of AIDS, said David Haynes, his companion.
        Mr. Griffin trained at the Martha Graham School in Manhattan and performed with Donald McKayle. He appeared on Broadway in "A Time for Singing," "Promises, Promises" and "Molly" and Off Broadway in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of "Peer Gynt." He also appeared in the films "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" and "Stiletto."
        He began choreographing in 1971, when he helped to establish Theater Dance Collection. His best-known dance for the company was "Misalliance," a comic look at the mismating of ballet and modern-dance techniques.
        His dances were also performed by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Bat-Dor Dance Company of Israel and the Milwaukee, Pennsylvania, Hartford and Dayton Ballets.
        He also created dances for productions at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, the Boston Lyric Opera and the Metropolitan Opera. He directed and choreographed productions for the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Conn., for three seasons in the late 1980's.
        He is survived by his parents, William and Lucille, and a brother, Thomas, all of Philadelphia.
