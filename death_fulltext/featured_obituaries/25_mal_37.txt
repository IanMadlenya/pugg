        Arthur Zegart, who was involved in the production of 125 documentaries, many of which he wrote and directed for network television, committed suicide Thursday by jumping off the Tappan Zee Bridge. Mr. Zegart, who had suffered for several years from a blood disease, was 72 years old and lived in Nyack, N.Y.
        His works were shown on such television series as ''NBC White Paper,'' ''Du Pont Show of the Week,'' ''Directions'' on ABC and ''N.E.T. Journal'' on the Public Broadcasting Service. Three of his films were nominated for Emmy awards, including ''Who Speaks for Man?'' on PBS (1969), which examined the role of the United Nations.
        Other documentaries by Mr. Zegart included ''San Quentin Prison,'' for CBS (1954) and ''Maine Lobsterman'' (1955), which he wrote with E. B. White, who narrated it on ''Omnibus'' on CBS. In 1956 he received the Albert Lasker Award for writing and directing ''Wassaic Story'' on CBS, an expose about the care of retarded children at a mental hospital in upstate New York.
        His ''Southeast Asia: The Other War'' on PBS in 1965 was one of the first American films to present the Vietnamese view of the war.
        Mr. Zegart was born in Chicago and attended the University of Chicago. During World War II, he led an Air Force photography unit. In the late 1940's, he was chief of the United Nations film division.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a son, Dan, of Newburgh, N.Y., and a daughter, Caroline, of Manhattan.
