        Doug Tuchman, a concert promoter and disc jockey who was one of the first to bring bluegrass to New York, died on Oct. 6 in Manhattan. He was 63 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his former wife, Gail Tuchman. Mr. Tuchman was on his way to see the Del McCoury Band at the Bowery Ballroom on Delancey Street when he died.
        Mr. Tuchman began promoting bluegrass concerts in New York in 1970, and in 1973 he held the first New York City Bluegrass and Old-Time Country Music Contest and Crafts Fair at the South Street Seaport. By the festival's fifth anniversary Mr. Tuchman was expecting 15,000 to 20,000 during a weekend.
        Mr. Tuchman was born in Brooklyn and discovered bluegrass on the radio. He was the first editor of Pickin' magazine and promoted concerts around the New York area. Among the places that he booked were the New York University student center and the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        He also had a weekly radio show, ''Honky Tonkin','' on WKCR-FM in New York, since 1978.
        His survivors include his daughter, Lauren, of Manhattan, and a brother, Les, of Marco Island, Fla.
