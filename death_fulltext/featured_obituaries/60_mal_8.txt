        Frank G. Carrington, a lawyer who served on a Presidential panel that advocated victims' rights, died in a fire yesterday at his home in Virginia Beach, Va. He was 55.
        Mr. Carrington devoted his legal career to addressing the needs of victims of crime, arguing that they had been overlooked by courts seeking to protect the civil rights of defendants. In 1981 he was appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the Task Force on Victims of Crime. In April 1991, he was honored by President Bush for "outstanding service on behalf of crime victims."
        Mr. Carrington was the director of the Crime Victim's Litigation Project of the National Victim Center, a nonprofit group. He had previously served as executive director and president of Americans for Effective Law Enforcement Inc., a legal foundation created in 1966 largely in response to the success that the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil liberties groups were having representing defendants in cases before the Supreme Court.
        After graduating from Hampden-Sydney College, Mr. Carrington served with the Marine Corps until 1963. He graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in 1960 and received a degree in criminal law from Northwestern University in 1970.
        Mr. Carrington is survived by his wife, the former Mary Olson; two daughters, Christine Winters of Virginia Beach, and Clare McDowell of Richmond, Calif.; a stepson, Daniel R. Willey of Pennsylvania; a step-daughter Christine W. Miller of Virginia Beach, and a sister, Maggie Carrington.
