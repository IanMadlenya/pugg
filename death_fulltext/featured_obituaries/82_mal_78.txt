        John D. Millett, president emeritus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, and the first chancellor of the Ohio Board of Regents, died on Sunday at his home in Cincinnati. He was 81.
        The university said Dr. Millett had been ill for a long time.
        He was an authority on public administration and the financing of higher education, and wrote 20 books on those subjects. His most recent book, "Conflict in Higher Education," was published in 1984.
        Dr. Millett was president of Miami of Ohio from 1953 to 1964, and regents chancellor from 1964 to 1972. From 1972 to 1980, he was a senior vice president of the Academy for International Development in Washington.
        While he was chancellor, the number of Ohio's state universities doubled, from six to 12, and the state's two-year colleges increased from two to 50. In 1964, Miami and Ohio State University opened a new joint branch campus that became Wright State University in Dayton in 1967.
        Dr. Millett returned to Oxford in 1980 to serve as a part-time professor of educational leadership and adjunct professor of political science.
        He received a bachelor's degree from DePauw University in Indiana and master's and doctorate degrees from Columbia University.
        He is survived by his wife, Catherine; three sons, Allan R. and Stephen M., of Columbus, Ohio, and David P., of Atlanta; a sister, Muriel Millett Mount of Battle Ground, Ind., six grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
