        Matityahu Shmuelevitz, a close aide to the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin, died on Sunday. He was 75.
        Yehiel Kadishai, a longtime Begin spokesman, said that doctors at Tel Aviv's  Tel Hashomer Hospital, where Mr. Shmuelevitz was taken after he collapsed on Saturday, reported that the cause of death was a blood clot.
        From 1980 to 1983, Mr. Shmuelevitz served as chief of the Prime Minister's office under Mr. Begin.
        The Polish-born Mr. Shmuelevitz immigrated to Palestine, then ruled by Britain, in 1938 and joined the Lehi, a right-wing Jewish underground group that was also known as the Stern gang. He was imprisoned by the British in 1940, escaped in 1943 and was wounded and recaptured in 1944. He was sentenced to death for firing at a British officer and carrying illegal arms.
        His sentence was commuted to life, but he escaped from jail in February 1948. He was a businessman for many years afterward.
