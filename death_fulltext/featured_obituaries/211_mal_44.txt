        Ward Smith, a manufacturing executive who was the longtime president of the Cleveland Orchestra's board, overseeing a great expansion of that orchestra's budget, endowment and reputation, died last Sunday at his home in Hunting Valley, Ohio. He was 73.
        The cause was cancer, an orchestra spokeswoman said.
        In 1973, Mr. Smith joined the board of the Musical Arts Association, which runs the orchestra and its home, Severance Hall, and was president from 1983 to 1995, when he became board chairman. He held that post until 2002, playing a central role in hiring the orchestra's last two music directors, Christoph von Dohnányi and Franz Welser-Möst.
        Mr. Smith, a Buffalo native, graduated from Harvard and earned a law degree at the University at Buffalo. After practicing in New York, he joined Whitin Machine Works in Whitinsville, Mass., as a lawyer.
        He moved to Cleveland in 1967. In addition to serving with the orchestra, Mr. Smith was on the boards of Gulftech International of Aspen, Colo., Sinclair International of Norwich, England, and other companies. He was a trustee of Case Western Reserve University and served on the Ohio Arts Council and on the American Symphony Orchestra League board.
        He is survived by his wife, Gretchen; three daughters, Jennifer Collison of Kennett Square, Pa., Meredith Weil of Cleveland and Sarah Smith of Manhattan; a son, Jonathan, of Los Angeles; a brother, Andrew, of Manhattan; and five grandchildren.
