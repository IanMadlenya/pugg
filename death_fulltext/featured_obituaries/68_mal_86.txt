        Edward P. Henderson, a retired curator at the Smithsonian Institution who was a leading authority on meteorites and precious metals, died Sept. 12 at Sibley Hospital in Washington. He was 93 years old and lived in Washington.
        Mr. Henderson died of complications from a heart attack, said Thomas Harney, a spokesman for the Smithsonian.
        Born in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Henderson joined the staff of the Smithsonian in 1929 and during his career built the National Museum of Natural History's meteorite collection, now considered to be the largest and finest in the world.
        He was the author of more than 50 scholarly articles on geology and was one of the investigators of the lunar samples returned by the Apollo space missions.
        Mr. Henderson retired in 1965, but continued his work as an honorary research associate until 1988. In 1974 he and his wife, Rebecca Rogers, established the Edward P. Henderson and Rebecca Rogers Henderson Meteorite Fund, which was specifically designated for meteorite collection and research at the Smithsonian.
        Mrs. Henderson died in 1989.
        There are no immediate survivors.
