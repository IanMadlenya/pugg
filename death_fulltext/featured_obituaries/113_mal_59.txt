        Michael Fox, a film, theater and television actor, died last Saturday at the  Motion Picture Home in Los Angeles. He was 75.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his agent, Sid Craig.
        Mr. Fox portrayed many characters in the course of his long career, but was  best known for the role of Saul Feinberg on the CBS soap opera "The Bold and the Beautiful," a part he played for the last eight years. The last episode in which he appears is to be broadcast on June 18.
        He was born in Yonkers, and began acting in the theater, appearing on Broadway in the 1947 play "The Story of Mary Surratt," which starred Lillian Gish. His film credits include "The Longest Yard," "Young Frankenstein" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" He also acted in many television series, including "Perry Mason," "Cagney and Lacey," "E.R." and most recently "N.Y.P.D.  Blue."
        He is survived by his wife, Hannah, and a daughter, Jennifer Fox, both of Los Angeles, and a son, David, of Philadelphia.
        Correction:  June 12, 1996, Wednesday
        An obituary on Monday about Michael Fox, an actor, misidentified the starring actress with whom he appeared in a 1947 Broadway play, "The Story of Mary Surratt." She was Dorothy Gish, not Lillian Gish.
