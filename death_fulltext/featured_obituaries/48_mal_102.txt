        Nicholas Marsicano, who taught painting and drawing at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art for 42 years, died at his home in Woodstock, N.Y., last Sunday. He was 82 years old.
        He died of cancer, his wife, Susan Kamen Marsicano, said.
        Mr. Marsicano began teaching in the late 1930's after studying and painting in France and Morocco on two Barnes Foundation scholarships. He taught for the Works Progress Administration's Education and Research Project, the Artists' Union and the Wayne Art Center in Philadelphia. In 1946, after World War II, he started his 42-year association with Cooper Union, which lasted until he retired in 1988. He also took teaching assignments at several other institutions, including the State University of New York at Purchase, the Brooklyn Museum and Yale University.
        Although Mr. Marsicano was a successful painter whose works are in collections and museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, he believed, his wife said, that his teaching was more important than his painting. He also designed murals for theaters and apartment buildings and created murals for the San Francisco and New York World's Fairs.
        His survivors include his brothers, Arthur and Joseph of Hazleton, Pa., and a sister, Mrs. John Stella Skelps of Linthicum, Md.
