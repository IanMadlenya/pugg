        J. Jacques Stone, a Manhattan lawyer and a leader in Jewish educational, religious and philanthropic causes, died on Tuesday at his home on Manhattan's East Side. He was 89 and also lived in Westport, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Stone was a partner in the firm of Levitt, Rosenberg, Stone & Notkins. After the firm was dissolved, he remained active until a few weeks ago at its East Side office in his own commercial-law practice.
        He was a past president and trustee of the Central Synagogue, at 55th Street and Lexington Avenue, and a life trustee of the UJA-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies. He was a past president of the Board of Jewish Education of Greater New York and of the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods, chancellor of the Jewish Chautauqua Society, adviser to Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, and trustee of the Jewish Braille Institute and the Union of American Hebrew Congregations.
        He was born in Manhattan, graduated from City College in 1928 and received his law degree from Harvard University in 1921.
        Mr. Stone is survived by his wife of 56 years, Janet Iason Stone; their daughters Toni Shore and Carol Pomerantz, both of Manhattan; three sisters, Sara Schwartzberg of Manhattan, Alice Schultz of Wayside, N.J., and Ann Gilbert of Hackensack, N.J., and two grandsons.
