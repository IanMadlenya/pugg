        Allin Whitfield Proudfoot, who headed an agency that specialized in nonprofit fund raising and foundation management, died on Tuesday at a nursing center in Dunedin, Fla. He was 65 and lived in Oldsmar, Fla.
        The cause was a brain tumor, his family said.
        Mr. Proudfoot was born in Chicago and graduated in business administration from Northwestern University, where he also earned an M.B.A. He started his career in sales management at Procter & Gamble, and then held successive marketing positions at several national corporations, including Best Foods and R. J. Reynolds.
        He was the Coca-Cola Company's top United States marketing executive in Atlanta in 1978 when he was named executive vice president for marketing by the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Company in Milwaukee. He returned to Chicago a few years later to work in nonprofit management for the Salvation Army and United Cerebral Palsy, among other organizations. He was particularly active at Northwestern University, where he was a trustee, vice president for development and director of public relations.
        Mr. Proudfoot is survived by his wife of 43 years, Ruth Shumm Proudfoot; two sons, Alfred C., of Irvine, Calif., and Malcolm W., of Downers Grove, Ill.; a daughter, Marcia R. Corenman of Palm Desert, Calif.; a sister, Dorothy C. Crow of Bethesda, Md., and six grandchildren.
