        Greg Rice, an almost unbeatable distance runner of half a century ago who won the 1940 Sullivan Award, died Sunday at the Hackensack (N.J.) Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in River Edge, N.J.
        Gregory Rice Jr. said his father died of complications from a stroke suffered three weeks ago.
        Until his final race, on June 20, 1943, Mr. Rice won 65 major races in a little over three years -- indoors and outdoors -- without a loss. Included were two indoor performances faster than any run before: 13 minutes 45.7 seconds in the three-mile run, at the 1942 national championships at Madison Square Garden, and 8:51 in the two-mile run, at the Cleveland Arena on March 26, 1943.
        In a total of eight races, Mr. Rice lowered these indoor bests, by 10.5 seconds in the three-mile run and by 7 seconds in the two. His best three-mile time was not bettered for 17 years; his two-mile mark prevailed for 9 years.
        The winning streak ended on Randalls Island when the barrel-chested, 5-foot-4 1/2-inch Rice, who two months earlier had enlisted in the United States Maritime Service, lost by 35 yards in the 5,000-meter run at the National Amateur Athletics Union championships to Gunder Haegg of Sweden, who held seven world records.
        "I had just spent two months on a vessel," Mr. Rice said years later. "I stayed with him for a mile or so. Then he just pulled away. I never raced again."
        Joseph Gregory Rice was born in Deer Lodge, Mont., and raised in Missoula, Mont. He gained his championship running form at Notre Dame, working with John P. Nicholson, before graduating in 1939. When he won the Sullivan Award the next year as the best amateur athlete in the United States, his vote total of 1,013 was more than double than that of his nearest competitor.
        Mr. Rice won national titles outdoors in the 5,000-meter run from 1938-42 and indoors in the three-mile run from 1940-43. After his running career, he served as an accountant with Louis Marx & Company, the New York City toy manufacturer, until his retirement in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Monaghan; four sons, Gregory Jr. of Drexel Hill, Pa., Michael of River Edge, Patrick of Albany and John of San Diego, and four daughters, Mary Jane Rice of Washington, Maureen Rice and Kathryn Rice of River Edge and Kam Walenza of North Hackensack.
