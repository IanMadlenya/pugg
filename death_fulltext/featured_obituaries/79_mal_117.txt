        Tice Alexander, an interior designer in New York who was known for the elegance of his rooms, died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 35.
        His companion, Glenn Albin, said the cause was AIDS.

        He was a contributing editor for Connoisseur magazine, for which he wrote a monthly column called Connoisseur's Choice. The magazine is no longer published.
        Mr. Alexander was born in Kansas City and attended the University of Kansas and the Kansas City Art Institute before graduating from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan in 1980.
        He is survived by his companion; his mother, Lorna Burge of Kansas City; his father and stepmother, Bill J. and Jinny Alexander of Kansas City, and a brother, Britton, of Chicago.
