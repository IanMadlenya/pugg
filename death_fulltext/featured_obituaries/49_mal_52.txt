        Ralph E. Page, an inventor who received more than 50 patents during a 43-year career with the International Business Machines Corporation, died on Sunday at his home in Hyde Park, N.Y. He was 95 years old.
        Among Mr. Page's inventions were an I.B.M. collator that was notable in organizing records for the Social Security system. Another was the first machine to sort fingerprints.
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Page helped devise the 407 accounting machine, the first product to produce $1 billion in revenue for I.B.M.. He also developed key-punching machines, electric typewriters and the first Braille typewriter.
        Mr. Page, who was born in Picture Rocks, Pa., and attended the University of Michigan, went to work in 1917 for the Tabulating Machine Company in Endicott, N.Y., a forerunner of I.B.M. In 1943 he became the first manager and chief engineer of I.B.M.'s Poughkeepsie laboratory.
        His first wife, the former Helen Ormsby, died in 1931. His second wife, the former Ruth Fairfield, died in 1984.
        Survivors include a son, David, of Milton, N.Y.; two daughters, Joan Watson of Hyde Park and Barbara Donaldson of La Grange, N.Y., 15 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.
