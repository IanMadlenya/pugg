        Mr. Witty, a graduate of Syracuse University, held a law degree from Fordham University. He retired from the clothing manufacturing and retailing business in 1960, when the Witty family business, which had been founded in 1888, was sold, and joined his brother Arthur in real estate development in the Virgin Islands.
        Surviving are his wife, Cecile; two sons, Kenneth, of Manhattan and Stephen, of Colorado Springs; three brothers, Ephraem and Spencer, of Manhattan, and Arthur, of St. Thomas, V.I., and three grandchildren.
