        Charles H. Ross Jr., a retired executive vice president of Merrill Lynch & Company, died last Friday in Rumson, N.J. He was 57.
        He died as a result of a fire at his home, the company said.
        Mr. Ross, who spent his entire career at Merrill Lynch, was a major figure in the development of the company over the last few decades. He joined the company in 1961 as an executive trainee, rising through the ranks to become president of Merrill Lynch Asset Management and later the chairman of Merrill Lynch International.
        He is survived by his wife, Beth, of Rumson; a daughter, Megan Ross, of Ketchum, Idaho; his mother, Margaret Ross, of Red Bank, N.J., and his sister, Norah McCormack, of Metuchen, N.J.
