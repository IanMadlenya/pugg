        Archbishop Proulx, of the Roman Catholic Church's Gatineau-Hull diocese in western Quebec Province, gained a reputation as a critic of inequality between rich and poor, and supported a 1983 statement by the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the economy for failing to meet the needs of the poor.
        Archbishop James M. Hayes, vice president of the bishops' conference, called him a ''conscience of the church who expressed his social concern in a clear and eloquent way.''
