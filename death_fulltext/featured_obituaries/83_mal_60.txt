        Peter Alan Gloo, a pianist and singer of popular music at Manhattan nightclubs for a decade, died on Dec. 3 at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York. He was 37.
        The cause was AIDS, said his mother, Joan Gloo, of Mohawk, N.Y.
        Mr. Gloo, who lived in Manhattan, was a founding member of Hearts and Voices, a group of performing artists who entertained in the AIDS wards of New York City hospitals. He graduated from Williams College in 1978.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father, Donald Gloo of Mohawk; four brothers, Stephen, of Herkimer, N.Y., Theodore, of Utica, N.Y., Donald, of Arlington, Va., and James, of Mohawk, and two sisters, Donna, of East Hampton, Conn., and Ellen, of Boston.
