        Lynn Stanford, a ballet accompanist who played at the School of American Ballet and for such performers as Margot Fonteyn and Mikhail Baryshnikov, died on Tuesday at Baylor University Hospital in Dallas. He was 44 years old.
        He died of melanoma, said Robert Larkin, his press representative.
        Mr. Stanford began training as a concert pianist in his hometown, Ector, Tex., but decided that this profession would be too lonely. He was invited to play for ballet classes at the Dallas Civic Ballet in 1971 and went on to New York City, where he found work at several dance studios, including those of Martha Graham, American Ballet Theater and David Howard.
        He was known for his improvisations on contemporary popular music rather than the ballet scores used in most classes. Many leading ballet dancers taped his class music for home practice, and Mr. Stanford recorded 20 albums on his own Dallas-based recording label, Bodarc Productions. He also composed the score for the Broadway musical "The Boys of Winter" and for several ballets.
        His companions were Robert Weigel and Clifton Pine.
        He is survived by his mother, Maggie Stanford of Waco, Tex., and a sister, Carol Bucy of Nashville.
