        Mr. Gervasi's father, Frank, said his son, who was known as Tom, died of complications from lead and aluminum poisoning, contracted while casting thousands of miniature soldiers, which was his hobby.
        A specialist in military affairs, Mr. Gervasi wrote several nonfiction works, including ''The Myth of Soviet Military Supremacy'' and the two-volume ''Arsenal of Democracy,'' a study of American military power. He was public relations director for Viking Press and later worked for Linguaphone Corporation of America.
        In addition to his father, a Manhattan resident, he is survived by his wife, the former Winifred Odell, and a brother, Sean, of Fremont, L.I.
