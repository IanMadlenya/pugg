        Alexander Coburn Soper 3d, a distinguished historian of Asian art who taught at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York City for more than 30 years, died yesterday at his home in Rosemont, Pa. He was 88.
        He died of heart failure, said a spokeswoman for the institute.
        Mr. Soper was born on Feb. 18, 1904, in Chicago. He earned a B.A. degree from Hamilton College in 1925 and a Masters degree in architecture from Princeton University in 1929. After a period spent living in Japan, he shifted his interests to art history and received a Ph.D. in that field from Princeton in 1944. He taught at Bryn Mawr College before arriving at the Institute of Fine Arts in 1960. Although he retired from full-time teaching nearly a decade ago, he continued to advise doctoral students at the institute.
        Mr. Soper was known for the breadth of his Asian-art scholarship, publishing books and articles on subjects ranging from Japanese architecture to early Indian Buddhist sculpture. He was co-author of standard texts on the art and architecture of both China and Japan and was editor of the journal Artibus Asiae from 1958 until his death.
        Mr. Soper was a widower. He is survived by a brother, Arthur, a son, John, of New Hampshire, and four grandchildren.
