        Norman Raab, a co-founder of the Villager line of women's clothing that was a mainstay of country club and collegiate style in the 1960's, died Saturday at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. He was 89.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, his family said.
        Villager style made its appearance in the late 1950's, featuring a classic preppy look of casual sophistication, with small prints, pleated skirts and Peter Pan collars worn with a circle pin.
        The clothing line prospered with the rise of well-to-do suburbs, as high-end retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue featured the brand.
        Villager became so popular by the mid-60's that Mr. Raab and his brother, Max, the other founder, introduced the Ladybug apparel line as an offshoot for juniors. At its peak, Villager reached $140 million in annual sales and then sold itself to a sportswear manufacturer in 1969; the Raabs left the apparel business.
        The Villager brand is now owned by Liz Claiborne, which still markets its dresses and accessories.
        Norman Raab was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 10, 1915. He graduated from Simon Gratz High School in 1934 and attended Penn State University, where he played for the lacrosse team. Mr. Raab dropped out of college to help support his family through the Depression, his brother said.
        Norman Raab served as a bombardier navigator in Europe in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.
        He retired to Florida at age 54 for a life of sport fishing, boating and medical philanthropy. He once negotiated, unsuccessfully, to buy the Philadelphia Eagles professional football franchise.
        Mr. Raab's first wife, Kristine Isabel Morrison, died. He is survived by his second wife, Christine Brooks; his sons, Stephen and Whitney; his brother; and four grandchildren.
