        Warren Mehrtens, 1 of only 10 jockeys to win thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown, died Tuesday in Sarasota, Fla. He was 77.
        Over a 12-year riding career, Mehrtens rode 614 winners and earned more than $3.5 million in purses. But no stretch of racing ever matched the five-week run he made in 1946 aboard Assault, a Texas-bred 3-year-old colt owned by the King Ranch and trained by Max Hirsch.
        At odds of 8-1, Assault won the Kentucky Derby by eight lengths over Spy Song, then nearly blew a four-length lead before capturing the Preakness Stakes by a neck over Lord Boswell.
        In the Belmont Stakes, Assault stumbled out of the gate, but recovered and rallied to win by three lengths, the seventh time the three-race sweep had been accomplished.
        A native of Brooklyn and a former diver at Jamaica High School, Mehrtens began his riding career in 1939 under the tutelage of Hirsch. He rode his first winner, Kiosk, a year later.
        After retiring as a jockey, Mehrtens became a racing official, serving at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Ky., and Delaware Park in Wilmington. He also became a steward for the New York Racing Association in 1973.
        Mehrtens is survived by his wife Noreen, four children and eight grandchildren.
        His death is the second in less than two months involving a jockey who won the Triple Crown. Eddie Arcaro, winner aboard Whirlaway in 1941 and Citation in 1948, died Nov. 14.
