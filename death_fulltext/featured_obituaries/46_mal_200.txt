        Bulent Arel, a composer and teacher best known for his electronic music, died on Saturday at University Hospital in Stony Brook, L.I. He was 71 years old and lived in East Setauket, L.I.
        Daria Semegen, a close friend and colleague, said Mr. Arel died of multiple myeloma.
        Mr. Arel was born in Istanbul on April 23, 1919. He studied composition at the Ankara Conservatory and sound engineering in Paris. In Ankara, he taught at the conservatory, established the Helikon Society of Contemporary Arts and was the first music director of Radio Ankara from 1951 to 1959. He was also a painter and sculptor, and several of his works are in the permanent collection of the Turkish National Gallery.  Invited to Join Laboratory
        It was his early efforts in electronic music, however, that attracted the most attention outside Turkey, and in 1959 he accepted an invitation from the Rockefeller Foundation to join the staff of a project the foundation was financing, the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in New York City, one of the world's first sophisticated electronic music laboratories. His colleagues at the center were the composers Milton Babbitt, Vladimir Ussachevsky and Mario Davidovsky. In 1962, Mr. Arel worked with Edgard Varese on the electronic sections of Varese's "Deserts."
        Mr. Arel designed and installed the electronic music laboratory at Yale University, where he taught from 1961 to 1970, and he established the electronic music program at the State University at Stony Brook, where he taught from 1971 until he retired in 1989. Besides electronic works, Mr. Arel wrote chamber music, vocal works and symphonic pieces, including a series of works commissioned in recent years by the Mimi Garrard Dance Theater.
        He is survived by a son, Emre Arel of Salzburg, Austria; a daughter, Lale Arel Boysan of Chatsworth, Calif., and three grandsons.
