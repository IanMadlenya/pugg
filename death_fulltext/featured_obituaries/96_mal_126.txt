        Henry Gladstone, a newscaster on the New York radio station WOR for 32 years, died on Sunday in San Diego, where he moved after his retirement in 1977. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Gladstone, who was born in Boston, graduated from the University of Toronto. He studied acting in New York and appeared in several Off Broadway productions in the 1930's.
        He subsequently worked on variety shows and news broadcasts in Boston before returning to New York as an announcer for WHN. During World War II, he narrated documentaries for "The March of Times."
        He began to broadcast the news on WOR in 1942, and after the war, was the station's United Nations correspondent.
        Mr. Gladstone is survived by a daughter, Valerie Gladstone; three sons, Stephen, John and Whitney; four stepdaughters, Alison Bankes, Kristine Washburn, Marion Orwin and Judith Van Ingen; nine grandchildren, and two step-grandchildren.
