        Bob Carroll, a veteran film and stage actor, died last Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 76 and lived in Port Washington, L.I.
        He died after a long illness, said Earl Kirmser, a friend.
        Best known for his portrayal of Tevye in the national tour of "Fiddler on the Roof" in the early 1970's, Mr. Carroll also appeared on stage as Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia in "Fiorello" and in "La Cage aux Folles," "Shenandoah" and "Beau Jest." His film credits included "Betrayed," "Seventh Avenue" and "The Prowler," and he was often on television, on the "Tonight" show with Johnny Carson and in "Another World," "The Edge of Night" and "Get Smart."
        Mr. Carroll was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and grew up in Brooklyn. He began his career as a singer with some of the well- known big bands of the 1940's, including Jimmy Dorsey's and Glenn Miller's, and he later appeared as a baritone soloist in concerts with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Florida Orchestra and the New York Pops under Skitch Henderson.
        He is survived by his wife, Nadine; four daughters, Jody Carroll and Laura Doland, of Port Washington; Melanie Carroll of Manhattan, and Chris Osmond of Pleasant Grove, Utah; a son, Keith, of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
