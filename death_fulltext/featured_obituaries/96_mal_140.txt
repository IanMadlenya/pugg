        Dr. Leopoldo M. Falicov, a theoretical physicist and professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley, died on Tuesday at the Alta Bates Hospital in Berkeley. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer of the esophagus, the university said.
        Dr. Falicov worked in condensed matter physics, which involves the study of solids and solid surfaces. Using the principles of quantum physics in the 1960's, he calculated the definitive electronic structures of metals, including magnesium, zinc, cadmium, arsenic and antimony. His studies of surface magnetism laid a theoretical foundation for efforts to improve magnetic recording devices.
        He was born in Buenos Aires and received doctorates in physics at the Instituto J. A. Balseiror of the University of Cuyo in Argentina and the University of Cambridge. He taught at the University of Chicago before joining the faculty at Berkeley in 1969, where he was chairman of the physics department from 1981 to 1983. He retired last year.
        Dr. Falicov was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Physical Society.
        He is survived by his wife, Marta; two sons, Alexis, of San Francisco, and Ian, of Herndon, Va., and a sister, Estela, of Buenos Aires.
