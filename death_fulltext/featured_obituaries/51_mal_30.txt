        David Kay, a retired pharmaceutical industry executive, died on Wednesday at his home in Pompano, Fla. He was 86 years old.
        He died of heart failure, a family spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Kay came to the United States in 1927 from his native Russia. He joined the Purepac Corporation, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, in 1934 as a production worker. After rising through the ranks, he was named chief executive officer in 1954 and retired in 1959. He worked as a consultant to the industry until 1981.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Irene Silberman; three sons, Eugene, of Aberdeen, N.J., Gerald, of Glen Rock, N.J., and Robert, of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
