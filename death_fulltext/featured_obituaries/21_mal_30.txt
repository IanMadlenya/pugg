        Clarence Carnes, the only inmate not killed or executed after a 1946 escape attempt from Alcatraz, died Monday at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Carnes, then 18, was sent to Alcatraz, then a Federal prison island in San Francisco Bay, in 1945. He was the youngest inmate ever incarcerated there, having been transferred after trying twice to escape from an Oklahoma prison, where he was serving a term for murder.
        Early in 1946 Mr. Carnes was drawn into an escape plot with five other inmates that went awry. Two guards and three inmates were killed, and two other convicts were later executed. Mr. Carnes was spared the death penalty because he had refused to kill several guards as ordered. He was paroled in 1973, but his parole was revoked twice for minor infractions.
