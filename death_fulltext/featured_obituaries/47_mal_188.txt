        Sayed Tawfik, Egypt's chief archeologist and chairman of antiquities, died of a heart attack on Thursday, friends and newspapers reported on Friday. He was 54 years old.
        Mr. Tawfik, a former dean of archeology and professor of Egyptology at Cairo University, was the author of a half-dozen books on Egyptian antiquities.
        As chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization, he was in charge of all restoration and conservation work on Egypt's vast legacy of pyramids, tombs, temples and other relics threatened by time, pollution and the demands of an exploding population.
        But among Egyptologists, he is remembered most as an excavator, especially for his work on a windblown bluff overlooking the ancient royal burial grounds of Sakkara south of Cairo.
        He began the excavation eight years ago. In 1985 he uncovered an unknown burial ground from the time of Pharaoh Ramses II, tombs hidden 33 feet below the desolate hillside, which yielded a rich store of data about some of the most important officials of the Egypt of 3,250 years ago.
        Friends said Mr. Tawfik had been at Sakkara on Thursday. That night he suffered a heart attack and died instantly. He was buried on Friday.
        Survivors include his German-born wife, Frieda; a son, Tarek, an Egyptology student at Cairo University, and a daughter, Sophie, a pupil at a German school in Cairo.
