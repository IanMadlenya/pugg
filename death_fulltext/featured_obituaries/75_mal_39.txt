        Cyril Francis O'Neil Jr., the senior partner and a founder of Richards & O'Neil, a New York City law firm, died yesterday at his home in Bedford, N.Y. He was 60 years old.
        The cause was cancer, said Hugh J. Freund, managing partner of the firm.
        Mr. O'Neil founded the firm with Stewart W. Richards in 1971. The firm grew from six lawyers to 55. Mr. Richards died before Mr. O'Neil.
        A specialist in corporate law, Mr. O'Neil devoted a large part of his practice to venture capital transactions and mergers and acquisitions.
        Mr. O'Neil was born in Cleveland. He graduated from Harvard in 1954 and received a law degree from Harvard in 1959. He began practicing law in 1960, and in his early years represented clients in a number of libel and censorship cases.
        He was a member of the board of directors of the Cymaron Foundation, a charitable foundation established by his family. He also served on the board of trustees of the University School in Cleveland and was a board member of the Arizona-Colorado Land & Cattle Company and several privately held corporations.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Priscilla Work; three sons, Ian, Cyril 3d and Aaron, all of Bedford; two brothers, Ralph, of Aurora, Ohio, and Eugene, of Greenwich, Conn., and a sister, Sister M. Anne O'Neil of Jakarta, Indonesia.
