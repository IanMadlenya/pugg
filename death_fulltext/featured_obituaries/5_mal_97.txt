        Kid Thomas Valentine, the last of the ''roughhouse'' trumpet players and longtime leader of the Preservation Hall jazz band, died Tuesday night. He was believed to be 91 years old.
        One of the trumpeter's grandsons, Winston Whitten, said funeral services would be held Friday. ''It won't be a jazz funeral because he didnt want a jazz funeral,'' Mr. Whitten said. ''He never did give us a reason. But as far back as I can remember he said he never wanted a jazz funeral.
        Kid Thomas last performed at Preservation Hall in the French Quarter of New Orleans last September, when he sat in with his band on second trumpet.
        There was dispute about his age. Mr. Whitten said his grandfather had turned 91 on Feb. 3, but Preservation Hall literature put the birthdate at Feb. 3, 1896.
        The son of a trumpet player, and a performer since he was a teen-ager, Kid Thomas was a natural showman who played a wide variety of music and was considered a major figure in the New Orleans jazz revival.
        Musicians described his music as ''roughhouse'' - loud, stomping, exuberant jazz fashioned in Mississippi delta dance halls.
        Kid Thomas's band, the Algiers Stompers, used an old French Quarter art gallery for night rehearsals, began drawing crowds and, in effect, made Preservation Hall happen.
        He is survived by two sons, two daughters, 26 grandchildren in addition to Mr. Whitten, 51 great-grandchildren and three great-great grandchildren.
