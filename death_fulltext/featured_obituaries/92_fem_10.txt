        Edith Sherin Markson, a promoter of regional theater in the United States and the founder of an exchange program for American and Eastern European theater artists, died on Saturday during a visit to Santa Fe, N.M. She was 81 and lived in New York City.
        The cause was heart failure after a stroke, said her daughter, Mary Markson Dawe.
        In the 1950's Mrs. Markson was among the founders of the Milwaukee Repertory Theater, and she later helped found the American Conservatory Theater in Pittsburgh before the company moved to San Francisco in 1967; until 1980, she was vice president of the theater's board.
        Mrs. Markson also created the Theater International Exchange Services Foundation, an organization that arranged for collaborations, both here and abroad, between American theater artists and administrators and their counterparts in Eastern Europe.
        In addition to Mrs. Dawe, of Milwaukee, she is survived by a son, Simpson Markson of New Jersey; a brother, the producer and director Edwin Sherin of New York City, and three grandchildren.
