        David A. Charny, a Harvard Law School professor who was an expert on employment and corporate law and who advised student demonstrators, died on Aug. 31 at his home in Cambridge, Mass. He was 44.
        He died after a short illness, said Michael J. Chmura, the law school's news director.
        Professor Charny had taught at the law school since 1984 and had held its David Berg chair of law since last year.
        He was best known at the school for his courses on contracts and corporations, both of which he taught for more than a decade.
        In 1992, he was prominent among the law school faculty members who provided legal advice to student demonstrators demanding greater diversity in the faculty after the appointment of four white faculty members. The demonstrators staged a brief sit-in in the hall outside the office of the school's dean, Robert Clark. The sit-in was one of a series at the law school, concerning diversity in its faculty, that took place in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The school's faculty has become considerably more diverse in recent years.
        Professor Charny was born and reared in Pittsburgh. He received a bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Yale University and a law degree magna cum laude from Harvard.
        He is survived by his partner, Ahmad H. Tabari; his parents, Margaret and Dr. E. Joseph Charny of Pittsburgh; a sister, Sharon Charny of Baltimore; and a brother, Joel R., of Washington.
