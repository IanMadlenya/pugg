        Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter Jr., the former owner of the Philadelphia Phillies, died of cancer Sunday. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. Carpenter was named president of the Phillies in 1943, when his father, R. R. M. Carpenter Sr., bought the team for $400,000. At 28, Mr. Carpenter became the youngest owner in the major leagues.
        For the next two seasons, while Mr. Carpenter served in the Army, the team - renamed the Blue Jays - finished in last place. But the 1949 team, once again called the Phillies, finished third and he was named Major League Executive of the Year.
        The following season, the Phillies won their first pennant in 35 years and only the second in team history.
        Mr. Carpenter is survived by his wife, Mary Kaye; two sons, Ruly and Keith; a daughter, Mary Kaye Murray; a sister, Irene Carpenter Draper, and four grandchildren.
