        Richard J. Duffin, a mathematician who made important contributions in several areas of his field, died on Oct. 29 at his home in Pittsburgh. He was 87.
        Dr. Duffin was the University Professor of Mathematical Sciences emeritus at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he was on the faculty for four decades.
        Victor J. Mizel, a professor of mathematical sciences at the university, said Dr. Duffin's contributions included work on electrical network theory, which has applications in electronic engineering.
        The main areas of Dr. Duffin's research were graphs and networks, mathematical programming, differential equations and mathematical modeling.
        He published more than 180 papers and was a co-author of a book, ''Geometric Programming,'' which introduced algorithms for achieving optimum solutions to nonlinear engineering design problems.
        His achievements led to his induction into the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.
        Ten years later he was awarded the John von Neumann Theory Prize of the Operations Research Society of America and the Institute of Management Sciences.
        Richard James Duffin was born in Chicago in 1909 and earned a bachelor's degree in engineering and a doctorate in physics from the University of Illinois.
        He taught at Purdue University and the University of Illinois and in World War II was a research physicist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, where he worked on navigational devices and mine detectors.
        In 1946 he joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty, becoming an emeritus professor in 1988.
        For many years Dr. Duffin was also a research consultant at the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, where he worked on industrial projects.
        He is survived by two daughters, Martha and Ginny, both of Pittsburgh. His wife, Jeanne, died two years ago.
