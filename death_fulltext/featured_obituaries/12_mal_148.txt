        Mr. Majeski underwent coronary bypass surgery and the replacement of a heart valve Dec. 15.
        The executive editor of the picture service of the agency since 1968, Mr. Majeski boasted of never having taken a news picture in his career. But he was celebrated for a keen eye in recognizing a good picture.
        He produced one of the best-remembered pictures of President John F. Kennedy's funeral in 1963, when he cropped a group shot of family mourners to show just John Jr.'s salute to his father.
        Mr. Majeski was born in Drexel Hill, Pa. He joined Acme Newspictures, the predecessor of U.P.I. Photos, in 1941 and was in charge of the radio and photography section of the Signal Corps in World War II.
        He was named a United Press International vice president in 1983. When U.P.I. sold its international newspicture operation to Reuters in 1983, Mr. Majeski helped establish exchanges between Reuters and U.P.I. in the United States.
        Surviving are his wife, Marie; a daughter, Blanche, and a granddaughter.
