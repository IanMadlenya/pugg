        Chester Santon, a radio announcer for 44 years, 38 of them at WQXR in New York, died last Thursday at Dobbs Ferry Hospital. He was 78 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
        He was a native of Northampton, Mass. He started his career in 1936 and later worked for stations in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Richmond, as well as for Mutual and CBS in New York.
        In 1942 he joined WQXR, the classical music station of The New York Times. In the 1950's and 60's he was in charge of the station's "Adventures in Sound" program, an hourlong Sunday broadcast of recordings, including stereo tapes and disks.
        In the 1960's he was also the "light listening" record reviewer for Audio magazine.
        He retired as a WQXR staff announcer in 1980 at 64.
        Mr. Santon is survived by his wife of 52 years, Geraldine Runk Santon; two daughters, Christine Mumbower of Albuquerque, N.M., and Patricia Siciliano of Manhattan; a sister, Franciska Duda of Northampton, Mass., and five grandsons.
