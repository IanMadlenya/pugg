        John Binnington, the man who started the Research Library at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1947 and built it into a prime repository of scientific and technical knowledge on Long Island, died of pneumonia Tuesday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital. He was 82 and lived in the hamlet of Brookhaven.
        When Mr. Binnington arrived in 1947 to become assistant librarian, he was the first resident of the housing within the laboratory grounds, a former Army base, Camp Upton. He was named head of the Research Library in 1952 and held that position until his retirement in 1979.
        Mr. Binnington, a leader of the Brookhaven Employees Recreation Association and its theater group, was largely responsible for attracting star performers to give concerts at the laboratory in the 1960's. He also helped create the Long Island Library Resource Council and the Suffolk Cooperative Library System.
        He was born in London and received degrees from the University of the South in Tennessee, Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and Columbia University, including a master's degree in library science in 1941 from Columbia. Before joining Brookhaven, he was a librarian at the University of Rhode Island and the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, L.I.
        Mr. Binnington is survived by his son, Thomas, of Bellport, L.I.; two daughters, Bree Rice, also of Bellport, and Marjorie Braxton of DeWitt, N.Y.; two stepdaughters, Vijaya Maclean of Lancaster, Mass., and Loveday Kochersberger of Bellport; a brother, Gerald, of Portland, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.

        An obituary yesterday about John Binnington, who developed the research library at Brookhaven National Laboratory, omitted a survivor. She is his widow, Julia Binnington of Brookhaven, L.I.
