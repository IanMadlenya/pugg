        Edgar C. Campbell Sr., a court clerk and former City Council member who was one of the first blacks to wield political power in Philadelphia, died Wednesday. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Campbell was nearly 65 when he was first elected to public office as an at-large member of the council. He was 72 when he was elected quarter sessions clerk, heading an agency that maintains criminal records for Municipal Court and Common Pleas Court.
        In 1983 he became, briefly, chairman of the city Democratic committee, the first black ever to hold that post.
