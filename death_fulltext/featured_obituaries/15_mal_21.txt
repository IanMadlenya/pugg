        Hamdija Pozderac, who resigned as Vice President of Yugoslavia last September in a major financial scandal, died of a stroke today, the state press agency Tanyug said. He was 64 years old.
        Mr. Pozderac, was admitted to a hospital several days ago after a stroke and never recovered. He died in Sarajevo, capital of the central Yugoslav republic Bosnia-Herzegovina, his home region.
        His brother Hakija, 69, is awaiting trial in connection with the scandal, in which a Bosnian agro-industrial concern, Agrokomerc, issued almost $1 billion worth of promissory notes, without financial guarantees, to finance an ambitious expansion program. The Pozderac family was Agrokomerc's chief political backer.
