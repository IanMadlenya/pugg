        Sybil Claiborne, a novelist and short story writer, died Wednesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. She was 69.
        She died of lung cancer, said Grace Paley, the writer, who was a friend.
        Ms. Claiborne was active in the antiwar movement and frequently wrote in opposition to the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. She was a board member of the War Resister's League for many years.
        Ms. Claiborne was in her 50's when her first stories began to appear in magazines like The New Yorker and Esquire. Some of her writing was the basis for a program of comedy-dramas performed in Manhattan in 1978 at Symphony Space.
        Her book "Loose Connections," a collection of short stories, was published by Academy Chicago in 1988, and a novel, "A Craving for Women," was published by Dutton in 1989.
        Last year she completed "In the Garden of Dead Cars," which is to be published by Cleis in the spring. It is a work of fiction that again reflects her abhorrence of war and tyranny, Ms. Paley said.
        At her death, Ms. Claiborne was chairwoman of the Women's Committee of PEN, the writers' organization. She was also a member of the National Writers' Union, of which her husband, Robert Claiborne, was an organizer and founder. He died last year. Her only son, Jan Stacey, died in 1990.
        She is survived by a stepdaughter, Amanda Claiborne Shulman of Cambridge, Mass.; a stepson, Sam Claiborne of Brooklyn; a grandson, Matthew Shulman, and a brother, David Resnik of Stockbridge, Mass.

        The headline on the obituary of a writer and antiwar campaigner yesterday rendered her last name incorrectly in some copies. She was Sybil Claiborne.
