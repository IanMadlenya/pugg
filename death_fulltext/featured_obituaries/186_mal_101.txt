        Maurice Denham, a British character actor whose face was familiar in movies and television but who achieved his greatest fame playing a gallery of characters in the hit British radio shows ''It's That Man Again'' and ''Much Binding in the Marsh,'' died last Wednesday in London. He was 92.
        He was known as a man of a thousand voices, playing a succession of Royal Air Force officers, small-time crooks, vicars, clerks and bureaucrats in nearly 1,000 radio broadcasts. He also played mostly supporting roles in roughly 100 films and many more television broadcasts. He had notable appearances in ''The Day of the Jackal'' and ''Our Man in Havana'' and provided all the animal voices in the 1955 animated version of ''Animal Farm.''
        William Maurice Denham was born on Dec. 23, 1909. He began his professional acting career onstage, joining a weekly repertory company in 1934. He later worked in West End theaters and radio productions at the BBC. After interrupting his career to serve in the army during the war, he played multiple characters in ''Much Binding in the Marsh,'' a long-running 1950's comedy series about the bumbling efforts of the Royal Air Force at a remote World War II air station. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1992.
        His wife, Margaret Dunn, died in 1971. He is survived by two sons and a daughter.
