        Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died Saturday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
        Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection, and despite those comforts, developed an early sense of social justice.
        She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, a son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman became a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, was involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was also one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.
