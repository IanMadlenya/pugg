        Thomas Eldredge Lawrence, a computer consultant, died on Friday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. He was 73 years old and lived in Cambridge.
        He died of heart disease, a funeral home representative said.
        Mr. Lawrence was most recently a consultant to Adcole, a Boston company. Formerly he was president of the New York subsidary of ICL, a British computer manufacturing company known for many years as International Computer Ltd.
        During World War II he served at the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and afterward joined the Laboratory for Electronics, a Boston subsidary of the British Tabulating Company. In 1958 he moved to British Tabulating, which merged into ICL in the late 1960's.
        Mr. Lawrence, a 1946 graduate of Harvard University, retired from ICL in 1974 and became a consultant.
        He is survived by a son, Peter, of Boston; two daughters, Alida Lawrence of Springfield, Mass., and Rebecca Hickman of Phoenix: two sisters, Barbara Shevill of Concord, Mass., and Caroline Whiteside of Scottsville, Va., and three grandchildren.
