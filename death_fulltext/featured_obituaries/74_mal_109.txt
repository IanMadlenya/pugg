        Aleck Leitman, a manufacturer who supported Jewish causes and Israel, died on Thursday at the Hallandale medical center in Hollywood, Fla. A resident of New York City and Hollywood, he was 105.
        His death came after a two-month illness, said Norbert Efros, his nephew.
        Mr. Leitman was born in Lithuania. He came to New York as a teen-ager and, in 1918, he began to deal in military survival gear for all branches of service. He started manufacturing his own equipment in World War II in Manhattan. His company, Lite Industries, is now based in Paterson, N.J., and he was still its president at the time of his death.
        A strong backer of Israel, Mr. Leitman endowed scholarship funds at several Israeli institutions, including Hebrew University, Technion and Ben Gurion University. He contributed to the Hadassah women's organization, among others.
        Mr. Leitman is survived by his wife of 46 years, Reggie Leitman; a stepdaughter, Shirley B. Loeb of Riverside, Calif.; a stepson, Jerome Jacobi of Malibu, Calif., and a brother, Aaron Leitman of Margate, Calif.
