        John D. Betz, former chief executive officer of Betz Laboratories Inc., a leader in waste water treatment, died Saturday at his home here. He was 72 years old.
        Mr. Betz, who also owned a share of the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, died of cancer, an associate said.
        Mr. Betz started his career in the laboratory founded in 1925 by his father, L. Drew Betz. The son became president, chairman and chief executive officer and, in 1975, chairman emeritus.
        Under Mr. Betz's leadership, the company, based in Trevose, Pa., grew from a family partnership to a publicly owned corporation with annual sales exceeding $500 million and 3,400 employees at 22 plants. It makes specialty chemicals for industrial and commercial water treatment.
        In 1981 Mr. Betz and five partners bought the Phillies for $30.18 million.
        He founded the JDB Fund, a charity that helps organizations and environmental projects in the Philadelphia area.
        He is survived by his wife, Claire; and three sons, John Drew Jr., Michael J. and Steven C.; three daughters, Jacqueline B. Murphy, Marian B. DiMaria and Joan B. LaRocco, and 15 grandchildren.
