        Herbert L. Strock, a television producer and director who directed B-movies like ''I Was a Teenage Frankenstein,'' ''How to Make a Monster'' and ''The Crawling Hand,'' died here on Wednesday. He was 87.
        The cause was heart failure after a car accident, according to his daughter, Leslie Mitchner.
        In a television career that began in the 1940's, Mr. Strock worked on series including ''Highway Patrol,'' ''Sky King,'' ''Sea Hunt,'' ''Maverick'' and ''77 Sunset Strip.''
        His creature features included ''Blood of Dracula'' and ''Gog,'' shot in 3-D.
        Mr. Strock, who was born in Boston, moved with his family to Los Angeles when he was 13. By 17, while a student at Beverly Hills High School, he became the director of the gossip columnist Jimmy Fidler's Hollywood segments for Fox Movietone News.
        Mr. Strock graduated in 1941 from the University of Southern California, where he studied journalism and film. He served in the Army's Ordnance Motion Picture Division before becoming an assistant editor on the 1944 film ''Gaslight'' for MGM.
        He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Geraldine; his daughters Leslie, Candice Dell Strock and Genoa Dodd; and two grandsons.
