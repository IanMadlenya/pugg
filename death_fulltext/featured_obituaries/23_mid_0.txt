        Henrietta Stein Klotz, longtime assistant to former Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr., died Sunday at her home in Manhattan after a long illness. She was 87 years old.
        Mrs. Klotz's association with Mr. Morgenthau spanned 37 years. He once called her ''the watchdog of the Secretary of the Treasury.'' Characteristically, when she went to Washington as his assistant in 1933, she refused the title. Having been his secretary since 1922, she preferred to continue as such and even a letterhead with her name on it was rejected as ''too fancy.''
        Mrs. Klotz represented Mr. Morgenthau at conferences. She accompanied him to the Bretton Woods monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, which established the foundation for the post-World War II international monetary system.
        Mrs. Klotz left Government service in 1946 and returned to Manhattan to become an executive in the Bonds for Israel drives. Shortly thereafter Mr. Morgenthau was appointed chairman of the United Jewish Appeal, and Mrs. Klotz joined him once again as his special assistant.
        A widow, she is survived by a daughter, Elinor Walden, and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan.
