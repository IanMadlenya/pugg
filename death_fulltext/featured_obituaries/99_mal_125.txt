        Sturgis Warner, a Washington lawyer who helped the capital's residents secure the right to vote for President, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 81.
        The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, his family said.
        Mr. Warner was a founder of the Washington Home Rule Committee and provided free legal work to the group. He helped draft the 23d Amendment to the Constitution, which was ratified in 1961 and gave Washington residents the right to vote in Presidential elections. He also headed a subcommittee of the home rule panel that drew up Washington's first election laws in 1955, allowing residents to vote for local offices.
        Mr. Warner was born in Boston, graduated from Harvard College and received a law degree from Harvard Law School. He moved to Washington in 1940, where he worked for the War Department, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and, finally, the Truman White House.
        In 1946 he went into private practice with what has become the large international firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue. He retired as a partner in 1981.
        Stricken by polio as a boy, he walked with a cane but led an active life. In recent years he used a wheelchair.
        Mr. Warner is survived by his wife of 51 years, Hilda Sizer Warner; two daughters, Mollie W. Flewelling and Edie W. Kinch, both of the Seattle area; three sons, Sturgis Jr., of Manhattan, Roger, of Ipswich, Mass., and Ariel F., of London, and five grandchildren.
