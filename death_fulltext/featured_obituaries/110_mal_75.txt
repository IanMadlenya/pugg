        Mr. Fetter began his career as an actor, but soon switched to writing lyrics. His work was featured in a number of Broadway productions including "The Show Is On" (1936) and "Billy Rose's Aquacade" (1939). His best-known song, "Taking a Chance on Love," was written with John Latouche and Vernon Duke and was introduced by Ethel Waters in the 1940 Broadway musical "Cabin in the Sky."

He joined ABC in 1956 and served as national director of programs for the network until 1968. After leaving ABC he became an independent producer. He was also the curator of the theater and music collection of the Museum of the City of New York from 1974 to  1979.
        He is survived by his wife, Marianne; a son, Frank Albert; a stepson, Patrick A. Pleven, and five grandchildren.
