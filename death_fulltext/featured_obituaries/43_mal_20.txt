        Dr. Fleming, who held a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, was a professor of political science at Morgan State, one of the nation's oldest predominantly black institutions, from 1954 to 1974.

        Dr. Fleming was the author of several books, including ''An All-Negro Ticket in Baltimore'' and ''Why Baltimore Failed to Elect a Black Mayor.'' Earlier, he was editor of ''Who's Who in Colored America'' and ''Who's Who in the United Nations.'' He was a former executive editor of The Amsterdam News in New York and most recently was a columnist with The Baltimore Afro-American.
        Dr. Fleming was active in community affairs, serving on the Baltimore Equal Opportunity Commission, the Commission on Architectural and Historic Preservation and the Civil Service Commission. He was a past president of the American Society for Public Administration and had been a member of the Maryland Association of Mental Health. At the time of his death he was serving on the boards of Good Samaritan Hospital and the College of the Virgin Islands and was a member of the Central Area Advisory Council of the Baltimore County Public Schools.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by several nieces and nephews.
