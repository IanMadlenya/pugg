        John Marin Jr., who for more than 40 years was the caretaker of both the collection and the memory of his father, the American artist John Marin, died of cancer Saturday at his home on Cape Split in Addison, Me. He was 73 years old.
        Last year Mr. Marin capped his career with the donation of the John Marin Archives - the artist's collected notebooks, letters and reviews and a large portion of the art in the estate -to the National Gallery of Art in Washington. His father died in 1953 at the age of 82.
        As a young man, Mr. Marin became acquainted with many of the artists who were his father's friends, including Alfred Stieglitz and Georgia O'Keeffe. From 1950 to 1964, he was an associate of Edith Halpert at the Downtown Gallery, which showed many leading American painters, including Stuart Davis, Arthur Dove and John Marin.
        He is survived by his wife, Norma Boom Marin, and a daughter, Lisa Marin Thompson, both of Cape Split, and two grandchildren.
