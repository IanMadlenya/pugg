        Tristan Egolf, a young novelist whose lavish prose was dismissed by some critics as callow and rapturously compared by others to the work of Thomas Pynchon, William Faulkner and John Kennedy Toole, was found dead in his apartment in Lancaster, Pa., on May 7. He was 33.
        The cause was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said G. Gary Kirchner, the Lancaster County coroner.
        Mr. Egolf wrote two novels, ''Lord of the Barnyard: Killing the Fatted Calf and Arming the Aware in the Corn Belt'' (Grove, 1999), originally published in Europe in 1998; and ''Skirt and the Fiddle'' (Grove, 2002). His third novel, ''Kornwolf,'' is scheduled to be published by Grove next year.
        ''Lord of the Barnyard'' centered on the hard times of a gifted young farmer forced to work menial jobs in a roughneck Kentucky coal town. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller wrote, ''Refreshing as it is to read a new novelist whose prose hasn't been manicured to lifeless perfection by too many fiction-writing workshops, Egolf still needs someone to tell him that he can't pull off this kind of novel'' -- 410 pages long -- ''without a single line of dialogue.''
        The Times Literary Supplement in London praised the book, calling it ''a work of substance, significance and originality.''
        Tristan Egolf was born on Dec. 19, 1971, in San Lorenzo del Escorial, Spain, where his father worked as a journalist, and grew up in Washington; Louisville, Ky.; and Lancaster. His parents divorced when he was a boy; he was later adopted by his stepfather, whose surname he took. His biological father died some years ago.
        Mr. Egolf is survived by his mother and stepfather, Paula and Gary Egolf, of Lancaster; a sister, Gretchen Egolf, of New York City; and his fianc√©e, Kara Dimitris, and their daughter, Orla Dimitris-Egolf, both of Lancaster.
