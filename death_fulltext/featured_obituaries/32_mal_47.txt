        Joseph Simeon Nkoane, the Anglican Bishop of Johannesburg East in South Africa and an ardent opponent of apartheid, died of cancer on Thursday at his home in KwaThema, a black township. He was 60 years old and had been ill for several years.
        Bishop Nkoane, a graduate of St. Peter's Theological College in Johannesburg, was an associate of Bishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize recipient. Bishop Tutu was elevated to Archbishop of Cape Town in 1986.
        Bishop Nkoane's anti-apartheid activities, including his officiating at the funerals of blacks killed in clashes with the authorities, led to apparent reprisal attacks, including the firebombing of his home in KwaThema on several occasions. He also drew the ire of black militants in 1985 when he helped Bishop Tutu rescue a man accused of being a police informer from a crowd of angry blacks.
        Bishop Nkoane was ordained in 1954 and served in a several churches in South Africa before moving to Britain, where he lived from 1957 to 1964. He returned to Johannesburg and became a lecturer at St. Peter's College, moving up in the church hierarchy until he was elected Suffragan Bishop of Johannesburg East in 1982.
        He is survived by a brother, Solomon, of Thokoza, South Africa.
