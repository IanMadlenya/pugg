        Dr. Frederick J. Wertz 3d, an expert in adolescent psychiatry and a former chief of psychiatry at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died on March 5 at his home in Middlebury, Vt. He was 80, and had lived and privately practiced in Manhattan before moving to Vermont in the late 1970's.
        The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism and a heart attack, said his son, Dr. Frederick Wertz 4th. He said Dr. Wertz had not been well since he suffered a fall while on vacation in Spain last month.
        Dr. Wertz was a consultant to several school districts in Bergen County, a past president of the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry and a founder of the society's chapter that covered most of the Northeast. He had also served on the staffs of Sheltering Arms, a private child care agency, and the Cornell University Medical College.
        He was born in the Bronx. He received an undergraduate degree from Manhattan College in 1937 and a medical degree from Georgetown University Medical School in 1941.
        His wife, Hannah F. Ziering Wertz, died in 1977. Besides his son, of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., he is survived by his companion of the last 15 years, Gloria Shaw; four daughters, Marcia Rossi of Holyoke, Mass., Judith Wertz of Oakland, Calif., Deborah Scott of Berkeley, Calif., and Janice McAdam of Arcadia, Calif., and six grandchildren.
