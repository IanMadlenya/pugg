        Thomas F. Carter, an entrepreneur who won a landmark lawsuit against the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, died Saturday at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. He was 67 years old and lived in Gun Barrel City, Tex.
        He died of lung disease.
        In 1959 Mr. Carter patented the Carterfone, a device that connects telephones with private two-way radio systems. The Carterfone could be used to talk over any telephone with radio-dispatched cars and trucks.
        Soon after his invention, A.T.&T. threatened to discontinue service to customers who used the Carterfone, prompting Mr. Carter's antitrust suit.
        In 1968 the Federal Communications Commission ruled in Mr. Carter's favor. This opened the door to the use of non-Bell equipment in the telephone system. The next year MCI became the first of many private companies to hook its long-distance network into local telephone service.
        By 1970 Mr. Carter's company, which changed its name from Carter Electronics to Carterfone Communications, had ceased making the Carterfone, and he left the company.
        He later started other business ventures, but never capitalized fully on his invention. He founded the North American Telecommunications Association in Washington, serving as its president. He moved to Gun Barrel City in 1975.
        Mr. Carter is survived by his wife, Helen; two daughters, Shari Lee Hammond of Roanoke, Va., and Terri Lynne Heard of Arlington, Tex., and four grandchildren.
