        David H. Edwards Jr., a State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan who presided over several notable cases, died on Friday at his home in Queens. He was 69 years old and died of heart failure, his family said.
        Justice Edwards in 1988 ordered that $16 million of the purse from the Michael Spinks-Mike Tyson championship boxing match be divided among Mr. Tyson and his co-manager and trainer to help settle a dispute between them. In 1983, following earlier Court of Appeals rulings, he ordered New York City officials to pay the developer Donald J. Trump a multimillion-dollar tax abatement for Trump Tower.
        That same year he also ruled against five City Board of Estimate members who had sued Mayor Edward I. Koch contending that he overstepped his powers in signing an agreement with Gov. Hugh L. Carey for the Westway project. And as a criminal trial judge in 1979 he sentenced Philip Fitzpatrick, the former Republican chairman of Staten Island, to jail for his conviction of lying to a grand jury.
        Mr. Edwards was born in Norfolk, Va., where his father was a lawyer. During World War II he won three battle stars while serving with the Army in Europe. He was a graduate of City College, the Baruch School of Business and New York University Law School.
        He was admitted to the bar in 1949 and had a general practice in a midtown Manhattan law firm for many years. Later he served as a law secretary to two State Supreme Court justices and in 1972 became a judge himself. He was a Democrat.
        His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Sheilah Hurd; a son, Robert H., of Durham, N.C.; two stepsons, Austin Hurd of Chesapeake, Va., and Franell Hurd of Brooklyn, and a stepdaughter, Michelle Hurd Bowe of Chesapeake, Va.
