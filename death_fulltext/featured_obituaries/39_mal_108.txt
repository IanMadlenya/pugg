        Dr. Hafner did research on sound and video in New York and in Britain and France. He developed the G-line, a transmission wire that carries television and other microwaves through a tube of air and allows communication with vehicles without the use of overhead wires. It has been used in railroad tunnels and for a community antenna system.
        He also was awarded a patent for an air-cushion train comprising three or four cigar-shaped cars that are propelled through tunnels by jet engines. He retired in 1987.  Dr. Hafner was born in Vienna, and received a Ph.D. from the University of Vienna in 1926 and a J.D. from Fordham University Law School in 1946. He practiced law in Manhattan from 1949 until he retired.
        He was president of Surface Conduction Inc., and Beam Guidance Inc., companies he founded in the 1950's in Manhattan to develop his inventions.
        Dr. Hafner belonged to several professional organizations including the Federal Bar Association, the Patent Law Association, and the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
        A widower, he is survived by a sister, Sabine Hahn of the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
