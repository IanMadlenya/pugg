        Dr. John L. Peters, a Methodist minister and founder of World Neighbors, an international self-help organization, died Saturday at the Cherry Creek Nursing Home in Aurora, Colo., a suburb of Denver. He was 85 and lived in Aurora.
        He died of complications from pneumonia and leukemia, said Judy Kelley, a spokeswoman for World Neighbors.
        Dr. Peters and a group of friends established World Neighbors in 1951 as a not-for-profit, international development organization, based in Oklahoma City. The group's first project was in a village in southern India, where they introduced health, literacy and sanitation programs and cottage industries.The experiment rapidly spread to other Indian villages.
        In an interview in 1964, Dr. Peters said the organization worked only at the village level because "too often government aid programs fail to get to the little guy in the rice paddy."
        Retiring in 1977 from his position as president, he remained involved in the organization, which today supports projects in 20 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia.
        He was born in Van Buren, Ark. He graduated from Bethany Nazarene College, attended the Boston University School of Theology and received a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma and a doctorate from Yale University.
        Dr. Peters's first wife, Kay, and a son, Don, died. Surviving are his wife, Maxine; three grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
