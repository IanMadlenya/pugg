        Mr. Halliwell, a longtime film buyer for British television, first published his ''Filmgoer's Companion'' in 1965. The ninth edition of this compendium of information about movies contains 15,000 entries. Mr. Halliwell's ''Film Guide'' was first published in 1977 and contains descriptions of thousands of movies. His third reference work, ''Halliwell's Television Guide,'' first appeared in 1979.
        Mr. Halliwell began buying feature films and series for Britain's Independent Television Network in 1968 and was program buyer for Channel 4 in Britain from 1982 until his retirement in 1987. He began his career as a journalist with a film magazine and managed a theater in Cambridge before beginning in television in 1959. Mr. Halliwell also published ''Seats in All Parts: Half a Lifetime at the Movies'' and a novel, ''Return to Shangri-La.''
        Mr. Halliwell was a devotee of films of the 1930's and 40's, and was a member of two National Film Archive committees. He said he despaired of the ''wasteful ineptitude'' and ''inane or violent rubbish'' of much contemporary movie-making.
        He is survived by his wife, Ruth, of Surrey, and three children.
