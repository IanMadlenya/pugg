        Ewan MacColl, who led the folk music revival in Britain and wrote the Grammy Award-winning ballad ''The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,'' died on Sunday in a London hospital after heart surgery. He was 74 years old.
        Mr. MacColl, a son of a Scottish ironworker and part-time folk singer, grew up in northern England and left school at 14 to become a poet.
        He roamed the slums of Manchester, worked in menial factory jobs, and embraced a political radicalism that was later to produce songs against nuclear weapons, apartheid and the Vietnam War.
        When folk music became popular, Mr. MacColl gained celebrity. He and his third wife, Peggy Seeger, a half-sister of the American folk singer Pete Seeger, made many concert appearance together. Roberta Flack's recording of ''The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face'' won a Grammy in 1972.
        Surviving are his wife and five children.
