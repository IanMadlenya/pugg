        Philip Henry Alston Jr., a confidant of former President Jimmy Carter and a former Ambassador to Australia, died Wednesday after a brief illness. He was 76 years old.
        Mr. Alston, an influential Atlanta lawyer, raised millions of dollars for the University of Georgia and began supporting Mr. Carter politically after meeting him in 1966.
        Mr. Carter lost the Governor's race that year to Lester Maddox but Mr. Alston was chairman of Mr. Carter's successful gubernatorial bid in 1970 and was chairman of the Committee for Jimmy Carter when Mr. Carter was elected President in 1976.
        While Ambassador, Mr. Alston was among several people asked to testify before the Senate Banking Committee about a low-interest government loan given to an airline controlled by the publisher Rupert Murdoch.
        Export-Import Bank officials said the lenient terms were to encourage Mr. Murdoch to buy 18 wide-body jets from the Boeing Company instead of from a European manufacturer. The committee was looking into whether the $290 million loan was connected to a 1980 political endorsement of President Carter by The New York Post, then owned by Mr. Murdoch. It concluded there was no connection.
        Mr. Alston testified that he had urged the bank, then headed by his former law partner, John Moore, to approve the loan quickly to assure Boeing would not lose the contract.
        Mr. Alston was a co-founder of the Georgia Foundation, which raised millions of dollars for the University of Georgia, where he received his undergraduate degree.
        Mr. Alston served in the Navy in World War II.
        Survivors include his wife, Elkin Goddard Alston; a son, a daughter, and five grandchildren.
