        Holly Stevens, an editor who devoted much of her career to writing about and editing the work of her father, the poet Wallace Stevens, died on Wednesday at her home in Guilford, Conn. She was 67 years old.
        She died of lung cancer, said Ruth Hein, a friend.
        Ms. Stevens's edition of "The Letters of Wallace Stevens" appeared in 1966. Her selection of work from her father's journals in a 1977 book called "Souvenirs and Prophecies: The Young Wallace Stevens" became controversial. The work was praised by Helen Vendler, writing in The New York Times Book Review, for giving a complete portrait of the poet as a young man "so that the journal fragments and first poems can be placed in the context of Stevens's character and life."
        But Anatole Broyard, reviewing the book for the daily edition of The New York Times, declared that it did a "disservice" to one of his favorite poets. The book, he said, offered "no intimations whatever of Stevens's ultimate achievement: one year he was writing vapid and sentimental mediocrities, and the next he was turning out one of the best poems of our century."
        She was married to John Martin Hanchak and later to Duncan Stephenson. Both marriages ended in divorce.
        She is survived by a son, Peter Reed Hanchak of Philadelphia, and two grandchildren.
