        Benjamin F. Price, a war correspondent with the military newspaper Stars and Stripes in Europe during World War II and later the picture editor of The New York Herald Tribune, died on Friday at his home in Charlotte, Vt. He was 74.
        The cause was heart failure, said his son Jeff.
        Mr. Price started in journalism while still in high school in his native Iowa, as a cub reporter for The Des Moines Register. He entered the United States Army at the outbreak of World War II, and on being transferred to London joined the staff of Stars and Stripes as an editor. After the Normandy invasion, he served as a combat correspondent in France and Germany, remaining with the newspaper for the rest of the war.
        Upon his discharge as a master sergeant in New York, Mr. Price became an editor at The Herald Tribune, where he remained until its demise in 1965. He later was an editor with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, retiring in 1980.
        He is survived by his wife, Jane, of Charlotte; and two sons, Andrew of South Burlington, Vt., and Jeff of Wycombe, Pa.
