        George Marshall, a vigorous proponent of civil rights and a conservationist with a special passion for the Adirondack Mountains, died in Nyack, N.Y., on May 21. He was 96.
        Mr. Marshall's involvement in civil rights was inspired by his father, Louis Marshall, a co-founder of the American Jewish Committee, and by his marriage to Elisabeth Dublin, a fellow advocate, in 1930.
        As a pioneer in the civil rights movement of the 40's and 50's, Mr. Marshall worked closely with people like Paul Robeson, and served as chairman of the National Federation for Constitutional Liberties and its successor, the Civil Rights Congress.
        In April 1946, Mr. Marshall was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and cited for contempt when he refused to produce records of the N.F.C.L. He was convicted and served three months in prison.
        Mr. Marshall's other passion was preservation of the wilderness.
        To publicize the need for protecting wilderness areas, Mr. Marshall, his brother, Robert, and their mentor, Herb Clark, became the first to climb the 46 highest mountain peaks in New York State. After Robert Marshall died at age 38 in 1937, Mr. Marshall became a trustee of the Robert Marshall Wilderness Fund.
        Mr. Marshall attended the Ethical Culture School in New York City and graduated from Columbia College. He earned a doctorate in economics from the Brookings Institution in 1930.
        Mr. Marshall's wife died in 1993. He is survived by his son, Roger Marshall of Springfield, Vt.; his daughter, Nancy Marshall Schultz of Nyack; six grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
