        Odell E. Powers, the chairman of the Nicolet Instrument Corporation, died Wednesday at his home in Minneapolis. He was 63 years old.
        He died of stomach cancer, said George Birch, a spokesman for the company, which is based in Madison, Wis.
        Mr. Powers had served as chief executive officer of Nicolet until Nov. 1. He had held that post, and the chairmanship, since 1988, and since 1983 he had been a director of the company, which makes instruments for the chemical, biomedical and test-and-measurement industries.
        He was born in Peoria, Ill., served in the Army, studied at Bradley University in Peoria, and headed S. J. Groves & Sons, a Minneapolis heavy construction, engineering and mining company, before becoming chairman and chief executive of Nicolet.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Mark, of Houston; three daughters, Kristin Rover of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., Julianne Fallert of Philadelphia, and Elizabeth Powers of Edina, Minn., and three granddaughters.
