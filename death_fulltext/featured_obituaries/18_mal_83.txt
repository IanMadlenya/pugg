        Mr. Baker, a native of Portland, Me., wrote the music for ''Phoenix '55,'' a 1955 revue, and ''Copper and Brass,'' a 1957 comedy written by Ira Wallach and starring Nancy Walker. He also composed the music for ''Smiling the Boy Fell Dead,'' a 1961 musical starring Claiborne Cary; and the score for ''Come Summer,'' a musical directed and choreographed by Agnes de Mille and starring Ray Bolger. ''Come Summer'' was performed on Broadway in 1969.
        Mr. Baker, who also worked as a voice coach, played the piano in a three-part public television series, ''Musical Comedy Tonight,'' produced by Mrs. Kaye. The series was broadcast from 1979 to 1984.
        ''He was a marvelous pianist and composer,'' Mrs. Kaye said yesterday. ''He was very courtly. If he liked you, he'd do anything for you.''
        He is survived by a sister, Sally, of Portland.
