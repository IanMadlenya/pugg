        Hermann E. Simon, a lawyer who specialized in estates and trusts and who obtained compensation from West Germany for victims of Nazi persecution, died of a heart attack on Tuesday in an elevator on his way to work at his office in lower Manhattan. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Simon, who was born in Frankfurt and was a graduate of the University of Frankfurt, practiced law there for a decade before Hitler came to power. Beginning in 1933 he helped many of his Jewish clients leave Germany before fleeing himself in 1937.
        He came to the United States and graduated from New York University Law School before serving in the United States Army in World War II. A soldier in combat intelligence, he was one of the first Americans to enter Bergen-Belsen and other concentration camps. He was awarded the Bronze Star.
        After the war he became a partner in the law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. He was instrumental in negotiating the restitution and indemnification legislation that secured compensation for victims who suffered at the hands of the Nazis. He was a director of United Help and Selfhelp Community Services, agencies that help refugees in this country.
        Although he reached retirement age in 1979 he continued of counsel to the law firm until his death.
        Mr. Simon is survived by a nephew and niece, Ernest and Louise Simon, both of Manhattan.
