        Edward Dunham Bodman, an investment banker who worked earlier in his career for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in China, died yesterday at his home in Stonington, Conn. He was 69 years old and also lived in Manhattan.
        He died of intestinal cancer, a spokesman for the family said.
        He was a graduate of Harvard College and later attended the Columbia University School of Business Administration. After graduating from college, he worked in Beijing for the United Nations relief agency from 1945 to 1947. He returned to work for the Economic Cooperation Administration, traeling extensively in China. After the fall of the Nationalist Government in China, he went into investment banking.
        From 1951 to 1958, he worked for Milmine, Bodman & Company in Manhattan in investment management and export-import financing, and from 1958 to 1966, he was with the Crocker National Bank in San Francisco. From 1966 until he retired in 1982, he was with the Empire Trust Company, now the Bank of New York, in Manhattan.
        He was a member of the boards of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Associaton and of the American Bureau of Medical Assistance to China and in retirement was a recruiter for the International Executive Service Corps.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rosamund Reed Veit; a daughter, Beaufort Butler of Concord, Mass.; a sister, Violet Coffin of Stratford, Vt.; a brother, Herbert Bodman of Chapel Hill, N.C., and three grandchildren.
