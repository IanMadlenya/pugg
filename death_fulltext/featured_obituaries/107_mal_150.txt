        Heiner Mueller, one of East Germany's most prominent and debated playwrights, died today at a Berlin hospital, a spokesman for his theater company said. He was 66.
        The cause was cancer, the spokesman said.
        Mr. Mueller was the artistic director of the Buehne am Schiffbauerdamm theater company, which was founded by Bertold Brecht, and the author of some 30  plays. "Germania, Death in Berlin" was one of his best-known works.
        In the 1960's, Mr. Mueller fell out with East Germany's rulers, who harshly criticized two of his plays. But the state later made peace with him, awarding him many literary prizes and allowing him to travel freely to the West.
        After unification in 1990, Mr. Mueller worked mainly as a director.
