        Frederic Spiegelberg, an early teacher of comparative religion in the United States, died on Thursday at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, where he lived. He was 97.
        The cause of death was complications from abdominal surgery, said Michael Murphy of San Rafael, Calif., a friend and former student.
        In the 1940's, when religions were studied mainly in divinity schools or by graduate students, Professor Spiegelberg began offering classes at Stanford University that undergraduates could attend. In his classes, which continued to 1965, he compared the world's major religions, in particular lecturing on the religions of India and the psychology of Buddhism.
        In 1951, he helped found the American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. An independent graduate-level institution, it was set up to study Eastern culture and philosophy. It later became a part of the California Institute of Integral Studies, and he served as its second president, from 1976 to 1978.
        With Robert O. Ballow, he compiled the "Bible of the World" (Viking, 1939), and he wrote "Living Religions of the World" (Prentice-Hall, 1956) and "The Spiritual Practices of India" (Citadel Press, 1962).
        Professor Spiegelberg, who emigrated from Hamburg, Germany in 1937, held a doctorate from the University of Tubingen. He taught at the University of Hamburg and later at Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary.
        His wife, Rosalie, died in 1968. He is survived by a daughter, Corinne, of San Francisco.
