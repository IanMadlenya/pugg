        Donald P. Cottrell, dean of the College of Education at Ohio State University from 1946 to 1967, died Monday at his home in Worthington, Ohio. He was 88 years old.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Dr. Cottrell began his career as a professor at Teachers College of Columbia University from 1929 to 1946. While there, he was executive director of Horace Mann and Lincoln Schools and executive officer of the college's Division of Instruction.
        He was the author of "Redirecting Teacher Education," published in 1938, and the editor of "Teacher Education for a Free People," a 1956 study for the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, which he later served as president.
        Dr. Cottrell was born in Columbus, Ohio, and received a bachelor's degree from Ohio State and master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia. He advised governments in the Philippines, Japan, China, Korea and India on educational matters. After retiring as dean at Ohio State, he continued as a professor until he retired in 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Eleanor Westberg; a daughter, Dorothy Caswell of Oneonta, N.Y.; a brother, Robert, of Detroit; a sister, Lois Musick of Waverly, Ohio, and two grandchildren.
