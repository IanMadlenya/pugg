        Prof. Edward Schreiber of Queens College, a geologist and lunar expert, died in an automobile accident Monday on the Bronx River Parkway. He was 61 years old and lived in Piermont, N.Y.
        A college spokesman said he was driving to the college from his home when another vehicle crossed the center divider and struck his car.
        Dr. Scheiber, a native of Brooklyn and a graduate in ceramic science of Alfred University, taught geology at Queens College for two years before joining its geology department as an associate professor in 1968. He became a full professor of earth sciences in 1971. He has been associated with the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University since 1968.
        He was the author of many articles and reports and was a member of the Lunar Science Review Board of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. He also conducted research on the structure of the ocean crust and the properties of rocks and minerals.
        Dr. Schreiber is survived by his wife, Prof. Charlotte Schreiber, who is also a member of the geology department at Queens, and two daughters, Christie, of Asheville, N.C., and Sue Anne, of Seattle. Also surviving are two sisters, Charlotte Carnegie, of Providence, R.I., and Florence Ehrlich, of Naples, Fla., and two brothers, Milton and David, both of Queens.
