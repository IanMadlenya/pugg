        Harold B. Gores, who headed the Educational Facilities Laboratories, a not-for-profit foundation in New York, from 1958 to 1976, died Friday at Falmouth Hospital in Falmouth, Mass. He was 83 and lived in East Falmouth.
        Dr. Gores, who received his doctorate in education from Harvard University, died of pneumonia, said his wife, the former Helen E. Boothroyd.
        He was the first president of the laboratories, which were established and supported for many years by the Ford Foundation.
        The laboratories were often credited with getting schools to accept air conditioning and carpeting, which were virtually unused in schools before the 1970's.
        Under Dr. Gores, the organization also helped lead efforts to persuade schools to do without interior walls, permitting teachers and children more freedom of movement.
        A native of Abington, Mass., Dr. Gores headed the school system of Newton, Mass., from 1949 to 1958. He won awards from the American Institute of Architects and elsewhere.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Richard W., of Satellite Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Judith E. Sweet of Alpharetta, Ga.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
