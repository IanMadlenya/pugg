        He is credited with having helped avert a possible war between Turkey and Greece during the partition of Cyprus in 1964 by urging that the Turkish Government not send an expeditionary force to the divided island. An Islamic Scholar
        In the Suez crisis of 1956, Mr. Hare counseled the Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, to turn to the United Nations to arrange a cease-fire and secure the withdrawal of Israeli, British and French forces that had invaded the Sinai.
        A graduate of Grinnell College, Mr. Hare was an acknowledged Islamic scholar and was fluent in Arabic and Turkish. He taught at Robert College in Istanbul before joining the Foreign Service in 1927.
        He spent most of World War II as an intelligence and liaison officer at the American Embassy in Cairo when Egypt was under attack by the Axis powers.
        Among other assignments in Washington, he was director general of the Foreign Service from 1954 to 1956 and Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs from 1960 to 1961. He served briefly as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs before retiring from the State Department in 1966.
        He was president of the Middle East Institute in Washington from 1966 to 1969.
        He is survived by his sons, Raymond A. Jr. and Paul, a former Ambassador to Zambia who most recently served as a special representative at Angolan peace talks, both of Washington.
