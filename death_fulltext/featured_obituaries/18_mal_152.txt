        Dr. Howard Bernhardt Adelmann, a zoologist, educator and author, died of arteriosclerosis Monday at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 90 years old.
        Dr. Adelmann, who received international acclaim for his writing on the 17th-century scientist Marcello Malpighi, began teaching embryology at Cornell University in 1919, while still an undergraduate. He received a master's at the school in 1922 and a Ph.D. in 1924. He was chairman of the zoology department from 1944 to 1959.
        In 1972, he was honored by the University of Bologna, where Malpighi taught, for the five-volume work ''Marcello Malpighi and the Evolution of Embryology,'' published in 1966 by the Cornell University Press. In 1962, the Italian Government awarded him the Star of Italian Solidarity.
        Surviving is his wife, Dorothy Schullian Adelmann.
