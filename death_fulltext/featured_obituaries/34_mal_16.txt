Mr. Huebl was a major ideologist behind the liberalization started by the Czechoslovak leader, Alexander Dubcek, before the Prague Spring was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion. He was director of the Communist Party Academy, in effect a Communist political college, in that period of a few months.
        He was convicted in 1972 on charges of anti-state activities and sentenced to six and a half years in prison. He was released early, in December 1976.
