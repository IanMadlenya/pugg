        Vance I. Oyama, a biochemist whose laboratory-in-a-shoe-box aboard the Mars landers two decades ago helped fuel debate about the existence of life on that planet, died on July 27 at his home in Middletown, Calif. He was 76.
        Mr. Oyama, the former chief of the life-detection branch at NASA's Ames Research Center, died of cancer, his family said.
        His experiment was one of three in a cubic foot of space aboard the two Viking landers that reached Mars in 1976. In the experiment, water and a ''chicken soup'' of nutrients were added to Martian soil. If there were microorganisms in the soil, the thinking went, they would consume the nutrients and emit gases.
        Mr. Oyama's experiment produced results ''even before he added the chicken soup itself,'' recalled Gilbert V. Levin, the president of Biospherics Inc., who had designed one of the other Viking experiments.
        ''Just the vapor coming off it produced a spontaneous emission of oxygen,'' Mr. Levin said.
        Any excitement was soon tempered as more results came in. Beyond the quick release of oxygen, Mr. Oyama's experiment gave little evidence of continuing metabolism of nutrients by any life form. The two other experiments gave similarly confounding results. And equipment designed to detect organic compounds found none.
        Mr. Oyama, who had been optimistic about finding life, quickly took the opposite view. He was convinced that the results could be explained by the presence of oxidants in the soil. Such compounds readily release oxygen when they encounter moisture, in some ways mimicking biological activity. The idea that life did not exist on Mars became the prevailing view.
        Mr. Oyama is survived by his wife, Rose; a brother, Jiro, of Cupertino, Calif.; two daughters, Denise Miller of Fremont, Calif., and Judith Olson of Chiloquin, Ore.; a son, Jerry, of Alta, Utah, and four grandchildren.
