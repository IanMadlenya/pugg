        Lar Roberson, a dancer who performed in the 1970's with the companies of Martha Graham, Pearl Lang and Rod Rodgers, died on June 21 at his home in Kensington, Calif. He was 48.
        The cause was AIDS, said his companion, Thomas Hibdon.
        Mr. Roberson was a member of the Graham company from 1969 to 1973 and taught at the Graham school in New York. He also appeared with Ms. Lang, who featured him prominently in an exuberant role in "Roundelays," a work she created in 1977. Mr. Rodgers cast him in 1978 in the title role of "The Visionary." Mr. Roberson danced at other times in companies headed by Lar Lubovitch, Sophie Maslow, Larry Richardson, Joyce Trisler and Ethel Winter.
        After 1980, he taught modern dance at the Marin Ballet School in California and at San Francisco State University.
        In addition to Mr. Hibdon, he is survived by a sister, Delores, of Hercules, Calif., and a brother, Brian, of Richmond, Calif.
