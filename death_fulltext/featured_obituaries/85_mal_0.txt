        Bradford Arnold Warner, a New York corporate official and former banker who was long active in community affairs, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 83.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Warner was vice president for planning at the Gilman Paper Company, where he had worked in his office the day before his death. He joined the company in 1977 after retiring as a senior vice president and director of the European-American Bank and Trust Company.
        Over the years, he served as president of the board of trustees of the Allen-Stevenson School and chairman of the National Society for the Prevention of Blindness, and he was chairman of the trustees of Woodlawn Cemetery. He also was a fund-raiser and trustee of the New York Public Library and, since 1979, an honorary trustee.
        His other associations included the ICD-International Center for the Disabled, Child Find of America, National Hospital for Speech Disorders and the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of New York, of which he was a governor and governor emeritus.
        Mr. Warner, a native of Locust Valley, L.I., graduated from Yale College and the Columbia University School of Business. He entered the overseas operations of General Motors but in 1940 joined the staff of Fortune magazine.
        His life as a banker began in 1954 when Manufacturers Trust Company named him vice president for business development. He later held senior positions at the Belgian-American American Bank and Trust Company, which became part of European-American. He retired from there in 1976.
        Mr. Warner is survived by his wife of 62 years, Nancy Hill Warner; two sons, Bradford A. Jr., of Washington, and Miner H., of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
