        Dr. Kenneth Sterling, a specialist in thyroid diseases whose research advanced knowledge of how thyroid hormones affect human metabolism, died on Jan. 12 at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 74.
        The cause apparently was complications from an aneurysm, his family said.
        At his death, Dr. Sterling was a clinical professor of medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was also a staff physician in nuclear medicine and director of the protein research laboratory at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in the Bronx.
        He regularly took part in the thyroid clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital Center, and treated patients there just days before his death, a spokeswoman for the center said.
        He was born in Baltimore and graduated from Harvard University in 1940. He earned his medical degree at Johns Hopkins University three years later. Dr. Sterling joined Columbia as a research associate in 1958. He was appointed an assistant clinical professor of medicine in 1962, the year he came to the V.A. Medical Center to direct its protein research laboratory. He rose to associate clinical professor in 1970 and to full professor four years later.
        He was a leading investigator of the cellular action of thyroid hormones. He was among the first scientists to use radioactive iodine in the treatment of thyroid diseases. In his early work on the metabolism of human serum proteins he employed radioisotopic labels and developed a method for the radioisotopic labeling of human red cells. This allowed for the accurate measurement of the red cells' life span and volume, a method still in use.
        Dr. Sterling is survived by his wife of 35 years, Ruth, and a daughter, Donna.
