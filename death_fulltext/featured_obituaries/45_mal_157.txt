        Professor Adam, an authority on modern colonial government and public law, was a native of Brechin, Scotland, and held a master's degree in history and a law degree from the University of Edinburgh. He served on the Australian Development Commission from 1925 until 1930, when he became an associate professor of history and government at Occidental College in Los Angeles.
        In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, he joined the British Army as a lieutenant colonel in the Black Watch Brigade. In 1944 and 1945 he was a military assistant to the deputy chief of the British Army General Staff. In 1945 Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands made him an officer of the Order of Orange Nassau.
        He joined the N.Y.U. faculty at the war's end and wrote several books, including ''Modern Colonialism: Institutions and Policies,'' published by Random House in 1955; ''Government and Politics in Africa, South of the Sahara'' (1959), and ''Western Interests in the Pacific Realm'' (1967).
        Mr. Adam is survived by several nieces and nephews in Australia.
