        Ron Cochran, a former television and radio newsman with CBS and ABC, died yesterday at Palm Beach Regional Hospital in Lake Worth, Fla. He was 81 and lived in Aberdeen, Fla.
        The cause was heart failure, and he had been in the hospital for five weeks with heart trouble and other ailments, said his wife, Beulah.
        In the early 1960's, Mr. Cochran was an early evening news anchor for the ABC network. Previously, he was the host of evening news programs on WCBS-TV in New York for several years beginning in 1954.
        He was born near Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and grew up in Iowa. After graduating from Parsons College in Fairfield, Iowa, he worked for radio stations in the Midwest. He then became an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1942 to 1944 before returning to radio, with a station in Boston, in 1945.
        He joined CBS in Washington in 1951 and worked in both television and radio. It was in 1954 that he went to WCBS-TV, to reinforce its 11 P.M. news program.
        For several years in the mid-1960's, he was under contract to the American Broadcasting Company. He was the anchor on an early evening television network news program through 1964.
        In addition to his wife of 56 years, the former Beulah Tracht, Mr. Cochran is survived by a son, Ronald W. Cochran of Sandy Hook, Conn., and a daughter, Judith Cochran-Smith of Indianapolis.
