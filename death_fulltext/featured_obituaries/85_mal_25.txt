        Ralph Farnworth, a character actor who specialized in musicals, died on Wednesday at his home in New York City. He was 71.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Tess Elliott.
        Mr. Farnworth appeared in the role of the Padre in "Man of La Mancha" during the show's entire six-and-a-half-year run of Broadway. He was also featured in the Broadway and London productions of "The Most Happy Fella." His other Broadway credits include "Destry!," "Bells Are Ringing," "The Unsinkable Molly Brown," "Milk and Honey," "Drat the Cat!" and "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Steven, Thomas and Bruce Farnworth.
