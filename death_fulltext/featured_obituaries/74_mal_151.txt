        Roy Riegels, who became part of college football lore when his 69-yard run in the wrong direction cost the University of California the 1929 Rose Bowl game, died Friday at his home in Woodland, Calif. He was 84.
        The cause of death was complications from Parkinson's disease, his son David said.
        Riegels was an all-America center, but he became famous because of one play in Cal's 8-7 Rose Bowl loss to Georgia Tech, a gaffe that earned him the nickname Wrong-Way Riegels.
        In the second quarter, California's Benny Lom hit Georgia Tech's Stumpy Thomason, forcing a fumble that Riegels, who also played defense, scooped up on the Georgia Tech 30-yard-line.
        Riegels started to run in the right direction but suddenly spun to elude tacklers. At that point, he began heading toward his own team's goal line. Players from both teams stood by, stunned, but then Lom took off after Riegels. He finally grabbed his teammate at the California 3-yard line and spun him around. But a wave of Georgia Tech players proceeded to tackle Riegels 1 yard from his own goal line.
        Cal then tried to punt, with Riegels snapping the ball to Lom. But a Georgia Tech player blocked the kick for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2-0 lead. Both teams later scored a touchdown and the safety stood as the margin of victory.
        The play made Riegels famous. He appeared on television from time to time, people asked him for autographs and every year at Rose Bowl time reporters called. Then, in 1991, he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame.
        A native of Oakland, Calif., Riegels graduated from California in 1931 and served during World War II as a major in the Army Air Corps.
        In 1955, he started his own agricultural chemicals business. He sold it, and retired, in 1976.
        In addition to his son David, he is survived by two daughters, Alexa Richmond and Helen Mackey, and another son, Richard.
