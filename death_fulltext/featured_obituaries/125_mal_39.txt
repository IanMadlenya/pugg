        Dr. Thomas Vincent Santulli, professor emeritus of surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University and former director of surgery at Babies and Children's Hospital of New York, died last Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 82 and lived in Riverdale, the Bronx.
        The cause was lung cancer, the university reported.
        Dr. Santulli was a pioneer of pediatric surgery in the United States. He helped build it into a recognized medical specialty, replacing the earlier practice that subjected even the smallest babies to surgical techniques designed for adult patients.
        He organized one of the county's first training programs in the late 1950's to equip specialists with the skills needed to operate on the immature systems of infants and children. He himself trained many future practitioners in the field, and nine of his former students became directors of pediatric surgery at major academic medical centers.
        A native New Yorker, he graduated from Columbia College and received his medical degree at Georgetown University in 1939. He taught at Columbia for more than 40 years and led the team of specialized surgeons at Babies and Children's Hospital for 25 years.
        Upon his retirement in 1983, the hospital, part of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, named its pediatric surgery library and conference room in his honor. There also is a national Santulli Society of former trainees who meet annually, and Columbia established a Santulli lectureship in pediatric surgery.
        He was the founding president of the New York Pediatric Surgical Society.
        Dr. Santulli's first wife, Dorothy Beverley Santulli, died in 1979. He is survived by his wife, Patricia Anne Rita Santulli; two sons, Dr. Thomas V. Jr. of Los Angeles, and Dr. Robert B. of Hanover, N.H.; a brother, Vincent, of Boca Raton, Fla., and New Fairfield, Conn., and five grandchildren.
