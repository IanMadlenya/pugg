        Denis McInerney, a specialist in antitrust law whose clients included the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, W. R. Grace & Company and Goodyear Tire, died on Tuesday at his home in Rye, N.Y. He was 80.
        His death was confirmed by his family.
        Mr. McInerney was a retired partner at the law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and had worked there for 40 years when he retired in 1990.
        Mr. McInerney grew up in the Bronx and graduated from Cathedral High School, where he studied for the priesthood. Those plans were interrupted when World War II broke out, and he enlisted in the 82nd Airborne Division. He was stationed in the Netherlands, Germany and France and received a Purple Heart. After the war, he attended Fordham Law School and then joined Cahill Gordon.
        During his career, Mr. McInerney led a successful defense of A.& P. in an antitrust case before the United States Supreme Court and represented Union Carbide after a gas leak from one of its factories killed thousands of people in Bhopal, India.
        ''I used to watch him practice,'' recalled Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer and a longtime partner of Mr. McInerney. ''It was a sort of Jimmy Stewart style. Denis was a very soft-spoken, self-effacing, overly modest person who left many flashier lawyers in his wake as he persuaded judges and juries alike that what he said could be trusted and should carry the day.''
        In retirement, Mr. McInerney was a board member of the Volunteers of Legal Service and the Catholic Youth Organization, and served on a New York State court disciplinary committee that reviews complaints against lawyers.
        Mr. McInerney is survived by his wife of 52 years, Irene; three children: Kathleen M. O'Hare and Denis McInerney, both of Harrison, N.Y., and Maura Romano of Wynnewood, Pa.; and eight grandchildren.
