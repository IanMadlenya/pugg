        Leslie (Bubba) Gaines, a noted tap dancer and leading member of the Copasetics tap group, died on Monday at the Veterans Hospital in Manhattan after a short illness. He was 85 and lived in Harlem.
        Mr. Gaines, born in Waycross, Ga., was a boxer who danced on street corners and in carnivals before becoming a member of the Three Dukes, a leading tap group of the 1930's. Also known as ''The Aristocrats of Tap,'' the Three Dukes specialized in synchronized jump-rope tapping and ''class act'' dancing, a genre known for its elegance, spaciousness and musicality, with clear tap sounds.
        He served in the Army during World War II, returning to the United States at a time when opportunities began to decline for tap dancers. He started working with the U.S.O. as a solo act, telling stories, tapping and playing the trumpet, and appeared occasionally during the 1950's and 60's with the Three Dukes in European theaters, among them the London Palladium and Folies-Bergere.
        From 1979 through 1994, Mr. Gaines performed with the Copasetics, a group of veteran tap stars that also included Honi Coles and Charles (Cookie) Cook. He also appeared in nightclub acts and in revues that included ''Black Broadway,'' a 1980 retrospective of black musical entertainment, created for the 1979 Newport Jazz Festival, whose cast also included Nell Carter, Gregory Hines and Bobby Short. Writing in The New York Times, John S. Wilson described his routines in the show as ''brilliant combinations of footwork, timing and working an audience.''
        Mr. Gaines is survived by two sons, Leslie E. and Alfred.
