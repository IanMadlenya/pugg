        Bruce D. Kaplan, who helped foster folk and ethnic music as the founder and president of Flying Fish Records, died Tuesday at Illinois Masonic Hospital in Chicago, where he lived. He was 47.
        He died of bacterial meningitis, his family said.
        Mr. Kaplan built on an academic background in anthropology and an interest in folk culture in founding the record company in 1974.
        It became one of the largest independent producers of folk and ethnic music, recording musicians with styles as diverse as country, bluegrass, jazz, African, new age, reggae and rock.
        Of its more than 500 records, 18 have been nominated for Grammy awards, and John Hartford's "Mark Twang" recording won a Grammy in 1977.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Kaplan grew up there and in nearby Oak Park, Ill.
        After graduating from the University of Chicago, Mr. Kaplan earned a master's degree in anthropology .
        His survivors include his wife, Sandra Shifrin; their daughter, Anna; his mother, June Kaufmann of Chicago, and a brother, Michael, of Highland Park, Ill.
