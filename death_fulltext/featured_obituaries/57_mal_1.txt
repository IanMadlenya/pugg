He served in Colombia, Bolivia and Chile, and was Ambassador to Honduras from 1969 to 1973. He later served as deputy director of the United States Information Agency and as a deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.
        He was born in New Haven, served in the Army in World War II and received his bachelor's and master's degrees at Yale University and a doctorate at the University of Madrid. He taught Spanish and Latin American literature at Yale, and later conducted seminars on diplomacy at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University.
        Mr. Ryan, who lived in Winchester, Mass., is survived by his wife, Helene; a son, Anthony H. Ryan, of Winchester, and a daughter, Anne Sprightley, of Washington.
