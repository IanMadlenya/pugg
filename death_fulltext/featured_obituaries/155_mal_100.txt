        Mark Cohen, a major collector of comics and an agent representing some of the world's leading cartoonists in the sale of their original art, died at his home in Santa Rosa on Dec. 19. He was 57.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        After leaving the real estate business several years ago, Mr. Cohen  built up an impressive clientele of comic strip artists, including Charles M. Schulz (''Peanuts''), Lynn Johnston (''For Better or for Worse''), Pat Brady (''Rose Is Rose''), Greg Evans (''Luann'') and Jim Borgman and Jerry Scott (''Zits'').
        Mr. Cohen, a native of Stockton, Calif., was a lifelong collector of cartoon art and amassed one of the world's largest collections of original Mad magazine art, numbering some 9,500 items.
        His comics collection, including about 3,000 books autographed by cartoonists -- many with original drawings -- and hundreds of other cartoon-related items, from Dick Tracy badges to Little Orphan Annie decoders, has been donated to Ohio State University, the repository of the National Cartoonists Society.
        He is survived by his wife, Rose Marie McDaniel; two sons, Eric, of Santa Rosa, and Jeffrey, of Jackson, Calif.; a daughter, Marsha Christmann of Santa Rosa, and a sister, Rochelle Warnier of Cupertino, Calif.
