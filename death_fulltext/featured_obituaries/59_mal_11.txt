        Dr. Bernard M. Halbstein, an orthopedic surgeon, died last Wednesday at the home of his daughter in Oceanport, N.J. He was 81 years old and lived in Interlaken, N.J.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Halbstein, who received his M.D. from Boston University School of Medicine, went into practice in 1939 and was an orthopedic surgeon at Monmouth Memorial Hospital in Monmouth County, N.J. He retired from surgery in 1975 but continued to practice medicine in Long Branch, N.J., until last summer.
        He served as director of orthopedic surgery at Monmouth Medical Center, Long Branch, a community teaching hospital, from 1951 until 1974. He was a consultant and attending physician with a half-dozen other area hospitals. A member and past officer of several medical societies, he was honored by the Medical Society of New Jersey with its 50 years of service award in 1985.
        Dr. Halbstein is survived by a son, David, of Freehold, N.J.; a daughter, Amy Grimm of Oceanport; three sisters, Madeline Froman of Lake Worth, Fla., Bertha Snyder of Sharon, Mass., and Ruth Vallon of Belmont, Mass., and four grandchildren.
