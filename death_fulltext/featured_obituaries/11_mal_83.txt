        In his 40 years at R.C.A., Dr. Brown was also responsible for the company's patent operations and worldwide licensing activities, and served as chief engineer of the industrial electronic products organization and of the commercial electronic products unit.
        Dr. Brown received a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin.
        The holder of more than 80 patents, he received the engineering achievement award from the National Association of Broadcasters in 1986.
        Among his inventions was an electronic device for accelerating the production of penicillin. His device enabled drug companies to complete in 30 minutes a drying process for the drug that formerly took 24 hours.
        He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, and twin sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich, and George, of Princeton, and two grandsons.
