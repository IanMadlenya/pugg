        John Beaufort, the longtime theater critic for The Christian Science Monitor, died on Wednesday at High Ridge House, a sanitarium in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Beaufort died after a brief illness, said his wife, Francesca.
        Mr. Beaufort was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and came to the United States in 1922. He attended Boston University and Rollins College. He joined the staff of The Monitor as a copy boy in 1930 and was named an assistant reviewer in 1935. From 1943 to 1946, he served in the Pacific as a war correspondent.
        Returning to The Monitor after World War II, he was named chief of the New York news bureau and then. In 1951, he became the newspaper's New York City theater and film critic. Except for a three-year stint in the early 1960's when he was The Monitor's bureau chief in London, Mr. Beaufort served primarily as its theater critic from then on, occasionally doubling as the feature editor or arts and entertainment editor.
        During the late 1960's, he was the president of the Drama Desk, the New York critics group. In 1983, he wrote a book called "505 Theater Questions Your Friends Can't Answer."
        Besides his wife, there are no immediate survivors.
