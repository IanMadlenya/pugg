        Reinaldo Povod, the author of the plays "Cuba and His Teddy Bear" and "La Puta Vida Trilogy," died on Saturday. He was 34 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was tuberculosis, said Richard Barbour, a friend and colleague.
        Mr. Povod (pronounced puh-VAHD) quickly achieved prominence when his first full-length play, "Cuba and His Teddy Bear," was produced by Joseph Papp in 1986 at the Public Theater and then on Broadway, with Robert De Niro in the role of Joseph Cuba, a Cuban drug dealer, and Ralph Macchio in the role of his sensitive son, Teddy.
        Although Frank Rich, in The New York Times, called the play "messy, wildly overlong and sometimes soppily autobiographical," he judged it a promising start. "Mr. Povod has an ear, a heart and a sense of humor," he wrote.
        Mr. Povod grew up on the Lower East Side, the son of a Puerto Rican mother and a Cuban father of Russian descent. At 17 he was discovered by Bill Hart, the literary manager of the Public Theater, who attended his play "Cries and Shouts" at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, where Mr. Povod was a protege of Miguel Pinero. Mr. Hart brought Mr. Povod to the attention of Papp, who invited him to become a resident playwright at the Public.
        Mr. Povod's second work there, "La Puta Vida Trilogy" ("This Bitch of a Life") was presented in 1987. Like "Cuba," the three one-act plays presented a grim picture of life on the Lower East Side.
        At the time of his death, Mr. Povod was at work on a play, "Super Fishbowl Sunday," with Mr. Barbour.
        He is survived by his father, Reinaldo, of Manhattan, and a brother, Edward, of the Bronx.
