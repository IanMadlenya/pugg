        Dr. Manrico Troncelliti, an expert on a drastic surgical weight-reducing technique, died on Thursday at Sacred Heart Hospital in Norristown, Pa. He was 77 and lived in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
        His family said he died of a heart attack.
        The weight-reducing technique, first performed as early as 1912, requires disconnecting and bypassing most of the small intestine, thus depriving patients of the ability to absorb most fat.
        Dr. Troncelliti used his advanced technique on eight patients from 1957 to 1965. The results attracted wide attention when they were reported in 1965 at the 51st annual Clinical Congress of the American College of Surgeons. Rarely Used Procedure
        The procedure was used only in rare cases when patients were extremely obese and only after other methods, including short-term starvation, had failed. By 1965, Dr. Troncelliti said, at least 100 such procedures had been performed at several medical centers in the United States.
        Dr. Troncelliti, a graduate of Villanova University and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, was director of surgery for more than 25 years at Norristown State Hospital and was a member of the staffs at Sacred Heart, Montgomery and Bryn Mawr Hospitals.
        He was a fellow of the American College of Surgeons and a past president of the Montgomery County Medical Society.
        He is survived by his wife, Kathleen; three sons, Manrico Troncelliti Jr. of West Norristown, Pa., and J. Edward and F. Joseph Troncelliti of New York City; two daughters, Elizabeth Troncelliti of Eagleville, Pa., and Kathleen T. Johnson of Oxford, Pa., a brother, Rudolph Troncelliti of Ardmore, Pa.; a sister, Theresa T. Mazzone of Naples, Fla., and four grandchildren.
