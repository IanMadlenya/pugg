        Robert H. Abajian, a retired fashion designer for Liz Claiborne, died on Jan. 6 in his home in Manhattan. He was 62.
        The cause was lung cancer, said a friend, Ronald Marshall of Manhattan.
        As a senior vice president at Liz Claiborne, he was in charge of coordinating design for the $1.1 billion sportswear division, which consists of three lines. He took over the company's design direction when Ms. Claiborne retired as company chairwoman in 1989. Mr. Abajian retired last year.
        In a 42-year career in the apparel industry, he served as design director for the apparel company College Town/Panther from 1980 to 1983 and spent 11 years as design director for Bobbie Brooks. He joined Liz Claiborne in 1984 as design director and, after a brief period away from the company, returned in 1987 as vice president of the Lizsport line.
        He developed a studio at Liz Claiborne where recent design graduates could work with an established director in developing their skills.
        He received his training from the Fashion Institute of Technology. In 1978, he received the Mortimer Ritter Award, presented for outstanding achievement in design. He was a member and the president in 1992 of Fashion's Inner Circle.
        He is survived by a brother, Anthony, of Lineboro, Md.
