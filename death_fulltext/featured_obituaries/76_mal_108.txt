        George M. DeLalio, an aeronautical engineer and authority on electron beam technology, died on Friday at his home in Dix Hills, L.I. He was 63.
        In 1965, Mr. DeLalio was founding president of E B Industries of Farmingdale, L.I., which over the years has used electron-beam technology on a broad range of projects for NASA, I.B.M., A.T.& T. and other major corporations. In this process, an accelerated stream of electrons is used to fuse precision components together.
        Also a specialist in mechanical hydraulics, Mr. DeLalio is has five patents on hydraulic transmissions, widely used in buses, tanks and other motor vehicles.
        Mr. DeLalio demonstrated his mechanical skills early. As a boy he revived a neighbor's Model T and overhauled the irrigation system on his family's farm. He also began flying biplanes, taking off from the farm.
        Graduating from Purdue University in 1952 with a degree in aeronautical engineering, he went to work as a test pilot for the Sikorsky Aircraft Company in Connecticut. At the age of 33, he became chief engineer for Highway Products Inc. of Akron, Ohio.
        He was a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for 40 years and an associate of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.
        He is survived by two sons, Steven, of Colchester, Conn., and George, of Dix Hills; two daughters, Barbara Bianco of North Babylon, L.I., and Nancy DiMartino of Belle Terre, L.I.; three brothers, Leonard, of Farmingdale, L.I., Louis, of Laurel Hollow, L.I., and Robert, of Dix Hills; a sister, Eunice Stattel of Amityville, L.I., and six grandchildren.
