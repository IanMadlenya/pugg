        Richard Marsh Bennett, a retired architect whose projects ranged from houses  of worship and campus buildings to shopping centers and a fire academy, died on  May 2 at the Sherrill House in Boston. A former resident of Chicago, he was 89 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        Born in Braddock, Pa., he graduated from Harvard College in 1928 and received a master's degree in architecture from the Harvard School of Architecture in 1931. He started an academic career at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
        In the late 1930's he was an associate architect in the New York office of Edward Durrell Stone, working on drawings for the Museum of Modern Art building. He then teamed with Caleb Hornbostel to design the art center and student-alumnae building at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.
        In his year at Chicago he was a partner in Loebl, Schlossman and Bennett, which did the drawings for apartment buildings, synagogues, churches and shopping centers, among other things, including the City of Chicago Fire Academy.
        In the late 1950's Mr. Bennett served a term with Eero Saarinen and Edgar I.  Williams on a special board to counsel the State Department on the design of embassies.
        Mr. Bennett also taught at Columbia University, Vassar College and Yale.
        Mr. Bennett's survivors include his wife, Susan Jacobson Bennett; two children by a previous marriage, and six grandchildren.
