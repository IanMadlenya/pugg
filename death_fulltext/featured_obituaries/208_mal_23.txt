        Fred Karlin, a prolific composer of film and television soundtracks who won both an Academy Award and an Emmy Award, died on March 26 in Culver City, Calif., where he lived. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, said Pat Connolly, a family friend.
        Mr. Karlin wrote music for more than 100 movies and television shows, including the film ''Lovers and Other Strangers'' from 1970, whose ''For All We Know,'' with lyrics by Robb Royer and James Griffin, won an Oscar for best song in 1971. When the Carpenters recorded the song that year, it became a Top 10 hit.
        Mr. Karlin was nominated, with various collaborators, for three other Oscars, for songs in the films ''The Sterile Cuckoo'' in 1969 and ''The Little Ark'' in 1972, and for the score to ''The Baby Maker,'' in 1970.
        He won his Emmy for the score for the television movie ''The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,'' from 1974, and was nominated 10 other times for Emmys.
        He also wrote music for the films ''Leadbelly,'' from 1976; ''Futureworld,'' also from 1976, with Peter Fonda and Blythe Danner; and ''Zandy's Bride,'' from 1974, which starred Gene Hackman and Liv Ullmann. His first credit was ''Up the Down Staircase,'' in 1967.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Karlin began playing jazz trumpet. He graduated from Amherst College and worked as a composer and arranger for Benny Goodman. In 1990 he wrote, with Rayburn Wright and John Williams, a textbook on film scoring called ''On the Track,'' which remains in print.
        He is survived by his wife, Megan Wells-Stagg Karlin; a brother, Kenneth; a son, Eric; two daughters, Wendy Karlin and Kathryn Velasquez; and four grandchildren.
