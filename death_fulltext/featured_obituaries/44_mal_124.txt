        Dr. Spiegelberg was active in spreading the study of development of human consciousness and self-awareness, phenomenology, in this country. He wrote several books on the subject, including ''The Phenomenological Movement,'' in 1960, which was revised in 1982. His most recent book was ''Steppingstones Toward an Ethics for Fellow Existers,'' published in 1986.
        He was born in Strasbourg in the Alsatian region of France and studied at the universities of Heidelberg, Freiburg and Munich. He received a Ph.D. from the University of Munich in 1928. After emigrating to the United States in 1937, he taught at Swarthmore College and Lawrence University before joining the Washington University faculty in 1963. He retired in 1971.
        He is survived by his wife, Eldora; two daughters, Gwen Butler of Geneva, N.Y., and Lynne Morgan of Fairfield, Conn., and three grandchildren.
