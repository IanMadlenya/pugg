        Calvin R. Sperling, a botanist who led the Department of Agriculture's explorations for plants for seven years, died on May 20. He was 38.
        The cause was melanoma cancer, the Department of Agriculture said.
        From 1987 to 1994, Dr. Sperling served as chief plant explorer for the Agriculture Research Service, working on the agency's foreign and domestic trips in search of cultivated and wild plants that might possess the genes for such traits as drought tolerance, pest or disease resistance and improved flavor.
        Trips he coordinated to more than 40 countries resulted in the addition of more than 1,000 new plant varieties to the National Plant Germplasm System, the United States' treasury of plant genes.
        Dr. Sperling led a United Nations effort in 1993 to conserve the genetic diversity of cultivated crops in Ethiopia when the country's drought threatened some traditional varieties with extinction.
        Dr. Sperling graduated from North Dakota State University in 1979 and earned a master's degree and doctorate from Harvard.
        He is survived by his wife, Debra Gilmore, and son, Carl, of Silver Springs, Md.; a sister, Beverly, of Oklahoma City; a brother, Roger, of Shakopee, Minn., and his parents, Clarence and Doris Sperling, of Farwell, Minn.
