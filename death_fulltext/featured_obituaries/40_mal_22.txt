        Charles D. Ewart, the general manager of the Philadelphia Eagles when they won their first National Football League championship in 1948, died on Monday after a long illness. He was 74 years old.
        From 1942 to 1946, he was an F.B.I. agent assigned to espionage cases and security assignments, including the Manhattan Project, which built the atom bomb.
        He joined the Eagles' staff in 1946 as backfield coach and was promoted to general manager in 1948. That year, the Eagles defeated the Chicago Cardinals, 7-0, for the championship.
        He is survived by his wife, Juliette; three sons, James, Stephen and David; a brother, Fred, and 10 grandchildren.
