        Dr. Warren Dean, a professor of Latin American history at New York University, died on Saturday in Santiago, Chile, where he had been conducting research. Dr. Dean, who lived in Manhattan, was 61.
        Cooking gas that had leaked from an apparently defective fuel line asphyxiated Dr. Dean as he slept in his apartment, a colleague, Prof. Christopher Mitchell, said.
        Dr. Dean, who was the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of History, specialized in the modern environmental, economic and social history of Brazil. He was on a three-month project researching changes in both the Amazon rain forest and Brazil's Atlantic coastal forest.
        His books include "The Industrialization of Sao Paulo" (University of Texas Press, 1969), "Rio Claro: A Brazilian Plantation System 1820-1920" (Stanford University Press, 1976) and "Brazil and the Struggle for Rubber" (Cambridge University Press, 1987). His final book, "With Broadax and Firebrand: The Destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Coast Forest," is to be published later this year by the University of California Press.
        A graduate of the University of Miami, he received a doctorate from the University of Florida and taught at the University of Texas before arriving at New York University's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies in 1970. Dr. Dean also was a visiting professor at the Universities of Sao Paulo and Parana in Brazil.
        Dr. Dean is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, a daughter, Julia and a son, Thomas, all of Manhattan, and his mother, Gabrielle Bach of Miami.
