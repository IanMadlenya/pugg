        William G. (Beaver) Harris, a jazz drummer who worked with the leading avant-gardists of the 1960's and led his own groups, died on Dec. 22 at his home in New York City. He was 55 years old.
        His wife, Glo, said he died of prostate cancer.
        With avant-garde groups, Mr. Harris's drumming was both swirling and muscular, waves of rhythm that gave propulsion and texture to the incantations of saxophonists like Albert Ayler and Archie Shepp. But Mr. Harris was also steeped in more traditional forms of jazz swing and in African and Caribbean rhythms. His own group, the 360-Degree Music Experience, included a steel drummer along with saxophonists and the rhythm section, and moved freely between traditional and experimental jazz on its albums "From Ragtime to No Time" and "A Well Kept Secret."
        Mr. Harris was born in Pittsburgh and became a professional baseball player in the Negro Leagues. Although he was scouted by the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, he gave up baseball for music after working with the saxophonist Sonny Rollins.
        During the 1960's and 70's, Mr. Harris performed with Mr. Ayler, Mr. Shepp, the pianist Cecil Taylor and the Jazz Composers' Orchestra, establishing a reputation as a free-jazz drummer. But he also worked in more traditional styles with the pianist Thelonious Monk, the trumpeters Chet Baker and Doc Cheatham and the guitarist Larry Coryell. In the 70's and 80's he was co-leader of the 360-Degree Music Experience with the pianists Dave Burrell and then Don Pullen. Before illness ended his career, he was in a trio with the pianist Barry Harris and the bassist Ron Carter.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Portia, of New York City, and Verna, of Pittsburgh; a son, William, of New York City; a brother, Earl, of Pittsburgh, and two sisters, Vernita Griggs of Pittsburgh and Rosalyn, of Winston-Salem, N.C.
