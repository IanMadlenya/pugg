        Amalia Mendoza, a diva of mariachi music whose dramatic performances brought fans to tears on both sides of the United States-Mexico border, died here on June 11. She was 78.
        The cause was a disease that slowly paralyzed her lungs, news reports said.
        Famous for songs like ''Echame la Culpa'' (''Put the Blame on Me'') and ''Amarga Navidad'' (''Bitter Christmas''), Ms. Mendoza had a career that spanned more than 30 years. She recorded about 36 albums, including ''Las Tres Señoras,'' made in 1996 with two other popular singers of Mexican country music, Lola Beltran and Lucha Villa.
        Mariachi music, rising from the sun-parched valleys of Jalisco, became a signature of Mexican culture during the years of revolution, when groups of traveling musicians performed emotional songs about heroic triumphs and tragic defeats. Their songs are an important part of Mexican oral history.
        Ms. Mendoza, one of the first women to become successful in the genre, used her music to share her life. Her eyes filled with tears, her arms outstretched and pleading, she moved her audiences with stories about betrayal and lost loves.
        She was born in 1923 into a family of musicians in the state of Michoacan. She became known as La Tariacuri, a name that the indigenous Purepecha tribes used for their king. Her brothers had performed as a trio, and Ms. Mendoza began performing duets with her sister, Perla.
        She began her solo career in 1954 with her recording of ''Puñalada Trasera'' (''Backstab'') and gained fame later that year when she began broadcasting over Mexico's leading radio station, XEW.
        Ms. Mendoza is survived by a nephew she reared as a son, Guillermo Valero Mendoza, and his children.
        ''I cry when I sing because I have known sadness in my life,'' she said in 1985. ''I live what I sing. I tell a story, and I become that person in it.''
