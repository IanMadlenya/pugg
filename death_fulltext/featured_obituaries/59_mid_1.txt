        Mary R. Williams, chairman of the Teagle Foundation for the past 14 years, died Dec. 12 at New York Hospital. She was 93 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Williams, then Mary Richardson, joined the staff of Walter Clark Teagle in 1917 when he was elected president of the Standard Oil Company (New Jersey), now Exxon. Mr. Teagle, who retired as chairman in 1942, established the foundation two years later. Its primary purpose is to provide scholarships in higher education for children of Exxon employees, but it also supports charities such as the United Way and the Salvation Army.
        Mrs. Williams had served as an officer of the foundation in various capacities since its creation and became a director in 1960.
        She is survived by a stepdaughter, Margaret Williams of Manhattan.
