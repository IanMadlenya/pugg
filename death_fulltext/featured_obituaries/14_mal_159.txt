        J. B. Tietz, a Los Angeles attorney who specialized in selective service law, died of a heart attack March 13 at his home in Los Angeles. He was 87 years old.
        Mr. Tietz, a native of Cincinnati, devoted his practice to the defense of conscientious objectors. As staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union during World War II he also helped Japanese-Americans who had been interned. At war's end he was named an honorary Nisei veteran because of his work on their behalf.
        When the draft was reactivated for the Korean and Vietnam wars, Mr. Tietz became one of the leading selective service lawyers in private practice. His most widely recognized success was a 1970 Supreme Court decision, U.S. v. Welsh, in which the Court held that conscientious objectors need not base their claim to an exemption from the draft on religion but could rely on other ethical and moral principles.
        The test, the Court declared, is that an individual's beliefs must be ''deeply held'' and must not not be based solely on ''considerations of policy, pragmatism or expediency.''
        Survivors include his wife, the former Johnnie Mae Patterson; two sons, Dr. Joseph E. Bogen of Pasadena, Calif., and Boris K. Bogen of Mt. Kisco, N.Y.; a daughter, Judy B. Gilbert of Orinda, Calif.; a stepson, Walter J. Cribbs of Mill Valley, Calif., and 10 grandchildren.
