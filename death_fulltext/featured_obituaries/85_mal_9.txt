        Charles Woodward, a producer or co-producer of a score of Broadway and Off Broadway shows in the 1960's and 70's, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in Charlotte Amalie in the United States Virgin Islands.
        The cause was stomach cancer, said Shirley Herz, a friend.
        Mr. Woodward, often in association with his partner Richard Barr, who died in 1989, produced a string of hits after his first major success, the production of Mart Crowley's comedy "The Boys in the Band," in 1968.
        Other productions in which Mr. Woodward was involved include "Johnny No-Trump" (1967), "Watercolor" (1970), "Criss-Crossing" (1970), "What the Butler Saw" (1970), Edward Albee's "All Over" (1971), "Drat!" (1971), "The Grass Harp" (1971), "The Last of Mrs. Lincoln" (1972), "Noel Coward in Two Keys" (1974), "P.S. Your Cat is Dead" (1975) and Mr. Albee's "Seascape" (1975) and "Sweeney Todd" (1979).
        A native of Niagara Falls, N.Y., Mr. Woodward left a successful family insurance business to move to Manhattan and become a producer.
        He is survived by a brother, Dueul, of Fort Myers, Fla., and a sister, Priscilla Walck of Grand Island, N.Y.
