        In the 1980's, Mr. Prestes accused the Brazilian Communist Party of abandoning Marxist-Leninist dogma. He was removed from the leadership in 1980 and expelled from the party in 1984.
        He campaigned for Leonel Brizola, a center-left candidate, in the 1989 presidential election, won by Fernando Collor de Mello.
        In his final days, nearly penniless, Mr. Prestes was largely supported by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer.
        Mr. Prestes's body is to lie in state at the Rio de Janeiro State Assembly before burial at Sao Joao Batista cemetery, Dr. Meira said.
        Mr. Prestes is survived by his wife, Maria do Carmo Ribeiro, and 10 children.
