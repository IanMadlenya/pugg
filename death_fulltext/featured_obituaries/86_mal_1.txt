        Jose M. Bosch, who ran the Bacardi rum empire for 32 years until his retirement in 1976, died on Sunday at his home in Coral Gables, Fla. He was 95.
        Mr. Bosch, who moved to Florida from Nassau, the Bahamas, two years ago, died after a brief illness, his family said.
        He was born in Santiago de Cuba, the son of a Spanish banker and sugar mill owner who made his fortune in Cuba. He briefly studied engineering at Lehigh University and later went to work in his father's sugar mills.
        The younger Mr. Bosch rose quickly in the industry, but when sugar prices plunged in the early 1920's, he changed careers, taking a bookkeeper's job at the Havana branch of the First National City Bank of New York. He then married Enriqueta Schueg Bacardi, a member of the family that founded the Bacardi Corporation in 1862 and made it into one of the world's biggest rum distillers and distributors. Twice to the Rescue
        Bacardi, whose rums are sold throughout the world, now has its headquarters in Bermuda. The founders' descendants continue to control most of its subsidiary companies.
        Mr. Bosch, who was known to his friends as Pepin, was credited with saving Bacardi twice -- during the Depression in the 1930's, when the company came to the brink of bankruptcy, and in 1960, when all its assets in Cuba were seized by the Castro Government.
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Bosch served briefly as Cuba's Minister of the Treasury under President Carlos Prio Socarras. After Fidel Castro overthrew the Batista regime in 1959, Mr. Bosch maintained close ties to the Cuban exile community in Miami. He retired from actively managing Bacardi in 1976.
        Mr. Bosch's first wife, Enriqueta, died in 1975. He is survived by his second wife, Maria Miller Bosch; two sons, Jorge, of Miami, and Carlos, of Bermuda; a sister, Maria Bosch Mercade of Coral Gables, six grandchildren and a great-grandson.
