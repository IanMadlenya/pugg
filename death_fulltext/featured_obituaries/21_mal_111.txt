        Philip O. Krumm, a former president of the United States Olympic Committee, died of a heart attack Sunday at his home in Divide. He was 82 years old.
        Mr. Krumm, who served as president of the Olympic committee from 1973 to 1977, ''was completely devoted and dedicated to the Olympic movement and amateur sports in the United States,'' said Don Miller, president of the United States Olympic Foundation.
        Mr. Krumm, a native of Wisconsin, was born Oct. 9, 1906. He founded the United States International Speedskating Association and participated in the sport as a competitor, official and executive, representing the association in the International Skating Union.
        Mr. Krumm was widely recognized for persuading Wisconsin to help raise the funds for construction of the nation's first refrigerated speed-skating rink in West Allis.
        He was named to the U.S.O.C. board of directors in 1961 and was elected president in 1973. He later appointed the first Athletes Advisory Board to serve as a liaison between the athletes and the committee.
        After his term as president, Mr. Krumm remained a member of the committee's executive board until his death, and served as chief of mission for the United States delegation to the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia.
        In 1987, he received the silver Olympic Order of Merit, which is the International Olympic Committee's highest award of distinction.
        Mr. Krumm is survived by his wife, Dorothy; and three children from a previous marriage, Kent, Steven and Phyllis.
