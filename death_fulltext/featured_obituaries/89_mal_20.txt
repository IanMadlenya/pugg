        Dr. Henry T. Randall, a surgeon and medical educator who was an executive of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York from 1951 to 1965, died on Tuesday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Dr. Randall, who lived in Bristol, R.I., was 79.
        The cause was a stroke, said his wife, Louise Randall.

He was a lieutenant colonel in the Army Medical Corps in Europe during World War II.
        Starting in 1951, Dr. Randall served in several surgical, research and administrative positions at Sloan-Kettering, including, from 1961 to 1965, vice president for clinical affairs.
        He joined the faculty of Brown University as a professor of medical science in 1967 and became surgeon in chief of Rhode Island Hospital. He retired in 1979.
        He is survived by his wife, of Bristol; two daughters, Martha Tillim of Warwick, N.Y., and Deborah Randall of Chevy Chase, Md.; a son, Henry, of West Warwick, R.I., and four grandchildren.
