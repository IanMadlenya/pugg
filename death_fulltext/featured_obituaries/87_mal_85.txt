        William Fabrikant, a Manhattan diamond trader, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. He was 79 and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        He had a long illness, his family said.
        A 1935 graduate of New York University, Mr. Fabrikant was an expert on diamond and antique jewelry. He played a role in developing the concept of the jewelry exchange, which put competing jewelers, watch stores and designers in booths under one roof, first on Canal Street and now on 47th Street. At his death he was managing partner of the International Jewelry Exchange at 578 Fifth Avenue.
        Mr. Fabrikant is survived by his wife, Sherry; a daughter, Stacey, of New York City, and two sons, Andrew, of New York City, and Paul, of Winterhaven, Fla.
