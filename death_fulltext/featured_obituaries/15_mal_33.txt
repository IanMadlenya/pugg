        Sir Denis Hamilton, a former chairman of the Reuters news agency and a leading figure in the British newspaper industry for more than four decades, died today at his London home after a long illness. He was 69 years old. The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Hamilton was chairman of Reuters from 1979 to 1985, during the British-based agency's expansion of its financial news services.
        He was a former editor in chief and chairman of Times Newspapers Ltd., which includes the Times of London.
        As chief executive of Times Newspapers, Mr. Hamilton battled production unions over computer technology and staff cutbacks. It culminated in a yearlong strike that closed the newspapers in 1978. In 1981, they were bought by Rupert Murdoch.
        Mr. Hamilton introduced into British journalism the color magazine supplement, now a feature of the national weekly newpapers.
        He began his career as a reporter on the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette in northern England in 1936. He became editor of the Sunday Times, weekly companion of the Times of London, as well as editorial director of the group, when Lord Thomson of Canada bought the newspapers in 1959.
        He was the first president, from 1978 until 1983, of the International Press Institute, an organization of more than 200 editors and publishers. He was also a chairman of the British Museum and received a knighthood in 1976.
        Mr. Hamilton is survived by his wife, Olive, and four sons.
