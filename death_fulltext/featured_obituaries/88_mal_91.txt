        Gilbert F. Richards, who retired in 1980 as chairman of the Budd Company, a manufacturer of transportation equipment based in Troy, Mich., died on Wednesday at his home in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico. Mr. Richards, a former resident of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., was 78.
        He died of a stroke he suffered in December, the company said.
        Mr. Richards was born in Prairieburg, Iowa, and attended Tilton Academy in New Hampshire. He worked with Henry Kaiser at Kaiser's West Coast shipyard in World War II and rose through a series of sales and production jobs before he joined Budd in 1958 as a product sales manager in the company's Philadelphia office.
        In 1959 he moved to Detroit as vice president of sales in Budd's automotive division. He became general manager and a vice president of the division in 1965 and president in 1968.
        Mr. Richards was named president and chief executive of Budd in 1971, and was chairman from 1974 until his retirement. In 1978, he played a central role when the company became a subsidiary of Thyssen A.G., a German steel maker.
        He is survived by his wife, Mitzi, five children and four grandchildren.
