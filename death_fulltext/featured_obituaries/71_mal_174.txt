        Lawrence E. Bruce Jr., a lawyer and president of the United States Committee for Unicef, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 47.
        He died of complications from a liver ailment, a family member said.
        As head of the largest national committee for the United Nation's Children's Fund for seven years, Mr. Bruce became a spokesman for children and their needs, addressing audiences throughout the United States and on network news programs. He traveled the world from Guatemala to Mozambique to Bangladesh to report on the plight of children.
        His message was both sober and hopeful. Frequently he said that 40,000 children die each day from "preventable causes." But he said he was convinced that Unicef and other organizations were moving toward the eradication of malnutrition.
        Under his leadership, the United States Committee more than doubled its revenue from fund-raising, from $18 million in 1985 to an expected total of $41 million this year. In the same period, the Government's contribution to Unicef rose from $53 million to $100 million.
        Before he joined the committee in 1985, Mr. Bruce served two years as executive vice president of AFS Intercultural Programs and four years as general counsel at the Inter-American Foundation.
        Mr. Bruce was the first American and, at the age of 43, the youngest person ever to serve as chairman of the executive committee of Unicef's 32 national organizations, serving from 1988 to 1990.
        He was born in Huntington, W. Va. He graduated from Marshall University and West Virginia University School of Law.
        Surviving are his parents, Lawrence and Joanne Bruce of Huntington, and a sister, Bonnie Joe Chittum of Washington.
