        Herbert Berman, a New York tax and corporate lawyer long active in civic and Jewish causes, died on Thursday at his home in Forest Hills, Queens. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to the Manhattan firm Tenzer Greenblatt, of which he was the most senior active member.
        Mr. Berman sat on New York City's Board of Higher Education from 1967 to 1973 and later was a consultant to the New York State Moreland Commission on the Urban Development Corporation and State Financing Agencies. He was a trustee of the Queens Borough Public Library System and a member of the Real Estate Board of New York.
        He conducted continuing education courses at the American Law Institute and was a delegate at three White House conferences, on foreign trade in 1958, on children and youth in 1960 and on aging in 1961.
        He was a past trustee of New York University and an officer in many Jewish educational organizations, including the Rabbi Isaac Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University, Bar-Ilan University in Israel and the Queens College Center for Jewish Studies, of which he was a founder and longtime advisory board chairman.
        He was also closely involved with the America-Israel Friendship League, UJA-Federation of New York, the World Jewish Congress, the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the Orthodox Union.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Berman graduated from New York University in 1944 and was just out of Harvard Law School when he joined what was then Tenzer Greenblatt Fallon & Kaplan in 1947. He was a partner from 1953 to 1972. Afterward, he remained of counsel to the firm.
        He is survived by his wife of 46 years, the former Daisy Koenig; two daughters, Sara and Debra, both of Manhattan; a son, Nathaniel, of Cambridge, Mass., and a sister, Marylin Moed of Manhattan.
