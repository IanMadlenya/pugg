        Gilbert O. Herman, an actor and producer who as a World War II Air Force officer played a similar role in the wartime play ''Winged Victory'' and who later became a major general in the Air Force Reserve, died on Sept. 6 in a hospital in Annapolis, Md. He was 80.
        ''Winged Victory,'' about World War II airmen, was written and directed by Moss Hart and presented on Broadway by what was then called the Army Air Forces to benefit the Army Emergency Relief Fund.
        Mr. Herman, who had been an actor in civilian life, was a second lieutenant when he opened in the part of one in ''Winged Victory.'' Offstage, Lieutenant Herman filled the real-life role of executive officer of the Air Forces' administrative staff for the play.
        A native Philadelphian, Mr. Herman received a bachelor's degree from the Wharton School of Finance.
        His career included working off-screen on the 1944 movie version of ''Winged Victory,'' acting in other plays and movies and working in television. He was an independent producer of programs including ''The Alan Young Show'' and ''The Kentuckian,'' with Burt Lancaster, and he also became an NBC and CBS production executive.
        He is survived by two sisters, Edith H. Feder of Crofton, Md., and Shirley H. Goldstein of Annapolis.
