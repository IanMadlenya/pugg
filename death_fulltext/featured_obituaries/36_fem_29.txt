        Mrs. Dunn, who was 75, specialized in photographing children and was one of the early users of color film for advertising layouts. Her photographs appeared on the huge Kodak screen on the Grand Central Terminal concourse. She took the photographs for ''The Little Animals,'' a series of best-selling children's books in the 1960's for which another daughter, Judith Spangenberg, wrote the texts.
        Mrs. Dunn is survived by a son, Tristram, of Darien, Conn., as well as by Mrs. Spangenberg, who lives in South Salem, N.Y., and by four grandchildren, including Mrs. Hanson's three children.
