        Max Perlow, a labor leader of the 1940's, died on Saturday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. He was 90 and lived in the Bronx.
        The cause was cancer of the esophagus, said his family.

        Rising to the position of international secretary-treasurer, Mr. Perlow was ousted from the executive board in 1950 when a majority defeated a dominant leftist faction. He had resigned from the Communist Party the previous year to take the non-Communist oath required by the Taft-Hartley labor legislation.
        He turned away from far-left politics when he learned of the murder of Jewish authors in the Soviet Union during the Stalin era. After the "red scare" in this country subsided in the 1960's, he became administrator of the health-and-welfare fund of the U.F.W.'s bedding workers Local 140 and founded the local's monthly newspaper.
        He retired from the union in 1973.Starting in the 1930's, he wrote in Yiddish for various publications and produced short stories and a novel.
        Born in Ukraine, he came to this country shortly after World War I.
        He is survived by a son, Leonard, of San Francisco; three granddaughters; four great-grandchildren, and one great-great-grandson.
