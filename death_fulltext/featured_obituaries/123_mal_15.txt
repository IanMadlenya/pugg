        Marvin A. Schneiderman, a specialist in health statistics and a retired associate director for science and public policy at the National Cancer Institute, died on Tuesday at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 78.
        The cause was coronary artery disease, said his wife, Irene.
        Dr. Schneiderman began his Public Health Service career in the 1940's as an expert in statistical applications for biological and medical experiments. Later, he studied the cancer-causing effects of drinking, smoking and exposure to the sun.
        In addition to his wife of 54 years, who lives in Bethesda, he is survived by three daughters, Jo Schneiderman of Roslindale, Mass., Sarah Schneiderman of Portland, Ore., and Susan Sykes of Mocksville, N.C., and three grandchildren.
