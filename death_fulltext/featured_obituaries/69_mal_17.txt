        Antonello Marescalchi, who retired last year as the New York-based American correspondent for the Italian television network RAI, died on Tuesday at his home on the East Side of Manhattan. He was 65 years old.
        He died of lung cancer, his family said.
        A native of Leghorn (Livorno), Italy, Mr. Marescalchi spent 40 years as a radio and televison journalist, 20 of them in New York. He first came to this country in 1962 to report from the United Nations. From 1970 to 1974, he worked in Hong Kong. He returned to New York in 1979 as RAI's United States correspondent, a position he held until his retirement.
        Mr. Marescalchi is survived by his wife, the former Mimma Paterno del Grado.
