        Edgar A. Grunwald, an executive of the McGraw-Hill publishing company for more than 25 years, died on Friday at his home in Northport, L.I. He was 84.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Janie.
        Mr. Grunwald joined Business Week in 1941 as marketing editor and became managing editor in 1946, serving until 1955. He left McGraw-Hill then, returning in 1959 to be editor of Purchasing Week. He retired in 1973.
        He was the co-author of "The Industrial Price Forecaster" (McGraw-Hill Books, 1978) and the author of "The Business Press Editor" (New York University Press, 1988). Mr. Grunwald graduated from the University of Chicago and served as an Army medic during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, of Northport; a daughter, Jane Baumann of Commack, L.I., and three grandchildren.
