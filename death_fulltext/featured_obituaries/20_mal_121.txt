        Charles H. Levine, a political scientist who was an expert on the civil service, died of a heart attack Friday night at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 49 years old.
        Dr. Levine was Distinguished Professor of Government and Public Administration at American University and deputy director of the National Commission on the Public Service.
        A champion of the civil service, he lamented what he saw as a decline in morale of Federal workers. He assailed the frequent attacks on the civil service by politicians and government officials and the increasing use of political appointees to fill top civil service jobs.
        A native of Hartford, Dr. Levine earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Connecticut and master's and doctoral degrees in political science at Indiana University.
        He was the author of nine books, the most noted of which was ''Managing Fiscal Stress.'' The book dealt with the many techniques used by cities and counties to deal with fiscal crises.
        ''His books and articles in that field are considered seminal contributions, and have been quoted by scholars and used by practitioners for the past ten years,'' said Bernard Ross, professor of government and public administration at American University.
        Dr. Levine is survived by his wife Elaine; his mother, Elaine Levine Gipstein, and a son, Jordan.
