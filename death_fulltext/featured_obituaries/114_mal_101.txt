        Brian E. Bent, an accomplished researcher who was appointed a professor of chemistry at Columbia University this month, died on Tuesday while cycling with  his family in Superior National Forest in Minnesota. He was 35 and lived in Manhattan.
        After collapsing, Dr. Bent was taken to North Shore Hospital in Grand Marais, Minn., where he was pronounced dead. No specific cause has been established, his wife, Stacey, said.
        Dr. Bent investigated chemical reactions at solid surfaces, especially those involving a gas. He showed how a number of commercially important chemical reactions take place at the molecular level. His approach was to seal a surface  under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, allow the reaction to take place, and then probe the surface using electron beams, mass spectroscopy and isotope labeling to identify molecules and their actions on the surface.
        He and his colleagues recently devised a new method of fabricating microelectronic devices that use the semiconductor gallium arsenide. Unlike methods now in use, they chose an all-chemical approach that etches away a layer of gallium arsenide at a time, resulting in fewer defects.
        Dr. Bent graduated from Carleton College in 1982 and received a Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1986. He did research at AT&T Bell Laboratories before joining the Columbia faculty in 1988.
        In addition to his wife, an assistant professor of chemistry at New York University, he is survived by his parents, Henry and Anne, of Pittsburgh; a sister, Libby, of Buffalo; a son, Andrew, and a daughter, Rachel.
