        Dr. Alva C. Cooper, a pioneer in college career counseling and placement and an advocate for minorities and women, died on Friday in New Millford, N.J. She was 83.
        Her nephew, John H. Taylor Jr., said she had a long illness.
        Dr. Cooper was born in New York City and was a resident of Bayville, L.I.
        While she was a professor at Hunter College in New York, she established one of the nation's first on-campus college placement offices. She also helped to found several professional organizations serving the personnel recruitment industry.
        She was one of the founders of the Council on Career Development for Minorities and traveled extensively, establishing career offices at colleges and universities with mostly black enrollments and seeking job opportunites for minorities in corporate America.
        In 1965, Dr. Cooper was appointed to a task force on the role of women in the military by Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara. She was a member of a task force of 20 women who worked closely with President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in setting a policy for the recruitment of women into the American military and defining their roles.
        Dr. Cooper retired from Hunter College as Professor Emeritus in 1976. Her husband, James Cooper, died in 1982.
        Survivors include a sister, Rosemarie C. Taylor of River Edge, N.J.; two nieces, Valerie E. Herbstman of East Quogue, L.I., and Jeanne Alva Besley of Bayville, and a nephew, John H. Taylor Jr. of Lattington, L.I.
