        E. Ira Marienhoff, who taught social studies in New York City schools for nearly five decades, died on Dec. 17 in the hospice of Beth Israel Hospital. He was 72 and lived in Teaneck, N.J.
        The cause was cancer, said Dr. Anthony Miserandino, the principal of Hunter College High School, where Mr. Marienhoff taught history, political science and economics for the last 28 years.
        Before joining Hunter, he taught at the High School for Music and Art, the Machine and Metal Trades High School and George Washington High School.
        He also wrote a textbook with Roy Sampson and William Mortenson, "The American Economy," which was used by high school students in the early 1970's.
        He received an undergraduate degree from City College in 1942 and a master's degree in history from Columbia University Teacher's College in 1948.
