        Mr. Camp started in the antiques business in Manhattan in the late 1950's after 15 years as an actor on Broadway. Some of his roles were in ''Junior Miss,'' ''Men of the Sea'' and ''This Too, Shall Pass.''
        A graduate of Iowa State University, Mr. Camp worked for several years in Rome as a dubbing actor for films.
        At his shop on Second Avenue and 53d Street, Mr. Camp specialized in unusual items like elephant hooves and turn-of-the-century metal chairs. In the mid-70's he moved his shop to the Hamptons, where he specialized in English furniture, china and glassware.
        His companion and partner was David Murray.
