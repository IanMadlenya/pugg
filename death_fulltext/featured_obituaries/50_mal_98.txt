        Donald Murdoch Frame, a French scholar and an authority on the works of Montaigne and Rabelais, died on Friday at the Woodbine Convalescent Care Center in Alexandria, Va., where he lived. He was 79 years old.
        Dr. Frame, who suffered a stroke in 1989, died of complications from pneumonia, a spokesman for Columbia University said.
        Dr. Frame was Moore Professor Emeritus of French at Columbia University, and a member of the French department for 40 years. From 1946 to 1950, he was assistant to the dean of the college and from 1971 to 1972 he was chairman of the Humanities Program, which he helped to found. He retired in 1980.
        He wrote six books, including a doctoral dissertation, on Michel de Montaigne, the 16th-century essayist, and a study of Rabelais published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1977. His translation of the complete works of Montaigne (Harcourt, Brace & World, 1957) is widely considered the definitive English work. Other translations include the complete works of Rabelais, to be published by the University of California Press in late fall.
        He was a visiting professor at Rutgers, Fordham, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, and, from 1967 to 1968, a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar at colleges around the country.
        Dr. Frame was born in Manhattan and graduated from Harvard with honors in 1932. He received a master's degree and Ph.D. from Columbia. He served in the Navy in World War II.
        His first wife, Katherine Mailler Wygant, died in 1972.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Kathleen Whelan; two sons from his first marriage, James, of Orchard Park, N.Y., and Donald Jr., of New Hyde Park, N.Y.; a brother, Dr. James Sutherland Frame of East Lansing, Mich., and five grandchildren.
