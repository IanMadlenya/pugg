        Herbert W. Hoover Jr., a former chairman of the Hoover Company, the vacuum cleaner maker that his grandfather founded at the turn of the century, died on Monday in Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach. He lived in Bal Harbour, Fla., and was 79.
        Starting with summer jobs on the assembly line, Mr. Hoover moved through sales and executive posts to the presidency of the family company, based in North Canton, Ohio, in 1954, succeeding his father. Five years later he became chairman, and he served as the company's top executive until September 1966, when he was ousted in a management dispute.
        The Hoover Company is no longer owned by the founding family, which sold it in 1986. The current owner is the Maytag Corporation, which acquired the company in 1989, adding Hoover vacuums, still manufactured in North Canton, to its line of appliances.
        After leaving the company, Mr. Hoover moved to South Florida, where he developed a second career as an environmentalist, particularly concerned with marine pollution in Biscayne Bay. Mr. Hoover was not related to President Herbert C. Hoover.
        Mr. Hoover, born in North Canton, graduated from the Choate School in Wallingford, Conn., and from Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla. He is survived by his wife, Carl Good Hoover; a son, Herbert W. Hoover 3d; a daughter, Elizabeth Chase, and three grandchildren.
