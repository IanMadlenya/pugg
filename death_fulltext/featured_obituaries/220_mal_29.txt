        Tony Fuller, a former journalist and co-author of a well-known book about the Vietnam War, died Friday in New York. He was 62 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.
        The cause was a stroke, his family said.
        When he was a senior editor at Newsweek, Mr. Fuller and another senior editor there, Peter Goldman, published ''Charlie Company: What Vietnam Did to Us'' (Newsweek/William Morrow, 1983). An outgrowth of an award-winning special issue of the magazine, it traced the experiences of 54 veterans.
        Richard Anthony Fuller, who was born in Princeton, Ill., attended the University of Illinois and started out with United Press International.
        In 1972 he joined Newsweek. He was deputy bureau chief in Chicago, bureau chief in Boston and a senior editor in New York.
        He also collaborated with Mr. Goldman on ''The Quest for the Presidency 1984'' (Newsweek/Bantam, 1985), the national election as seen by the magazine's correspondents.
        After leaving Newsweek in 1991, Mr. Fuller was assistant managing editor of New York magazine for four years. He then worked in corporate public relations, retiring in 2001 as vice president for media relations at Avis Rent A Car System Inc.
        Mr. Fuller is survived by his wife of 35 years, Kathleen; a daughter, Ann; a son, Anthony; and a brother, Peter, of Chicago.
