        Kenneth Haas, who held managerial positions with the Boston Symphony and other American orchestras, died on Saturday in Newton Upper Falls, Mass. He was 57.
        The cause is still to be determined, pending an autopsy, said Caroline Smedvig, a spokeswoman for the Boston Symphony.
        Mr. Haas was the managing director of the symphony from 1987 to 1996, when he had a heart attack resulting in severe brain damage. With his faculties impaired, he lived in treatment centers in Texas and New Hampshire until 1998, when he was moved to the Falls at Cordingly Dam, an institution for long-term care in Newton Upper Falls.
        Mr. Haas was born in Washington in 1943 and grew up in Brooklyn and on Long Island. In 1964 he graduated from Columbia University.
        After several jobs as technical director and stage manager in theater companies, including the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center, he took managerial positions with the New York Philharmonic in 1967 and with the Cleveland Orchestra in 1970. He became general manager of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in 1975 and of the Cleveland Orchestra in 1976, eventually going to Boston. He also served in advisory roles with the National Endowment for the Arts and the American Symphony Orchestra League.
        Mr. Haas is survived by his mother, Eunice Haas; a sister, Lenore Jones of Palo Alto, Calif.; a brother, Charles, of Oakland, Calif.; his second wife, Signe Johnson Haas; their son, John Kenneth, of Wellesley, Mass.; two daughters from a previous marriage, Elizabeth of Cambridge, Mass., and Amanda of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.
        In 1998 former colleagues of Mr. Haas from his orchestras arranged a benefit concert at Symphony Hall in Boston to raise money for his care. The performers included members of the orchestras, the violinist Itzhak Perlman and the conductors Kurt Masur, Christoph von Dohnanyi, Seiji Ozawa and Pierre Boulez.
