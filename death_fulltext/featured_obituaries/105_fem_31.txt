        Beverly Gary Kempton, a freelance writer and former journalist, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 65.
        Her husband, the columnist Murray Kempton, said the cause was complications after hip surgery.
        A native of Douglaston, Queens, Mrs. Kempton worked for the NBC "Today" show before joining The New York Post, writing profiles and covering the Castro revolution in 1959. She later worked for the Peace Corps in Washington.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Christopher, of Manhattan.
