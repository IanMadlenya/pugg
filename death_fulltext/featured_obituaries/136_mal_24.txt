        Eddie Rabbitt, a singer and songwriter who defined ''crossover'' in country and pop music of the 1970's and 80's and had 26 No. 1 country singles, died on Thursday at Baptist Hospital in Nashville. He was 56.
        The cause was lung cancer, said a spokesman for the Brokaw Company, his manager.
        Mr. Rabbitt wrote most of his own songs after assembly-line song-production had become the industry norm. The son of Irish immigrants, he was born in Brooklyn and raised in East Orange, N.J. In 1968, having saved enough money to live on for a few months, he took a chance and traveled to Nashville. Within two years, he had a hit song, ''Kentucky Rain,'' recorded by Elvis Presley.
        His own recording career within country music started in 1974, and in 1979 he had his first pop hit, the theme song from the Clint Eastwood movie ''Every Which Way but Loose.'' After that breakthrough, some of his other well-known hits included ''I Love a Rainy Night,'' ''Drivin' My Life Away,'' ''Step by Step'' and a duet with Crystal Gayle, ''You and I.''
        His second child, Timmy, was born with a defective liver and died at 23 months, despite a liver transplant.  Soon after, Mr. Rabbitt became involved in working with health organizations; he served as honorary chairman of the American Council on Transplantation and acted as celebrity spokesman for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and for United Cerebral Palsy.
        Mr. Rabbitt is survived by his wife, Janine, of Williamson County, Tenn.; a daughter, Demelza, and a son, Tommy.
