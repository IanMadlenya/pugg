        Carlo Scorza, the last secretary of Italy's wartime Fascist Party, has died, family members said today. He was 91 years old.
        The relatives said that he died Friday but that it was decided not to issue an announcement until after his funeral.
        Between the wars Mr. Scorza, who was a newspaper publisher, developed the use of gangsters who would protect wealthy and influential Italians for a high price.
        Benito Mussolini appointed Mr. Scorza party secretary in April 1943. In that year, he conducted a purge of pessimists in the Mussolini regime.
        The Fascist Government fell three months. Mr. Scorza was arrested several times by the Nazi-controlled government in northern Italy, and was tried and acquitted of treason by a special tribunal in April 1944 on charges that he had failed to mobilize the Fascist militia when Mussolini was overthrown.
        After the war, Mr. Scorza fled to Argentina, where he reportedly worked on a magazine in Buenos Aires under an assumed name. He was tried in absentia in Italy and sentenced in 1947 to 30 years in jail for his role in a Fascist gang's assault on a political opponent. He was later given amnesty and returned to Italy in 1955.
