        The Rev. John B. Mulgrew, a Dominican priest who was a professor of theology and philosophy, died on Sunday at his home in the rectory of Molloy College in Rockville Centre, L.I. He was 78 years old.
        He died of congestive heart failure, a spokeswoman for the college said.
        Since 1978 he had been teaching medical ethics and serving as assistant chaplain at Molloy College. In February he received the college's highest honor, the President's Medal, "for his charismatic Dominican teaching in the philosophy department."
        Before joining Molloy, he had taught both undergraduates and graduates at the St. John's University School of Arts and Sciences in Queens. In 1954 he was assigned to an abbey at Spencer, Mass., where he helped prepare Trappist monks for the priesthood.
        Father Mulgrew, who was a native of Philadelphia, graduated from St. Thomas Aquinas College in River Forest, Ill., and received a Lectorate in Sacred Theology from the Immaculate Conception College in Washington. He was ordained in 1938.
        He is survived by a sister, Sarah Roberts of Sharon Hill, Pa.
