        Bob Berg, a tenor saxophonist who brought the speed and intensity of middle-period John Coltrane into a jazz-fusion context, died on Thursday in an automobile accident in Amagansett, N.Y., said Christine Martin, his friend and former manager. He was 51.
        Mr. Berg and his wife, Arja, had left their home in East Hampton, N.Y., on an errand and were on Route 27 in Amagansett when the driver of a cement truck lost control and collided with the Bergs' car. Ms. Berg was injured in the crash.
        Mr. Berg grew up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and took up the saxophone at 13. He studied at the High School of Performing Arts and Juilliard; before graduating, he toured with the organist Brother Jack McDuff.
        Through the 1970's, he played in Horace Silver's band and in Cedar Walton's quartet, Eastern Rebellion, but found his biggest audience in the 1980's, after he became a sideman in Miles Davis's group in 1984. His tenure there lasted three years.
        Later Mr. Berg led a band with the guitarist Mike Stern that became popular on the jazz-club circuit. In 1992 he joined Chick Corea's acoustic quartet. He also made albums under his own name for the Denon, Stretch and GRP labels, including ''Back Roads,'' nominated for a Grammy in 1993. Most recently Mr. Berg was involved in a re-creation of the fusion band Steps Ahead.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by their children, Mia and David, both of East Hampton; his mother, Annette, of Brooklyn; and his brother, Jeff Berg of Staten Island.
