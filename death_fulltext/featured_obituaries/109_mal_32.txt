        Harold Brasington, the former dirt-track stock car racer who built the original Darlington Raceway, the first of the superspeedways on the Nascar circuit, died Sunday. He was 86.
        Mr. Brasington raced stock cars at dirt tracks in the 1930's and 1940's. But  he wanted a faster racing format and, in 1949, began building the Darlington track. The Southern 500 opened there on Labor Day, 1950, with its egg-shaped 1.366-mile oval.
        The track is still the site of two major Nascar races each year.
        He sold his interest in the Darlington Raceway in 1954, helped in the creation of Charlotte Motor Speedway and built and owned North Carolina Motorspeedway in Rockingham, N.C.
        He is survived by his wife, Mildred, a son and four grandchildren.
