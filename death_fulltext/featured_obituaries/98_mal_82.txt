        Leo Kaplan, a lawyer who oversaw the distribution of royalties paid out to songwriters and publishers for nearly 30 years, died on Monday in his Manhattan home. He was 90.
        The cause was complications from a pancreatic tumor, said a son, Theodore.
        It was Mr. Kaplan's task to insure that the royalties due the members of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) were distributed fairly under a system set up in a 1950 Federal court decree.
        A graduate of New York University School of Law, he had practiced law for some 65 years and was a founding partner of the Manhattan law firm Kaplan, Kilsheimer & Fox.
        Mr. Kaplan's first wife, Hazel Nalitt Kaplan died in 1965. Besides his son, of Northport, L.I., he is survived by his wife, Dorothy Shames Kaplan; two daughters, Susan Hut of Greenwich, Conn., and Deborah Kaplan of Paris; a second son, Robert, of Rye, N.Y.; two sisters, Belle Golinko of Great Neck, L.I., and Anne Unger of the Bronx, and four grandchildren.
