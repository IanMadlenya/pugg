        Arthur Roth, a novelist, columnist and writer of adventure fiction for children, died on March 5 at his home in Amagansett, L.I. He was 67.
        His wife, Ruth Buchalter Roth, said the cause was liver cancer.
        Mr. Roth was a columnist for the East Hampton (L.I.) Star for 27 years.
        His first book, published when he was 33, was "A Terrible Beauty" (1958). Set in Northern Ireland during World War II, it was about a 20-year-old Catholic man involved in Irish Republican Army action against the British. The book was the basis for the film "The Night Fighters," starring Robert Mitchum.
        Mr. Roth's other works of fiction for adults included "The Shame of Our Wounds" (1961). His fiction for young people included "The Iceberg Hermit" (1975), about a 17-year-old boy shipwrecked alone in the Arctic, and "The Secret Love of Elmtree" (1976), about an adopted 17-year-old boy whose father re-enters his life.
        Mr. Roth was born in the Bronx and spent some of his early years with relatives in Northern Ireland. After serving in the Irish Republican Army, the Irish Army and the United States Air Force, he earned a bachelor's degree from Arizona State University in 1954 and a master's degree in political science from Columbia University.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Mark, of Amagansett, and a sister, Laura Jones of St. Petersburg, Fla.
