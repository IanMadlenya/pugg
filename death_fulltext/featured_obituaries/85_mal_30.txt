        Walter Havighurst, a retired professor at Miami University in Ohio whose works of fiction and nonfiction were largely about the Midwest, died on Thursday at his home in Richmond, Ind. He was 92.
        The immediate cause was unclear, said a niece, Ruth Neff of Richmond, but he had Alzheimer's disease.
        Mr. Havighurst taught English at Miami, in Oxford, Ohio, from 1928 to 1969. He was the author, a co-author or the editor of more than 20 books.
        His 1964 book "Voices on the River: The Story of the Mississippi Waterways" was praised by one critic as painting a masterly picture of "the sweep, contrariness and tremendous value of the Mississippi and its candelabra of rivers."
        His first book was a 1935 novel, "Pier 17." His last was "Ohio: A Bicentennial History" (Norton, 1976).
        Mr. Havighurst was born in Appleton, Wis. He worked as a deckhand on Great Lakes freighters before earning a bachelor's degree in 1924 from the University of Denver and a master's in 1928 from Columbia University.
        He was married in 1930 to Marion Boyd, a poet and novelist, with whom he worked on several historical novels for young people. She died in 1974.
        He is survived by a sister, Miriam Johnson of Batavia, Ill., and seven nieces and nephews.
