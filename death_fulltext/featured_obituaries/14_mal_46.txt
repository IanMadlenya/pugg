        Mr. Martin edited City Lights magazine in San Francisco in the early 1950's. In 1953, he established the City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco, and it was acquired by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet and publisher.
        The New Yorker Bookshop, at 250 West 89th Street, specialized in books on politics, psychology, poetry and literature. It also served as a neighborhood bulletin board and meeting place.
        Mr. Martin is survived by his wife, Madeleine; a stepdaughter, Lavinia Glick of San Francisco, and two half-sisters, Jane Bobba of San Francisco and Roberta Bobba of Oakland, Calif.
