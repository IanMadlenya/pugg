        In 1916, Mr. Goodrich ran away from his home in Texas to join the Navy. Years later, he drew on his World War I experiences aboard an oil-soaked and leaky destroyer in the Asiatic Squadron for the novel "Delilah," which became a best seller in 1941.
        Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Charles Poore called it "the best sea story we have read since 'Captain Horatio Hornblower.' "
        Thereafter, Mr. Goodrich frequently wrote about naval subjects. In a 1921 essay in The New York Times, he argued that the demonstrations of the superiority of aircraft over battleships staged by Brig. Gen. William (Billy) Mitchell had been unfair to the Navy because they were not conducted under realistic conditions. Wrote 'Wonderful Life'
        In World War II, Mr. Goodrich served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy, participating in the campaigns at Salerno, Sicily, and Okinawa.
        After working for the drama department of The New York Herald Tribune, Mr. Goodrich moved to Hollywood, where he specialized in writing treatments, or outlines of potential screenplays. His most successful treatment was one that became the hit film "It's a Wonderful Life."
        He was married five times. His last marriage, in 1946, was to the actress Olivia de Havilland. They were divorced in 1952.
        Mr. Goodrich's son, Benjamin, died three weeks ago in Paris.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by two grandsons.
