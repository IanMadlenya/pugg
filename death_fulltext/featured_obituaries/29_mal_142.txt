        Nicholas Benton, the designer and builder of the Halve Maen (Half Moon), a full-size replica of the 17th-century ship of the explorer Henry Hudson, died Monday at the Albany Medical Center after falling 75 feet when the mast of a schooner he was working on in Rensselaer, N.Y., snapped.
        Mr. Benton was 35 years old and lived in Middleton, R.I. The Rensselaer police ruled the death an accident.
        Mr. Benton, a master ship-rigger and shipwright, was president of the Rigging Gang of Middleton, which specialized in colonial ship restoration and design. To prepare for building the Half Moon, a $1 million project, he visited maritime museums in the Netherlands and the United States. The 65-foot ship, which took a year to build, was christened on June 10 in the Port of Albany.
        Mr. Benton is survived by his wife, Deborah; three sons, Kevin, Jeremy and Kelly, and his mother and two sisters of Phoenix.
