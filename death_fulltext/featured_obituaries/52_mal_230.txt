        Nicholas Bachko, a shipping industry executive who oversaw construction of the ocean liner United States in the early 1950's, died on Saturday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. He was 71 years old and lived in Sands Point, L.I.
        He died of a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Bachko was senior vice president for planning with the United States Lines before he retired in 1979 after 38 years.
        On her maiden voyage in 1952, the United States, the largest American-flag ocean liner and one of the last major passenger vessels to be built in this country, crossed the Atlantic in 3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes at a speed averaging 35.39 knots, a record that still stands.
        Mr. Bachko, a native of Keystone, Pa., graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy and served as a lieutenant commander in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific in World War II. He then attended Columbia University. When he retired from United States Lines he opened his own consulting business, Nicholas Bachko Company. He also operated a container service, Topgallon Group Inc., for ships in the North Atlantic.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Jadwin; a daughter, Laura, of Manhattan, and two brothers, Alexander and Raymond, both of Titusville, Pa.
