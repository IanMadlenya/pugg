        Jerome A. Danzig, whose early work in broadcasting as a reporter and a producer led to his appointment as a top adviser to Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, died on Sunday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 88.
        Mr. Danzig was named to Rockefeller's staff in 1962 to manage his broadcasting arrangements, including those for the governor's unsuccessful campaigns in 1964 and 1968 for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Danzig continued to work in state government after  Rockefeller's tenure as governor ended in 1973, and he was also in a private management consulting firm.
        Before that, Mr. Danzig worked in broadcasting for nearly three decades, beginning in 1935 at a New York radio station, WOR, where he was among the first reporters to broadcast from remote locations. He was a programming executive at the CBS and NBC networks.
        He worked at NBC from 1953 to 1961, supervising the program ''Today'' and ''The Tonight Show'' with Jack Paar.
        Jerome Alan Danzig was born in Manhattan on Feb. 7, 1913. In 1951, he married Sarah Palfrey Danzig, a top-ranked professional and amateur tennis player, who died in 1996.
        Mr. Danzig is survived by a son, Jerome P. of Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Diana C. Dupont of Hudson, N.H.; and a sister, Evelyn Haas of San Francisco, Calif.
