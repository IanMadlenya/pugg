        Robert Patterson, a baritone who sang with the Metropolitan Opera in the 1960's, died on Oct. 31 at his home in Glendale, Queens. He was 70.
        The cause was lymphoma, said Henry Rinckhoff, a friend.
        At the Met, Mr. Patterson's roles included Phanuel in Massenet's opera "Herodiade" and Ortel in Wagner's "Meistersinger von Nurnberg." He also sang with the New York City Opera and the Frankfurt Opera, in musicals and in a variety of concerts and oratorios.
        His marriage to the former Betsy Holmes ended in divorce. He is survived by two sons, Robert Jr., of Annapolis, Md., and Hans, of Clearwater, Fla.; two daughters, Victoria, of Franklin, N.J., and Wendy, of Newton, N.J., 14 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.
