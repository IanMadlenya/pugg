        Terry Slater, Colgate University's hockey coach, died today at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital, four days after suffering a stroke at his home in Hamilton, N.Y. He died on his 54th birthday.
        Mr. Slater began coaching at Colgate in 1977, and in his 15 seasons became the most successful hockey coach the university has ever had. His Colgate teams compiled a record of 251-180-23 and played at the highest level of intercollegiate competition for the first time. In 1990, the Red Raiders won the Eastern Collegiate Athletic Association title and skated in the national championship game, losing to Wisconsin.
        A native of Kirkland Lake, Ontario, Mr. Slater was a 1961 graduate of St. Lawrence University, where he was a two-time all-America center. He played professionally for two seasons before beginning a coaching career at the University of Toledo.
        He is survived by his wife, Agatha, and five children, Nora, Leah, Wade, Grant and Todd.
