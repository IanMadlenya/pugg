        Glenn Dale Wilburn, who lost his two grandsons in the Oklahoma City bombing and led a successful campaign to set up a local grand jury to investigate the crime, died yesterday morning at his home in Oklahoma City. He was 46.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, his son, Bart Wilburn of Moore, Okla., said.
        The elder Mr. Wilburn, a mild-mannered certified public accountant, lost his grandsons, Chase Smith, 3, and Colton Smith, 2, in a day-care center on the second floor of the Federal Building in the April 19, 1995, bombing, which killed 168 people, including 19 children. At the time, the boys and their mother, Edye Smith, were living at the Wilburn home in Oklahoma City. Ms. Smith was Mr. Wilburn's stepdaughter.
        Mr. Wilburn began a crusade to find out how and why his grandchildren died, interviewing witnesses to the bombing, public officials, and anyone else with information on the explosion. His kitchen became a second home to visiting journalists.
        The Federal investigation and the arrests of Terry L. Nichols and Timothy J. McVeigh, who was convicted and sentenced to death in the case, did not satisfy Mr. Wilburn. He suspected a broader conspiracy. And he did not believe official denials that no one in Federal law enforcement had any warning of the attack.
        In November 1995, Mr. Wilburn and State Representative Charles Key, Republican of Oklahoma City, teamed up to demand that a local grand jury be set up to investigate the case and to question witnesses.
        They collected more than 10,000 signatures on a petition to set up a grand jury in Oklahoma County. After a decision in their favor by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the grand jury began work last month.
        In addition to his son and stepdaughter, Mr. Wilburn is survived by his wife, Kathy; another son, Matt, of Moore; his mother, Audra Wilburn, of Olustee, Okla.; a brother, Roy, of Butler, Okla., and two sisters.
