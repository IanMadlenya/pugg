        Dr. Leon Goldman, a pioneer in laser surgery and a leading educator in the field, died on Tuesday in San Diego. He was 91.
        In 1961, Dr. Goldman became the first researcher to use a laser to treat a human skin disease when he treated melanoma. The method later became popular in removing birthmarks and tattoos without leaving much scarring.
        In 1966, Dr. Goldman, who worked for much of his career as a dermatologist at the University of Cincinnati, supervised the first operation in which a laser was used to remove a tumor without causing bleeding. The laser's pulses of light cut skin and cauterized blood vessels simultaneously, opening the door to several other applications.
        In the 1990's, Dr. Goldman was a consultant at the San Diego Naval Medical Center.
        Dr. Goldman helped to found the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery in 1979 and in 1981 was its first president.
        He received his medical degree in 1929 at the University of Cincinnati and was appointed director of dermatology there in 1945. He wrote six books on laser medicine.
        Dr. Goldman is survived by his wife, Belle, of San Diego; and two sons, John, a doctor in Atlanta, and Steven, a doctor in Tucson.
