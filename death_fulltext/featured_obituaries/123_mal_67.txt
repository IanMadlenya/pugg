        Yank Rachell, one of the few blues musicians to specialize on the mandolin, died on April 9 at his home in Indianapolis. He was 87.
        Mr. Rachell, whose real first name was James, grew up on a farm near Brownsville, Tenn. He said that at the age of 8 he received his first mandolin in exchange for a pig his family had given him to raise for slaughter.
        While a teen-ager in Brownsville, he met the guitarist and singer Sleepy John Estes, who remained his friend and frequent collaborator until Estes's death in 1977.
        He was the composer of several blues standards, including ''Divin' Duck Blues'' and ''She Caught the Katy.''
        Mr. Rachell sang as well, and with  Estes and the pianist Jab Jones formed Three J's Jug Band, the group that became Mr. Rachell's first ticket to the recording studio in 1929.
        At the start of the Depression, he moved to Chicago along with Estes. But he soon moved back to Brownsville and shuttled back and forth between his home jobs in St. Louis. During this period he recorded with the first Sonny Boy Williamson, Peetie Wheatstraw and Elijah Jones, among others. He moved to Indianapolis in 1958.
        His move north coincided with a revival of interest in acoustic rural blues, and he became one of the elder statesmen of the music, recording for labels like Delmark and Blue Goose.
        He was prized for his driving, rhythmic style on the mandolin and his cropped, guitarlike phrases.
        In later years, arthritis limited the length of his playing sessions, but at his death he had just completed a new recording called ''Too Hot for the Devil,'' said Pat Webb, a record producer and one of the musicians on the recording.
        He is survived by two daughters,  Maenell Smith and Willa B. Taylor, both of Minneapolis and both members of the Gospel High-Lows singing group; 25 grandchildren, and 40 great-grandchildren.
