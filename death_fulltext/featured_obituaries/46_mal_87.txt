        Ian Cosman, a former New York City police officer, public school teacher and operatic tenor who was known in the 1940's as the "singing policeman" died on Thursday at his home in Englewood, N.J. He was 80 years old.
        He had been ill for 18 months and died of prostate cancer, his son Maury said.
        Mr. Cosman had been an officer with the New York City Police Department for six years when he made his debut as a tenor on Oct. 11, 1945, at the age of 32. His role, Turidda in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" at the New York City Center, received nine curtain calls and rave reviews. Afterward, he remained a police officer and performed in his spare time on various radio stations and with the San Carlo Opera Company.
        Mr. Cosman studied music at night and received a certificate as a cantor in 1958 from the School of Sacred Music of the Hebrew Union College in Manhattan.
        After retiring from the Police Department in 1965, he became a fifth-grade teacher at Public School 70 in the Bronx. He taught there for 15 years before retiring in 1980.
        He devised and performed in several annual interfaith concerts in Tenafly, N.J. in the 1980's, and until June he officiated as a cantor at the Congregation Adasemuno in Leonia, N.J.
        Mr. Cosman had been married for 39 years before his wife, Sylvia, died in 1988. In addition to his son Maury, of Woburn, Mass., Mr. Cosman is survived by a brother, Herman, of Plantation, Fla., two sisters, Reina Radelman of Miami and Pearl Safford of Brooklyn; another son, Jeffrey, of Boxford, Mass.; a daughter, Dr. Felicia Cosman-Clynes of Pomona, N.Y., and two granddaughters.
