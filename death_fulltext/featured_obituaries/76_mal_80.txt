        Captain John Treasure Jones, the last master of the Cunard liner Queen Mary, died Wednesday at Chandler's Ford in Hampshire, England. He was 87 and had retired to Hampshire in 1968.
        When the Queen Mary arrived at its home port of Southampton in September 1967 at the end of its thousandth and final trans-Atlantic voyage, after 33 years on the seas, Captain Jones addressed his crew and his fellow officers after a party, saying, "My heart is rather full. That celebration we have had was full of joy, not sadness."
        The Queen Mary was later converted into a floating hotel in California, and Captain Jones sailed it there.
        He was born in Haverfordwest, Wales, one of eight children of a hay merchant. He first went to sea at 16, in a tramp steamer, rose to be a ship's officer and worked with the White Star line, which merged with Cunard.
        He served on a succession of Cunard vessels and was on board the Laurentic, which had been taken over by the British Navy in World War II, when the ship was torpedoed.
        Captain Jones went on to be the master of the Saxonia, the Mauretania and the Queen Elizabeth before he took command of the Queen Mary.
        He is survived by his wife, three sons and a daughter.
