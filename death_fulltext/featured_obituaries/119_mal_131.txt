        Viggo F. E. Rambusch, an architect who coordinated the decorating, lighting and furnishing of more than 1,000 churches, synagogues, theaters and other public places, died on Friday at White Plains Medical Center near his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He was 97.
        Mr. Rambusch helped decorate the main public rooms at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel when it was built in the early 1930's. He also helped make some of the stained glass windows at St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue.
        In 1988, Catholic University in Washington recognized Mr. Rambusch as the ''Dean of American Church Architects.''
        Mr. Rambusch, who was born on Staten Island in 1900, spent his entire career working for the Rambusch Decorating Company. The Manhattan firm was founded by his father, Frode Rambusch, who emigrated from Denmark in 1889.
        During World War II, Mr. Rambusch helped camouflage American airfields from enemy planes. His sketches of orchards and farm buildings were painted on the airfields to confuse the enemy.
        Mr. Rambusch was also dedicated to supporting the Roman Catholic Church in Scandinavia. For more than 60 years, he was president of St. Ansgar's Scandinavia Catholic League, a group of about 1,000 Americans who support the Catholic Church in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.
        In 1994, Pope John Paul II installed him as a Knight of St. Gregory for his support of the Scandinavian church.
        Mr. Rambusch is survived by his three sons, Viggo Bech Rambusch of Manhattan, Lennard Rambusch of Larchmont, N.Y., and Erik Rambusch of Rowayton, Conn. His wife, Gudrun Harriet Bech, died in 1989.
