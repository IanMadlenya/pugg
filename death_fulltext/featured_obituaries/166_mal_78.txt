        Edward Ludlum, who won praise for his stage directing on both coasts, died on Tuesday in Los Angeles, where he had helped to establish professional theater. He was 80.
        The cause was heart failure, said  David Stanford, his publicist.
        Mr. Ludlum's direction of a 1951 revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Desire Under the Elms,'' at the Barbizon-Plaza Theater in Manhattan, drew praise from Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times. ''The heartening thing about the performance is the fact that it catches the elemental fury of the drama,'' he wrote.
        Mr. Atkinson also lauded Mr. Ludlum's 1958 Hollywood staging of ''Inherit the Wind,'' the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee based on the 1925 Scopes ''monkey trial.''  Atkinson cited ''a thoughtfully organized performance'' and said that ''one of the most stirring plays in recent years retains its folk flavor and spiritual awareness.''
        Mr. Ludlum also worked as a director in television, where his credits included ''Death Valley Days,'' a durable Western anthology series.
        A native New Yorker, Mr. Ludlum was also the director of the first West Coast productions of ''The Glass Menagerie,'' by Tennessee Williams, and ''Compulsion,'' by Meyer Levin.
        He is survived by two cousins, Tom Carroll and Robert Ludlum, the writer.
