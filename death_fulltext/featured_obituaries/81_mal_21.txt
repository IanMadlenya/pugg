        Frederick Gash, a patron of the arts who helped raise millions of dollars for dance, music and education, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. A resident and native of Manhattan, he was 82.
        The cause was acute pneumonia, said his wife, Emily Genauer.
        Mr. Gash retired from business in 1963 to found a Business Committee for the Arts. His group initiated a national program to enlist commerce and industry to support philanthropic and cultural activities in their communities. In 1966 he also became a consultant on development and resources for the National Council on the Arts to generate financial support from private philanthropies.
        He was a charter member of the Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies and sat on the boards of the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., and the Martha Graham Dance Company for which he commissioned several works.
        A graduate of the University of Iowa, he had a business career with a food-brokerage concern, Gash-Ferolie Corporation of Englewood, N.J. He sold his share in it 30 years ago to devote himself full time to charitable activities.
        He was an honorary life member and chairman of the trades and industries division of the Anti-Defamation League.
        His wife won a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism in 1974 when she worked for the Newsday Syndicate.
        Mr. Gash is survived by his wife; by a daughter, Constance Roche, also of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
