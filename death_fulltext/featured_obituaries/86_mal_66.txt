        Richard Tierney, a nursing administrator at the New York Blood Center who helped develop a process for monitoring donations of blood, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Mr. Tierney, who lived in Manhattan, was 58.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Jenni Lee Robins, a spokeswoman for the center.
        Mr. Tierney was the director of quality assurance in nursing at the center and over the last year he helped create what is called the safe donor system for the collection of blood. Over the last decade many innovations in blood supply collection that were attributed to Mr. Tierney have been adopted by other blood centers.
        Mr. Tierney graduated from Boston University.
        He is survived by a brother, Cornelius, of Sterling, Va., and a sister, Beverly Walsh of Manchester, Conn. His companion was Martin Magovsky.
