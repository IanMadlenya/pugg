        Peter E. Sheib, president and chief operating officer of a New York brokerage and investment banking firm, Josephthal, Lyon & Ross Inc., died on Wednesday. He was 56.
        The cause was a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the firm said.
        Mr. Sheib, who lived in Manhattan, oversaw the company's rapid growth from one office with 45 employees in 1988 to 150 offices with more than 1,500 employees.
        He spent most of his career at the firm, having started in 1963 as a broker. He spent seven years as vice president of a men's suit company, but rejoined Josephthal in 1977 as chief administrative officer. In 1994, he was named president.
        He is survived by a daughter, Debra, of Manhattan; a sister, Peggy DeZwirek of Toronto, and a brother, Marc, of Purchase, N.Y.
