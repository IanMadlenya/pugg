        Harold L. Trigg, one of the first doctors to use methadone in treating heroin addiction, died on Monday at the Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of lung cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Dr. Trigg, the former chief of medical and psychiatric services at Beth Israel, was associated with the hospital for nearly 30 years. He worked closely with Dr. Marie Nyswander and Dr. Vincent Dole in 1965 in establishing the hospital's methadone maintenance program, which has since become one of the largest drug treatment programs in the world. He was also an international consultant to the State Department.
        Dr. Trigg was founder, chairman and president of the Greater New York Coalition on Drug Abuse, which brought together experts with varied treatment philosophies.
        In 1961 he was appointed the first director of the drug detoxification service at Manhattan General Hospital, which in 1964 became part of the Beth Israel Medical Center.
        Dr. Trigg was born in Raleigh, N.C., and graduated from Hampton Institute and the Meharry Medical College. In 1958 he graduated from the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan.
        He is survived by his mother, Geraldine Trigg of Manhattan, and two sisters, Melva Currier and Leota Trigg, also of Manhattan.
