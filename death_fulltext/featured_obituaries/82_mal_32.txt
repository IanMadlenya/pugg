He served as Speaker from 1937 to 1938, when he became a state judge, first with the Court of Errors and Appeals, then with the Court of Common Pleas. In 1939 he was appointed to the United States District Court in Newark with the endorsement of Mr. Hague. Mr. Walker served three years on the Federal bench.
