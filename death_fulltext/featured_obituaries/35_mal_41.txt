        Dr. George L. Nardi, a surgeon who was an expert on diseases of the pancreas, died of cancer yesterday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 66 years old. Dr. Nardi, who lived in Boston, received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1944, when he was 21. Except for service as a medical officer in the Navy, he spent his entire medical career at Massachusetts General. He was also an instructor in surgery at the Harvard Medical School.
        Dr. Nardi was responsible for a number of medical discoveries, including his description of the urinary loss of amino acids essential for the regrowth of proteins in severely burned patients. He also showed the relationship between inflammation of the pancreas and overactivity of the parathyroid gland.
        In 1963, he led a surgical team that was able to remove an animal pancreas and keep it alive outside the body for closer study of its functions.
        Dr. Nardi served on numerous committees and professional organizations and wrote hundreds of articles for professional journals.
        He is survived by his wife, Sally; two sons, George Nardi of Holbrook, Mass., and Edward Nardi of Lincoln, Mass.; three daughters, Elizabeth Kanter of Waquoit, Mass., Linda Gilman of West Buxton, Me., and Sally Jean Nardi of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
