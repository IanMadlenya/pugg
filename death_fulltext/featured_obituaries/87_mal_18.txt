        Felipe Neri Torres, a retired Judge of the Family Court and a former Democratic assemblyman, died on Sunday in White Plains Hospital. He was 96 and lived in the Parkchester section of the Bronx.
        The cause was pneumonia, said Analisa Torres, a granddaughter.
        Mayor Robert F. Wagner named Mr. Torres a judge of the New York State Family Court in 1962, and he remained on the bench until his mandatory retirement, at age 70, in 1967.
        Mr. Torres was an assemblyman from the South Bronx from 1952 to 1961, when he retired and was succeeded by his son Frank. In 1963, it was seen as a sign of the advancement of Puerto Ricans in New York politics that there were then three in the Assembly, compared with a decade earlier, when Felipe Torres was the only one.
        From 1967 until well past his 90th birthday, Mr. Torres practiced law in the South Bronx, specializing mainly in the field of domestic relations, with his son Austin. He was also a hearing officer for the Board of Education and for the Supreme Court for some years.
        The future judge was born in Salinas in southern Puerto Rico, and graduated from high school in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He served in the United States Army as a second lieutenant in Puerto Rico late in World War I and immigrated to New York in 1919, living at first in Brooklyn.
        He washed dishes at the Biltmore and Commodore Hotels while studying for a Fordham law degree, which he received in 1926. He later did further study at City College.
        His wife of 58 years, the former Inocencia Bello, died in 1990.
        Besides his two sons, Austin, of New Rochelle, N.Y., and Frank, of Waccabuc, who is a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, and his granddaughter Analisa, Judge Torres is survived by three daughters, Aida Torres Mora of Brandon, Fla., Velia Torres of the Bronx and Alma Torres-Warner of Pelham, N.Y.; 10 other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
