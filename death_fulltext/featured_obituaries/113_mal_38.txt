        Kermit Axel, a former principal of 21 Brands, a wine and spirits importing company, died yesterday in New York. He was 75.
        He died after a short illness, his son, Blair, said.
        Mr. Axel joined 21 Brands in 1948 and worked in the family-run business until 1972, aggressively searching for new ways to import innovative wines. During his tenure, he was particularly interested in shaping tastes for California wines. The company was later sold, and Mr. Axel went on to become an executive at Schenley Industries and Knickerbocker Liquors, where he worked until 1985.
        For the rest of his life, Mr. Axel was involved in volunteer work, ranging from hospital consulting to lecturing on "Carmen," one of his favorite operas, and cultivating bonsai trees.
        Mr. Axel was born in Philadelphia in 1921 and graduated from Rutgers College  in 1941. From 1942 until 1945, he served in the Army Office of the Secret Service.
        Mr. Axel is survived by his wife, Elaine; three children, Blair and Carol, both of New York, and Jane Bobrick, of Evanston, Ill., and six grandchildren.
