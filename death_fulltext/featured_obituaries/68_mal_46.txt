        Raymond Thomas Wellington Jr., an authority on wines who played a major role in food and wine education in New York City and beyond, died Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39 years old.
        Mr. Wellington died from complications related to AIDS, his companion, Ed McCarthy, said.
        Mr. Wellington was born in Oceanside, N.Y., and received a bachelor's degree in history from Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y. He also attended the University of Rochester.
        Mr. Wellington started his restaurant career as a busboy at Windows on the World in Manhattan, worked his way up to a manager and eventually became wine director. At the time Windows on the World had one of the largest wine cellars in the country. In 1984, he left to join Joseph Baum, who opened the restaurant Aurora in Manhattan.
        Mr. Wellington also developed the wine list at the Rainbow Room before joining the restaurateur Alan Stillman, who owns the New York Restaurant Group, to serve as wine director for five restaurants. In addition to his interest in food and wine, Mr. Wellington was a musician who for several years played accordion with a Cajun band, the Pinballs.
        Mr. Wellington continued to work as a wine consultant until shortly before he died.
        In addition to Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Wellington is survived by his mother, Regina Wellington, of Oceanside, N.Y., and an uncle, Roy Hopewell of Brightwater, N.Y.
