        Joseph R. Coulter Jr., co-founder, president and chief executive of the Coulter Corporation, a world leader in manufacturing medical analysis equipment  and diagnostic instruments, died on Monday at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. He was 71 and lived in Miami.
        The cause was complications from prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Coulter teamed with his brother, Wallace H. Coulter, in the 1950's to form the company that introduced an electronic, automated way of counting and measuring microscopic particles.
        From the company's modest beginnings in a Chicago basement in 1952, the brothers produced the first commercial blood-cell counter. It changed clinical diagnostics and medical research by replacing labor-intensive and sometimes fallible methods for counting blood cells.
        The family business grew into an enterprise with more than 5,000 employees, designing and manufacturing diagnostic systems for laboratories throughout the world. In recent years, Joseph Coulter played a central role in taking the company into cancer and AIDS research by forming Coulter Pharmaceutical Inc., which focuses on the treatment of lymphoma.
        Mr. Coulter was born in Poplar Bluff, Mo. He received a bachelor's degree in  electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, and then worked as a project engineer for the Motorola Corporation's communications  division.
        At first, he and his brother worked in their spare time to develop an instrument to count blood cells, but then they joined forces to build and market their first blood-cell and particle analyzer. They incorporated in 1958 and soon moved to Miami, where the company now has its headquarters.
        Besides his brother, the company's chairman, Mr. Coulter is survived by his former wife, Laura Bell; three daughters, Elizabeth Ann, Mary Susan and Laura Gene Coulter-Jones; a son, Joseph R. 3d, and six grandchildren.
