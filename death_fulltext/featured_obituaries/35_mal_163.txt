        In 1967, Mr. Brown bought a franchise in the fledgling American Basketball Association. He at first called his team the New York Americans, but, unable to find a suitable court in New York City, he moved it into the Armory in Teaneck, N.J., and renamed it the New Jersey Americans.
        In 1968, Mr. Brown moved the team to Commack, L.I., and changed the name to the Nets. A year later, he sold the team for $1.1 million to a syndicate led by Roy Boe.
        Mr. Brown was also involved in harness racing for 45 years. One of his horses, Historic Freight, won the Hambletonian in 1984.
        Born in Maywood, Ill., Mr. Brown began his career as a trucking company freight handler. In 1941, he started his own company, ABC Freight Forwarding, with two employees.
        By 1986, when he retired as president, the Manhattan-based company had more than 20 subsidiaries and thousands of employees.
        Mr. Brown is survived by his wife, Frieda Gordon Brown of Fort Lee; a son, Gordon J., of Stamford, Conn.; a daughter, Margot Salzman of Scarsdale, N.Y., and five grandchildren.
