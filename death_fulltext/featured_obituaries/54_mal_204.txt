        John Mortimer Coward, former president of Coward Enterprises, an investment firm, died on Wednesday at his home in Essex Fells, N.J. He was 66 years old and also lived in Edgartown, Mass.
        Mr. Coward died of cancer, his wife said.
        A great-grandson of James S. Coward, founder of the Coward Shoe Company more than 100 years ago, he began his business career at the Bank of Manhattan Company in Manhattan. He founded Coward Enterprises in 1957, and the firm went out of business 30 years later when he retired.
        He was a graduate of Princeton University and served in the Army in World War II with Gen. George S. Patton's headquarters from 1942 to 1946.
        Besides his wife, the former Patricia Lamborn, Mr. Coward is survived by three sons, George D. Flynn 2d of Darien, Conn., John M. Coward 3d of Ben Lomond, Calif. and David L. Coward of Essex Fells; four daughters, Patricia Post of Charlotte, Vt., Carroll L. Coward of Manhattan, Elizabeth Miller of West Barnstable, Mass., Sara Blum of Shelburne, Vt., and six grandchildren. A sister, Audrey McBratney of Beaufort, S.C., also survives.
