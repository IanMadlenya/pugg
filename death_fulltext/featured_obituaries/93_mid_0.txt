        Anna Hauptmann, the widow of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, who was convicted of murder in the kidnapping of Charles A. Lindbergh's infant son, died on Oct. 10 at Lancaster (Pa.) General Hospital. She was 95 and lived in New Holland, Pa.
        Mrs. Hauptmann, who was German-born, strove for years to exonerate her husband, a German-born carpenter who contended that he was not guilty. He was electrocuted in 1936 for the murder, which took place in 1932 in Hopewell, N.J. The baby was named for Mr. Lindbergh, who had flown across the Atlantic in 1927. Later, Mrs. Hauptmann sued unsuccessfully, asserting that the state of New Jersey had acted wrongfully in trying her husband.
        She is survived by a son, Manfred, of Lancaster County.
