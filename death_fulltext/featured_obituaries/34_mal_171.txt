        Carlos Arias Navarro, the last Prime Minister appointed under Franco, died of a heart attack on Monday, his family said today. He was 80 years old.
        A niece, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Arias Navarro died at his suburban Madrid home and was buried outside the capital. He had been in poor health for several years, she said.
        Franco named Mr. Arias Navarro, a conservative lawyer and former Mayor of Madrid, as Prime Minister in December 1973. Mr. Arias Navarro appeared on national television to announce Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. He was reappointed to the post by King Juan Carlos, who began dismantling Franco's authoritarian system.
        In July 1976, Mr. Arias Navarro resigned, giving way to the peaceful transition to democracy that led to general elections in 1977, the first since the end of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War.
        Mr. Arias Navarro, who began his career as a prosecutor, was appointed Mayor of Madrid in 1965 and held the post until 1973, when he became Interior Minister. He is survived by his wife, Maria Luz.
