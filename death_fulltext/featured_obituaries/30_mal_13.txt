        Dr. Edward L. Ruhe, a professor of English literature at the University of Kansas who specialized in studies of John Milton, Samuel Johnson, James Agee and films, died of a heart attack Wednesday at his home in Lawrence, Kan. He was 66 years old.
        As a Fulbright exchange professor in Australia in the 1960's, Dr. Ruhe became increasingly interested in that country's Aboriginal art, writing widely about it and collecting more than 1,000 eucalyptus bark paintings and sculptures.
        The collection, one of the largest private ones of such art in the world, was circulated to many universities and galleries around the country by the National Gallery of Art. Most of the art was from Arnhem Land, a northern Aboriginal reserve. At Dr. Ruhe's death, he had virtually completed a definitive book on such art titled ''A Manual of Australian Bark Painting.''
        Dr. Ruhe was a native of Allentown, Pa., who received a bachelor of arts degree in English literature at Swarthmore College and a master's and doctoral degree at Columbia University. In World War II, he served in the Navy in the South Pacific, rising to the rank of lieutenant.
        He previously taught at Rutgers and Cornell universities and had been a professor at the University of Kansas since 1958. He was the editor of the university's Humanities Studies Monograph Series from 1972 to 1981.
        Dr. Ruhe is survived by a sister, Judith Diehl, of Allentown, and three brothers, Dr. David, of Haifa, Israel, Capt. William, U.S. Navy ret., of McLean, Va., and Ben, of Washington.
