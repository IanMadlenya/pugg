        With her former husband, Bernard Jacobs, Mrs. Willens helped prove that a commercial station could thrive without programming pop music.
        Founded 40 years ago, the station is known for broadcasting classical music, live concerts, jazz seminars and documentaries.
        Mrs. Willens's former husband was general manager of radio station WOAK-FM in suburban Oak Park when the couple met and married in 1950. He changed the station's format from pop to classical, and the couple presided over its success under the new call letters.
        The station grew in stature by syndicating its programming, including symphonies and interviews by the Chicago author Studs Terkel, to more than 500 radio stations.
        The couple divorced in 1966; the station was sold to WGN Continental Broadcasting Company two years later. In 1967, she married David Willens, an advertising executive, who died in 1986. Mr. Jacobs died in 1975.
        In 1979, WFMT became the first radio station in the United States to be relayed by satellite and available nationwide 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in stereo.
        WGN donated the station to its current owner, the Chicago Educational Television Association. Mrs. Willens maintained ties to WFMT until 1981.
        She is survived by two sons, two daughters and a sister.
