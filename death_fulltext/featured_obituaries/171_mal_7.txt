        Nakamura Utaemon VI, a Kabuki star whose skill earned him a designation as one of Japan's ''living national treasures,'' died on Saturday at his home here. He was 84.
        Born Fujio Kawamura, Utaemon VI was the son of Nakamura Utaemon V and the sixth generation of a line of famous Kabuki actors. The Kabuki world is largely hereditary still, and stage names continue to be passed from father to son and father-in-law to son-in-law.
        Utaemon VI made a reputation for himself as an onnagata, a Kabuki actor who specializes in women's roles. Skilled onnagata are highly influential in the all-male world of Kabuki, and he became the artistic director of Tokyo's Kabuki-za theater, the capital of Kabuki in Japan.
        Utaemon VI was known for his stamina onstage. Kabuki shows are performed every day from the second day of the month to the 26th, and Kabuki actors usually perform in only 2 or 3 acts out of as many as 10. Utaemon VI, however, would perform in as many as seven acts in a show, and rather than take the standard four-day holiday at the end of each month, he would spend two or three of those days performing in a show for which he was the host.
        He became one of the best-known Kabuki actors outside Japan, making his overseas debut in the United States in 1960 and becoming an honorary citizen of Las Vegas, where he loved to gamble. Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and Grace Kelly were said to be among his fans.
        In 1968 the Japanese government named Utaemon VI a ''living national treasure,'' a title awarded to men and women in the traditional arts who are designated ''bearers of important intangible cultural assets.'' He received the Order of Culture in 1979 and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure in 1996, the year of his last performance.
