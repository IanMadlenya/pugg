        Alfred Hunt Howell, a retired banker and philanthropist, died on Tuesday at his home in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 83.
        He retired in 1972 as vice president for pension-fund investments at Citibank after 35 years with the bank.
        In retirement he pursued history and Middle Eastern studies at Columbia University. He learned Arabic and received a Ph.D. in medieval history in 1993, when he was 80. He had graduated from Princeton University in 1934 and earned a master's in philosophy at Columbia in 1978.
        His interest in philosophy and theology prompted his book "Who Made You? Theology, Science and Human Responsibility" (Praeger, 1989). As a collector of rare books, he was active for 54 years in the Grolier Club, the library and gathering place for bibliophiles on East 60th Street, of which he was a past president. He also was a trustee of the Frick Collection.
        He was a longtime benefactor of the Young Men's Christian Association and served as a trustee, board chairman and president at the metropolitan, state and national levels. He was also a director and vice president of the Bronx-based Cleveland H. Dodge Foundation.
        A native of Wyoming, Ohio, he arrived in Riverdale in the late 1940's and soon delved into community work, supporting a long list of cultural, recreational and social service institutions in the Bronx.
        Mr. Howell is survived by two sons, Alfred H. Jr., of Reston, Va., and Henry  P., of Arlington, Va.; a daughter, Ann H. Armstrong of West Chester, Pa.; six grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter. His wife of 55 years, Ruth Rea Howell, died in 1993.
        Correction:  April 29, 1996, Monday
        An obituary yesterday about a retired banker in the Bronx omitted his first name. He was Alfred Hunt Howell.
