        Jimmy Van Heusen, who composed the music for ''Moonlight Becomes You,'' ''Sunday, Monday or Always,'' ''Call Me Irresponsible'' and ''All the Way,'' among many other popular ballads, died yesterday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif., after a long illness. He was 77 years old.
        One of Hollywood's most successful composers of the 1940's and 50's, Mr. Van Heusen wrote most of his songs with one of two longtime lyricist partners, Johnny Burke (his principal collaborator from 1940 to 1953) and Sammy Cahn (starting in 1954). With them, he produced many of the biggest hits sung by Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra, both of whom were his close friends as well as ardent champions For Mr. Crosby, he wrote the songs for six of the seven ''Road'' pictures that teamed the singer with Bob Hope. His Crosby hits, written predominantly with Mr. Burke, who died in 1964, included ''Moonlight Becomes You,'' ''Sunday, Monday or Always,'' ''Swingin' on a Star'' and ''But Beautiful.'' 76 Songs for Sinatra Mr. Sinatra recorded 76 songs by Mr. Van Heusen, more than by any other composer. The Sinatra hits that Mr. Van Heusen wrote with Mr. Cahn include ''Love and Marriage,'' ''The Tender Trap,'' ''Second Time Around,'' ''High Hopes'' and ''My Kind of Town.'' Mr. Van Heusen also wrote, with the comedian Phil Silvers, the Sinatra signature song ''Nancy With the Laughing Face.''
        ''Jimmy Van Heusen was an architect of melody,'' Mr. Cahn said yesterday. ''When we were writing together, if I would ask him to add even a grace note to the song, he would sit down and write a whole new melody. He was also one of the world's greatest swingers. He used to joke that he ought to get more than 50 percent of a song because he spent so much time with Sinatra.''
        Jimmy Van Heusen was born Edward Chester Babcock, in Syracuse, N.Y., and later renamed himself after the shirt company. He began writing songs while in high school. Through his friendship at Syracuse University with Harold Arlen's older brother, Jerry, he was able to place several of his songs in one of the Cotton Club revues in New York. During the 1930's, he also worked as a staff pianist for several New York music-publishing houses.
        First Hit in 1939
        His first success was ''Darn That Dream,'' a hit in 1939 for Benny Goodman, with Mildred Bailey as vocalist. Written with the lyricist Edward de Lange, the song came from a flop Broadway show, ''Swingin' the Dream,'' a jazzed-up version of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream.'' It ran for 13 performances.
        ''Darn That Dream'' established Mr. Van Heusen's career, and in 1940 he had four hits: ''Polka Dots and Moonbeams,'' ''All This and Heaven Too,'' ''Shake Down the Stars'' and ''Imagination.''
        In that same year Mr. Van Heusen teamed up full time with Johnny Burke to write for Paramount Pictures; their first score was for ''Love Thy Neighbor,'' starring Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Mary Martin. Assigned to write for Bing Crosby, they did the scores for ''The Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''The Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Dixie'' (1943)'' and ''Going My Way'' (1944), among other films.
        All together, Mr. Van Heusen composed the songs for 23 Crosby movies. Among the best-known are ''Sunday, Monday or Always,'' from ''Dixie''; ''Aren't You Glad You're You,'' from ''The Bells of Saint Mary's''; ''Welcome to My Dream,'' from ''The Road to Utopia''; ''But Beautiful,'' from ''The Road to Rio,'' and ''Sunshine Cake,'' from ''Riding High.''
        ''Swingin' on a Star,'' from ''Going My Way,'' was the first of four Van Heusen songs to win Academy Awards. His other Oscar winners were ''All the Way,'' from ''The Joker is Wild'' (1957), ''High Hopes,'' from ''A Hole in the Head'' (1959), and ''Call Me Irresponsible,'' from ''Papa's Delicate Condition'' (1963).
        Helped Sinatra's Resurgence
        The Van Heusen-Cahn partnership played a significant role in the resurgence of Mr. Sinatra's career after a slump in the early 1950's. ''Love and Marriage'' - written for a 1955 television production of ''Our Town'' in which Mr. Sinatra played the Stage Manager - ''The Tender Trap,'' ''All the Way'' and ''High Hopes'' became major hits for the singer, whose albums include generous selections of Van Heusen material.
        Not every movie for which Mr. Van Heusen contributed songs was successful, and several Broadway shows he wrote with Mr. Cahn also failed. The longest-running show was ''Skyscraper,'' an adaptation of Elmer Rice's ''Dream Girl,'' which opened in 1965 and ran for 248 performances. But occasionally a popular standard would emerge from an unsuccessful project, like the torch standard ''Here's That Rainy Day,'' a collaboration with Mr. Burke from the 1953 show and film ''Carnival in Flanders.'' Another major song, ''Suddenly It's Spring,'' written with Mr. Burke, appeared in the 1944 film version of the Kurt Weill-Ira Gershwin musical ''Lady in the Dark.''
        Mr. Van Heusen was one of 10 songwriters elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame when it was founded in 1971.
        He married for the first time in 1969, at the age of 56. His wife, Bobbe, survives him.
