        Charles E. (Chad) Ballard, who was sentenced by a Indiana court to write a book after he accidentally killed his wife in 1982, died on Friday. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Ballard, the son of a noted Indiana hotel owner, had been ailing since 1979, when he suffered a stroke in 1979.
        Mr. Ballard pleaded guilty to reckless homicide after he shot Alicia Chimiak Ballard to death in April 1982; he was attempting suicide. In addition to a five-year suspended sentence and a $10,000 fine, a judge ordered Mr. Ballard to write a book about his family's past.
        Mr. Ballard's father, Charles Edward Ballard, had owned the West Baden Springs Hotel, once meeting place for such notorious figures in crime as Al Capone. The hotel was later donated to the Society of Jesus for use as a seminary. The elder Mr. Ballard was shot to death in a dispute with a business associate in 1936.
        The younger Mr. Ballard said the book, ''The Ballards in Indiana,'' was a tribute to his father's charitable works.
