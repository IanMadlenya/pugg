        Harry Willmer Jones, Cardozo Professor emeritus at Columbia University School of Law, died on Tuesday at Del Webb Memorial Hospital in Sun City West, Ariz. He was 82 and had homes in Sun City and Gaylordsville, Conn.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, the former Jean Brown.
        Professor Jones taught at Columbia for 32 years and won a reputation as a legal philosopher and innovator in the teaching of contracts and church-state relations. He helped to establish the Law School's curriculum in legal methods and legislation.
        A native of New York City, Professor Jones attended Westminster College and graduated from Washington University and its Law School. A Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, Professor Jones earned his LL.M. degree at Columbia in 1939. Teaching After the War
        During World War II, he went into Government service with the Office of Price Administration and, from 1943 to 1946, as a naval officer and lawyer in the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics.
        He returned to Columbia as a professor of law in 1947, was named Cardozo Professor 10 years later and reached emeritus status in 1979.
        Professor Jones edited and contributed to the 1976 volume of historical papers prepared for the American Bar Association's observance of the Bicentennial.
        For many years, Professor Jones directed the Foundation Press's casebook series and at the time of his death remained director of its textbook series. Among his many honors was the Columbia Law School's highest, the Medal for Excellence, awarded in 1989.
        Professor Jones's first wife, the former Shirley O'Neal Coggeshall, died in 1955, and his second, the former Alice Neuberger Katz, in 1984.
        In addition to Jean Brown, whom he married in 1990, his survivors include two sisters, May Sugert of Sarasota, Fla., and Ruth Treglow of St. Louis.
