        Louis Severin Tregre, an interior designer who specialized in health-care centers and furnishings for the elderly, died on Friday at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. He was 66 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Tregre died of cancer, said Loren Swick, executive director of the National Council for Interior Design Qualification.
        Mr. Tregre, a 1943 architecture graduate of Texas A. & M. University, joined the J. C. Penney Company after serving as an Army captain in World War II. He joined Voorhies Walker Foley & Smith in 1957, and later worked as an architectural and interior designer for J. Gordon Carr, William Pahlmann Associates and Valerian S. Rybar Inc.
        In 1961 he founded his own firm, Louis Tregre Associates, and in 1972 helped found the National Council for Interior Design Qualification, which tests and certifies interior designers. He served as the council's president until 1981 and then became chairman. He became executive adviser in 1986 president emeritus in 1990.
        There are no immediate survivors.
