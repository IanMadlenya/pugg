        Phillip David Marcus Brown, an actor and singer, died on Sept. 16 at his home in Manhattan. He was 37.
        The cause was heart failure resulting from a severe asthma attack, his family said.
        Mr. Brown, who was born in San Francisco, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and voice at the Juilliard School. He moved to Paris to begin a recording career, and his single, ''Easy Life,'' reached the top of the French charts.
        In the United States, he had a number of successful shows, including ''Brown Voices Out of the Blue'' and a one-man performance piece, ''An Evening of Black Magic: Songlines and Dreamtracks.'' Last December, he appeared in concert with Jane Siberry at the Bottom Line.
        He is survived by his mother, Geraldine Smith, and three brothers, Michael, Terrence and Eric.
