        Alan Lewis, the managing director of the Rainbow Room, died yesterday in the restaurant's office. He was 70 years old and lived in Manhattan..
        He died of heart disease, his companion, Verna Hobson, said.

In 1950, he joined Restaurant Associates and with Joseph Baum, the restaurateur and consultant, opened legendary New York dining rooms like the Forum of the Twelve Caesars, the Four Seasons and Windows on World. For four decades, Mr. Lewis followed standards of professionalism and courteousness that were imitated in grand restaurants across the country.
        He directed the refurbishing of the Rainbow Room and presided over the restaurant since it reopened in 1987.
        He is survived by a son, Seth Lewis of London; a daughter, Patrica Blanc of Paris; a sister, Janice McMillan of Brewster, Mass., and a granddaughter.
