        Bruce Hubbard, a baritone who sang both opera and musical theater, died on Tuesday at New York University Hospital. He was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of pneumonia, said his mother, Hannah Poindexter of Indianapolis.
        Mr. Hubbard was best known in the United States for the role of Jake in "Porgy and Bess," which he sang in his Metropolitan Opera debut during the 1984-85 season and in his debut at the Glyndebourne Festival in England the following year.

        Born in Indianapolis, Mr. Hubbard studied voice at Indiana University and apprenticed with the Santa Fe Opera.  He had an active career in Britain, appearing at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and as a soloist with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic, as well as on BBC television.
        In addition to his mother, he is survived by his father, Lenwood Hubbard; three sisters, Vicki Linn, Jewell Ann and Leslie Smith; and a brother, Gerald, all of Indianopolis.
