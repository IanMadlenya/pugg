        He was born in Troy, N.Y., and attended Phillips Academy at Andover, Mass., and Union College in Schenectady, N.Y.
        Before his retirement, Mr. Stillman had homes in Manhattan, Darien, Conn. and Pawling.
        His first marriage, to the former Dorothy Rachel Hall, ended in divorce. His second wife, the former Angela Aguilar, died in 1980.
        In addition to his wife Eugenia, whom he married in 1981, he is survived by two daughters, Suzanne S. Heiligman of Cazenovia, N.Y., and Coralia S. Merritt of Marion, Mass, and two granddaughters.
