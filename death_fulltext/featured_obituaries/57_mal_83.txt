        Dr. Harlan J. Smith, an astronomer who headed the University of Texas's McDonald Observatory, in the Davis Mountains of west Texas, died on Thursday at the Seton Medical Center in Austin, Tex. He was 67 years old and lived in Austin.
        Dr. Smith died of cancer, his family said.
        He was the director of the observatory for 26 years, until his retirement in 1989, and was chairman of the university's astronomy department for 15 years, during which its faculty expanded several-fold. He helped develop a 107-inch-diameter reflector telescope, the world's third largest when it began operating in 1965. In recent years, he worked on plans for an 8.5-meter spectroscopic telescope, which is expected to rank as the second largest.
        Dr. Smith was credited with discovering the variability of quasars, the influence of solar wind on radio emissions from Jupiter and the existence of variable stars known as dwarf Cepheids.
        In promoting a public interest in astronomy, he helped develop the "Story of the Universe" series that won first place awards at the New York Film Festival.
        Dr. Smith, a native of Wheeling, W. Va., earned his undergraduate, master's and doctoral degrees at Harvard University. He taught 10 years at Yale before joining the Austin faculty in 1963.
        He is survived by his wife, Joan Greene Smith; four children, Nathaniel, of Houston, Hannah, of San Antonio, Julie, of Dallas, and Theodore, of Austin, and a brother, Kenneth, of Newark, Del.
