        Kevin M. Seagrave, an insurance company senior account executive, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan at the age of 46. He had a second home in East Hampton, L.I.
        The cause was believed to be a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Seagrave was an executive pension consultant for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. He sold investment products to large corporate retirement plans and was the liaison between his company and its clients in the operation of the plans.
        His entire 25-year career was at Metropolitan Life, where he started in 1968 after his college education.
        Mr. Seagrave was born in Queens and was a graduate of Queens College. He also earned a master's degree in business administration from the New York University School of Business.
        His survivors include his companion of 19 years, Harold Gal of Manhattan and East Hampton; his mother, Beatrice T. Seagrave of Little Neck, Queens, and two sisters, Kathleen Nocera of Forest Hills, Queens, and Dolores Heintz of Little Neck.
