        Laurence J. Kirwan, who was chairman of the New York State Democratic Party from 1984 to 1989 after being handpicked by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, died on Thursday at his home in Wellfleet, Mass. He was 61 and had lived in Rochester from 1965 until a few years ago.
        He had melanoma, said John A. Marino, his successor as chairman from 1989 to 1993.
        Mr. Kirwan was also a member of the Democratic National Committee from 1977 to 1992. For 11 years before becoming state chairman, he was the Democratic leader of Monroe County, which includes Rochester, and supported Mr. Cuomo. Under Mr. Kirwan and Governor Cuomo, the once-bankrupt state Democratic organization prospered financially and electorally. The two men also promoted a party code of ethics.
        A native of Worcester, Mass., he graduated in 1962 from St. Anselm's College in Manchester, N.H.
        At his death he was president of Paris-Kirwan Associates Inc., an insurance agency in Rochester.
        He is survived by his wife, Constance B. Wilder; two daughters, Susan Kirwan of Boston and Kathryn Basson of Newburyport, Mass.; two sons, David, of Austin, Tex., and Robert, of Hartford; and two grandchildren.
