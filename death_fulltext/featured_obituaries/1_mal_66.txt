        Dr. Edward H. Rynearson, a retired Mayo Clinic physician who argued against prolonging the lives of those with incurable diseases, died here Tuesday in an automobile accident. He was 86 years old.
        Dr. Rynearson and his wife, Lida, were traveling from their winter home on Sanibel Island to Fort Myers when the accident occurred, killing Dr. Rynearson and injuring his wife, said the couple's son-in-law, Frank Michaels.
        Dr. Rynearson, a senior consultant at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., when he retired in 1966, gained national prominence in 1959 when he wrote in the bulletin of the American Cancer Society that physicians should not try to prolong the lives of patients suffering from incurable diseases. 'The Mercy of Death'
        Dr. Rynearson, a Methodist, suggested that clergymen help make decisions to allow terminally ill patients to die by withdrawing the medical means that keep them alive. ''Why don't you step back and give them the mercy of death?'' he asked.
        He was one of the first physicians in the United States to say take such a stance and make his views public.
        Dr. Rynearson also wrote and lectured widely on the health hazards of obesity. In 1950, at a meeting in New York of the Association of Life Insurance Medical Directors, he compared fat people to alcoholics and urged the formation of a ''Calories Anonymous'' to help overaters keep within proper weight limits.
        Dr. Rynearson, who was born in Pittsburgh, was appointed to the staff of the Mayo Clinic in 1932. He was a specialist in endocrinology, the branch of medicine dealing with the endocrine glands and the internal secretions of the body.
