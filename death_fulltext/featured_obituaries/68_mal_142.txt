        Robert C. Caviano, a founder of Lifebeat, the music industry's organization to fight AIDS, died on Sept. 22 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 42 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Caviano died of AIDS complications, said Frances Pennington, a spokeswoman for Lifebeat.
        Mr. Caviano was involved with AIDS relief efforts since the early 1980's and helped to raise more than $1 million for community-based AIDS organizations including Gay Men's Health Crisis and Bailey House.
        Lifebeat directly assists entertainment-industry figures afflicted with AIDS, in part by staging musical benefits around the country to raise money for local organizations. The first such concert was held in June at the Roseland ballroom in Manhattan.
        In the 1970's and early 1980's Mr. Caviano, a native of Manhattan, managed pop music stars including Grace Jones, the Village People, and K. C. & the Sunshine Band. Later he was a talent agent for a number of agencies, including Famous Artists.
        Mr. Caviano is survived by his father, Frank, of Manhattan; three brothers:, Raymond, Louis, and Richard; and a sister, Maria Berk of Queens.
