        Msgr. Martinho da Costa Lopes, who was vicar general of the former Portuguese colony of East Timor when Indonesian forces invaded the predominantly Roman Catholic enclave in 1975, died last Wednesday at Egas Moniz Hospital in Lisbon. He was 72 years old and lived in Alges, a suburb of Lisbon.
        The exact cause of death was not immediately available, but he had been suffering from diabetes for some time, a friend said.
        Monsignor da Costa Lopes was appointed as papal administrator, or acting bishop, of East Timor in 1977 but was replaced in 1983 by the Vatican after Indonesian authorities complained that his sermons were inciting nationalist sentiment.
        Ordained a priest in 1948, after graduating from the Roman Catholic seminary in Macao, he was an outspoken critic of human rights violations in his native East Timor. His calls for intervention by the United Nations or for curtailment of United States military aid to the Indonesian Government went unheeded.
        There were no immediate survivors.
