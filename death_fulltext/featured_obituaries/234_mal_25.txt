        Ross Tompkins, a jazz pianist best known for his long tenure with Doc Severinsen's big band on the ''Tonight'' show, died on June 30 at his home in St. Augustine, Fla. He was 68.
        His death was announced by his family, who did not specify the cause, although published reports said it was lung cancer.
        He recorded several albums as a leader, but was best known as a sideman and did some of his most acclaimed work in support of other musicians.
        Born in Detroit on May 13, 1938, he studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and began his career in 1960 in New York, where he worked with Benny Goodman, Wes Montgomery, Eric Dolphy, the Clark Terry & Bob Brookmeyer quintet and many others.
        In 1971 he moved to Los Angeles, where he joined Mr. Severinsen's ''Tonight'' ensemble. He remained on the show until Johnny Carson retired as host in 1992, ending Mr. Severinsen's long run as its bandleader.
        During his television years Mr. Tompkins also worked regularly in the Los Angeles area, in and out of the recording studios. His most notable and long-lasting association was with the drummer Louie Bellson's big band. In the mid-1980's he began working with the trumpeter and singer Jack Sheldon, and in recent years the two performed frequently as a duo.
        He is survived by a brother, Rick; three daughters, Teri, Suzie and Janine; and five grandchildren.
