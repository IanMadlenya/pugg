        The Rev. Dr. John Seldon Whale, a Congregational historian and theologian who taught, lectured and preached in New York, New Jersey and elsewhere in the United States and his native Britain, died last Wednesday after moving to a nursing home in Edinburgh. He was 100 and had lived in southwestern England, not far from his birthplace in Cornwall.
        The Times of London said on Friday that Dr. Whale's ''intellectual influence reached well beyond the parameters of one denomination,'' and that ''he was a genuine master of the pulpit, possessing great dramatic gifts, a lucid mind and the authentic accent of authority.''
        His 1941 book, ''Christian Doctrine'' (Cambridge) went on to be used in training Anglican ministers in Britain for more than 50 years. It is still in print in the United States.
        Dr. Whale studied history and also trained for the ministry at Oxford University. He became Mackennal Professor of Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity from Glasgow University and held other educational and religious posts in Britain.
        Most of Dr. Whale's campus appearances in America were prior to the late 1960's. They included serving as a visiting professor of theology at Drew University in Madison, N.J., from 1951 to 1953, as a lecturer at Columbia University in 1952 and at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., in 1954, as a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1959 and as a senior fellow of the Council of the Humanities at Princeton University in 1960.
        He also lectured and preached elsewhere around the country. The churches where he preached in Manhattan included the Riverside Church and the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Carter; a daughter and two sons.
