        Jean J. Vuillequez, a longtime executive with Amax Inc., the metal and energy company, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. He was 80 years old and lived in Sawgrass, Fla.
        Mr. Vuillequez died of a heart attack, said the family's lawyer, Nelson Buhler.
        During a career that spanned 49 years, Mr. Vuillequez (pronounced VILL-a-kay) rose through the ranks of Amax as it evolved into one of the country's largest metal and mining companies, with operations around the world.
        Mr. Vuillequez, who attended New York University, joined the bookkeeping department at Amax in New York City in 1927, when he was just 16 and the company was still known at the American Metal Company. He was named vice-president of sales in 1953 and was elected to the company's board three years later.
        As an executive with Amax, he became a leading spokesman for the metals industry, testifying often before Congress on issues like international mining rights and tariffs.
        In 1964, he became president of Ametalco Inc., an international metals trading company that was acquired by Amax in 1967. He served as vice-chairman of Roan Selection Trust, a copper producer in Zambia, and returned to Amax's headquarters in New York as executive vice-president in 1973 when Roan merged with Amax. A year later, he was elected vice-chairman. He retired in 1976.
        He is survived by his wife, Germanine Bardet Vuillequez; a son, Richard, and a daughter, Diane S. Vuillequez, both of Brookfield, Conn.; a sister, Suzanne Vuillequez of Rutherford, N.J.; four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
