        Mr. Raymond, a graduate of the Columbia University School of Architecture, designed classical houses using contemporary materials. In 1946, he became associated with Elder, Raymond & Breck, an architectural concern in Stamford that later disbanded. The firm designed many estates and remodeled Arden House, Columbia's conference center in Harriman, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Cecilia Ococks.
