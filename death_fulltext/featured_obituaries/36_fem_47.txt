        Madge Bellamy, an actress who starred in silent films in the 1920's, died on Wednesday at San Antonio Community Hospital in Upland, Calif. She was 90 years old and lived in Ontario, Calif.
        In the years between ''Hail the Woman,'' released in 1922, and ''The Daring Young Man'' in 1935, Miss Bellamy made 26 films. She was considered the Fox studio's answer to Clara Bow and Colleen Moore, her contemporaries at other studios.
        Grace Houghton, whose Vestal Press of Vestal, N.Y., is to publish Ms. Bellamy's autobiography, ''Darling of the Twenties,'' next month, said that the actress thought her best film was the 1928 adaptation of an Edna Ferber story, ''Mother Knows Best.''
        Ms. Bellamy's film career ended in the 1930's. ''I got too big for my britches,'' she said. ''I wanted too much money and when it was not forthcoming, I quit.''
