        Eli Elias, a clothing manufacturer and leader of the New York City garment industry, died on Friday in Hollywood, Fla. He was 92.
        The cause was a stroke, his grandson, Dan, said.
        As president and executive director of the New York Skirt and Sportswear Association for several decades, until he was 86, Mr. Elias tried to steer the city's clothing manufacturers through wave after wave of competition from overseas.
        Mr. Elias was born in Rochester on Aug. 2, 1912, and studied drafting and machine designs in high school before moving to Manhattan in 1929 to work as a plant manager at his uncle's clothing factory. He became a partner at another manufacturing company, Maybro Sportswear, in 1931 but left in 1934 to open his own company, Elias Sportswear, which by 1946 employed 1,200 workers at its plant in Brooklyn.
        In 1979 he transferred the company to his son Richard and became president of the New York Skirt and Sportswear Association.
        During his tenure, he organized the Federation of Apparel Manufacturersand the Garment Center Economic Security Council. He was vice chairman of the board of the Garment Industry Development Corporation and was on the boards of the Council for American Fashion, the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Institute of Technology and the High School of Fashion Industries in Manhattan.
        Mr. Elias was a founder of the Sephardic Temple of Cedarhurst, N.Y., and an honorary president of the United Sephardim of Brooklyn. He helped start the Sephardic Home for the Aged in Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife, Sara; three children, Roslyn Hazan, Allan and Richard; 9 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
