        Dr. G. William Jones, a professor of cinema and video who founded the film archives at Southern Methodist University and the USA Film Festival in Dallas, died on Tuesday at his home in Dallas. He was 62.
        The cause was brain cancer, his family said.
        For 27 years Dr. Jones taught screenwriting and all aspects of cinema at S.M.U. In that period, he served on several Federal film commissions and as a consultant to Hollywood studios on copywright and censorship.
        In 1970 Dr. Jones established the Southwest Film/Video Archives at the Meadows School of Arts at S.M.U. after Ginger Rogers gave him 21 prints of her films. Under Dr. Jones's direction, the archives became one of the largest film libraries in the country, with more than 9,500 films, extensive tapes on the history of the Southwest and a comprehensive collection of movie cameras and projectors.
        To finance the archives, he organized a festival in 1970, presenting what then was an obscure film, "M*A*S*H," and its director, Robert Altman. The event became the USA Film Festival, which has brought leading figures of cinema to the university and now has a year-round film program.
        Dr. Jones, who was born in Austin. graduated from S.M.U. and received a master's degree from the university's Perkins School of Theology in 1956 and a Ph.D from Syracuse University in 1971. He is the author of 10 books, the latest being "Black Cinema Treasures: Lost and Found," (North Texas Publishers, 1991).
        Surviving are his wife, Bobbie; two sons, David, of Dallas, and Chris, of Indianapolis, and a grandson.
