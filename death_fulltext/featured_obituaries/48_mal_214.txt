        Herman H. Kahn, a longtime partner in the Lehman Brothers investment banking firm, died on Friday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. He was 81 years old and had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan.
        He died of a stroke, his assistant, Ann Finkelson, said.
        Mr. Kahn was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, graduated third in his class at the High School of Commerce and was a $15-a-week runner for Lehman while earning a bachelor's degree at night in economics and finance at New York University.
        He soon specialized in statistics and security analysis and became a leading expert in private-placement financing -- the sale of securities to selected investors without their having to scramble for it in the open market. He became a partner at Lehman Brothers in 1950, and retired in 1986.
        Mr. Kahn's clients included more than a score of the nation's major corporations, and he had been a director of the Allied Stores Corporation, Avco Corporation, Dayco Corporation, Fruehauf Corporation, Microwave Associates and the Seaboard Finance Company. He was a founder and president of the Herman and Ruth Kahn Foundation, which contributes to charitable, educational and cultural organizations.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Ruth Schulman; a son, Sidney, of Locust Valley, L.I.; a daughter, Geraldine Karetsky of Aspen, Colo.; a sister, Sylvia Silber of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.
