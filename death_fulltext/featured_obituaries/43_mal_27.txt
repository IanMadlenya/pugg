        Milton C. Sapinsley, a retired manufacturing executive, died Wednesday at his home in Providence, R.I. He was 94 years old.
        Mr. Sapinsley was the former chairman and president of the Carol Cable Company, a manufacturer of insulated wire and cable and one of the largest employers in Providence.
        After service as an Army lieutenant in France during World War I, Mr. Sapinsley settled in Providence, where he founded the Crescent Company, a forerunner of Carol Cable. He sold the company to the Penn-Texas Corporation in 1953 and repurchased it five years later.
        He was a founder and past president of United Way of Rhode Island. He was also a past president of the Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce and served on the boards of Miriam Hospital, the Jewish Community Center, the Jewish Home for the Aged, and the Lying-In Hospital.
        He is survived by a son, John, and a daughter, Jane S. Nelson, both of Providence; seven grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.
