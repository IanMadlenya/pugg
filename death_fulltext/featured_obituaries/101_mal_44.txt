        Dr. Lenox Dial Baker, a Duke University orthopedic surgeon who contributed to the treatment of children with cerebral palsy, died on Friday at the Hillcrest Convalescent Center in Durham, N.C. He was 92.
        He joined the Duke faculty in 1937 as an assistant in orthopedics and served as a full professor from 1947 until he reached emeritus status in 1972. He was chief of orthopedics from 1937 to 1967.
        When the North Carolina Legislature established the Durham Cerebral Palsy Clinic in 1947, he became its medical director and served in that post until 1971. The clinic, renamed in his honor, has been part of Duke University Medical Center since 1987.
        A leading practitioner in the surgical treatment of cerebral palsy, Dr. Baker was also widely known for treating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
        Dr. Baker played a central role in the development of Duke's medical center virtually since it opened in 1930.
        Born in De Kalb, Tex., he graduated from the University of Tennessee. He was a member of the first class of medical students at Duke, receiving his M.D. in 1934. He joined the Duke faculty after advanced training in his specialty at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore.
        He was a leader in many professional groups, including the American Academy of Cerebral Palsy and President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Committee for the Employment of the Physically Handicapped, which honored him with its 1957 Physician's Award.
        Dr. Baker is survived by two sons, Robert F. of Durham, and Dr. Lenox D. Jr. of Norfolk, Va.; seven grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
