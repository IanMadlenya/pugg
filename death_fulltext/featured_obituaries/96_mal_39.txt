        Conrad Strasser, music director of the After Dinner Opera Company, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was AIDS, said Richard Flusser, the company's director.
        Mr. Strasser joined After Dinner Opera, which specializes in new American works, in 1969. His first project was a program of short operas with words by Gertrude Stein. He later conducted 56 New York City premieres of operas by American composers. He was also music director of the Unitarian Church of Staten Island for nearly 20 years.
        Mr. Strasser studied piano and violin and taught in the pre-college opera division at the Manhattan School of Music for more than 10 years. He also taught piano and voice and coached singers from the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera.
        He is survived by a brother, Jonathan.
