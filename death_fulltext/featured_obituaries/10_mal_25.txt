        Eamonn Andrews, an Irish-born British television personality who was the host of the British version of ''This Is Your Life,'' died Thursday after a long illness. He was 64 years old.
        One of the pioneers of early television talk shows, Mr. Andrews's Irish brogue and cool charm made him a celebrity throughout Britain.
        His wife, Grainne, said he had been hospitalized on Monday for treatment for a long-standing heart condition. ''He had been feeling weak over the weekend and had gone into hospital for some X-rays,'' Mrs. Andrews said.
        Mr. Andrews started out in life as a boxer. He won the Irish amateur junior middleweight boxing championship and began his broadcasting career as a boxing commentator for Irish radio, and later became a sports announcer on the BBC.
        In 1955, he began broadcasting the British version of ''This Is Your Life,'' using an idea borrowed from the United States.
