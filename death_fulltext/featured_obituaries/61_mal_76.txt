        Louis Sobol, who founded Caviarteria, a specialty foods business that supplies Americans with millions of dollars worth of caviar each year, died Thursday in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was 72 years old.
        He died of leukemia, his family said.
        Mr. Sobol opened Caviarteria in 1952 to sell exotic foods that were very difficult to find at the time, like white asparagus and quail eggs. Eventually Caviarteria had nine stores, in New York and New Jersey.
        About 25 years ago, the company closed most of its retail operations and began concentrating on a more limited line. The company now has a store at 29 East 60th Street in Manhattan and one at 247 North Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., with a large mail-order business in items like caviar, salmon and foie gras. It sells about $10 million worth of food annually in the United States.
        Mr. Sobol was born in Brooklyn on Jan. 13, 1920. He grew up in Manhattan, and graduated from City College.
        Mr. Sobol is survived by his wife, the former Ruth Kraus, of New York, who will take over as president of Caviarteria; two sons, Bruce and Eric, both of New York, who run the company's day-to-day operations; a sister, Beatrice Rosen of Los Angeles, and several nieces and nephews.
