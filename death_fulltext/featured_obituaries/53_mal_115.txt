        William D. Ogdon, a member of the editorial board of The New York Times from 1946 to 1966, died on Saturday at his home in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 89 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, his son, Thomas, said.
        Mr. Ogdon specialized in writing editorials on the political, economic and governmental issues of New York City and New York State. In his 35 years at the newspaper, he had also been a copy editor and later contributed articles to The Times Magazine and The Times Book Review.
        On the eve of his retirement in 1955, the Citizens Budget Commission gave him a special award for "high public service." It cited "his well-informed editorial comments on all phases of municipal affairs over a period of many years and especially for his penetrating analyses of municipal finance" in 1965 that disclosed the significance of the city's efforts to gain new taxing authority from the State Legislature.
        William Duley Ogdon was born in Hoopeston, Ill., and grew up in Toledo, Ohio. He earned a bachelor's degree at Transylvania College and did graduate studies at Yale. He was a reporter with The Toledo Times and a rewrite man and copy editor with The St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
        He joined The New York Times in 1931, working successively as a copy editor, an editor in the Washington bureau and on the editorial page. In World War II he served in Navy intelligence and on the carrier Yorktown in the Pacific, rising to commander.
        Surviving, besides his son, who lives in Manhattan, is his wife of 59 years, Juanita; a daughter, Judith Gardner of Lexington, Ky., five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
        Correction:  June 18, 1991, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final
        Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about William D. Ogdon, a former editorial writer for The New York Times, misstated his retirement year. It was 1966, not 1955.
