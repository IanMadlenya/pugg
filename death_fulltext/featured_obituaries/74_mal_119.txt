        James F. Hatcher Jr., whose career as a director and producer at the University of Alabama at Birmingham spanned four decades, died on Friday at the university hospital. He was 71 and lived in Birmingham.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for the university.
        Mr. Hatcher began his long association with the university's Town and Gown Theater with its founding in 1950 and retired in 1991. He also directed 36 Miss Alabama pageants and was the founding producer and director of the Birmingham Summerfest programs. He was working on the 15th festival at his death. He was also a founder of the Alabama Council on the Arts and Humanities.
        Mr. Hatcher's credits ranged from a staging of "The Nutcracker" with the Alabama State Ballet Company to his most recent project, "Tallu," a play about the life of the actress Tallulah Bankhead.
