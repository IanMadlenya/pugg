        Joe Morrison, the head football coach at South Carolina and a star running back and receiver in a 14-year career with the New York Giants, died of a heart attack Sunday night. He was 51 years old.
        Mr. Morrison collapsed in a shower room after having played racquetball at the university, Dawn Catalano, a spokeswoman for Providence Hospital, said. He died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. Ms. Catalano said that Mr. Morrison had previously been hospitalized for heart problems.
        Mr. Morrison's teams had a record of 39-29-2 in his six seasons at South Carolina, including an 8-4 mark in 1988, when he took the Gamecocks to the Liberty Bowl, where they lost to Indiana.
        In 1984, Mr. Morrison was named coach of the year by the Walter Camp Foundation. He previously coached at Tennessee-Chattanooga and New Mexico and had a career record of 101-73-7 over 16 seasons. 'Old Dependable'
        Mr. Morrison graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 1959 and was a third-round draft selection of the Giants. He played for them from 1959 to 1972, and earned the nickname Old Dependable.
        He was a versatile player, seeing action at halfback, fullback, tight end, wide receiver and even safety on defense. He was named most valuable player by the National Football League Touchdown Club in 1972. That year, the Giants retired his number, 40.
        ''He was the ultimate team player,'' Wellington Mara, the Giants' owner, said tonight. ''He would do anything you asked him. Run the ball, catch play on the special teams, anything.''
        Mr. Morrison is the Giants' career leader in receptions with 395 covering 4,993 yards and 47 touchdowns. He gained 2,472 yards rushing in his career on 677 carries, scoring 18 rushing touchdowns. His 65 career touchdowns rank him fourth in the history of the Giants with 390 points.
        Mr. Morrison is survived by his wife, JeVena.
