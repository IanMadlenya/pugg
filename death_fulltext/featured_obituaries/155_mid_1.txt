        Princess Kathleen Comerford McLoughlin Scherbatow, who had been active in the Russian Nobility Association in America, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 85 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        The cause was heart failure, said her husband of 58 years, Prince Alexis Scherbatow.
        Princess Scherbatow (pronounced sher-BAH-toff) was born in Briarcliff, N.Y. She was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant and the daughter of an artist, Gregory Van Zandt McLoughlin. She attended private schools in California and Maryland.
        Prince Scherbatow was born in Russia and since 1982 has been president of the nobility group, with headquarters in Manhattan.
        He is descended from the House of Rurik, legendary founder of Russia. His father, Prince Paul Scherbatow, was a colonel and aide-de-camp to Grand Duke Nicholas, commander of the Russian Army on the Western and Turkish fronts in World War I.
        Prince Scherbatow is a retired professor of history at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
        The group's treasurer, Prince Ivan Obolensky, said after the couple wed in 1941, the princess became active in the group, which has 140 members and is, he said, ''an organization with two thrusts.''
        ''First,'' he said, ''it's a genealogical society which is able to locate and help people that are looking for their forebears or people with whom they've lost touch, in Russia or here.'' The association also donates money to orphanages in Russia.
        Prince Obolensky said Princess Scherbatow served on several committees of the association, which has an annual Russian ball.
        Besides her husband, Princess Scherbatow's survivors include two sisters, Cornelia Van Winkle of Bedford, N.Y., and Hope Ryan of the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
