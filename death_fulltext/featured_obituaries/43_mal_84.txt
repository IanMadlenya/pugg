        Mr. Whiteley, who was born in St. John's, Newfoundland, was an expert on the waters of Canada's Atlantic provinces. On his boats Seal and Neptune he made many research voyages from the 1950's through the 1970's. With Charles W. Bartlett and Dr. Paul Shelden he wrote ''The Cruising Guide to Newfoundland'' in 1971, and he was the author and illustrator of ''Northern Seas, Hardy Sailors'' in 1982.
        A graduate of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with a master's degree from the University of Toronto, he worked with British biologists on the first systematic study of the Grand Banks fishery. He did research for the United States Navy during World War II in Massachusetts at the Marine Biological Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, with which he was associated for many years.
        Mr. Whiteley taught at the Hill School in Pottstown, Pa., for 33 years and was named to the Independence Foundation Chair there in 1963.
        He is survived by a daughter, Diane Woodward of Pottstown; three sons, W. F. N. Whiteley of Middleboro, Mass., and Stark and George Whiteley 3d, both of Manhattan; a sister, Mary, of St. John's; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
