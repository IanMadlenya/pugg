        William E. Clancy, a former New York State Assemblyman who championed enhanced pensions for public school teachers, died on Tuesday in Sarasota, Fla. He was 82.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn.
        Mr. Clancy served in the State Assembly as a Democrat from Ridgewood, Queens, from 1942 to 1952. His teachers' pension bill was passed in 1951 and made it possible for teachers to receive a combined annuity and pension equal to 70 percent of their final salary instead of 50 percent.
        Mr. Clancy also served as an executive for several electronics companies. As vice president of Continental Cablevision of Boston, he negotiated franchises in Chicago, St. Louis and other cities.
        He was member of the board of the Catholic Telecommunications Network of America in Washington and a member of its finance committee. He also served on the board of the Office of Pastoral Communications of the Diocese of Brooklyn.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret Lydon of Forest Hills; three sons, William E. Jr., of Los Angeles, John J., of St. Louis and Ambrose T., of Forest Hills; two daughters, Margaret C., of Manhattan and Elizabeth R., of Forest Hills; a sister, Marle C. Cummings, of Paoll, Pa., and a brother, Msgr. Thomas C., of Brooklyn.
