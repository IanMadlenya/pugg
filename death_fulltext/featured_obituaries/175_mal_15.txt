        Philip Edward Rollhaus Jr., the founder, chief executive and chairman of the Quixote Corporation, died Tuesday at his home in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 66.
        The cause of death was cancer, said Barbara, his wife.
        Mr. Rollhaus founded Energy Absorption Systems in 1969. He developed the company's patented highway cushions, which are designed to protect cars in crashes. In 1969, the company became Quixote, a holding company, to reflect its interests in optical discs and court-reporting machines. A subsidiary, LaserVideo, which became DMI, made the first audio compact disc in the United States in 1975.
        Today, Quixote's focus is highway safety: its companies manufacture flexible signposts, devices to measure traffic flow and highway advisory radio systems. Mr. Rollhaus retired as president and chief executive last year, but remained chairman.
        Mr. Rollhaus received a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University in 1956. He moved to Paris after four years in the Navy; there he started a research company and founded The Parnassus Review, a literary magazine. He worked at Business International, a research company, and Woolard & Company, an investment bank, before he started E.A.S.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter, Natalie Burton, of Los Angeles; his son, Ned, of San Francisco; and his sister, Barbara Quimby, of Albany.
