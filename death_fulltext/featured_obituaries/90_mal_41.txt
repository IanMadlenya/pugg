        Nils W. Berg, a former senior art director of the McCann-Erickson advertising agency in New York who later was a restaurateur in Provincetown, Mass., died on Wednesday at the Cape End Manor Nursing Home in Provincetown. He was 79.
        Mr. Berg had a long illness, said his wife, Eva.
        A native of Sweden, Mr. Berg came to this country as a child. He fought with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and 1937 and was wounded in action. Back in the United States, he was long active in the efforts by brigade veterans to aid Spanish refugees.
        He began working for McCann-Erickson in 1930. After retiring from the agency in 1955, Mr. Berg moved to Provincetown and developed a rundown pier into boutiques, apartments and a restaurant, Pepe's Wharf.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Nils J., of Duxbury, Mass.; a daughter, Astrid Karinna Berg of Provincetown; a brother, Avid, of Denver, and two grandchildren.
