        William J. Colihan Jr., a former executive vice president of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, died on Friday at Essex Meadows, a retirement community in Essex, Conn. He was 79.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his son, William J. 3d.
        The elder Mr. Colihan was born and raised in Manhattan, graduated from Loyola School and began at Young & Rubicam as a messenger and mail boy in 1936. He rose -- with time out for Navy service in World War II -- to executive copy director, then assistant to the president, senior vice president and executive vice president.
        In 1968 he resigned, saying, "I've long been interested in public service, and it seemed like an appropriate time to say, 'O.K., now, make the change.' I'd like to be some sort of missionary between the Government and the business."
        He then became a senior vice president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, and the head of its Washington office, for some years. He went on to be a high executive of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and to serve on the board of the Connecticut River Museum.
        In addition to his son, William, of Manhattan, Mr. Colihan is survived by his wife, the former Matilda Alston, to whom he was married in 1947; another son, Alston, of Washington; two daughters, Jane, of Brooklyn, and Abigail, of Jamaica Plain, Mass., and two grandsons.
