        George Strugar, a former defensive lineman with the Jets and Los Angeles Rams who had a standout  career at the University of Washington, died last week in Anza, Calif. He was 63 years old. The cause of death was lung cancer.

        Mr. Strugar was elected to the Husky Hall of Fame in 1988. After his career ended, he became a trucking and warehouse executive.
        He is survived by his wife, Janice; a daughter, Pamela; a son, Douglas, and two grandsons, two brothers and a sister.
