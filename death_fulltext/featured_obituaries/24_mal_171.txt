        Lord Basnett, a former union leader often blamed by his fellow members of the Labor Party for helping to put Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in power, died today. He was 64 years old.
        Lord Basnett was leader of Britain's third-largest union, the 800,000-member General and Municipal Workers, until he retired in 1986.
        His union's strenuous opposition to efforts to hold down pay raises during a Labor Government in 1978 led to the ''winter of discontent,'' in which hospitals were strikebound and the dead went unburied. In the general election in May 1979, Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives ousted Labor in the first of three election victories.
