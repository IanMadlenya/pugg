        Ursule Molinaro, a novelist and translator, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was believed to have been in her 80's, said McPherson & Company, her publishers.
        In a career that spanned five decades, she wrote 14 novels, 4 collections of short fiction and 18 one-act plays. She also translated books and was fluent in five languages.
        Born in Paris, Ms. Molinaro was educated at the Sorbonne and the University of London, and studied medicine in Florence, Italy. Jailed for harboring Jews in Paris during World War II, she escaped and joined the Resistance. After the war she became a freelance journalist and soon published her first book, a collection of fables.
        She came to New York in the 1950's to work as a simultaneous translator at the United Nations and adopted English as her primary language. Her first book published here was ''Mirrors for Small Beasts'' (Noonday Press) in 1960. That year she was also one of the founders of Chelsea magazine, a literary journal.
        Ms. Molinaro's books include ''The Borrower,'' ''Green Lights Are Blue'' and ''Sounds of a Drunken Summer.''
        During the 1960's and 70's Ms. Molinaro wrote a series of one-act plays and translated works by such authors as Hermann Hesse, Nathalie Sarraute and Christa Wolf for publication in English. She also taught at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of Hawaii and New York University.
        Her most recent book, a trio of short satirical novels under the title ''Demons and Divas,'' was published earlier this year.
        She is survived by a daughter.
