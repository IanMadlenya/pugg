        Mickey Levine, a lifelong advocate for social and political rights who helped to organize the American Veterans Committee, died on Nov. 22 at his home in North Miami Beach. He was 83 and had lived for many years in and near Manhattan.
        The cause was smoke inhalation in a fire at his home, said Bernie Bellush, a lifetime friend.
        Mr. Levine was a fund-raiser for charitable organizations after World War II. He became an organizer for the American Veterans Committee and was soon propelled into the forefront of its campaign to secure decent housing for veterans and equal rights for blacks. The group's interest in civil rights became one of Mr. Levine's principal concerns in the 1950's, a time when organizations like the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, barred them.
        He and the A.V.C. took on those  groups, at Congressional and administrative hearings, over their positions supporting pensions and other compensations that the A.V.C. considered extravagant.
        Mr. Levine served three terms as national chairman of the A.V.C. He was first elected in 1955 to succeed Bill Mauldin, the cartoonist. As the organization's spokesman he frequently challenged the Government and the Veterans Administration.
        He argued that even with costly programs being pressed by the larger groups, veterans' needs were being shortchanged, including psychiatric care and housing for black veterans. He made the point in a ''civil rights audit'' he produced for the A.V.C., for which he traveled in the South, staying with black families and getting out before segregationists could discover him.
        He also was associated with the Americans for Democratic Action, from which he resigned in 1975.
        Mr. Levine, whose parents named him Milton. was born in Manhattan and graduated from City College. He served in the Army in World War II, becoming a noncommissioned officer in the Pacific.
        There are no immediate survivors.
