        Thomas F. Madigan, an Emmy Award-winning television producer whose career spanned radio, advertising and film, died on July 8 in New York City. He was 85.
        The cause was complications of heart surgery, his family said.
        In 1980 Mr. Madigan received an Emmy for producing ''The Hunter and the Hunted,'' a PBS documentary about Nazi war criminals, one of many public television programs and series -- another was ''The Adams Chronicles'' in 1976, winner of four Emmy Awards -- for which he obtained financing. At various times, he ran the corporate underwriting departments of the public television stations WNET-New York, WGBH-Boston and WQED-Pittsburgh.
        Mr. Madigan, who began his career in the 1940's writing radio scripts for live dramas, also worked for the advertising agency Ted Bates Worldwide and as a director of nighttime programming for the entertainment division of NBC.
        In 1969 he produced the documentary ''Salvador Dal√≠: A Soft Self-Portrait,'' which he and the director Jean-Christophe Averty filmed at the artist's home in Spain. Narrated by Orson Welles, it won best documentary at the Venice Film Festival.
        Thomas Francis Madigan was born in New York on May 4, 1919. He graduated from the Choate School and from Trinity College, in Hartford, and was a captain in the Army in the Pacific during World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Eschauzier; a daughter, Alix, of Los Angeles; four of his five children from his first marriage, to Cynthia A. Boissevain: Tony, of Madrid; Sheila Kaelon of Boulder, Colo.; Nick, of Santa Monica, Calif.; and Kevin, of Atlanta; and six grandchildren. Another son, Thomas F. Madigan III, died last year.
