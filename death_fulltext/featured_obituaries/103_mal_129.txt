        Gerald W. Breese, a sociologist who analyzed the structure and growth of large urban areas, particularly in the third world, died on Friday at the Meadow Lakes retirement community in Hightstown, N.J. He was 83.
        The cause was leukemia, his family said.
        Dr. Breese retired from Princeton University in 1977 as emeritus professor of sociology. He joined the faculty in 1949 and from 1950 to 1966 directed Princeton's Bureau of Urban Research, one of the first efforts by an American university to focus on the study of cities.
        He was the author of many articles and books, among them the influential "Urbanization in Newly Developing Countries" (Prentice-Hall, 1966). His Ph.D. dissertation was published in 1949 by University of Chicago Press as "The Daytime Population of the Central Business District of Chicago," the first in-depth study of the dynamics of urban commuting.
        Born in Breesport, N.Y., Gerald William Breese graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1935 and from Yale Divinity School three years later. He received his doctorate at Chicago in 1947.
        Dr. Breese is survived by his wife, Alice Osborn Brown; four children, Adele Overmyer of Arlington, Va., James and Dana, both of Denver, and Brinda Wederich of Belle Meade, N.J., a sister, Viola Ives of Cortland, N.Y.; seven grandchildren, and five stepchildren. He was previously married to Alice Janette Bailey, who died in 1972.
