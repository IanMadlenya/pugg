        Eugene J. Kelly, an assistant district attorney in Queens who prosecuted four drug dealers convicted of murdering a New York City rookie police officer, was found dead on Wednesday at his Bronx home. He was 43 years old.
        Mr. Kelly died of what apparently was a heart attack, said a spokeswoman for the Medical Examiner's office.
        Mr. Kelly was on the two-man prosecution team that won convictions in 1989 in two trials stemming from the murder of the rookie officer, Edward Byrne. Officer Byrne was shot as he sat in a parked patrol car on a South Jamaica street in the early morning of Feb. 26, 1988. He was guarding the firebombed home of a man who had complained to the police about drug dealers in his neighborhood.
        Mr. Kelly and his fellow prosecutor, A. Kirke Bartley Jr., told the jurors that another drug trafficker had ordered the killing from jail as a random act of retaliation against the police for his conviction on a weapons charge.
        The Byrne trials were among about 100 that Mr. Kelly prosecuted in a 14-year career with the Queens District Attorney's office.
        Mr. Kelly graduated from Fordham University in 1971 and New York Law School in 1975.
        He is survived by his mother, Julia, and three brothers, George, Andrew and Timothy.
