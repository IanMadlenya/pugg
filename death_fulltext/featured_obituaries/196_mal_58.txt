        Lionel Wilson, the voice of Tom Terrific, Mighty Manfred the Wonder Dog, Crabby Appleton and all the other characters of the ''Tom Terrific'' cartoons on the ''Captain Kangaroo'' children's television show, died on April 30 in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, his longtime agent, Richard Seff, said.
        ''Tom Terrific,'' produced by Terrytoons from 1957 to 1959, followed the adventures of a young superhero who wore a funnel for a hat and could change shape at will.
        Each story centered on the efforts of the exuberant and wildly imaginative ''greatest hero ever'' to save the lazy Manfred from villains like Crabby Appleton, a meanie who was ''rotten to the core'' and did a bad deed every day.
        Mr. Wilson provided the voices for numerous other cartoons, appearing most recently as Eustace in the Cartoon Network's ''Courage the Cowardly Dog.''
        He also recorded dozens of children's books on tape and CD, including ''Wayside School'' stories by Louis Sachar.
        He was born Lionel Lazarus Salzer on March 22, 1924, in Brooklyn, and is survived by his brother, Herbert Salzer, of Brooklyn.
        He began his career as an actor, first appearing on Broadway in ''Dodsworth'' at 14.
        He also wrote children's books and at the time of his death had just finished his memoirs, ''. . . and Also in the Cast.''
