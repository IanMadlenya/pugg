        David Klasfeld, a New York City official in four mayoral administrations and former deputy schools chancellor, died on Wednesday at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 58.
        The apparent cause was a heart attack, his family said.
        A graduate of City College and Rutgers University School of Law, Mr. Klasfeld was in private practice before he took a succession of public posts, starting as general counsel to the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. He joined the Koch administration in 1986 as counsel to the deputy mayor for policy and physical development.
        He was chief of staff of the deputy for economic development and planning from 1994 to 1997, dealing with the Hudson River Park project and the redevelopment of Times Square. That led to a stint as executive vice president of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
        The incoming schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy, a onetime colleague in private practice, recruited him as an executive assistant in January 2000. Two months later he became deputy chancellor for operations, a position in which he oversaw the recovery of the system after Sept. 11, 2001. After he left the public sector in 2002, he was counsel and an adviser to the Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation, a nonprofit group.
        Mr. Klasfeld is survived by his wife, Hila Richardson, a daughter, Rebecca Klasfeld of Manhattan, and his mother, Pauline Klasfeld, also of Manhattan.
