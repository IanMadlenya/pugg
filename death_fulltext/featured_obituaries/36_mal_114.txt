        Mr. Fletcher was ordained in 1953 and served in Episcopal parishes in Larchmont, N.Y., and Cambridge, Mass., before going to New Britain. Until about a year ago, he still accepted interim priestly assignments in six Connecticut towns.
        Mr. Fletcher was a Princeton graduate and a Navy veteran of World War II.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Louise Love; a son, Peter A., of Morristown, N.J.; a daughter, Mary Pickering of Farmington, and five grandchildren.
