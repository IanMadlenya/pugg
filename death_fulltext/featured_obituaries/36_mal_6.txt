        Patrick Kelly, the American designer whose sexy, witty clothes attracted attention in Paris, died yesterday at the Hotel Dieu, a hospital near the Cathedral of Notre-Dame. The cause of death was bone marrow disease, Bjorn Amelan, his business partner, said.
        Mr. Kelly, who was born in Vicksburg, Miss., was known for the oversize overalls and T-shirts he usually wore. He always refused to give his age, though his friends assumed he was about 40 years old.
        Mr. Kelly ran a boutique in Atlanta before going to Paris in 1980, where he started selling clothes in the street. His specialty was snug shift dresses, which he covered with buttons. Buttons became his trademark.  His first collection was shown in Paris in March 1985. He made each of the styles himself on his portable sewing machine. Bergdorf Goodman Inc. bought the collection, which was shown in the store's windows the next month.
        Even before his first show, Elle magazine had devoted six pages to dresses he had made on his portable Singer. He had a rapid success with his short, snug dresses decorated with bows, and sequined outlines of the Eiffel Tower and watermelon slices.
        Grace Jones, Madonna, Jane Seymour and the Princess of Wales were among the women who wore his clothes. His associates hope to continue his business, with his Paris shop serving as an outlet for the work of new young designers, an assistant said.
        He is survived by his mother, Letha Kelly, of Vicksburg. His companion, Mr. Amelan, was with him when he died.
