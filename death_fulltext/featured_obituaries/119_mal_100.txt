        Jim Karayn, a former public television executive who organized the broadcasts of the Presidential campaign debates in 1976 and the Watergate hearings in 1973, died on Dec. 12 at the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington. Mr. Karayn was 64 and lived in Washington.
        The cause of death was complications from diabetes, Edythe Burch, his sister, said.
        Mr. Karayn helped start the National Public Affairs Center for Television in 1971 and served as its president until 1975. The center, a nonprofit organization, was the main source of public affairs and news programming for the Public Broadcasting Service. In 1973, it carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of the Senate Watergate hearings.
        Mr. Karayn is credited with recruiting several broadcast television reporters for public television, including Robert MacNeil. In 1976, as executive director for the Presidential debates sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Mr. Karayn produced the live broadcasts. The three debates, between Gov. Jimmy Carter and President Gerald R. Ford, were the first since the Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960.
        His professional honors included seven Emmy awards, two George Foster Peabody Broadcasting Awards and an Alfred I. du Pont-Columbia University award in 1973 as a member of the public affairs center for its 1972 election coverage.
        Mr. Karayn was a news producer for NBC before joining the National Educational Television network, part of PBS, in 1963. He was an executive for WETA-TV in Washington, a PBS affiliate, in the 1970's and later was the general manager at WHYY-TV, the Philadelphia affiliate. After leaving WHYY, Mr. Karayn was a consultant and started his own production company, Projects in Democracy.
        A Los Angeles native, Mr. Karayn received a bachelor's degree from the University of Southern California.
        He is survived by his sister, a resident of Los Angeles.
