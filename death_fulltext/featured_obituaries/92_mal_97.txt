        Lord Shackleton, a British Cabinet minister who played a key role in Britain's decision to give up its colonial toehold in southwest Arabia, died on Thursday in Lymington in southern England. He was 83 and lived in London.
        Edward Arthur Alexander Shackleton was Minister Without Portfolio in 1967 when the Labor Government of Harold Wilson sent him as a troubleshooter to Aden, a strategically important British colony on the Arabian peninsula's southern coast.
        Since 1963 Aden had been part of the British-backed Federation of South Arabia, along with nearby Arabian emirates, sultanates and sheikdoms. By late 1967 the federation, with 17 component states, was racked by internal hostilities, despite the presence of thousands of British troops.
        As The Daily Telegraph of London put it on Saturday in summing up Lord Shackleton's career, "It was largely due to Shackleton's patient but quietly forceful diplomacy" that the Wilson Government "was able to announce in November 1967 that British forces had withdrawn from Aden, and that Southern Arabia had become independent."
        The area became Southern Yemen, which merged with Yemen in 1990 to form a single nation.
        Lord Shackleton was also Minister for the Royal Air Force from 1964 to 1967, Deputy Leader of the House of Lords as well as Minister Without Portfolio in 1967 and 1968, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords from 1968 to 1970 and opposition leader in the House of Lords from 1970 to 1974. He became a life peer in 1958 and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1974.
        A son of Ernest Shackleton, a polar explorer, Edward Shackleton studied at Oxford and was a Labor Member of Parliament in the 1940's and 50's.
        He is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Betty Homan, and a daughter.
