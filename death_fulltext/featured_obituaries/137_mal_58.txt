        Jan Gullberg, a Swedish surgeon and anesthesiologist whose fascination with mathematics and science in general led him to write two books whose explanations of rarefied subjects to the layman were widely praised, died on May 21 at the hospital where he worked, near his home in Nordfjordeid, Norway. He was 62.
        The cause was a stroke, his North American publisher, W. W. Norton & Company of New York, said this month in announcing his death.
        Dr. Gullberg, who was born and raised in Sweden, worked as a general surgeon in Sweden. Saudi Arabia, Norway and in the United States, where he spent time at Virginia Mason Hospital in Seattle after earning a medical degree at the University of Lund in 1964.
        Continuing his studies as he practiced, he wrote his first book, an 1,100-page volume in Swedish that gave an overview of basic science.
        It sold more than 8,000 copies, which, in Sweden, is a highly respectable figure for a book of its nature.
        He followed that up with an illustrated, 1,100-page book about mathematics and its history, written in English, ''Mathematics: From the Birth of Numbers'' (1997), which is now in its fifth printing.
        It was a main selection of the Library of Science and an alternate selection of the Book of the Month Club. Dr. Gullberg is survived by his wife, Ann, and their sons, Kamen and Kalin. Also surviving are three children from his earlier marriage to Anne-Marie Hallin, who died in 1983, Par, Karin and Annika.
