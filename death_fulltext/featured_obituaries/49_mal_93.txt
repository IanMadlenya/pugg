        Gyorgy Krasso, a former dissident jailed by the Communists for his role in the 1956 uprising, died today. The state press agency said Mr. Krasso was 58 years old.
        The agency did not report the cause of death, saying only that it followed "a long, grave illness." But Mr. Krasso had a history of heart disease and an editor at the press agency said in a telephone interview that Mr. Krasso had been hospitalized two weeks ago after a heart attack.
        Facing increased police control, Mr. Krasso decided to remain in London after being granted a passport in 1985, and worked as a freelance journalist for the British Broadcasting Corporation and Radio Free Europe. He returned to Hungary in 1989, the last year of Communist rule in his homeland, and set up the Hungarian October Party, a fiercely anti-Communist splinter group unrepresented in Parliament.
        The agency did not indicate if there were any survivors.
