        Denis J. McMahon, a retired Internal Revenue Service official in Manhattan, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
        He suffered a long illness, his family said.
        From 1949 to 1955, Mr. McMahon was in charge of a district covering Manhattan, from 34th Street to the Battery, and Staten Island. Well over a million returns from that area poured into the gloomy old Custom House yearly. Collections ranged from pennies to hundreds of millions of dollars each.
        The filers included giants like the American Telephone & Telegraph Company and the House of Morgan, along with all of New York's principal banks, exchanges and the baronies of Wall Street. Delinquents found Mr. McMahon's signature on their tax liens from Federal Court.
        Resigning in 1955, he said, "I've got a chance to make some money for myself." He did so as a partner in McMahon, Andrews & Company, a management consulting firm, which no longer exists.
        Mr. McMahon was born in Yorkville. He started his career with the Internal Revenue Service in 1934.
        He advanced from deputy collector to division chief and chief field deputy before President Harry S. Truman nominated him as Collector for what was then called New York's Second District. An I.R.S. realignment in 1952 changed his title to District Director.
        Mr. McMahon is survived by his wife of 61 years, Rose Lalis McMahon, and a brother, George, of Flagler Beach, Fla.
