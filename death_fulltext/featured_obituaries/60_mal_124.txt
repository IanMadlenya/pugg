        Allen D. Graves, a former Mobil Oil executive who helped organize the Kuwait National Petroleum Company, died on Friday at his home in Hilton Head, S.C. He was 76 years old.
        He died of bone cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Graves began his career with Mobil as a junior geologist in Colombia and became the chief geologist there in 1948. Two years later, he was transferred to Canada, working in oil exploration in Saskatchewan and Alberta. He returned to South America in 1954 as the general manager for Colombia. He was transferred to New York in 1957 as an assistant executive vice president for Europe, and was named executive vice president for South America in 1959.
        The next year, he was hired as an adviser to help set up the Kuwait National Petroleum Company. He remained in Kuwait until 1967.
        He is survived by his wife, Peggy; a son, Donald, of Tucson, Ariz.; two daughters, Maureen, of Coconut Grove, Fla., and Lorraine, of San Francisco; a brother, Donald, of Costa Rica, and two grandsons.
