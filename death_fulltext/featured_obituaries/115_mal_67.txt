        James F. Fleming, a pioneer in television news who helped start the ''Today'' show on NBC and later produced many award-winning documentaries, died on Aug. 10 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 81.
        After starting his career in radio, Mr. Fleming worked for all three major television networks and also produced specials for public television.
        Among Mr. Fleming's notable works was the 1967 documentary ''Africa,'' on ABC. Narrated by Gregory Peck, it was unusual in its scope: Mr. Fleming and at least six different crews spent a year filming it, and ABC broadcast it in four straight prime-time hours, making it the longest such program of its time in American television. It won wide  critical praise and the Emmy Award as the best news documentary of that season.
        A native of Baraboo, Wis., Mr. Fleming graduated from the University of Chicago in 1938 and moved to New York to attend law school. Instead, he took a job as a CBS radio network announcer; five years later he became a CBS radio correspondent in the Middle East, and then in Moscow.
        NBC hired Mr. Fleming in 1949, and in 1952 the network made him news director and a news announcer on the first ''Today'' show, with Dave Garroway.
        In 1962 and 1963, working for the independent station Channel 5 in New York, he and David Susskind produced ''Festival of Performing Arts.'' Mr. Fleming later rejoined CBS, where he produced a series called ''Woman'' and won a Peabody Award for an episode of ''The Hidden Revolution,'' which he co-produced with Edward R. Murrow.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane; two daughters, Ann Fleming Brown of Schenectady, N.Y., and Susan Fleming Moran of Manhattan; two sons, James F. Jr., of Milwaukee, and Thomas, of Brooklyn; a sister, Kathryn McLaughlin of Chillicothe, Ill., and a brother, Edward J., of Walnut Creek, Calif.
