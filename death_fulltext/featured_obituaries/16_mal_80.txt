        John C. Bullitt, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Kennedy, died of cancer yesterday at his farm in Princeton, N.J. He was 62 years old.
        Mr. Bullitt, a senior partner in the law firm of Shearman and Sterling, served as director of the New Jersey Office of Economic Opportunity, an antipoverty agency, in the 1960's. He was an assistant administrator for East Asia in the Agency for International Development from 1967 to 1969.
        He joined Shearman and Sterling in 1953 as an associate and returned to the firm as a partner in 1969. In 1978 he opened a Hong Kong office and remained there until 1981.
        Mr. Bullitt was responsible for an airlift of American books to Moscow in 1959, after Soviet readers borrowed so many of the books from a bookmobile at the American National Exhibition that the bookmobile had to be closed. After one of the speediest packing jobs in the history of the publishing industry, 2,800 books were flown to the Soviet Union to replenish the exhibit.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith Ogden Bullitt; a son, Thomas, of Boston; a daughter, Clarissa, of Manhattan; a brother, Orville and a sister, Louisa B. Ward, both of New York City; and three stepchildren, Elizabeth L. Cabot of London and Edward O. Cabot and Timothy P. Cabot, both of New York City.
        A funeral service is planned Wednesday at 11 A.M. at Trinity Church in Princeton.
