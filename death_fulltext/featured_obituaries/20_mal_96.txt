        Msgr. Raul del Valle, the Chancellor of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, died of cancer Tuesday at the Archbishop's residence in Manhattan. He was 62 years old and lived at the residence.
        Msgr. del Valle earned a Licentiate in Canon Law at Gregorian University in Rome in 1949. He was ordained a priest in Cuba, his native country, and served his first pastoral assignments there.
        He came to the United States in 1961 and held a number of parish and teaching assignments before becoming pastor of St. Anselm Parish in 1976 and pastor of St. Athanasius Parish in 1980, both in the Bronx. In 1985, the Archbishop, John Cardinal O'Connor, named him to the high-level administrative post of Chancellor.
        Msgr. del Valle was named a papal chamberlain by Pope Pius XII and an honorary prelate by Pope John Paul II. Earlier this year, Pope John Paul conferred on him the honorific prothonotary apostolic, traditionally a position involving the recording of papal events.
        He is survived by a sister, Lydia del Valle de Lopez, and a brother, Manuel, both of Puerto Rico.
