        Bert Remsen, a stage, screen and television actor for some 50 years, died on April 22 at his home in California's San Fernando Valley. He was 74.
        Mr. Remsen, who was born in Glen Cove, N.Y., began his career at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where he studied with Sanford Meisner. He went on to act in summer stock and on Broadway, where he appeared in such shows as ''Diamond Lil'' with Mae West and ''The Rainmaker'' with Geraldine Page.
        After moving to Hollywood, Mr. Remsen soon became a familiar face on television, appearing in dozens of shows including ''Rawhide,'' ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' and ''Dr. Kildare.'' His career was interrupted by an accident in 1964, when he was struck by part of a falling crane while filming an episode of ''No Time for Sergeants.''
        After recovering he decided to become a casting director, which he pursued until 1970 when a friend, the director Robert Altman, persuaded him to take a role in the film ''Brewster McCloud.'' He went on to appear in seven more Altman films, including ''Thieves Like Us.'' He also acted in the films ''Lookin' to Get Out,'' ''Maverick,'' ''Only the Lonely'' and ''Independence Day.'' He recently completed work in two HBO specials, ''Lansky'' and ''Crime of the Century.''
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; two daughters, Ann Manners and Kerry Remsen, both of the San Fernando Valley; a brother, Guy, and two grandchildren.
