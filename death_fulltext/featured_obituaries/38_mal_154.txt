        Robin Harris, a comedian and actor who appeared in the movies ''Do the Right Thing,'' ''Harlem Nights'' and ''House Party,'' was found dead in a hotel room here on Sunday, officials said. He was 36 years old.
        He apparently died in his sleep after giving a comedy show, officials said. An autopsy was scheduled. Mr. Harris was a Chicago native, but moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was 8.
        Mr. Harris's most recent film appearance was as the stern father of a trouble-prone teen-ager in the comedy ''House Party,'' which opened earlier this month. In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby praised Mr. Harris's work for its ''great humor.''
        In Spike Lee's 1989 film, ''Do the Right Thing,'' Mr. Harris played the role of Sweet Dick Willie, one of a trio of middle-aged men who sit under an umbrella on a street corner and comment on the passing scene.
        ''I gave him a lot of latitude to make Sweet Dick funny,'' Mr. Lee said in an interview in The Los Angeles Times last summer. ''I couldn't write that character as funny as Robin could.''
