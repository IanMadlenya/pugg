        Former Mayor John E. (Jack) Reardon, who underwent a heart transplant nearly two years ago, died of heart failure Friday night. He was 45 years old.
        Mr. Reardon entered the University of Kansas Medical Center here early Friday, dizzy and short of breath, and doctors implanted a pacemaker in his chest, said Mary Harrison, a hospital spokeswoman. Mr. Reardon died at 6:50 P.M., she said, adding that doctors would conduct tests to determine the underlying cause of his death.
        He was Mayor when he received a new heart Feb. 18, 1987, at the medical center. He had suffered from his heart's inadequate pumping ability.
        In an interview a year after he received his new heart, Mr. Reardon said the transplant was ''a humbling experience in many ways,'' adding, ''It's not something you think about constantly, but it is something you're aware of on a daily basis and it is amazing.'' A Loss, a Victory, and Death
        Mr. Reardon, a Democrat, served 12 years as Mayor before losing last year to Joseph Steineger. Mr. Reardon said he believed his physical condition was a factor in his defeat. In the general election this month, he was elected to the Wyandotte County Commission.
        Except for the 1987 mayoral election, Mr. Reardon's only election defeat came in 1984, when he lost a campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representives to Jan Meyers.
        Mayor Reardon sought to bring new economic development to Kansas City, Kan., a largely blue-collar town with an aging and declining industrial base.
        One of Mr. Reardon's biggest accomplishments resulted from his years of negotiating with General Motors, which ultimately led to a commitment to build a new plant in the city.
        Mr. Reardon leaves his wife, Helen, a son and a daughter.
