        Thomas Gallagher, a writer whose painstaking research informed nonfiction on great disasters and military heroism and novels that probed the lost lives of bumbling, self-destructive people, died on Saturday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 74 years old.
        He died of a heart attack, said his son, Michael.
        Mr. Gallagher was born in Manhattan in 1918. After graduating from Columbia College in 1941, he served in Iran during World War II as a civilian attached to the Army Corps of Engineers. He then shipped out as a seaman on freighters with the merchant marine, where he began to write.
        His well-received first novel, "The Gathering Darkness" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1952), traced the disintegration of a New York family after it lost its fortune in the stock market crash of 1929.
        Although he continued to write novels, Mr. Gallagher also turned to nonfiction, producing "Fire at Sea" (Rhinehart & Company, 1959), an investigation of the 1934 fire that destroyed the luxury liner Morro Castle off the New Jersey coast. Mr. Gallagher concluded that rather than being an accident, the fire was set by the ship's sociopathic radio officer. The book won the Edgar Allen Poe Award for nonfiction.
        Mr. Gallagher's last novel, "Paddy's Lament" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982), dealt with the Irish potato famine.
        In addition to his son, Mr. Gallagher is survived by his wife, Josephine.
