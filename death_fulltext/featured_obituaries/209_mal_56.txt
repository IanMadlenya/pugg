        Fari Amini, a psychiatrist known for his work linking memory with bonds formed in childhood, died June 13 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. He was 73 and lived in nearby Ross.
        The cause was a heart attack he had several days earlier, his family said.
        Dr. Amini, a professor emeritus still affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco, was a co-author of ''A General Theory of Love'' (Random House, 2000), with two colleagues, Thomas Lewis and Richard Lannon. The book explained how lingering but forgotten impressions, like a smell or sound associated with a person or a positive experience, become embedded in the mind's memory banks, where neurons constantly fire and forge connections. Over time these links are reinforced through repeated exposure, leading to affectional bonds.
        To continue work on these theories, Dr. Amini established the Amini Foundation for the Study of Affect.
        Fariborz Amini was born in Iran and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1953. He received his M.D. at the University of California, San Francisco, and trained at the Neuropsychiatric Institute of the University of Michigan and at the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute.
        He was appointed to the faculty of the institute in 1973 and served as its president in 1981. He was a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, for 37 years.
        Dr. Amini is survived by his wife of 32 years, Elizabeth Ann Cunningham Amini; six daughters, Dr. Kim S. Frederickson, Lisa R. Amini-Nicolopoulos, Dawn P. Shaw, Ariana S. Amini, Christina M. Amini and Elita F. Amini; a brother, Hossein, and a sister, Aghdas Davarkhan; and seven grandchildren.
