        William Robertson, a former speak-easy operator who owned Snuffy's Steak House in Scotch Plains, N.J., died Dec. 19 at the Holmes Regional Medical Center in Melbourne, Fla. He was 89 years old and lived in Melbourne.
        He died of respiratory difficulties, his daughter Joan Hewitt said.
        During Prohibition, Mr. Robertson ran speak-easies in Mountainside, Garwood and Scotch Plains. When Prohibition was repealed, he opened what eventually became Snuffy's Steak House.
        Mr. Robertson also owned shrimp boats in Florida and several hotels. He sold the restaurant in 1972, when he retired.
        He is survived by two daughters, Joan Hewitt of Scotch Plains and Jean Goldstein of Melbourne; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
