        Kenneth Gerald Peters, former chairman and president of Austin Nichols & Company, importers and distributors of wines and liquors, died on Saturday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 78 and lived in Manhasset.
        The cause of death was a heart attack following a stroke, said his brother, C. Brooks Peters.
        Mr. Peters joined Austin Nichols in 1946. He became its president in 1969 and chairman in 1975. During his years at the company, Austin Nichols introduced Wild Turkey bourbon and began importing Glenfiddich whisky and Metaxa brandy. He retired in 1979 and became a consultant to the Fleischmann Distilling Company.
        Mr. Peters was the chairman of the National Association of Alcoholic Beverage Importers from 1975 to 1976.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Peters graduated from Yale in 1936, when he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve. He was called to duty in 1940 and served until 1946. He had reached the rank of lieutenant colonel by the time he left the service.
        In addition to his brother, of Dallastown, Pa., Mr. Peters is survived by three sons, Michael R., of Napa, Calif., Kenneth G., of San Diego, and E. Brooks, of Manhattan; a daughter, Constance C., of Bronxville, N.Y., and a granddaughter. His wife, Muriel Reno, died last month.
