        James J. Dwyer, a former New York State parole administrator and a jail, police and fire official in Westchester County, died on Dec. 17 at Martin Memorial Hospital in Stuart, Fla. He was 85 years old and lived in Stuart.
        He died of complications from lung cancer, his family said.

Then he was the Public Safety Commissioner for the City of White Plains from 1963 to 1975, in charge of its Police and Fire Departments.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Gertrude Kirk; three sons, James Jr., of White Plains, William, of Springfield, Va., and Dennis, of Tarrytown, N.Y.; a daughter, Teresita O'Leary of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
