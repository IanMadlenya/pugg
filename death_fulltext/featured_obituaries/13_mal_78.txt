        Justice Cotton, who had served as a judge in the New York court system for 16 years, was elected to a 14-year term on the Supreme Court in 1975. His term was to end Dec. 31, 1989. He was an acting justice for three years, beginning in 1973. A Democrat from the Bronx, he was first appointed to the bench as a Civil Court judge in 1972 by Mayor John V. Lindsay.
        Justice Cotton was considered an authority on real-estate law and much of his case work concerned tax assessment and condemnation of property matters.
        Before his appointment to the bench, Justice Cotton spent nine years as law secretary to Francis T. Murphy, when Judge Murphy was successively a Supreme Court justice and later a judge of the Appellate Dvision of State Supreme Court.
        He is survived by his wife, Janet; a daughter, Lauren, and a son, Howard, both of Manhattan.
