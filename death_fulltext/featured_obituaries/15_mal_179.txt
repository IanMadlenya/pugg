        Irving Kolodin, an American music critic and historian of the Metropolitan Opera, died yesterday in a Manhattan nursing home. He was 80 years old and had suffered a stroke a year ago.
        Over the course of a career that spanned half a century, Mr. Kolodin wrote prolifically about a spectrum of music that stretched from Mozart to jazz. During his tenure as the music critic for The Saturday Review, from 1947 to 1982, he was one of the most influential critics in the country, particularly during the 1950's and 60's.
        Mr. Kolodin was one of the first American critics to pay extensive attention to phonograph records. His first book of record reviews, ''A Guide to Recorded Music,'' appeared in 1941; it was followed by ''Mozart on Records'' (1942), ''The Saturday Review Home Book of Recorded Music and Sound Reproduction'' (1952, revised in 1956), and ''Orchestral Music'' (1955, part of a three-volume survey of long-playing recordings published by Alfred A. Knopf).
        It was the publication in 1936 of ''The Metropolitan Opera: 1883-1935'' that first brought Mr. Kolodin to public notice. A second edition, titled ''The Story of the Metropolitan Opera, 1883-1950,'' was published in 1953. It was further updated in 1966 and Mr. Kolodin was working on an edition tracing the first 100 years of the troupe when he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1987. Journalist and Teacher
        His other books include ''The Continuity of Music: A History of Influence'' (1969), ''The Interior Beethoven'' (1975), ''The Opera Omnibus'' (1976) and ''In Quest of Music'' (1980).
        ''His style combines a baroque expansiveness with pithy journalistic acuity, and is informed by a wide knowledge of music and the business of music,'' Patrick J. Smith wrote of Mr. Kolodin in the New Grove Dictionary of American Music.
        Irving Kolodin was born in Manhattan on Feb. 21, 1908. He grew up in Newark, where his father owned a book and stationery store. He studied music from an early age.
        He joined The New York Sun in 1932 and remained with the paper until 1950, eventually becoming its chief critic. He wrote program notes for the New York Philharmonic from 1953 to 1958. During the 1950's, he assembled several albums for RCA Victor, including a ''Critic's Choice'' album and a five-record set titled ''50 Years of Great Operatic Singing.'' In 1970, he selected the classical music for the first official White House music library.
        From 1968 until 1986 he taught criticism at the Juilliard School. After the original Saturday Review folded in 1982, Mr. Kolodin wrote freelance articles for other publications.
        He was married from 1936 to 1970 to the former Irma Rose Levy and is survived by two stepchildren, Susan Zeckendorf and William Zeckendorf Jr.
