        David Leon Chandler, a journalist and author, died on Sunday at his home in Denver. He was 56.
        The cause was complications from diabetes, said his literary agent, Jed Mattes.
        Mr. Chandler's books include "Brothers in Blood" (1975), a study of organized crime; "The Natural Superiority of Southern Politicians" (1977); "Henry Flagler: The Astonishing Life and Times of the Visionary Robber Baron Who Founded Florida" (1986), and "The Binghams of Louisville" (1988). In June, Morrow will publish "The Jefferson Conspiracies: A President's Role in the Assassination of Meriwether Lewis."
        Mr. Chandler was born in Covington, Ky. He attended Boston College but failed to graduate after betting his tuition money on a losing horse. After serving in the merchant marine and the Navy, he found work in 1959 as a journalist with The News-Herald in Panama City, Fla. He headed the investigative team there that won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1962 for a series of articles on political corruption and racketeering involving the local sheriff's office. Ran for Governor
        After working as a general assignment reporter for The States-Item in New Orleans from 1962 to 1964, Mr. Chandler became a contract writer for Life magazine, initially as part of a team assigned to investigate the Kennedy assassination. In 1971 he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Louisiana, hoping to prove that a candidate could win the governorship without taking any campaign contributions.
        From 1972 until his death, apart from brief stints as a reporter for The Ledger-Star in Norfolk, Va., and for The Associated Press, he wrote freelance magazine articles and books.
        He is survived by his third wife, Mary Voelz Chandler, and four children by his previous marriages, which ended in divorce: a daughter, Bayou, of New Orleans, and three sons, David Michael, of Wollaston, Mass.; Clayton, of Boston, and John Henry, of Costa Mesa, Calif.
