        Lee Wright, an award-winning designer of men's fashions, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. He was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan. Mr. Wright, a former actor, died of pneumonia, his family said.
        Mr. Wright was best known for his popularly priced line of European-style clothing - definite but unexaggerated shoulders, slightly wider lapels and a long lean line - sold through J. C. Penney stores since 1982. He won the Coty Award in 1979 and the Cutty Sark Award for outstanding menswear design in 1981.
        ''I design for men of responsibility, sensibility and a clear insight into their own individuality,'' Mr. Wright said at the Coty ceremony. ''I am that man and, as a designer, I like to believe he's my audience.''
        Earlier in his career he worked as a designer for Bill Blass Menswear under the Lanerossi label.
        Mr. Wright was on the board of God's Love We Deliver, a group that delivers meals to the homebound with AIDS.
        Surviving are his wife, Diane; a son, Alexander; his parents, Jeanne and Robert Wright of Fort Myers, Fla.; two brothers, Richard, of Dallas, and Paul, of London, and a sister, Patricia Pisani, of Denver.
