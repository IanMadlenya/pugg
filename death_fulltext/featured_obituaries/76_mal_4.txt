        Dr. William B. Ober, a retired pathologist and author, died on Tuesday in Washington. He lived in Tenafly, N.J., and was 72.
        Dr. Ober was attending a meeting when he collapsed after an aortal aneurysm, his family said. He died at Sibley Memorial Hospital.
        A native of Boston, Dr. Ober graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1941 and received his medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine five years later. He completed his internship and residency at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston and Boston Lying-In Hospital.
        He was an outspoken advocate of a woman's right to choose an abortion, and wrote about the issue early on, when statutes, often dating from the 18th and 19th centuries, made the procedure illegal in this and many other countries. He also appeared as an expert witness at hearings and in court. Essays and Articles on Medicine
        Dr. Ober wrote "Bottoms Up! A Pathologist's Essays on Medicine and the Humanities" (Southern Illinois Press, 1987).
        "It consists of 14 brilliant essays on such exotic and arcane topics as infertility in the Bible and how to illustrate a dirty book," wrote Richard Selzer, an author-surgeon, in The New York Times Book Review.
        An earlier volume, "Boswell's Clap" (Southern Illinois Press, 1979), analyzed the afflictions of literary figures. Dr. Ober was the author or co-author of about 200 papers and articles with titles ranging from "Did Socrates Die of Hemlock Poisoning?" to "Carcinosarcoma of the Ovary."
        He taught pathology at various institutions, most recently at New York Medical College and New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry. He was a past director of the department of pathology at Hackensack Medical Center and a former associate medical examiner for Bergen County.
        Dr. Ober is survived by his wife of 40 years, the former Rhoda Schott; a daughter, Elaine M. Ober of Brookline, Mass., and a son, Stephen F., of Clinton, N.J.
