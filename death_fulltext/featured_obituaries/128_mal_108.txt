        Vahakn Nigogosian, a builder and restorer of stringed instruments who operated the Stradivarius Studios on West 57th Street for many years, died on Sept. 20 at his home in Bayside, Queens. He was 87.
        Mr. Nigogosian was born in Istanbul in 1910, and studied violin making there with Karekin Kurkjian. He made his first violin when he was 15 and moved to Paris four years later to continue his studies as an apprentice to Marcel Vatelot. In 1958 he moved to New York, where he worked at the Rembert Wurlitzer shop as an assistant to Simone Sacconi.
        Mr. Nigogosian opened his Stradivarius Studios in Manhattan in 1969, and since 1984 he had worked at his studio in Bayside. His clients included the violinists Jacques Thibaud, Zino Francescatti, Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin and Itzhak Perlman and the cellists Pablo Casals and Pierre Fournier.
        Besides making and restoring instruments, Mr. Nigogosian taught his craft to two generations of assistants in New York and as the director of the Stringed Instrument Restoration Workshop at Oberlin College in Ohio from 1986 to 1996.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, Aram, of Philadelphia, and Hayg, of Phoenix, and a brother, Dr. Goryun Nigogosyan, of Corning, N.Y.
