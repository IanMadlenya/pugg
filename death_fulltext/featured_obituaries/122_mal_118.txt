        Lane Dwinell, a two-term Republican Governor of New Hampshire in the 1950's and later a member of the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations, died on Thursday at his home in Hanover, N.H. He was 90.
        The cause was heart failure, a relative said.
        Mr. Dwinell, Governor from 1955 to 1959, was known for his shrewd application of accounting and budgeting principles to state government and for using some of the savings he achieved to pay raises for state employees, seeking to reduce what he called an excessive and costly turnover of state employees.
        After being a businessman in Lebanon, N.H., for many years, he got his start in politics by being elected to the town budget committee, then worked his way up to president of the State Senate and House Speaker before becoming Governor.
        In 1959, he was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration and served until 1961. He returned to the family-owned clothing-manufacturing business, Carter & Churchill. In 1969, he was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to lead the Agency for International Development and served until 1971.
        Mr. Dwinell graduated from Dartmouth College.
        His wife, the former Elizabeth Cushman, died in October.
