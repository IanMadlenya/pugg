        Charles H. Greenthal, an early leader in the real-estate management field, died on Sunday at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of emphysema, his brother, Leonard, said.
        Mr. Greenthal left high school to enter the real-estate business during the Depression. In 1938 he was a co-founder of Herbert Charles & Company, and after serving in the Army in World War II, he returned to the concern.
        In 1958 he resigned as executive vice president and founded Charles H. Greenthal & Company to specialize in renting and managing luxury apartment buildings. His company became one of the largest managing concerns in Manhattan and handled almost 100 apartment buildings.
        His brother Leonard, who lives Manhattan, is his sole survivor.
