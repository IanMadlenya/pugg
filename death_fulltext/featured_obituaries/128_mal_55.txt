        Paul W. Brechler, the youngest athletic director in Big Ten history and later the first commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference, died last Saturday at his home in Denver. He was 86 years old.
        In 1947, when he was 37, Brechler was named athletic director at the University of Iowa. In 1960, he left to become commissioner of the Skyline Conference. A year later, the Western Athletic Conference was formed with six members -- Wyoming, New Mexico, Utah, Brigham Young, Arizona and Arizona State -- and he was its commissioner from 1962 through 1969. He served as athletic director at California until 1972. He also presided over the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference from 1976 to 1990.
        He is survived by his wife, Wanda, and two sons, Steve and Larry.
