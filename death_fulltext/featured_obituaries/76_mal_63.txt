        Peter John Zondervan, a founder of one of the nation's largest publishers of religious texts, died on Thursday at the St. Andrews Estates North retirement community in Boca Raton, Fla. He was 84 and lived at St. Andrews.
        His wife, Mary, said the cause of death was complications from a stroke suffered four years ago.
        In 1931, Mr. Zondervan and his brother Bernard founded Zondervan Publishing House in Grandville, Mich. The company began publishing Bibles and other religious books, then expanded to publish printed music, records and best sellers like "Delorean," by John Z. DeLorean, the automobile entrepreneur who became a born-again Christian after his arrest on drug-trafficking charges.
        When Mr. Zondervan retired in 1988, HarperCollins, a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, acquired the publishing company for $50 million. Today it is one of the world's largest publishers of English-language religious works.
        Mr. Zondervan, who was born in Paterson, N.J., was an active leader of Gideons International, the Christian Evangelical group.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mary B. Schouter of Norwich, Vt., and two sons, Dr. Robert Zondervan of Clairmont, Calif., and William Zondervan of Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla.
