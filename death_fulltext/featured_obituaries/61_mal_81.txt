        Jerome Weinstein, a builder and real-estate developer, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 63 years old and also had a home in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
        Mr. Weinstein died of complications from a stroke, his family said.
        He was born in New York City and attended Vanderbilt University and New York University. In 1950 he joined the Godfrey M. Weinstein Company, a Manhattan building and real-estate business founded by his father in 1927. For many years, the younger Mr. Weinstein was the company's president.
        Among his major projects was the co-development of 1700 Broadway, a 42-story, 550,000-square-foot office building between 53d and 54th Streets in Manhattan. He also worked on One Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, a 50-story, 750,000-square-foot office tower on Second Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets near the United Nations, and on a 120,000-square-foot office building at 287 Bowman Avenue in Purchase, N.Y.
        In addition to his building projects, Mr. Weinstein also operated Sunbelt Farms in Alabama, raising cattle and growing soybeans, wheat and corn.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Carol Bernstein; a son, David, of Mamaroneck; a daughter, Patricia, of Piedmont, Calif.; a sister, Phoebe Chason of Harrison, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
