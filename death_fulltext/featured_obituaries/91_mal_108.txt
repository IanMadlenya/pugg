        Maxwell Hahn, an executive of the Field Foundation in New York from 1941 to 1965, died on Wednesday at the Mount San Antonio Gardens retirement home in Claremont, Calif. He was 94.
        The cause was a stroke, said his son, Philip M. Hahn.
        A graduate of Oberlin College, Mr. Hahn worked briefly as a journalist, then in public relations for colleges and hospitals. From 1929 to 1939 he was the director of public education for the Associated Hospital Service of New York and the United Hospital Fund.
        As an adviser on charitable giving to Marshall Field 3d, the Chicago banker and publisher of The Chicago Sun-Times, Mr. Hahn helped form the Field Foundation in 1941 and retired as its director. The foundation, which shut down in 1989, supported health programs for children, programs that sought to improve race relations and other programs devoted to international peace.
        Mr. Hahn is survived by his wife of 71 years, Irene, of Claremont; a daughter, Carolyn Jones of Exeter, Calif.; his son, of Riverside, Conn., and five grandchildren.
