        Leo D. Goulet, president and chief executive officer of the Gerber Products Company, died Sunday after suffering a heart attack while playing golf near his home in Fremont, Mich. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Goulet was named chief executive officer of the baby food company in May. He had been expected to be named chairman of the company at its annual shareholders' meeting July 22.
        Mr. Goulet, a native of Panama, joined Gerber in 1955 as assistant manager in the export department. In 1968, he moved to Fremont to direct the company's Latin American operations. He was elected to the board of directors in July 1982 and named president and chief operating officer in February 1983.
        Last year, to curtail public fears resulting from several reports about glass shards in Gerber's baby food, Mr. Goulet appeared in television commercials with his infant granddaughter.
        Mr. Goulet is survived by his wife, Carol; two daughters, Beverly Goulet of Dallas and Stephanie Alonzo of Mesquite, Tex.; a granddaughter, Christine Alonzo, and two sisters, Macel Thomson and Rita Goulet.
