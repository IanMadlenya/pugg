        Craig J. Davidson, a community advocate and founding executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 37 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his companion, Michael Valentini.
        As executive director of the homosexual-rights group from 1987 until last year, when he stepped down for health reasons, Mr. Davidson sought to correct what the group considered offensive and insensitive depictions of gay people.
        In a widely publicized incident last year, the group called for the suspension of the CBS News commentator Andy Rooney because of remarks he made about homosexuals during a broadcast.
        Mr. Davidson graduated from Harvard in 1977 and from Harvard Law School in 1981. He worked as a litigator with the New York City firm of Webster & Sheffield, and later practiced corporate-finance law at the firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.
        Mr. Davidson left the legal profession to serve without salary as the alliance's executive director, Mr. Valentini said, shepherding the organization through a period of growth.
        From 1987 until 1990, Mr. Davidson was chairman of the Council of New York Law Associates, an organization that provides free legal advice to community-based groups.
        He is survived by his parents, Donald and Jean Davidson of Bellevue, Wash., and a sister, Kathryn, of Seattle.
