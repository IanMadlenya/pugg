        William Edgett Smith, a journalist for Time magazine for 35 years, died on Thursday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.
        He was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan. He died of carcenoid syndrome, a rare cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Smith became a central witness at a libel trial in 1985, defending an article he wrote about Ariel Sharon, the former Israeli Defense Minister. The jury found that the article had false and defamatory passages suggesting that Mr. Sharon had encouraged Phalangists who massacred hundreds of Palestinians. The jurors also criticized the correspondent who supplied the disputed information to Mr. Smith.
        But the jury acquitted Time, because the magazine's writers and editors did not have serious doubts about the accuracy of the article when they published it, a legal standard in proving libel against public figures. After the verdict, both sides claimed vindication.
        Mr. Smith was born in Pasadena, Calif., and grew up in Los Angeles. He graduated from Occidental College in 1953 and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism in 1954.
        At Time he was a reporter and a bureau chief. He became a senior writer at Time headquarters in Manhattan, specializing in foreign affairs and writing many cover articles. Later, he became an editor.
        Mr. Smith is survived by his wife of 16 years, the former Genevieve Wilson, and their daughter, Caroline.
