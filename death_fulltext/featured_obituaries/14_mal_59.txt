        John Duncan (Jock) Semple, who was involved wih the Boston Marathon for six decades but will always be remembered for chasing down a woman who entered illegally in 1967, died today. He was 84 years old.
        Mr. Semple had been suffering from cancer of the liver and pancreas, according to a niece, Nan Small.
        In that 1967 marathon, Mr. Semple, then the race director, chased after Katherine Switzer, who had been given a number for the race after using only her first initial on the entry blank. The race had not yet been opened to women.
        After spotting the runner, Mr. Semple climbed down off the administrators' bus, ran after her and grabbed the top of her number before he was hit with a body block by a friend of the runner.
        She was thrown out of the race and the photo of Mr. Semple ripping at the number was transmitted around the world.
        Mr. Semple was a physical therapist for the Boston Bruins and the Boston Celtics for more than 40 years and was also a trainer for Olympic athletes.
        He was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on Oct. 26, 1903, and emigrated to the United States in 1921 to look for work as a cabinetmaker in Philadelphia. He moved to the Boston area in 1930, one year after running in his first Boston Marathon.
        He had his training room and office at the Boston Garden and was the Celtics' masseur from 1947-64 and officially the Bruins' therapist starting in 1971, but he was affiliated with the team from the 1950's.
        Mr. Semple trained the United States Olympic hockey team in 1948 and 1952. He also worked with Olympic bobsledders, skiers and skaters over the years.
        He ran in more than 100 marathons, and was instrumental in the rise of the 26-mile-385-yard Boston road race over the years, including the implementation of qualifying times in 1970 and the formal admission of female runners in 1972.
        Mr. Semple's wife, Elizabeth, died four years ago. The couple had no children.
