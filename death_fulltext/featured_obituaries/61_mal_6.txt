        William L. Weissel, a former assistant manager of the New York Philharmonic and executive secretary to its board, died on Wednesday at Doctor's Hospital. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from pneumonia, said his wife, Carmine.
        Mr. Weissel became assistant manager of the Philharmonic in 1962, after three years as manager of the Little Orchestra Society. Before that, he was an operations manager at the WQXR radio station.
        He was born in Vienna and received a Doctor of Law degree there. He worked in law firms in Vienna, London and Paris, and after coming to the United States in 1938 joined the brokerage of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith.
        He became executive secretary of the New York Philharmonic's board in 1970. He held this position until his retirement seven years later. He was also a director of the American-Portuguese Cultural Society.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a sister, Maria, of England.
