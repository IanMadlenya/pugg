He directed ''Melinda,'' a 1972 melodrama, and produced and directed ''Bim,'' a 1976 film on colonial Trinidad. His final film, ''Obeah,'' is to be released this year.
        He and his wife, Suzanne, worked in Trinidad and Tobago for 10 years, until two years ago, to establish a Caribbean film and recording center. He made numerous documentaries and short features there and, as he had done in the United States, trained people for film careers.
        Mr. Robertson was born in Brooklyn, of Jamaican parents. He started working in films when he was 17 years old. In 1982, he was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame.
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Robertson is survived by a son, Antonio, and a daughter, Anna.
