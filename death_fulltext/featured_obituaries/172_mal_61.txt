        Murray Murdoch, the last survivor of the original New York Rangers of 1926-27 and later the Yale hockey coach for 27 years, died yesterday at Georgetown Memorial Hospital in South Carolina. He was 96.
        Murdoch played 11 seasons for the Rangers, including the team's first 574 games. For the first season, Lester Patrick, the coach and general manager, brought Murdoch to Madison Square Garden along with luminaries like Frank Boucher, the brothers Bill and Bun Cook and Ching Johnson.
        The Rangers were an instant box-office success at the Garden, and in their second season they won the Stanley Cup, the National Hockey League's championship prize. In that era, teams had only 13 players and often used only 10 in 60-minute games. Murdoch was a stalwart on the second line.
        In the 1928 cup finals against the Montreal Maroons, the 44-year-old Patrick was pressed into service in the middle of the second game as the Ranger goalie because of an injury to Lorne Chabot. The Rangers won, 2-1, in overtime and the game became a part of N.H.L. lore because Patrick had not played for 10 years and had never played in goal.
        Years later, Murdoch recalled, ''Lester really did not have to do too much because every time a Maroon came across the blue line we knocked him down.''
        Murdoch, Boucher, the Cook brothers and Johnson helped win another Stanley Cup in 1933.
        John Murray Murdoch was born on May 19, 1904, in Lucknow, Ontario. In 1924, he earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Manitoba. After two years of minor league hockey, he joined the Rangers as a 5-foot-10, 180-pound left wing. When Murdoch retired in 1937, he had 84 goals and 108 assists in 508 regular-season games and 9 goals and 12 assists in 56 playoff games.
        In 27 seasons as Yale's coach, Murdoch had 13 winning teams, two Ivy League champions and the third-place team in the 1952 national tournament. His teams won 278 games, a Yale record until Tim Taylor broke it last winter. After he retired as coach, he served seven years as an athletics administrator at Yale.
        Three of his Yale skaters -- Fred Pearson and Terry Van Ingen in 1948 and Jack Morrison in 1968 -- became Olympians. None of his players reached the N.H.L., but three became owners: Northrup Knox, co-founder of the Buffalo Sabres; Bruce Norris of the Detroit Red Wings; and Gordon Ritz, an original partner of the Minnesota North Stars.
        After retiring from Yale, Murdoch continued to live in Hamden, Conn., outside New Haven. With Lynn Patrick, a Ranger teammate and Lester Patrick's son, he formed and nourished a peewee hockey league.
        Six months ago, Murdoch moved to Pawleys Island, S.C., between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, to live with his daughter, Joan Troostwyk, his only direct survivor. His wife, the former Marie Heinrich, died in 1974.
        The easygoing Murdoch, whose humor always prevailed, was popular with his Yale players. In 1994, more than 100 honored him at a 90th birthday dinner in New York.
