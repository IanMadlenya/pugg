        Elly Annie Schneider, who was known for many years in the circus world and on the big screen as Tiny Earles, then Tiny Doll, and who played one of the Munchkins in ''The Wizard of Oz,'' died here on Sept. 6. She was 90.
        Her death was reported by Marlene Grunewald, a longtime friend who took care of her.
        Ms. Schneider was born in Stolpen, Germany, in 1914, the youngest of nine children. She came to the United States in 1925 to join two sisters and a brother, all of short stature. Ms. Schneider herself was 39 inches tall and never weighed more than 46 pounds. She became an American citizen at 21.
        At first the siblings in the United States used the name Earles, the last name of the man who brought them to America. They changed it to Doll after Mr. Earles died.
        Before retiring in the mid-1950's, the Doll family -- Harry, Grace, Daisy and Tiny -- performed with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. They appeared in several films, among them a Laurel and Hardy short, ''Sailors, Beware!'' in 1927, and the cult classic ''Freaks'' in 1932.
        The family moved here in 1934. All four siblings traveled to California to appear in ''The Wizard of Oz.''
        Ms. Schneider, the last of the Doll family, left no immediate survivors. Until two months ago, she would entertain her many friends by singing songs from ''The Wizard of Oz'' and her circus shows.
