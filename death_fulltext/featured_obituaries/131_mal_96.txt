        William B. Arthur, a former editor of Look magazine, died Dec. 10 at Harborside Healthcare in Naples, Fla. He was 83.
        The cause of death was cancer, said a son, William B. Arthur Jr.
        Mr. Arthur joined Look in 1946 in its Washington bureau and he remained at the magazine for 26 years until it ceased publication in 1971. He moved to the New York offices in 1949 and served in several positions before he was appointed editor in 1966.
        He started his journalism career at The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky., after he graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1937. He was involved with several national journalism groups and was president of Sigma Delta Chi from 1968 to 1969. The organization is now the Society of Professional Journalists.
        Mr. Arthur is survived by his wife, Frances, of Naples; two sons, William, of McLean, Va., and Richard H., of Slippery Rock, Pa., and four grandchildren.
