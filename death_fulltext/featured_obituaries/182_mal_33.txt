        Ronald L. Freed, a classical music publishing executive, died on Feb. 20 in Miami. He was 64 and lived in Miami Beach and New York.
        The cause was a brain hemorrhage, said Sean Marino, a friend and colleague and the executor of Mr. Freed's estate.
        Mr. Freed was the president of the European American Music Distributors Corporation, which represents Universal Edition, Schott and many other major European publishers of classical music. The company licenses performance and recording rights for the works of many 20th-century composers, including Stravinsky, Pierre Boulez, Krzysztof Penderecki and Carl Orff.
        Some of the company's most popular properties, like Orff's ''Carmina Burana'' and songs by Kurt Weill, are licensed widely, particularly in film and on television commercials, and earn millions of dollars a year in royalties.
        Mr. Freed was born in Tulsa, Okla., and studied singing at the New England Conservatory and the Juilliard School. At his first job in the publishing business, at the Peer-Southern company in New York, he edited some scores by Charles Ives and worked closely with many composers.
        In 1977 he was sought out to be the chief of the new European American company. It was first based in Clifton, N.J., moved to Paoli, Pa., and after making a deal with Warner Brothers Publishing, recently moved to Miami.
        Mr. Freed was the agent for Lotte Lenya, Weill's wife, toward the end of her life, and as the agent for the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music he came to be involved with Weill's legacy. He served four terms as the president of the Music Publishers Association and in other trade organizations, and was a board member of the Charles Ives Society.
        He is survived by a sister, Dorothy Furman of Houston.
