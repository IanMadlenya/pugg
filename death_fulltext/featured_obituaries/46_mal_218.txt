        Wladyslaw Cardinal Rubin, a Polish-born prelate who headed the Congregation for Eastern Churches of the Vatican, died today, church officials said. He was 73 years old.
        The Vatican did not give the cause of death.
        Cardinal Rubin was ordained in 1946 and became a bishop 18 years later. He was responsible for the pastoral care of Poles living abroad.
        He was elevated to Cardinal in 1979 and also served as secretary general of the Synod of Bishops.
        His congregation dealt with churches of the Eastern rite, which have liturgies and practices different from the Roman Catholic Church's but acknowledge the Pope as their leader.
