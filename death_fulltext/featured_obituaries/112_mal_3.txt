        Itzhak J. Karpman, who spent his life helping to chronicle Jewish history and achievements, died on Tuesday at his home on Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He was 82.
        His wife, Esther, said the cause was lung cancer.
        Mr. Karpman, a native of Warsaw, where he became a Zionist youth leader, went to Palestine in 1936 and came to the United States 10 years later as director of the World Confederation of General Zionists, the largest international Zionist organization.
        He held the post until the early 1950's, when he conceived the idea of publishing a compendium of Jewish men and women of accomplishment. After obtaining the rights to the name from the publisher of "Who's Who in America," he brought out the first "Who's Who in Jewry" in 1955.
        Although the reference work continued to be published until 1978, Mr. Karpman relinquished day-to-day control in 1959, when he was enlisted by the Zionist leader Nahum Goldmann to help complete and translate into English the 16-volume  Encyclopedia of Judaica, which Dr. Goldmann began in Germany in 1922.
        Mr. Karpman, who lived in Israel for several years, remained with the project until 1967, when he became director of the Encyclopedia Judaica Research Foundation in the United States, serving as its executive director until 1978.
        Working out of his Manhattan apartment, Mr. Karpman remained active in publishing reference works on Jewish history and culture. He had been on the editorial board of the Standard Jewish Encyclopedia since 1957, and until his final illness, he had been working on an Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion for Oxford University Press.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Dahlia Japhet of Putnam Valley, N.Y., and Diana Karpman of Lund, Sweden; a son, Daniel, of Longmeadow, Mass., and five grandchildren.
