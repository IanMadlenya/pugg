        Rabbi David Schudrich, director of Jewish chaplaincy services of the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Washington, died last Thursday at his home in Silver Spring, Md., at the age of 61.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Rabbi Schudrich, a native of Manhattan, was a graduate of Yeshiva University and was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary. He was an Air Force chaplain in Alaska and led congregations at synagogues in Patchogue, L.I., Woodbury, N.J., and New Orleans before moving in 1978 to Washington, where he organized the federation's chaplaincy services. The chaplains visit more than 35 hospitals, 70 nursing homes, six prisons and other institutions.
        During his career Rabbi Schudrich was responsible for several innovative programs, including one on counseling for AIDS patients at the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington and training for rabbis serving at the Jewish Hospice there.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Doris Goldfarb; three sons, Rabbi Michael Schudrich of Manhattan and Nathaniel and Alexander, both of Silver Spring; a daughter, Brynna, of Manhattan; a sister, Sylvia Pfeffer of Baltimore, and two grandchildren.
