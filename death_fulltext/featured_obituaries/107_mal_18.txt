        Leon McQuay, a former New York Giants running back who played in the Canadian, National and United States Football Leagues, died on Wednesday in Tampa, Fla. He was 45.
        The cause of death apparently was a heart attack, said his mother, Margarete  McQuay. She said her son, an ordained minister, was bothered for several years with health problems related to high blood pressure and blood sugar.
        McQuay starred at the University of Tampa before joining the Toronto Argonauts of the C.F.L., where he played in a losing effort in the 1971 Grey Cup game. Drafted by the Giants in 1973, he played one season for them in 1974, starting when the two runners ahead of him, Ron Johnson and Doug Kotar, were injured. For the season, he rushed 55 times for 240 yards and 1 touchdown. He also caught 5 passes for 59 yards.
        McQuay was traded to the New England Patriots and played for them in 1975. He tried to latch on to various teams after that, playing for the Tampa Bay Bandits of the U.S.F.L. in 1982.
        Besides his mother, he is survived by his wife, Ethel Ricks McQuay; four children from previous marriages, Leon Jr., Matthew, Robert and Bobby; two brothers, and a sister.
