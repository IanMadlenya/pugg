        Barry Martin, a modern dancer who turned to a career in choreography after an accident made him a quadriplegic, died on Feb. 6 at his home in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was apparently heart failure, said a friend, Valerie Gladstone.
        Born in New York City, Mr. Martin trained at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center and received a degree in dance and sociology from the State University of New York at Purchase. While on tour in South Africa in 1983 with the English dance company Hot Gossip, he was seriously injured in an automobile crash. Mr. Martin, who was black, was refused transportation in a whites-only ambulance and was denied treatment in a hospital he was taken to by car. His spinal cord was apparently severed during the transfer to another hospital.
        Mr. Martin eventually returned to New York and began to choreograph in 1985, from a wheelchair, and earned a master's degree in arts administration from New York University. He formed a company he called Déjà Vu Dance Theater because, he said, dance was something he now saw again in a new way. He choreographed for his own and other troupes.
        Mr. Martin, who taught dance privately and tutored children in the New York City public school system, had recently established a children's dance workshop whose members were drawn from the Ailey school, Dance Theater of Harlem and the School of American Ballet. At the time of his death, he was studying for a second master's degree at New York University, focusing on disabilities and the arts.
        Mr. Martin is survived by his mother, Daisy, and a sister, Hilary, both of New York, and a brother, Lionel, of Los Angeles.
