        Tibor Fabian, a founder of Mathematica Inc., a leading economics and public policy research institute in Princeton, N.J., died on Saturday at the age of 74. The cause of death was heart failure after a long illness, his son, Jonathan Fabian, said.
        Mr. Fabian, an economist, founded Mathematica in 1961 with several other Princeton mathematicians and economists. The company performed the first economic analysis of the performing arts and used game theory to analyze disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union. It also produced several software products that were used in I.B.M. mainframe computers, prompting Martin Marietta to buy Mathematica in 1983. At that time Mr. Fabian was the company's president.
        He is survived by his wife, Dorothy, and two sons, Timothy, of Pittsburgh, and Jonathan, of New York.
