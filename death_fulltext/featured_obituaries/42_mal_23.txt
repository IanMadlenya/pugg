        Mortimer H. Gold, a philanthropist who produced variety shows, circuses, carnivals and athletic events to benefit charitable organizations in Queens, died yesterday at Jamaica Hospital. He was 91 years old and lived in Jamaica Estates. He died after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Gold produced his first show in 1919, starring Jimmy Durante, at the old Fox Jamaica Theater. It raised $450 to buy X-Ray equipment for Jamaica Hospital. Other shows featured such then-unknown performers as Jackie Gleason and Red Skelton.
        He was credited with having raised millions of dollars for hospitals, schools and other nonprofit organizations. Although confined to a wheelchair for the last few years, he continued his activity on behalf of charities.
        At his death, Mr. Gold was planning a variety show in the fall to benefit the Variety Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Queens and a 92d birthday gala to benefit the Center for Children and Families, formerly the Queensboro Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, of which he had been a director for 60 years.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Etta Gladstone Levinson; a daughter, Lynn Goodfield of Jamaica Estates; a sister, Blanche Stern of Mattituck, L.I.; four grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
