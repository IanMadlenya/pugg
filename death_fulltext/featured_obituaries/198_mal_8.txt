        Dr. Joseph R. Wilder, a New York surgeon who also became a well-known artist, died on July 1 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. He was 82.
        The cause of death was coronary arrest, his daughter Piper said.
        From the 1960's until his retirement in the mid-1980's, Dr. Wilder was director of surgery at the Hospital for Joint Diseases as well as a professor of surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital.
        In 1959, Dr. Wilder, who had vast experience treating gunshot wounds and other serious injuries, was called in to save the badly damaged leg of the actor Zero Mostel, who had been hit by a New York bus. During several months of treatment that included a number of operations, they became friends, and Mr. Mostel advised Dr. Wilder to follow his example and start painting for relaxation.
        Dr. Wilder quickly became a largely self-taught artist of considerable skill, specializing in race cars, athletes and surgical procedures. His pictures were exhibited at galleries and museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. He also published three books of his own paintings.
        Joseph Richard Wilder was born in Baltimore on Oct. 5, 1920. He attended Dartmouth College from 1939 to 1942 and was a doctor in the Air Force, among other jobs.
        He is survived by his wife, Madeline; his children with his former wife Ruth, Kathy W. Karlin, Tony and Piper; and his children with his other former wife, Cynthia, Alyssa and Nicholas.
