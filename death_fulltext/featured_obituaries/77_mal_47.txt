        Lyman M. Anderson, a retired illustrator for leading national magazines and advertising clients, died on May 30 at a hospital in Bridgeport, Conn. He was 86 and lived in Fairfield.
        The Saturday Evening Post, Cosmopolitan and Good Housekeeping were among the magazines he worked for. His advertising clients included General Electric, Pan American World Airway, Pepsi and Procter & Gamble.
        Hundreds of readers wrote the Reader's Digest praising his World War II Christmas cover that depicted a shepherd on the front and a lone soldier on the back panel.
        An oil he painted for Woman's Home Companion will be exhibited by the Society of Illustrators in Manhattan next month.
        Mr. Anderson, born in Chicago, graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago and studied at the Grand Central School of Art in New York City. In his early years he worked for pulp magazines and drew the "Inspector Wade" comic strip for the King Features Syndicate.
        He is survived by his wife, Verna; a sister, Margaret Larson Everitt, of Urbana, Ill., and a brother, Lowell, of Ormond Beach, Fla.
