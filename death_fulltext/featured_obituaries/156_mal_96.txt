        Dr. Herbert S. Gutowsky, who pioneered the use of the technique of nuclear magnetic resonance for determining the structure of molecules, died on Jan. 13 at a hospital in Urbana, Ill. Dr. Gutowsky, who lived in Urbana since 1948, was 80.
        The technique gave chemists a new analytical tool to join X-ray crystalography and other advanced techniques. A substance undergoing N.M.R. analysis is placed in a magnetic field and exposed to electromagnetic radiation. The radiation is partly absorbed by the substance, and analysis of the spectrums of the absorbed radiation permits a chemist to determine the molecular structure of the target substance.
        A similar technique was developed for clinical use, allowing medical technicians to obtain detailed images of parts of the body.
        Dr. Gutowsky, an emeritus professor at the University of Illinois, was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Among his awards were the 1977 National Medal of Science and the 1983 Wolf Prize in Chemistry.
        He is survived by his wife, Virginia.
