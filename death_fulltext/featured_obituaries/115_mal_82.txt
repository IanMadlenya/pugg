        Linwood Franklin Tice, a pharmaceutical chemist who pioneered the development of special gelatins as a blood plasma substitute in World War II, died on Sunday at his home in Salem, N.J. He was 87.
        Mr. Tice was an emeritus dean and professor at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science.  He was on the faculty for 37 years.
        Dean Tice also did research on sorbitol, a natural or synthetic crystalline alcohol used as a sugar substitute for people with diabetes. Working with Charles H. LaWall, he also developed a new tincture of iodine that is registered with the official book of drug standards, the United States Pharmacopeia.
        A native of Salem, he received undergraduate and advanced degrees from the college of pharmacy, where he became an associate professor in 1938. He was promoted to full professor in 1940, and while continuing to teach pharmacy and the chemistry of medications, he served as a dean for three decades until his retirement in 1975.
        Dean Tice was a past president of the American Pharmaceutical Association and the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, and a trustee of the American Pharmaceutical Association Foundation. He served as a vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and headed its section on pharmaceutical sciences.
        He also wrote some 150 scientific publications and was a contributing editor and member of the editorial boards for several reference texts.
        He edited the American Journal of Pharmacy from 1941 to 1977, using its pages to give early warning about the hazards of smoking. He also was a past technical editor of Pharmacy International and its Spanish-language twin, El Farmaceutico.
        Dean Tice is survived by his wife, Mary-Louise Lott, also a pharmacist; two sons from an earlier marriage, Dr. Gregory, and David P., and two granddaughters.
