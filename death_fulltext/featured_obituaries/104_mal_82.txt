        Robert G. Dunlop, a retired chairman of the Sun Company Inc. whose 23-year tenure as president led to a rapid growth of the Philadelphia-based energy company and its expansion overseas, died at the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania on Wednesday. He was 86 and lived in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
        The cause was complications from a stroke he suffered last week, a Sun spokesman said.
        Mr. Dunlop, who was named president of the company in 1947 at the age of 37, was a self-effacing man who often said he was "only a bean counter," referring to his early years with the company where he started as an accountant in 1933. He usually remembered an employee's name after the first meeting and would surprise them by addressing them by their name the next time he met them.
        He expanded the company's interests in petroleum refining and marketing by acquiring the Sunray DX Oil Company of Oklahoma in 1968, which brought with it large reserves and production capacity. Sun markets gasoline under the Sunoco brand name.
        Born in Boston, Mr. Dunlop graduated with honors with a degree in economics from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania in 1931. After serving as the president of Sun until 1970, he was promoted to chairman and chief executive. He retired in 1974 but continued to serve on the board until 1991.
        Mr. Dunlop was elected president of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry trade group, in 1965, and held the post for two years.
        He was also closely associated with the Boy Scouts of America. In 1972 he was awarded the Silver Beaver Award for distinguished service to the Boy Scouts, and in 1974 he won the Roger S. Firestone Distinguished Citizen Award from the same group.
        He is survived by his wife, Emma; a son, Richard, of Salt Lake City; a daughter, Barbara Hauptfuhrer, of Strafford, Pa., five grandchildren and a great-grandchild.
