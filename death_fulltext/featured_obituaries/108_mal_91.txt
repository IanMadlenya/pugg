        Morty Corb, a jazz bassist who performed with Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Pearl Bailey and Nat King Cole, among others, died on Saturday at a  Las Vegas hotel. He was 78 and lived in Studio City, Calif.
        The cause was a brain aneurysm, said the jazz songwriter and historian Floyd  Levin, a friend.
        Born on April 10, 1917, in San Antonio, Mr. Corb learned to play the ukulele at age 6 and later, without training, mastered the guitar and bass. He began performing professionally at 17 with a San Antonio dance band and later played with bands in Arkansas and Missouri.
        After appearing with a band in the Army Air Forces, he moved to Los Angeles in 1946 and soon joined Louis Armstrong's All-Stars band. He also recorded with  Claude Thornhill, Jess Stacy and Kid Ory and later performed with Jack Teagarden and Bob Crosby. With his own group, he recorded the album "Strictly From Dixie"  in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; a son, Gary, also of Studio City, and two brothers, Jack and Alvin, both of Houston.
