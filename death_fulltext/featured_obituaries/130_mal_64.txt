        Floyd Mallory Shumway, a New Haven historian and a former professor at Columbia University, died last Wednesday at Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. He was 80 and lived in New Haven.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        A past executive director of the New Haven Colony Historical Society, he published more than 100 articles, essays and books relating to his hometown and state.
        He edited, with Richard Hegel, ''New Haven: An Illustrated History'' (1981, second edition 1987), which formed the basis of a permanent exhibit at the New Haven historical society and was reissued in 1995 by the American Historical Society.
        Dr. Shumway, who was born in Manhattan, also had a teaching career at Columbia and was an assistant dean of the School of General Studies from 1970 to 1973.
        After graduating from Yale University in 1939, he held managerial positions with various companies in New York, Chicago and Bridgeport, Conn. In Chicago, he was a partner in a manufacturers' agency, Shumway-Fresen Company, from 1952 to 1958.  He eventually returned to academia to receive a master's degree (1965) and a doctoral degree (1968) in history from Columbia, were he taught as an assistant and adjunct assistant professor until 1978. While in New York, he was a historical consultant to the city's Bicentennial Commission and the South Street Seaport Museum, which published his ''Seaport City: New York in 1776'' (1975).
        With John E. Pomfret, he wrote ''Founding of the American Colonies, 1583-1660'' (Harper, 1970). He was also co-editor, with Richard B. Morris, of ''John Jay: The Making of a Revolutionary'' (Harper, 1975).
        Until shortly before his death, he was editing a book on the 1839 Amistad trial, which followed a revolt of African slaves aboard a Spanish slave ship, La Amistad, off Cuba.  The volume will contain scholarly essays about the revolt and trial, which took place in New Haven, and will be published by Yale Press.
        Dr. Shumway is survived by his wife of 37 years, Emma Jean Clifton Shumway; two sons and a daughter by a previous marriage, Thomas S., of Altamonte Springs, Fla., Jean S. Warner of Oklahoma City, and Peter M., of Des Plaines, Ill.; two stepdaughters, Burr Leonard Diehl of Rowayton, Conn., and Mimi Fleischman of Beverly Hills, Calif., and five grandchildren.
        His 18-year marriage to the former Margaret Rabling ended in divorce.
