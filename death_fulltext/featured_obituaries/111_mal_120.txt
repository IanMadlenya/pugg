        Edward Lea Marsh Jr., a country lawyer, civic leader, legislator and breeder  of show-quality cattle and poultry, died last Sunday at his home in Old Lyme, Conn., where his ancestors settled in the 1600's. He was 86.
        Mr. Marsh, known as Lea, was in general practice in Deep River, Conn., from 1933, when he graduated from Yale Law School, until the end of last year.
        A Republican, he represented Old Lyme in the state Legislature from 1937 to  1946, and he served as his party's majority leader and as Speaker of the House. There was hardly a local commission or board on which he did not serve.
        But closer to his heart was agriculture, particularly the breeding of the livestock he exhibited all over the United States and Canada. His 100-acre Pioneer Farm bred prize-winning Jersey cattle, and he was equally adept at breeding chickens, including white single-comb Leghorn bantams and silkies, a Japanese species.
        Mr. Marsh is survived by his wife, Sylvia Davis Marsh; a son, Edward G., of Old Lyme; three daughters, Jane R. and Elizabeth L., of Old Lyme, and Caroline McCord of Port Washington, L.I.; a sister, Elizabeth Griswold of Old Lyme; two stepsons, Dr. Peter Beardsley of New Haven and Timothy Beardsley of Haddam, Conn.; 10 grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
