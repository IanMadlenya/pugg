        Carl Wartenburg, a leader in efforts to widen educational opportunities for disadvantaged youths and to curb alcohol abuse among young people, died last Wednesday while vacationing in the Rangeley Lakes region of Maine. He was 48 and lived in Swarthmore, Pa.
        The cause was a heart attack, according to Swarthmore College, where Mr. Wartenburg was dean of admissions.
        Over the years, Mr. Wartenburg was a consultant to the North Carolina Governor's Institute of Alcohol and Substance Abuse; a member of the advisory board of the Recovery Institute of San Francisco, and executive director of the Action Congress on Responsible Drinking and of the Graduate Inter-Club Council, both at Princeton University. He worked with the Princeton students' social organizations known as eating clubs and was a trustee of the Mercer County Council on Alcoholism.
        He served in leading positions at the Princeton Education Center in Blairstown, which operates a summer camp for disadvantaged youths. He also coached youngsters in baseball and soccer and served on the boards of the Trenton City Museum, the University League and the Young Scholars Institute in Trenton.
        He was assistant dean of students at Princeton in the mid-1970's and returned to the campus as a senior admissions officer in 1983. From 1985 to 1992 he was assistant to the president.
        He was named admissions director at Swarthmore in 1993 and became dean of admissions last year.
        Born in Philadelphia, Mr. Wartenburg graduated from Davis and Elkins College in West Virginia and received a master of divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary in 1975. He was an ordained Unitarian-Universalist minister.
        He is survived by his sons, Andrew, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Mark, of Trenton; his parents, Carl and Gladys Wartenburg of Phoenixville, Pa.; a sister, Nancy Bevilacqua of Villas, N.J.; a brother, Kurt, of Nottingham, Pa., and his fiancee, Susan Garrity.
