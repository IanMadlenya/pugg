        Jim Campbell, an old-school general manager who oversaw the Detroit Tigers through two World Series titles and two 100-loss seasons during his 43 years with the organization, died on Tuesday night. He was 71.
        Campbell, who was dismissed in 1992 before the team was sold to the current owner, Mike Ilitch, died of sudden cardiopulmonary arrest at Lakeland Regional Medical Center in Florida, a Tiger spokesman, Dan Ewald, said. He had been hospitalized in recent days.
        Campbell was the architect of the Tigers' 1968 and 1984 World Series championship teams. The Tigers also won American League East titles in 1972 and  1987 and finished second seven times during his reign.
        But there were also lean times. The Tigers lost 102 games in 1975, including  19 straight, and had 103 losses in 1989. "There have been ups and downs," Campbell said of his career in 1988, "but definitely more ups than downs."
        Campbell was described by some as tight-fisted, a curmudgeon.
        "He never liked the idea of the modern game," said Denny McLain, a pitcher Campbell signed in 1963 who won 31 games for the Tigers in 1968. "He would have  liked it to stay where it was in 60's and 70's, or 40's and 50's. He didn't like it when the salaries went out of sight. He thought the game got worse, fundamentally."
        A native of Huron, Ohio, Campbell played baseball at Ohio State and joined the Tigers' minor league organization in 1949. In 1952, he moved to Detroit as business manager of the club's farm department and in 1959 he was named vice president. He was promoted to general manager in 1962 and team president in 1978.
        He is survived by a sister, Betty Herbert of Toledo, Ohio.
