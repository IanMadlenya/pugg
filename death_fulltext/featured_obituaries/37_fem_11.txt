        Mrs. Bleecker, a native of Atlantic Highlands, N.J., graduated from the Parsons School of Design in 1922. After World War II she began to plan weddings and parties for friends in the area and in 1950 started a series of dances for adolescent boys and girls that has become a fixture in the social life of Long Island. She also founded a scholarship fund in 1958 for students at the Columbia University School of Nursing.
        She is survived by two daughters, Patricia Jones of Manhattan and Mary Simmons of Chevy Chase, Md., and five grandchildren.
