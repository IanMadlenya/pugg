        George J. Silberfein, a retired dress manufacturer and supporter of Jewish causes, died on Monday at Hollywood Medical Center in Florida. A former resident of Huntington, L.I., he was 86 and lived in Hollywood.
        He was active in what became known as the Airlift to Israel of 1947, when Israel was moving toward statehood under threats from Palestine's Arab neighbors. The operation smuggled guns, ammunitions and dissembled planes past the British Mandate authorities. Mr. Silberfein contributed to and raised funds for the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, his main charity, for about 50 years.
        A native of Brooklyn, he attended Brooklyn College, then joined the dress business founded by his father. He eventually took over as owner of the company, S. Silberfein & Sons Dress Factory of Huntington, and ran it until he shut it down in 1979.
        Mr. Silberfein is survived by his wife of 61 years, Ann Permut Silberfein; a daughter, Judith Gold of Forest Hills, Queens; two sons, Michael, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., and Stephen, of Manhattan, and 10 grandchildren.
