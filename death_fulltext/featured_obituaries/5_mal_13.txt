        Mr. Winsor wrote thousands of television and radio scripts. After graduating from Harvard College in the mid-1930's, he worked in Minneapolis and then in Chicago, where he supervised eight serials for NBC.
        He came to New York in 1950, when sponsors owned broadcast programs, to work for the Biow Company, an advertising agency, as vice president and director of television and radio. In 1951 he created ''Search for Tomorrow,'' said to be the first commercially successful television daytime serial. Mr. Winsor was its first executive producer, as he was for ''Love of Life,'' another Biow serial. In 1954, he created ''The Secret Storm.''
        Mr. Winsor left Biow in 1955, set up Roy Winsor Productions and produced episodes of many shows, including ''I Love Lucy,'' ''My Little Margie'' and ''Have Gun, Will Travel,'' A Winning Mystery
        After retirement in 1969, Mr. Winsor served as a consultant for CBS and NBC, taught writing at the New School and began writing mysteries. These included ''The Corpse That Walked,'' which won the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Award for best paperback mystery of 1974.
        Mr. Winsor is survived by his wife, Martha; three daughters, Ann Helm and Mary Newman of Pelham Manor and Cathrine Winsor of Washington; a son, Ricker Winsor of Liberty, N.Y., and four grandchildren.
        A funeral service is to be held at 10 A.M. today at Christ Church in Pelham Manor.
