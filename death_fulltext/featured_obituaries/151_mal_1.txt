        Dr. Harrison Holt Richardson, the youngest member of the team that spent the winter with Adm. Richard E. Byrd on his third mission to Antarctica, died on July 17 at a son's home in Claiborne, Md. He was 80 and lived in Beaver, Pa.
        Dr. Richardson carried a 16-millimeter movie camera with him on the trip and became the first person to take color movies on the continent.
        Mount Richardson in the Fosdick Mountains in the Ford Ranges in Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica was named in his honor.
        Dr. Richardson was a teen-ager when he attended a speech by Admiral Byrd at Beaver College, where his father was a trustee.
        Inspired, he wrote numerous letters to Admiral Byrd and persuaded him to let him work as a hand for the summer on one of his ships, the U.S.S. Bear.
        Over that summer, Dr. Richardson persuaded the Admiral to keep him on board as part of a Government-financed expedition to the Antarctic in 1939.
        As a member of the 59-man team that stayed on the ice over the winter of 1940-41, Dr. Richardson worked as a dog team driver and meteorological observer.
        After the expedition with Admiral Byrd to Antarctica, Dr. Richardson graduated from Geneva College and the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.
        He then joined the Navy and served as a medical officer for military expeditions to Antarctica and the Arctic. He also helped open the United States Air Force Base in Thule, Greenland.
        After his discharge, Dr. Richardson returned home to Beaver and worked as a radiologist for two hospitals.
        He is survived by three sons, Harrison H. Richardson Jr., of Grosse Pointe, Mich., James M. Richardson, of Claiborne, and William H. Richardson of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Jean M. Richardson of Abiquiu, N.M.; a sister, Jean Hamilton of Beaver, and seven grandchildren.
