        Elliott S. Barker, a conservationist and author who helped make Smokey Bear part of American lore, died Sunday at a nursing home here. He was 101 years old.
        In 1950, after a fire in Lincoln National Forest in south central New Mexico, Mr. Barker found a singed and frightened bear cub, and sent it to Washington to represent the United States Forest Service.
        Smokey, a fixture at the National Zoo until death in 1976, soon became a symbol for forest fire prevention.
        Mr. Barker, who was born in 1886 in Moran, Tex., moved with his family to New Mexico in a covered wagon when he was 3 years old.
        He worked for the Forest Service in New Mexico for 10 years as a ranger and a supervisor. Game Warden for 22 Years
        In 1931 he was named the state's first game warden, and stayed on until his retirement 22 years later. He was a founding member of the National Wildlife Federation.
        Mr. Barker joined a group in New Mexicans that lobbied for the state's first laws to protect fish and game. The State Legislature adopted a law in 1930.
        In his tenure as game warden, the state acquired 75,000 acres of land for recreation and wildlife refuges, established fish hatcheries and began to reintroduce several species of animals into New Mexico.
        After retiring in 1953, Mr. Barker wrote seven books, and in 1972 received the Golden Spur Award from the Western Writers of America for his book, ''Western Life and Adventures, 1889-1970.''
        He is survived by his wife, Ethel; three children, Roy Barker and Florence Giers, both of Santa Fe, and Dorothy Elmore of El Paso, Tex., and a sister, Grace Wilson of Aztec, N.M.
