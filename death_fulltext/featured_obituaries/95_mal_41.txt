        Neil McCaffrey Jr., the founder and president of the Conservative Book Club, died on Thursday at his home in Pelham Manor, N.Y. He was 69.
        The cause was lung cancer, his son Neil said.
        Mr. McCaffrey was born in the Bronx and grew up in Pelham, where he attended St. Catherine's School, Cathedral Preparatory School and Fordham University, earning a bachelor's degree in journalism in 1950. From 1943 to 1946 he served in the Coast Guard.
        After a brief stint as a customer-service representative at the publishing house of Sheed & Ward, he worked as an editor at Doubleday/ Image Books from 1955 to 1961. From 1961 to 1964 he held several positions at Macmillan.
        In 1964 he founded the Conservative Book Club and Arlington House Publishers, whose titles included "Quotations From Chairman Bill," a collection of observations by William F. Buckley Jr. Many of the company's books reflected Mr. McCaffrey's enthusiasm for old films and the music of the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Mr. McCaffrey founded the Nostalgia Book Club in 1968 and in 1978 took over the Movie Entertainment Book Club.
        In addition to his son Neil, of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., he is survived by his wife, Joan; a sister, Sister Mary McCaffrey of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; two other sons, Eugene, of Fort Collins, Colo., and Roger, of Ridgefield, Conn.; three daughters, Maureen, of Pelham; Eileen Sclafani of Wayne, Pa., and Susan Sharp of Westfield, N.J., and 18 grandchildren.
