        Andrzej Wasowski, a Polish pianist admired for his lyrical approach to Chopin and widely remembered for his wartime adventures, died at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington on Wednesday. He was 69.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Maria.
        He had lived in the United States since 1968, and was a professor at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., but it was his bizarre concert career in World War II that made him a public figure. When he was captured by Soviet troops in 1939, his captors sent him off to tour the Soviet Union and he gave 200 concerts in two years.
        The Germans, on Mr. Wasowski's return to Poland, wanted him for tours of their own; but when Chopin was forbidden him, he made his way to Vienna, where family friends hid and protected him. Mr. Wasowski began touring professionally again after the war and subsequently won prizes at the Marguerite Long and Bolzano competitions.
        Critical response to Mr. Wasowski's concert career in New York generally agreed on his generous Romantic style and not-altogether-foolproof technique. One of his more interesting ventures was a performance in 1981 of all 51 Chopin Mazurkas at a single sitting.
        Mr. Wasowski was born in Warsaw in 1924. His mother, who taught at the Warsaw Conservatory and began her son's lessons when he was 3 years old, had herself studied with a pupil of Liszt's.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Xavier, of Warsaw; a daughter, Yolanta, of New York City; two sisters, Irena and Maryla, and a brother, Mieczyslaw, all of Poland. A memorial service is to be held on Monday at 10 A.M. at St. Dominick's Church, 630 E Street, SW, Washington.
