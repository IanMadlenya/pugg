        Herbert Weiner, a leading researcher in psychosomatic medicine and professor emeritus at the U.C.L.A. School of Medicine, died on Tuesday at his home in Encino, Calif. He was 81.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Weiner explored the way the brain and body interact in various illnesses, including hypertension, asthma, ulcers and anorexia nervosa.
        His many writings included the textbook ''Perturbing the Organism: The Biology of Stressful Experience'' (University of Chicago, 1992), which remains in print. He was editor of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine from 1972 to 1982.
        Born in Vienna, he came to the United States in 1939 and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College in 1943. He received his medical degree at Columbia University in 1946.
        He was a professor of psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx from 1966 to 1982 and was chairman of the psychiatry department at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx from 1969 to 1982. From then until his retirement last year he taught at the University of California at Los Angeles, where he was also chief of behavioral medicine.
        Dr. Weiner is survived by his wife of 49 years, Dr. Dora Bierer Weiner; three sons, Tim, a correspondent for The New York Times based in Mexico City; Richard A., of Brussels, and Tony, of Arlington, Mass.; a sister, Mary Black of Beaufort, S.C.; and seven grandchildren.
