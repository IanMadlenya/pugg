        Milton Lyon, a stage director long associated with Princeton University, died on Saturday at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 72.
        The cause was cardiovascular disease, said Dan Bauer, a spokesman for the McCarter Theater Center for the Performing Arts, of which Mr. Lyon was the founding executive director in the early 1960's.
        Mr. Lyon first came to Princeton's McCarter Theater in 1955 to stage the undergraduate musical performed every spring by members of the Princeton Triangle Club. From then through the 1980's he staged all but two of the club's  annual shows and took them on national tours.
        Born in Pittsburgh, he graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University with a major in theater and music. He also studied at the University of California.
        He started as an actor but then turned to directing and producing. Altogether, he worked on more than 150 Actors' Equity productions coast-to-coast.
        In 1960, Princeton University engaged him as a consultant to a faculty committee planning the future of the McCarter Theater. It was his idea to turn it into a prominent regional theater as well as an educational asset to Princeton.
        At his death he was semi-retired but continued to give private voice lessons.
        Mr. Lyon is survived by a brother, Arnold Levine, of Pittsburgh.
