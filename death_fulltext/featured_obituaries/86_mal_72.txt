        Shabdai Samuel Koder, a Jewish leader in southern India, died March 10 in Cochin, Kerala, India. He was 86.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Johanna Spector, a friend.
        Mr. Koder, a merchant, was the former president of the South Indian Jewish Association and former vice president of the Council of Indian Jewry, as well as being an authority on the history of the Jews of Kerala.
        Members of the group were known as the "white Jews," who date their history in India back two milleniums. In recent years many of the Indian Jews in the Kerala area, on the Malabar coast 700 miles south of Bombay, have emigrated to Israel. Only 22 remain in Cochin.
        In 1968 Mr. Koder helped organize a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the building of the Jewish synagogue in Cochin which was attended by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mr. Koder was the chief elder of the synagogue.
        Mr. Koder was active in Rotary International and visited New York in the 1960's for one of its meetings.
        He is survived by a wife, Gladys Koder of Cochin; a daughter Queenie Hallegua of Cochin; a grandson, Dr. David Hallegua of Kalamazoo, Mich.; a granddaughter, Fiona Hallegua of Los Angeles, and a sister Lilli Koder of Cochin.
