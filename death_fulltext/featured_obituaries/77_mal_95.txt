        Dr. Bernard Gordon Rosenthal, a psychologist, educator and author, died Wednesday at Midway Hospital in Los Angeles, having retired there from Chicago seven years ago. He was 71.
        The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        A native of Chicago, Dr. Rosenthal was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Northwestern University with M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University. He began his career teaching at Princeton and later taught at the University of Chicago.
        While he was a research associate and lecturer at Harvard University from 1957 to 1960, he was a founder and a chairman of the Greater Boston Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. He then became a professor of social psychology at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and, subsequently, professor of psychology at the Forest Institute of Professional Psychology in Des Plaines, Ill., reaching emeritus status there in 1986.
        Among his books was "The Images of Man" (Basic Books, 1971), a study of modern psychology in the context of the Greek, medieval and Renaissance eras. He contributed to scientific and scholarly journals and, from 1969 to 1976, co-edited the journal The Human Context.
        Dr. Rosenthal is survived by his wife of 36 years, the former Judith Ann Straka; a daughter, Amy Bagan of Portsmouth, N.H.; a son, Mark of New York City; and a sister, Ann Bisno of Los Angeles.
