        Raymond Reisler, a former New York State Supeme Court judge and a past president of the Brooklyn Bar Association, died on Friday at New York Hospital. He was 84 years old and lived in Neponsit, N.Y.

        Judge Reisler's career as a practicing lawyer and jurist spanned more than four decades. After attending Erasmus High School, in Brooklyn, he graduated from Cornell University in 1927 and Columbia University Law School in 1929 and began a nearly 30-year career in private practice in Brooklyn. Judge Reisler was also active in the New York State Bar Association and was a member of the executive committee of the American Bar Association.
        Judge Reisler, a Republican, was appointed to the bench in 1967 by Mayor John V. Lindsay, to fill the unexpired term of another judge. When he retired from the bench in 1977, he joined the New York law firm of Buchman & O'Brien as counsel.
        He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Harriet Spitzer; a daughter, Nancy Wexler; a son, Raymond, Jr., and two grandchildren, all of Los Angeles.
