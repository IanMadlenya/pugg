        Vera Brodsky Lawrence, a pianist, editor and historian of American music whose research helped bring the works of Scott Joplin and Louis Moreau Gottschalk to the attention of contemporary performers, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.
        Mrs. Lawrence was best known for ''The Collected Works of Scott Joplin,'' which restored to print much of that composer's long unavailable music. The edition, published in 1971, was a catalyst in the ragtime revival of the mid-1970's. She was an artistic consultant to the Houston Grand Opera in 1975 when it staged Joplin's opera, ''Treemonisha,'' and to Deutsche Grammophon when it recorded the production the same year.
        Mrs. Lawrence also published ''The Piano Music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk'' (1969), the first collected edition of an American composer's works, and ''The Wa-Wan Press, 1901-1911,'' a five-volume reprint of Arthur Farwell's pioneering American music series. Her ''Music for Patriots, Politicians and Presidents'' (1975) explored the relationship between politics and music during the 18th and 19th centuries.
        Her most recent project was ''Strong on Music,'' a series that explored the musical world of 19th-century New York through the eyes of the lawyer and diarist George Templeton Strong. The first volume, ''Resonances,'' was published in 1991. A second, ''Reverberations,'' followed in 1995. Mrs. Lawrence left a third volume nearly completed.
        Music history was actually Mrs. Lawrence's second career; she did not begin to devote herself fully to it until 1965, when she gave up a 40-year career as a concert pianist. She was born in Norfolk, Va., in 1909, and attended the Juilliard School, where she was a student of Josef and Rosina Lhevinne, Rubin Goldmark and Bernard Wagenaar.
        Mrs. Lawrence made her debut in 1925, and performed regularly in new music concerts and with chamber groups. She was a staff pianist at CBS radio from 1939 to 1946. In 1944, she married Theodore Lawrence, an engineer for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He died in 1964.
        During her years as a performer, Mrs. Lawrence taught at the Juilliard School and the Curtis Institute of Music. In 1967, she became the administrator of the publications program of the Contemporary Music Project, which sent 73 composers to 77 secondary school systems around the country.
        In 1969, Mrs. Lawrence compiled and edited a library of 500 works composed as part of the project.
        No immediate family members survive.
