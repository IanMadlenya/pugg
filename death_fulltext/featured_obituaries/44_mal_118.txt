        Rudolph J. Thomas, who rose from elevator operator to become head of the Harlem Y.M.C.A., died on Wednesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 86 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of cardiac arrest, his niece, Gloria Flores of Manhattan, said.
        Mr. Thomas came to New York from Orlando, Fla., in 1920 to visit relatives and to work as an elevator operator at the Harlem Y. He stayed on in various capacities but left in 1926 to attend Wilberforce University.
        After graduation, he returned to the Y and in 1947 was named executive director. He persuaded Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson to work there as coaches. He remained as director until he retired in 1964.
        He is survived by his niece.
