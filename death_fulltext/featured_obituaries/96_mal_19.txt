        Michael P. Molloy, 49, a brokerage executive who had been missing since Dec. 28, was found dead on Monday in a remote area of the Adirondacks around the town of Stony Creek, about 50 miles north of Albany.
        Mr. Molloy died last Thursday or Friday of hypothermia, the authorities said.
        A search was begun when his car was discovered on a mountain road after friends and relatives had been unable to contact him. The police in Glens Falls, who said they had no reason to suspect foul play, said he had apparently walked about three miles through creeks and heavy forests as temperatures fell below freezing.
        Mr. Molloy, who lived in Manhattan, was a founding shareholder and managing director of Ormes Capital Markets, an institutional brokerage firm, at the time of his death. He had previously been a vice president at Merrill Lynch, Oppenheimer & Company and L. F. Rothschild. In the mid-1970's, when he was in his early 30's, he became the youngest partner in the history of the Dillon Reed investment-banking firm.
        Mr. Molloy was a graduate of St. Mary's College of California, in Moraga.
        Surviving are his wife, Lucille; two sons, Matthew and Ross; a daughter, Courtney; his mother, Julia Molloy, of Lake Tahoe, Nev., and three sisters, Juliana Shields, of Pasadena, Calif.; Sheila Gast, of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Molly Linneman, of Fresno, Calif.
