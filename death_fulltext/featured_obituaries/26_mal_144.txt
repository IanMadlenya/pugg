        Archie Bleyer, a musical director and arranger whose Cadence Records company provided a showcase for singers like Andy Williams, the Everly Brothers and the Chordettes, a 1950's-era quartet, died today at a rest home in Sheboygan, Wis. He was 79 years old.
        Mr. Bleyer's biggest public exposure came as the on-camera musical director for ''Arthur Godfrey and His Friends,'' the television show that featured variety entertainers.
        In the early 1950's, Mr. Bleyer founded Cadence Records, which produced hits through the late 1960's until it was dissolved after his retirement in 1964.
        The hits for the Chordettes on Cadence included ''Mr. Sandman'' in 1954 and ''Lollipop'' in 1958. In 1956, the brothers Phil and Don Everly signed with Cadence and released ''Bye Bye Love,'' their first hit. Andy Williams's first hit for Cadence was ''Canadian Sunset'' in 1956.
        Mr. Bleyer is survived by a stepdaughter, Jacquelyn Everly, and a grandson, Jason.
