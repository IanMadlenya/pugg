        Vincent Wagner, a classical music manager who was the music director of the summertime Maverick Concerts in West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 57 and lived in Manhattan and West Hurley.
        The cause was cancer, said Cornelia H. Rosenblum, the chairwoman of Maverick Concerts.
        Mr. Wagner's passion was chamber music, and during his 16 seasons at Maverick, chamber music was the heart of an annual series that also included solo recitals by instrumentalists and singers, as well as occasional poetry readings and jazz concerts. Maverick, which was founded in 1916 by Hervey White, a novelist and poet, presents its concerts in an open-sided barn that allows an interaction between the sounds of music and nature.
        Mr. Wagner preserved this rustic charm and also upheld a longstanding tradition of presenting both traditional repertory and new music. Among the composers whose works he commissioned were Peter Schickele, Robert Starer, Joan Tower and Philip Lui.
        He regularly presented new-music ensembles like Eighth Blackbird and the New Century Saxophone Quartet, but he also offered all the Bach Suites for Unaccompanied Cello.
        After service in the Army, he moved to Manhattan, where he worked for Columbia Artists Management and Hillyer International. Mr. Wagner became music director of Maverick in 1985.
        Mr. Wagner is survived by two brothers -- James, of Henderson, Nev., and Paul, of Billings, Mont. -- and four sisters: Julietta Pumper of Lonsdale, Minn.; Audrey Darling of St. Paul; Beverly Shellenbarger, of Sparks, Nev.; and Virginia Grumke, of Pasadena, Calif.
