        Edwin A. Rothschild, who was the president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois in 1977 when its defense of the right of the American Nazi Party to march in Skokie, Ill., touched off angry demonstrations, died on Jan. 10 at his home in Chicago. He was 84.
        The cause was complications from a gastrointestinal illness, said his son, Michael, of San Diego.
        When the American Nazis were blocked from marching in Skokie, a Chicago suburb that was home to many Holocaust survivors, they turned to the civil liberties group to defend their right to assemble and speak out in public. The decision to represent the Nazis prompted mass resignations from the A.C.L.U., which has a long history of defending unpopular causes.
        Mr. Rothschild was born in Chicago; he graduated from Dartmouth College in 1931 and from Harvard Law School in 1938. During World War II, he was a lieutenant in Merrill's Marauders, one of the Army's first guerrilla units, which fought behind enemy lines in Burma.
        After the war, he joined the Chicago firm of Sonnenschein, Nath & Rosenthal and was made a partner in 1954.
        During his 30-year association with the civil liberties group, he was a board member, president and a general counsel.
        He was also a board member of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis, the Metropolitan Planning Council and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
        Besides his son, he is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Ann Meyer; a daughter, JoAnn, of Milton, Mass.; a brother, George, of Evanston, Ill., and three grandchildren.
