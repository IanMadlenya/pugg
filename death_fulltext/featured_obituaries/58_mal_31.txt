        Khatchik O. Donelian, who worked on the first atomic bomb and designed nuclear plants and whose inventions included a smoke detector similar to those in widespread use today, died on Oct. 25 at Fish Memorial Hospital in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. He was 77 years old and resided in New Smyrna Beach.
        He died of liver failure, his family said.
        Born in Burdur, Turkey, to Armenian parents, he fled with them as a child to escape massacres that killed 27 relatives. He grew up in Mount Vernon, N.Y., and earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering at Columbia University.
        He worked five years for New York City and two years for the American District Telegraph Company, where he invented a detector for ionized particles produced by fire before smoke or heat built up.
        He was recruited for what became the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb. He was the chief project engineer for Kellex Corporation's Oak Ridge, Tenn., reactor, and after the war for the successor company, the Vitro Corporation, on several Atomic Energy Commission plants.
        From 1952 to 1974 he worked for Nuclear Development Associates, which became Gulf United Nuclear Fuels, and remained as a consultant until his death. He held 22 patents.
        His survivors include his wife, Geraldine; three sons, John of Toronto, Gary of Saugerties, N.Y., and Armen of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret of Ithaca, N.Y.; a brother, Avedis of Hackensack, N.J., and a sister, Armen Sarkis of Maitland, Fla.
