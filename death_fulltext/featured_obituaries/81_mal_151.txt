        Dr. Reynold Erland Carlson, a former United States Ambassador and economic-development expert for the Ford Foundation in Latin America, died on Wednesday at the Green Hills Health Care Center in Nashville. He was 81 and lived in Nashville.
        He had suffered a long illness, his family said.
        He was with the Ford Foundation from 1959 to 1975, except for three years after President Lyndon B. Johnson sent him to Colombia as Ambassador in 1966. At the foundation, he was successively a consultant, representative in Rio de Janeiro, associate director of the foundation's Latin American program, representative in Buenos Aires and, finally, regional program adviser with headquarters in Lima, Peru.
        Dr. Carlson, a native of Chicago, graduated from Northwestern University and received a Ph.D. at Harvard University. Over the years, starting in 1940, he taught economics at Johns Hopkins University and at Vanderbilt University, where he directed its Brazilian institute from 1949 to 1953.
        After retiring from the Ford Foundation, he taught at Vanderbilt, Grinnell College, and, until 1981, Franklin Pierce College
        Dr. Carlson is survived by his wife, Patricia Proctor Carlson; a daughter, Marie Louis Roehm of San Francisco, and two sisters, Jean Hattauer of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Emmy Merritt of Milton, Mass.
