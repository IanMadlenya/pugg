        Herman Malamood, a New York City Opera tenor who also sang at the Metropolitan Opera and major European houses and had an active career as a cantor, died of cancer Saturday at his Manhattan home. He was 57 years old.
        Born in the Bronx, Mr. Malamood studied in New York - operatic singing with various teachers and cantorial singing with Moshe Ganchoff. His first major performance was of ''Pagliacci'' in Philadelphia in 1970, replacing the man he counted as his mentor, Richard Tucker.
        From there he sang at numerous European opera houses, including the Vienna State Opera and in Tel Aviv. During his eight years with the City Opera he specialized in robust Italian parts, and also appeared at the Met spelling Luciano Pavarotti in the title role of Mozart's ''Idomeneo.''
        He is survived by his wife, Anna; a son, Howard, of Albany; two daughters, Helayne, of New York, and Debra Bieling of Westhampton, L.I., and two grandchildren.
