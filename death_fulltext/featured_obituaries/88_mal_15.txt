        Clarence H. Linder, a retired vice president of the General Electric Company, died on Tuesday at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady. Mr. Linder, who lived in Schenectady, was 91.
        The cause was a burst appendix, said his son, Clarence Jr.
        Mr. Linder worked for General Electric for almost 40 years, holding positions in engineering, manufacturing and general management in New York and Louisville as well as Schenectady. He became a vice president in 1951 and retired in 1963.
        He earned his bachelor's degree and a master's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Texas. After retiring from G.E., he became a research professor of electrical engineering at Union College. He also was on advisory committees at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
        Mr. Linder was active in the Reformed Church in America, heading several of its major committees, and also served on several advisory groups to the World Council of Churches.
        He is survived by four daughters: Elizabeth Ann Walraven of Schenectady, Marion Calvert and Sara Yates, both of Houston, and Mary Grossman of Katonah, N.Y., and his son of Charlton, N.Y.
