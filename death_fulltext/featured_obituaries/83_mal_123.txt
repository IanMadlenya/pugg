        STUART, Fla., Dec. 24 (AP),-- Zack Mosley, who mixed humor with aviation in his "Smilin' Jack" comic strip, died on Tuesday at Martin Memorial Medical Center here. He was 87.
        The cause was a heart attack.
        Inspired by a mail plane that flew over his boyhood home in Oklahoma, Mr. Mosley created a comic strip full of characters based on real people and detailed drawings of aircraft.
        The biggest fans of his syndicated strip were those who had lived through World War I and World War II. "Smilin' Jack" appeared in more than 300 newspapers from 1933 to 1973.
        "It was the most popular aviation adventure strip in the country in the 1930's and 40's," said Ron Goulart, editor of the Encyclopedia of American Comics. "This was a time when flying was literally by the seat of the pants. There was a romance to aviation, and Mr. Mosley got in on that."
        The strip began in 1933 as "On the Wing." The story of nervous flying students became popular several months later when The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate changed the title to "Smilin' Jack."
        The strip featured a motley cast of characters, including Fatstuff, whose belly was so big that buttons popped, and a dashing faceless pilot, Downwind Jaxon, who symbolized the period's colorful aviators.
        Mr. Mosley is survived by his wife, Betty; a daughter, Jill, of Gainesville, Fla., and three brothers, Joe of Stuart, Bob of Merritt Island, Fla., and Doyle of Oklahoma.
