        John M. Coates, the retired head of the Masonite Corporation, died Wednesday at a hospital in Orinda, Calif. He was 86 and lived most of his life in Palatine, Ill.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        In 1952 Mr. Coates became president and chairman of Masonite, which was the world's largest manufacturer of hardboard. He served as president until 1971 and continued as chairman until 1976.
        Masonite, made from wood fiber byproducts processed with steam and pressure, is stronger and more versatile than the wood it is derived from. During Mr. Coates's tenure as president, the company expanded into making panels with photographically copied wood grain surfaces, and sales rose nearly fivefold. U.S. Gypsum bought the Chicago-based company in 1984.
        Mr. Coates was born in Wausau, Wis. As a teen-ager, he worked in paper mills and a box factory.
        After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he worked as an insurance claims adjuster, then went to Harvard Law School. He was a lawyer in Chicago before joining Masonite as a legal counsel in 1939.
        He also served on the boards of the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad, the Employer's Mutual Insurance Company of Wausau, Allis Chalmers, Hartford Plaza Bank, Home Capital Funds and the Marathon Corporation.
        His wife of 50 years, the former Mary E. Abbott, died in 1987. His survivors include two sons, Robert of Urbana, Ill., and William of San Francisco; a daughter, Catherine Coates of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Helen Broadfoot of West Orange, N.J., and three grandchildren.
