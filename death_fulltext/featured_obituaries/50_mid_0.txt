        Neta Snook Southern, an aviator who helped Amelia Earhart learn to fly, died Saturday at her home here. She was 95 years old.
        Mrs. Southern operated Kinner Field in Los Angeles in 1920 and in 1921 began teaching Ms. Earhart to fly, said her son, Curtiss Southern. Ms. Earhart vanished on a flight across the Pacific in 1937.
        Mr. Southern said that his mother, who also tested planes at Kinner, gave up flying when he was born in 1922.
        Other survivors include a sister, two grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild.
