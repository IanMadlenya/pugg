        Arthur M. Goldberg, the union lawyer who was the chief legal strategist in a crucial and successful organizing campaign at the J. P. Stevens Company, died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 67 years old and lived in New York City.
        He died of general sepsis, his son Jonathan J. (J. J.) Goldberg of New York City said.
        When he retired in 1989, Mr. Goldberg was general counsel for the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. The union waged a bitter 17-year campaign to organize the workers in J. P. Stevens's 10 Southern plants, which ended in a union victory in 1980. The film "Norma Rae" was based on the J. P. Stevens boycott.
        During a similar campaign to unionize a pants manufacturing company, Mr. Goldberg devised the corporate campaign tactic, in which corporate boards and shareholders were approached to bring about labor-management settlements.
        From 1963 to 1971, Mr. Goldberg worked for the National Labor Relations Board, first for the board's appellate court and then as a trial examiner.
        Mr. Goldberg was a member of the central committee of the Labor Zionist Alliance, founding chairman of the Washington Zionist Federation and a board member of the American Zionist Federation. His father, Israel Goldberg, was a historian on Jewish history under the name of Rufus Learsi.
        In addition to his son Jonathan, Mr. Goldberg is survived by his wife, Lenore; another son, Joshua, of Valley Stream, N.Y.; his daughters, Deborah Lee, of New York City and Maggie Bartura of Kibbutz Hulda, Israel; his brother, David Goldberg of Jerusalem, and his sister, Judith Field of New York City.
