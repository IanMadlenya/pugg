        Alan J. Haber, the spokesman for the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in the early 1980's, died yesterday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 34 years old and lived in Brooklyn Heights.
        He died of pneumonia resulting from AIDS, his sister said.
        He was raised in Brooklyn and graduated from Hunter College. In the late 1970's and early 80's, he was Hunter's assistant director of communications and assistant to the associate provost. In 1981, he joined the landmarks panel and was its public affairs chief until 1983, when he moved to the Municipal Art Society. He returned to the commission in 1984, staying until 1985.
        After working with Howard J. Rubenstein Associates, the public-relations firm, he was hired in 1987 as spokesman for John Burgee Architects. He left in 1988 and moved to Jerusalem, where he lived until 1989.
        He is survived by his sister, Estelle, and his father, Sam, both of Brooklyn, and a brother, Jack, of Madrid.
