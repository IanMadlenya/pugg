        Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who helped guide Kenya to independence in 1963 and was an important political leader there for more than 30 years, died on Thursday. He was 82.
        Members of his family said he had suffered a heart attack at his home in the town of Kisumu, 280 miles northwest of Nairobi, and died in the Aga Khan Hospital there.
        After independence from Britain, Mr. Odinga served as Vice President for three years, but he resigned and became the opposition leader after a falling-out with the President, Jomo Kenyatta.
        Tough-talking and combative, Mr. Odinga was known in African politics as "Double O." He was widely respected in Kenyan society for aiding the fight for independence, but tribal politics prevented him from becoming President. He was a member of the Luo tribe in the western part of Kenya, the country's second largest tribe.  12 Percent of Vote in 1992
        In the presidential election in 1992, the first multiparty elections in 26 years, he received only 12 percent of the popular vote. Voters re-elected President Daniel arap Moi, the nation's strongman since 1978, who was a bitter political enemy of Mr. Odinga.
        Mr. Odinga was a continuing thorn in the side to Mr. Moi. Three years ago he was jailed briefly by Mr. Moi, who released the opposition leader after international protests.
        Mr. Odinga was also imprisoned in his dispute with Mr. Kenyatta, after the opposition leader organized a new political party over the President's objections. Mr. Kenyatta banned Mr. Odinga's party, in effect ending multiparty politics in the East African nation until the last several years.
        Mr. Moi succeeded Mr. Kenyatta after his death in 1978. Despite the long-time animosity, Mr. Moi paid tribute to Mr. Odinga yesterday, saying, "Kenya has lost a great son, a nationalist and a patriotic citizen."
