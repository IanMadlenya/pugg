        John Harold Bryant, an electronics engineer who specialized in the miniaturization of microwave systems and was the founding president of Omni Spectra, a manufacturer in that field, died on Tuesday at his home in Ann Arbor, Mich. He was 77.
        The cause was lymphoma, his family said.
        Dr. Bryant was born in Baird, Tex., and earned a Ph.D. in electrical engineering at the University of Illinois in 1949. He joined ITT Laboratories to head its division of microwave electron tubes. Dr. Bryant then moved to the Bendix Corporation, where he was the supervising engineer of its research laboratories. In those years he helped develop techniques used today for the miniaturization of microwave systems.
        He and some collaborators formed Omni Spectra in 1962 to design and make miniature microwave components and connectors for industry. The company achieved marked reductions in weight and size while improving electrical performance of its products.
        In 1980, Omni Spectra became part of AMP Inc., a large maker of electrical connectors and switches based in Harrisburg, Pa. Dr. Bryant retired as its chairman and joined the electrical engineering and computer science department of the University of Michigan as historian of radar, electromagnetics and the work of Heinrich Hertz.
        He was the holder of 14 patents and the author of many articles and a book, ''Heinrich Hertz: The Beginning of Microwaves.''
        Dr. Bryant is survived by his wife of 48 years, Barbara Everitt Bryant; two daughters, Linda B. Valentine of Hinsdale, Ill., and Lois B. Chen of Lindenhurst, N.Y.; a son, Randal E. of Pittsburgh; a sister, Beth Bryant of Dallas, and eight grandchildren.
