        Irving H. Stolz, a lawyer and builder who engineered the merger of Bronx and Lebanon Hospitals to give the Bronx a central medical center, died yesterday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale. He was 87 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
        A spokeswoman for the Hebrew Home, Pat Molino, said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Stolz was a lawyer at Stolz & Stolz and a builder who was involved in office and apartment buildings throughout the city.
        He was active in Bronx County political and civic groups. In 1962, he helped organize Democrats in the Bronx to foil the nomination of a candidate for a judgeship who they believed was being dictated to by political bosses, instead supporting the Republican-Liberal nominee.
        In 1962, he helped the Bronx and Lebanon Hospitals merge, thus assuring their survival, and was president or chairman of the Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center until 1982.
        He was a member of the Conciliation and Appeals Board for 10 years during the Lindsay and Beame administrations.
        Mr. Stolz worked to raise money for various Jewish and Israeli causes and for the YM-YWHA of the Bronx and other civic and philanthropic organizations.
        Mr. Stolz was born on July 31, 1903 and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and he graduated from New York Law School.
        He is survived by his wife, Pearl; a son, Alan J. Stolz, of Westport, Conn.; a daughter, Eleanor Stolz Greenfield, of Shorewood, Wis.; a brother, Samuel S. Stolz, of New York City; and two sisters, Ruth Lazar of Yonkers and Barbara Roth of Teaneck, N.J.
