        Syd Cassyd, whose idea it was to found the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which gives the Emmy Awards, died on Friday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 91.
        Mr. Cassyd was working for a trade publication when he had the idea, and in 1946 he organized a meeting of influential figures in the world of television.
        He believed that television, then in its infancy, had the potential for enormous growth, so the purpose of the 1946 gathering was to talk about creating an organization like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had been giving the Academy Awards, known as Oscars, since 1927.
        The television academy's first president was the ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, and it grew quickly, as Mr. Cassyd recalled in a 1996 interview. Mr. Cassyd was president of the academy in 1950 and held other posts there over the years.
        The first Emmy statuettes were awarded in 1949. The name was loosely adapted from Immy, the nickname for a piece of television equipment then in use, the image orthicon camera.
        Mr. Cassyd was born in Teaneck, N.J. He served as a film editor in the Army Signal Corps in World War II and moved to Los Angeles after his discharge. His early television activities included working for an experimental television station in Los Angeles and producing children's programs.
        He is survived by his wife, Miriam, and a daughter, Donna.
