        Jim Feeney, an ABC-TV sports producer whose three decades of work included ''Wide World of Sports'' and coverage of the Olympics, died last Tuesday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 61.
        The cause was colon cancer, his wife, Barbara, said.
        In 1970, the first season of ''Monday Night Football,'' Mr. Feeney, the associate producer, was seen at the start of each telecast counting down to air time. It was a taped sequence meant to simulate a live production.
        Mr. Feeney, who was known professionally as Doc, started at ABC in 1959 in sales and moved to sports in 1964.
        Although mainly a producer, he held administrative and technical positions in the sports division.
        He produced college football and golf telecasts, segments of ''Wide World of Sports'' and coverage of events at the 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France. He was also the director of Olympic operations for coverage of the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary, Alberta.
        ''He was one of a small number of people who wrote the book on sports production, who knew how to produce interesting and exciting programs,'' said Geoffrey Mason, a former executive producer of ABC Sports. ''And he was probably the best-dressed guy in the history of television.''
        Mr. Feeney was known for finding Don Ohlmeyer at Notre Dame in 1966. Mr. Ohlmeyer is now the president of NBC's West Coast entertainment division.
        Mr. Feeney, who graduated from Notre Dame in 1958, left ABC in 1971, worked for NBC and other companies, returned to ABC in 1974, and stayed until 1994.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Barbara Colleen.
