        Dr. Kevin D. Dowling, former chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford, and a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Connecticut, died on Monday at his home in West Hartford. He was 61.
        The cause was cancer, according to a spokesman for the university.
        Dr. Dowling received an honorary degree and the University Medal this year, the first time that both awards have ever been given to one person. He was cited for his role as a member of the board in the development of the university's Health Center. In 1986, he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Hartford County Medical Society.
        He was a fellow of the American College of Surgeons and the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons and a diplomate of the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and the National Board of Medical Examiners.
        He was a staff member at the Newington Children's Hospital as well as president of Medical Delivery Systems and president and board chairman of Connecticut Medical Insurance Company. He was also active in helping physicians to overcome drug addiction and other problems.
        Dr. Dowling is survived by his wife, Jane; three daughters, Anne Dowling-Logue, Pamela, and Kara, all of West Hartford; three brothers, Victor, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Vincent and Gregory, both of West Hartford; two sisters, Denise and Joan Dowling, both of West Hartford, and three grandsons.
