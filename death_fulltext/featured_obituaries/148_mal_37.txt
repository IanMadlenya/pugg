        Daniel Hoffman, a former New York City judge in Criminal Court, died on April 23 at his home in Tamarac, Fla. He was 91.
        Judge Hoffman had been active in the Republican Party, and in 1937, Mayor Fiorella H. La Guardia named him a city marshal, a job he held until 1960, when he became a Supreme Court special-assignment clerk.
        His political activities were centered in the Silk Stocking district, on Manhattan's East Side. In 1965, he was an organizer in the successful mayoral campaign of John V. Lindsay, the Republican-Liberal candidate. The following year Mayor Lindsay appointed him to a 10-year term on the Criminal Court bench. He retired at the end of 1975.
        He graduated from St. John's University School of Law in 1929 and was a port claims officer in the Army Judge Advocate General's office in World War II, attaining the rank of captain. After the war he was a captain of city auxiliary police officers and commanded the auxiliaries of the 13th Precinct, on the East Side, in the early 1950's.
        He is survived by his wife, Leah.
