        Ignatius D. Volpe, a prominent electronics and engineering consultant, died on Friday at his home in Huntington, L.I. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Volpe suffered a severe stroke in June, said a grandson, Daniel Rose.
        Mr. Volpe was a pioneer in the fields of electronics, sound and communications, playing a major role in the development of television, stereophonic broadcasting, the cardiac pacemaker, the bimetallic thermostat, which is commonly used in appliances, and several other inventions.
        He worked for several electronics and communications companies during his 50-year career, including the Minerva Radio Corporation and the Herold Radio and Television Corporation, for which he was chief engineer.
        Mr. Volpe immigrated to the United States from Sicily. He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and received a bachelor's degree in physics from New York University in 1936 and a master's in communication engineering from the RCA Institutes in 1938.
        Mr. Volpe was a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers. He was also an accomplished violinist, and played with the Huntington and Port Washington symphonies on Long Island. In the 1930's, he was the host of a classical music program on radio, which featured the Volpe Orchestra.
        Mr. Volpe is survived by his wife, Laura; two sons, Nino, of Oakdale, L.I., and Richard, of Port Washington; a daughter, Bruna V. Rose of Huntington, and eight grandchildren.
