        Raymond Sabinsky, a violist in the New York Philharmonic for 40 years, died on Jan. 9 in San Francisco. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said A. Ina Block, a friend.
        Mr. Sabinsky was born in New York in 1913. In the 1930's, he supported himself as a singer and saxophonist in nightclubs and on ocean liners, but he was intent on joining an orchestra as a violist. In 1941, he joined the viola section of the Pittsburgh Symphony. The invitation to join the Philharmonic came two years later.
        Besides playing in the Philharmonic's viola section, Mr. Sabinsky was an accomplished chamber music player. He performed as a member of Chamber Music Concertante in the late 1940's and was a founding member of the Beaux-Arts Quartet, which played regularly in the 1950's.
        He also played the violin, saxophone, classical guitar, mandolin and banjo, and was occasionally called upon to contribute these abilities in Philharmonic performances. He played the mandolin part in the Mahler Seventh Symphony, for instance, several times. And he was an accomplished painter who exhibited his work in annual shows by Philharmonic musicians at Carnegie Hall in the 1940's and 50's.
        There are no survivors.
