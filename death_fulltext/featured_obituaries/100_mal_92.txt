        Jerome Badanes, a novelist and film maker who was a faculty member at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, N.Y., died on Thursday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. He was 58 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, a college spokeswoman said.
        Mr. Badanes wrote the script for "Image Before My Eyes," a 1981 documentary that used photographs, home movies and interviews with emigres to re-create Jewish life in Poland from the turn of the century to World War II. In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called the film "a touching monument to a world long gone."
        He was also the author of "The Final Opus of Leon Solomon" (1989), a novel in the form of a memoir being written by a suicidal Holocaust survivor. In The Times Book Review, Edith Milton praised the work's "deeply compelling" insights and termed it "a novel filled with illuminations."
        Mr. Badanes was born and reared in Brooklyn. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, where he won the Avery Hapgood Award in Poetry. He also founded and edited a literary journal for Students for a Democratic Society. In 1969, he was a founder of Burning City Theater, a touring group for which he wrote scripts.
        At Sarah Lawrence, where he taught since 1986, Mr. Badanes was the chairman of the graduate program in fiction writing. He had previously held positions at Vassar and State University College at Purchase, N.Y.
        He is survived by his wife, Gail Kinn; a daughter from a previous marriage, Shira, of Philadelphia; a sister, Estelle Manzi of Brooklyn, N.Y., and a grandchild.
