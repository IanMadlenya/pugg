        Benny Binion, owner of the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas whose flamboyant promotional efforts included an annual monthlong ''World Series of Poker'' for high-stakes players, died of congestive heart failure on Monday at Valley Hospital in Las Vegas, where he lived. He was 85 years old.
        Mr. Binion was born near Dallas to a family that dealt in racehorses sold at county fairs. He ran illegal craps games in hotel rooms and served in prison for selling liquor during Prohibition and for income-tax evasion later. In 1946 he moved to Nevada to take advantage of legal gambling and five years later bought a legal casino on Fremont Street that became the Horseshoe.
        He installed the poker World Series, in which heavy gamblers buy in for $10,000, and craps tables where up to $1 million may be bet. In his later years he was so close to law-enforcement officials that police officers borrowed money from his casino for undercover drug purchases.
        Surviving are his wife, Teddy Jane; two sons, Jack and Ted, both of Las Vegas; two daughters, Brenda Michael of Amarillo, Tex., and Beckey Behnen of Las Vegas, and a sister, Dorothy Binion of Anchor Point, Alaska.
