        Carlo Donat Cattin, the Italian Labor Minister, died on Sunday in Monaco, the Labor Ministry said on Monday. He was 71 years old.
        The announcement said he died of complications arising from a heart bypass operation.
        Outspoken and combative, Mr. Donat Cattin was a key figure in Italy's postwar trade union movement. He rose to prominence in the 1950's as a leader of the Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions, an umbrella body with close links to the dominant Christian Democratic Party.
        He resigned to concentrate on his work as a Christian Democratic deputy for Turin, and became a leader of a left-leaning faction in the party called New Forces.
        He was Deputy Minister of State Holdings under Prime Minister Aldo Moro in the 1960's before first becoming Labor Minister in 1968. He mediated between unions and managers in Italy's "hot autumn" of 1969, when worker militancy was at a peak.
        In later years he also held the Health and Industry portfolios.
        One of his four sons was identified as a member of the left-wing Red Brigades guerrilla group active in the 1970's and 1980's.
        Mr. Donat Cattin's death raises to three the number of unfilled Cabinet posts in the five-party coalition Government.
