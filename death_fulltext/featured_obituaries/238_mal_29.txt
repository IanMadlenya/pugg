        Robert J. Strudler, the chairman of the Lennar Corporation, one of the nation's largest home building companies, died Tuesday in Houston. He was 64.
        The cause was complications of an infection, his wife, Ruth Honigman Strudler, said.
        Mr. Strudler was named chief operating officer of Lennar, based in Miami, in 2000. During the next five years, the company built 180,613 homes -- start-ups, move-ups and retirement homes, in industry parlance -- in 13 states. He was elected chairman in December 2004.
        Mr. Strudler had been chairman and chief executive of the U.S. Home Corporation, which was acquired by Lennar in 2000. Mr. Strudler started at U.S. Home in 1972 as vice president for acquisitions. He became president in 1984, and chairman and chief executive in 1986. Construction figures for U.S. Home during Mr. Strudler's career there were not available, but in 1999 the company built about 10,000 homes in more than 250 towns in 12 states.
        Robert Jacob Strudler was born in Brooklyn on Sept. 22, 1942, a son of Harry and Lilly Kaplan. When he was a child, Mr. Strudler's mother, a high school teacher, married Ralph Strudler. The Strudlers owned a motel in New Paltz, N.Y.
        Besides his wife, whom he married in 1965, Mr. Strudler is survived by three sons, Keith, of Beacon, N.Y., and Seth and Craig, both of Houston; and two brothers, Paul and Lewis, both of Washington.
        Mr. Strudler graduated from Cornell in 1964 and received a law degree from Columbia in 1967. For the next four years, he worked at two law firms: Wickes, Riddell, Bloomer, Jacobi & McGuire, and London, Buttenwieser & Chalif, both in New York.
        The latter firm represented U.S. Home, which led to Mr. Strudler's being hired by that company.
