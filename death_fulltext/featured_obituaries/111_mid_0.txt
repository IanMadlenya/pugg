        Larry LaPrise, a singer who wrote the novelty song-and-dance number "The Hokey Pokey" for the apres-ski crowd at an Idaho resort, unwittingly creating a  classic for nursery schools and roller-skating rinks, died last Thursday at a Boise hospital.
        A daughter, Linda Ruby, said her father, who was 83, had been ill since last  fall.
        Mr. LaPrise was leading the Ram Trio -- its other members were Charles Peter Macak and Tafit Baker -- at the Ram Bar in Sun Valley when he came up with the song. It was an instant hit.
        " 'The Hokey Pokey' is like a square dance, really," Mr. LaPrise told The Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho, in 1992. "You turn around. You shake it all about. Everyone is in a circle, and it gets them all involved."
        The Ram Trio recorded the song in 1949. Four years later, the bandleader Ray  Anthony bought the rights and recorded it on the B-side of another novelty record, "The Bunny Hop."
        Mrs. Ruby said her father wrote several other songs besides "The Hokey Pokey", none of them quite as famous, including the "Sitz Mark Samba," named after the hole left in the snow by a skier who has fallen down.
        The success of "The Hokey Pokey" among children was a source of amusement, but not steady income, to Mr. LaPrise until Roy Acuff's publishing company bought the rights in the 1960's, she said.
        In addition to his daughter Linda, Mr. LaPrise is survived by his wife, Donna; two sons, Paul and David, and three other daughters, Donna Chandler, Laurel Day and Shelly.
