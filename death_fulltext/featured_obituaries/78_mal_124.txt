        Norman Sidney Weiser, a music publishing executive, writer and editor, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his lawyer, Alvin Deutsch.
        Mr. Weiser was best known as a former president of Chappell Music Company of New York, which was founded in England in 1811 and is now Warner-Chappell, the world's largest music publisher. He joined the company as vice president and general manager in 1969 and was president from 1973 to 1977.
        Afterward he became senior vice president and director of Polygram Corporation, an entertainment company, and from 1978 to 1981, he was president of Sesac Inc., a performing-rights licensing company in New York. Then he became vice president and general manager of Largo Music Inc., a small music publisher in New York, from which he retired in 1986.
        Before joining Chapell he held executive positions with United Artists, 20th Century Fox and Paramount Music Division.
