        Henry A. Boorse, a physicist who was one of the original scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project in the development of the atomic bomb, died on July 28 in Houston, where he lived. He was 98 and a former resident of Leonia, N.J.
        Dr. Boorse, who received his Ph.D. in physics from Columbia in 1934, taught for more than three decades at Barnard College, where he was the dean of faculty for more than 20 years and the acting president in 1962 and 1967.
        An expert on low-temperature physics, he was an initial member of the staff of a laboratory at Columbia University that was a unit of the Manhattan Project looking into the separating of uranium isotopes for producing a nuclear bomb.
        Dr. Boorse was a consultant to the United States Atomic Energy Commission from 1946 to 1958 and to the Brookhaven National Laboratory from 1951 to 1955.
        He and Lloyd Motz wrote a two-volume work, ''The World of the Atom'' (1966), and -- with Jefferson Hane Weaver -- a one-volume book, ''The Atomic Scientists'' (1989).
        His wife, the former Margaret Hazelton, died in 1996. He is survived by a son, Ronald H., of Houston; and a daughter, Suzanne Remond of Kerrville, Tex.
