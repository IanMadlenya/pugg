        Princeton University officials said the cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage.
        Professor Rogers, who was born in Bickley, England, studied mathematics and physics at Cambridge University, where he received a master's degree in 1930. Before moving to the United States in 1937, he taught at several schools and colleges in England and the United States, including Harvard University. He joined Princeton in 1941 and retired in 1971.
        A staunch advocate of teaching physics to all college students, not just those majoring in sciences, Professor Rogers managed to turn a difficult class into informative theater. He approached teaching by asking his students questions instead of lecturing them on the answers.
        To illustrate complicated principles, he performed experiments using props like spinning bicycle wheels, ladders and buckets of water.
        Professor Rogers received medals for outstanding contributions to teaching from the American Association of Physics Teachers and from the International Commission on Physics Education. His textbook ''Physics for the Inquiring Mind,'' published in 1960, is now in its 12th printing by Princeton University Press and is still widely used in colleges.
        He is survived by a son, David, of West Springfield, Mass.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Janet Tran Drummond, died in 1972.
