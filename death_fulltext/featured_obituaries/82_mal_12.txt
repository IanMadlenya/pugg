        Dr. Shagass was a professor of psychiatry at Temple from 1966 until three years ago. He specialized in the neurophysiological aspects of psychiatric illness, emotion and learning. He contributed to the electrophysiology of mental illness and influenced the increasingly practiced biological approach to psychiatry.

        He was born in Montreal and received a bachelor's degree from McGill University in Montreal. He received a master's degree in psychology from the University of Rochester and, after wartime service with the Royal Canadian Air Force, returned to McGill for his medical degree. He started his career at McGill and headed the electrophysiology laboratory at the Allan Memorial Institute at the university from 1952 to 1958.
        Before coming to Temple, he taught at the University of Iowa. In Philadelphia he founded the Temple University Psychiatric Electrophysiological Laboratory at Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute.
        After reaching emeritus status at Temple in 1990, Dr. Shagass became a professor of psychiatry at the Medical College of Pennsylvania. He continued his research in psychiatric electrophysiology by establishing the Clinical Research Center at Norristown State Hospital.
