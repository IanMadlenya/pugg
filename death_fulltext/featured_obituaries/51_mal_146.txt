        Sergio Peresson, an Italian-born violin maker who crafted instruments for some of the leading soloists, died of a heart attack on Tuesday at his home. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Peresson made violins for Isaac Stern, Jaime Laredo, Eugene Fodor and Ivan Galamian, among others. He also made a cello for Jacqueline du Pre. Norman Carol, concertmaster of the Philadelphia Orchestra and owner of two Peresson violins, called him "the most outstanding maker" in the world.
        Mr. Peresson was born in Udine, Italy, and started making violins in 1943. He emigrated to Venezuela after World War II and repaired violins for the Venezuela Symphony. In the early 1960's, he moved to the United States. While repairing violins he also began making instruments on his own.
        In 1982, Mr. Peresson stopped taking new orders for his instruments because he couldn't meet the demand. There was a waiting list of 180 musicians who had placed orders, said his wife, Margit.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, two grandchildren and four sisters.
        A funeral service is scheduled for Friday at St. Rose of Lima Church in Haddonfield.
