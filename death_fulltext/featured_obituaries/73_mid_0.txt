        Chris Blazakis, a fashion executive who prompted investigations of Nancy Reagan by contending that she improperly kept $2 million in free designer clothes, furs and jewelry, died on Tuesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 39.
        His death was a result of AIDS, said David Farneth, his companion for 21 years.
        Mr. Blazakis operated a consulting and marketing concern whose clients included Galanos, Ann Lawrence, Bascardi Furs, SoHo Tee Shop, Lenore Smith, S & B Designs and Diana Ross. Earlier he was the executive vice president of Galanos Originals, a fashion house favored by Mrs. Reagan.
        In 1987 he began a campaign to urge officials and journalists to investigate Mrs. Reagan for not declaring her free fashions as gifts or income, contrary to the White House counsel's advice.
        Mrs. Reagan continued the practice even after promising to stop. But she denied wrongdoing, saying she had only borrowed the items for official functions and to help publicize the designers. She gave some of the items to museums as charitable donations.
        Born in Sewickley, Pa., Mr. Blazakis grew up in Baltimore, Md., and Ambridge, Pa. His given name was Milton.
        Besides Mr. Farneth, his survivors include his mother, Katherine Knox, and a sister, Clara Zugliani, both of Conway, Pa., and three brothers, Andrew, of Boardman, Ohio, Nicholas, of Dayton, Ohio, and Dino, of Baltimore.
