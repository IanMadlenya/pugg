        Stanley S. Lasdon, a philanthropist and retired vice president and director of the Warner-Lambert Company, died on Sunday at his apartment in Manhattan. He was 83.
        His family said he died after a brief illness.
        Mr. Lasdon, a native of Brooklyn, earned a law degree at St. John's University in 1936 and joined his brothers the next year in forming the Nepera Chemical Company, a maker of prescription drugs. Nepera was acquired by Warner-Lambert in 1957 and Mr. Lasdon remained as a vice president of the parent company for two years and as a director until 1972.
        At his death, he was president of the Lasdon Foundation, a family philanthropy established in 1946 to support medical research and cultural institutions.
        He is survived by his wife of 50 years, the former Gene Schwarzer; a daughter, Susan Abrams of Baltimore; two sons, Richard H., of New Canaan, Conn., and Jeffrey S., of Bedford, N.Y.; a sister, Miriam Gerrity of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
