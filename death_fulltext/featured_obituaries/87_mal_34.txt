        Dan Hartman, a record producer, singer and songwriter, died on March 22 at his home in Westport, Conn. He was 43.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said his manager, Julian Able.
        Mr. Hartman wrote and sang many hit songs, including "Free Ride" and "Relight My Fire." He also wrote many songs for movies, among them "Living in America" from "Rocky IV," which became James Brown's biggest-selling record in 15 years and earned a Grammy nomination for Mr. Hartman. Other films in which his music was used include "Streets of Fire," "Ruthless People" and "Bull Durham."
        Mr. Hartman produced Joe Cocker's "Unchain My Heart" and "One Night of Sin" and Tina Turner's "Foreign Affair," which sold more than six million albums worldwide. In 1989 he produced and recorded a solo album of his own music for Private Music, and last year worked on a solo album for Chaos, a division of Columbia Records.
        He is survived by his parents, Carl and Pauline Hartman; a sister, Kathy, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a brother, David, of Wellsville, Pa.
