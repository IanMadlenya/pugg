        Albert E. Jeffcoat, a former Wall Street Journal foreign correspondent who founded the Manhattan Theater Club in New York City, died on March 10 at his home on Bainbridge Island, Wash. He was 77.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Jan.
        While working for the Wall Street Journal in London immediately after World War II, Mr. Jeffcoat was impressed by the small theater clubs and other fringe productions there because they allowed a closer interaction between actors and audiences and also provided an opportunity to try out new works.
        On his return to New York in 1955 after serving as The Journal's Paris correspondent, Mr. Jeffcoat sought to recreate the kind of small, experimental theater he had enjoyed in London by founding the nonprofit Manhattan Theater Club. After leaving The Journal, Mr. Jeffcoat worked in communications for I.B.M. and the Ford Motor Company and founded his own public relations firm, Jeffcoat, Schoen & Morrell.
        He is survived by his wife; four sons: Thomas, of Mountain View, Calif.; Peter, of Sammamish, Wash.; John, of Seattle; and Ross, of New York; and by two daughters, Lindsay Jarris and Catherine Jeffcoat, both of Seattle.
