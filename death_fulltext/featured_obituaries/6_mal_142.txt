        Dr. Carlton Fredericks, a leader in nutritional therapy and a radio show host at WOR for the last 30 years, died of a heart attack yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Yonkers. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He was pronounced dead at 4:05 P.M. at the hospital, according to Mary Recchia, a spokeswoman for WOR.
        She said his program on health care and nutrition, which was broadcast six days a week, first went on the air in 1957.
        Dr. Fredericks was born Harold Carlton Caplan in Brooklyn in 1910 and grew up in the Flatbush section. He changed his name to Carlton Fredericks at the start of his radio career.
        He was graduated from the University of Alabama in 1931 and earned a Master of Arts degree and a doctorate degree from New York University in public health education.
        Dr. Fredericks advised listeners to his syndicated radio show that modern food-processing methods so impaired natural nutrients that they needed vitamin and mineral supplements.
        He wrote a number of books on health and nutrition, including ''Eat, Live and Be Merry'' and ''Psychonutrition.''
        In the 1950's and 60's, Dr. Fredericks had a prolonged battle with Government regulatory agencies regarding his nutritional theories and his relationship with drug companies. Those problems began after he pleaded guilty to charges in 1945 in New York City of practicing medicine without a license.
        He is survived by his wife, Betty, and three children.
