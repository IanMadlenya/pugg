        James S. (Jim) Rathschmidt, a man from Princeton who coached a Yale crew to an Olympic gold medal in 1956, died on Tuesday at his home in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 79 years old, and the cause of death was a heart attack, said Kay Rathschmidt, his wife.
        Genial Jim, as he was known to his oarsmen, was born and brought up in Princeton, N.J., and though he never attended Princeton University, he became lightweight coach there in 1935. He was appointed head coach at Yale in 1951, and in 19 years there his crews won three Eastern sprint championships. He returned to Princeton and was the first coach of women's crew there until his retirement in 1973.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, James Jr. of Northfield, Mass., and two grandsons.
