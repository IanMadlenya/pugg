        Dr. Milton I. Levine, a pediatrician in Manhattan who offered advice on raising children to several generations of parents, died on Wednesday in St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 91.
        The cause was heart failure, said his grandson, Franz Paasche.
        Dr. Levine maintained a private practice for more than 40 years. He wrote books and newspaper articles and made broadcast appearances. He was an emeritus clinical professor of pediatrics at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he started on the staff in 1928.
        Dr. Levine was the author or co-author of several books about bringing up children, including "The Parents' Encyclopedia," which he wrote with his wife. Others include "A Baby Is Born" and "The Wonder of Life." Generally, he believed in the healing power of mother love, and was regarded as a purveyor more of the "happiness is a warm parent" school of advice rather than the "permissiveness is everything" approach. Worked Through School
        The son of a rabbi, Dr. Levine was born in Syracuse and grew up in Spokane, Wash. His family moved to Manhattan in 1917. He worked his way through City College and graduated from Cornell Medical School in 1927.
        He chose pediatrics while interning at the old St. Mary's Free Hospital in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan, at a time when he felt that the medical profession misunderstood the needs of babies and thus unknowingly treated them negligently, even cruelly.
        He urged, for example, that newborns be kept as close to their mothers as possible, as soon as possible, which ran contrary to much of the conventional wisdom of that time.
        After leaving his full-time academic position in 1971, he founded and edited the professional magazine Pediatric Annals.
        He is survived by his wife of 57 years, Jean Seligmann Levine of Manhattan; two daughters, Carol Paasche of Toronto and Ann Parker of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.
