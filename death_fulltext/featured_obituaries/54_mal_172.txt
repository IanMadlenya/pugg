        Dr. William E. Homan, a pediatrician and writer, died yesterday at his home in White Plains. He was 72 years old.
        He died of emphysema and a heart attack, his family said.
        Dr. Homan, who had a private practice and taught, was also the senior pediatrician at the White Plains Hospital Medical Center for more than 35 years. He was a pediatrician at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1948 to 1965 and at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y., from 1948 to 1976.
        His popular books included "Child Sense," published by Basic Books in 13 editions from 1969 to 1977, and "Caring For Your Child," published by Harmony Books in 1979. His books were published in eight foreign languages, and he wrote 160 articles for many publications, including The New York Times Magazine.
        His observations included statements like these:
        "Normal hand washing by a child accomplishes little more than encouraging the migration of germs from one area to another."
        "If you say, 'Johnny, stop hitting your sister with that hatchet,' and there is no response, don't repeat yourself. Take action."
        Dr. Homan was a native of the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and a graduate of Columbia College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha. He interned at Kings County Hospital.
        He served in the Navy Medical Corps on destroyers in the Pacific in World War II and in the Third Marine Air Wing in the Korean conflict.
        Survivors include his wife of 47 years, the former Betty Ruth Peden; a son, Dr. William P. Homan, a surgeon who also lives in White Plains; a daughter, Jane Antin of Neadham, Mass., and two grandchildren.
