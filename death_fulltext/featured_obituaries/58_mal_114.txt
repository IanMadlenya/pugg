        Jesse G. Heiges, a retired executive of Pfizer Inc., died Saturday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 77 years old and had residences in Palm Beach and East Hampton, N.Y.
        He died of cancer, a Pfizer spokesman said.
        When Mr. Heiges retired in 1979 after nearly three decades at Pfizer, he held the posts of vice president, general counsel and secretary.
        Born in Shippensburg, Pa., he was graduated from Ursinus College in 1935 and the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1938. The next year, he joined a Wall Street law firm now known as Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon.
        During World War II, Mr. Heiges took a temporary leave from the law firm to serve as a lieutenant in the Navy, commanding a submarine chaser.
        He joined Pfizer at its Manhattan headquarters in 1950. He was elected assistant secretary of the pharmaceutical company in 1952, secretary and general counsel in 1956 and vice president in 1967.
        He was a board member of the Palm Beach Civic Association and previously was a vice president and board member at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, a director of the U.S. Life Corporation and a member of several organizations in the legal profession.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Virgina Rodgers; and a nephew.
