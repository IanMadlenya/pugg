        Morris Harrell, an influential Texas lawyer and former president of the American Bar Association, died on Tuesday in Dallas, where he lived. He was 80.
        Mr. Harrell was also a former president of the Dallas Bar Association, the State Bar of Texas, the American College of Trial Lawyers and the National Conference of Bar Presidents.
        A. P. Carlton, chairman of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Judicial Independence, of which Mr. Harrell was a member, said, ''Morris led the effort in trying to effect a change in the way judges are selected in Texas, and to implement a merit selection procedure, as opposed to partisan political selection.''
        Morris Harrell was born on April 16, 1920, in Grandview, Tex. He received a bachelor's degree and law degree from Baylor University in Waco, Tex. He was a Navy officer in World War II. After the war, he  joined his uncle's law office, where he remained, with the exception of four years as a federal prosecutor, until 1955, when he joined Thompson, Knight, Wright & Simmons, then one of the largest law firms in Dallas. In 1965, he was a co-founder of the firm of Rain, Harrell, Emery, Young & Doke, which merged with other firms over the years to become Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, one of the largest law firms in Texas. Mr. Harrell remained a practicing trial lawyer there until the end of his life.
        In 1998, Mr. Harrell was awarded the American Bar Association Medal, which is given to people considered ''to have rendered exceptionally distinguished service to the cause of American jurisprudence.'' Previous recipients have included Oliver Wendell Holmes, Thurgood Marshall, Felix Frankfurter and Sandra Day O'Connor.
        Mr. Harrell is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Rhoda Baylor, who is known as Rusty; a son, Jim, of Dallas; two daughters, Julia Harrell Boone of Houston, and Rhoda Harrell Reynolds of Dallas; and seven grandchildren.
