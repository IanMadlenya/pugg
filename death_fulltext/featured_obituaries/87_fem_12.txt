        Betti Hellinger Salzman, who worked at the United Nations for 30 years, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was in her 80's.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Ann Phillips, a daughter.
        Mrs. Salzman worked with the United Nations Tourist and Visitors Department and the hospitality committee maintained at the United Nations by the National Council of Women. She was a graduate of Hunter College.
        She is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Phillips and Josie Spalter, both of Manhattan.
