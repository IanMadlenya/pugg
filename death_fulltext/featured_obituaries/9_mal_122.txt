        Bishop Antonio Anoveros Ataun of Spain, whose support of Basque rights in that country once produced a crisis in relations between the Spanish Church and the Franco Government, died yesterday of a lung infection in a hospital in Bilbao, a Spanish church spokesman announced. The bishop, who had suffered from Parkinson's disease, was 78 years old.
        The crisis arose in 1974 with the bishop's call for greater freedom for Spain's ethnic Basque minority. Under the Franco regime, Basque language and culture were severely repressed.
        The sermon declared that the Basque people were faced with ''serious obstacles'' in preserving their identity, including restrictions on the use of the Basque language. The Government appeared to interpret the statement as as tacit support for Basque independence.
        Bishop Anoveros, an outspoken advocate of social justice and a Basque himself, had been named Bishop of Bilbao, the largest city in the Basque region, in 1971.
        After the sermon, the Government accused the bishop of undermining national unity and sowing civil discord. The Government at first confined the bishop to his home, then sought to expel him. But he refused to leave.
        The Government then reportedly threatened to break a treaty that, since 1953, had governed Spain's traditionally close relations with the Roman Catholic Church.
        Bishop Anoveros, however, received the full backing of the Spanish church, which threatened to excommunicate the Government officials involved, including Generalissimo Francisco Franco. The Government backed down.
