        Bobby Dodd, the top-winning football coach in Georgia Tech history and a member of the National Football Hall of Fame, died of lung cancer today. He was 79.
        Mr. Dodd was head coach at Georgia Tech from 1945-66. From 1952-56, his teams won six consecutive bowl games: three Sugar Bowls, one Orange Bowl, one Cotton Bowl and a Gator Bowl. From 1951-53, his teams had a 31-game unbeaten streak, including a 12-0 season in 1952.
        His overall record of 165-64-8 is the best in the 96 years of Georgia Tech football. In Georgia, however, he is probably best remembered as the Georgia Tech coach who beat archrival Georgia eight consecutive times from 1949-56 Outstanding Quarterback Born Oct. 11, 1908, in Galax, Va., Robert Lee Dodd was named after the Confederate Civil War general. He played quarterback at the University of Tennessee from 1928-30, leading the Volunteers to a record of 27-1-2 in that time.
        After he left college, Mr. Dodd went to Georgia Tech as an assistant to Bill Alexander, who had succeeded John W. Heisman, for whom the trophy honoring the nation's best college football player is named.
        Mr. Dodd became known as a coach who had extraordinarily good luck. ''If Bobby Dodd were trapped at the center of an H-bomb explosion, he would walk away with his pockets full of marketable uranium,'' a rival coach, Wally Butts of the University of Georgia, once complained.
        ''Lucky?'' Mr. Dodd said. ''Bet your life I'm lucky.'' I'm lucky and so are my teams.'' He gave his autobiography the title ''Dodd's Luck.''
        After retiring from coaching in 1967, Mr. Dodd continued as athletic director at Georgia Tech until 1976. Last April, Georgia Tech renamed its football stadium after him.
        He is survived by his wife, Alice Davis Dodd; a son, Robert of Douglassville, Ga.; a daughter, Linda Thompson of Atlanta, and six grandchildren.
