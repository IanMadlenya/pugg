        Daniel J. Ransohoff, a tireless booster of his native Cincinnati as a planner, tour guide, historian, professor, photographer and fund-raiser, died at a hospital there on May 29. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Ransohoff relished everything about his hometown, from the geological history of its fossils to its industrial history.
        For nearly three decades, his two official jobs were teaching community planning at the University of Cincinnati and directing special projects for the United Way and Community Chest.
        In his unofficial role, he conducted more than a thousand tours for residents and visitors. Companies used him to help recruit workers who may have had negative feelings about the city.
        Dr. Ransohoff made photography a serious hobby, and his work was shown at the Smithsonian Institution, the 1967 World's Fair in Montreal and the Museum of Modern Art's Family of Man exhibit in New York.
        He was a founder of Cincinnati's public radio and television stations and was chairman of the Friends of Judaic Studies.
        He earned a bachelor's degree at Bard College, a master's degree in social work at Columbia University and a doctorate at Union Graduate School.
        Surviving are two daughters, Sallie Ransohoff Kreines and Lela Ransohoff-Englert, both of Cincinnati; two brothers, Jerry and William, both of Cincinnati; a stepson, Charles Fleischmann, of Unionville, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Melanie Fleischmann of North Salem, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
