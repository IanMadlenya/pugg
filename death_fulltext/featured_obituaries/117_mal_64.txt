        Peter Lyon, an author of books, radio scripts and magazine articles, died on Monday at a nursing home in Kingston, N.Y. He was 81.
        Mr. Lyon made his mark as a writer for such 1940's radio shows as ''March of Time'' and ''Cavalcade of America.'' He also wrote shows for ''Theater Guild of the Air'' and ''The Eternal Light,'' among others.
        He served as president of the Radio Writers Guild, a forerunner of the Writers Guild of America, and in 1950, when the Guild was under investigation by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, he was blacklisted by the radio broadcasting industry.
        Mr. Lyon, whose original name was Robert Crawford Lyon, was born in Madison, Wis., in 1915. His family moved to Princeton, N.J., soon after his birth. He was a graduate of Williams College and worked briefly for Architectural Forum magazine before starting in radio.
        His books include ''Success Story: The Life and Times of S. S. McClure,'' a 1963 biography of his maternal grandfather who was the muckraking editor of McClure's magazine. The book won a George Polk Memorial Award. Among his other books are ''The Wild, Wild West'' and ''Eisenhower: Portrait of the Hero.''
        In addition to his wife, of Woodstock, N.Y., he is survived by his stepmother, Clara Lyon of De Land, Fla.
