        Harold M. Koch, a designer and importer of carpets who was the brother of former Mayor Edward I. Koch, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. He was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was liver failure after open-heart surgery about three weeks ago, the former Mayor said.
        Mr. Koch, who was born in the Bronx, spent his career in the carpet business, and until he sold it recently was the president of International Carpets Imported, a Manhattan wholesale concern. He was the winner of a number of industry accolades, among them the 1991 Harrogate Design Award.
        In addition to his brother, Mr. Koch is survived by his wife, the former Gail Kleinberg of Manhattan; a daughter, Joey Kara of Manhattan; a son, Andrew, of Maplewood, N.J., a sister, Pat Koch Thaler of Manhattan, and two grandsons.
