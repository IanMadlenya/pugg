        Charles V. Schaefer Jr., a New Jersey businessman who became a major benefactor of Stevens Institute of Technology and chairman of its board, died on Nov. 18 at the North Ridge Medical Center in Oakland Park, Fla. He was 85 and lived in Saddle River, N.J.
        Mr. Schaefer was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Queens, where he went to public schools. He received a degree in mechanical engineering in 1936 from Stevens, in Hoboken, N.J.
        After being a plant manager for the DeLaval Steam Turbine Company in Trenton, he went on to become an owner of several manufacturing companies with headquarters in New Jersey, and was also chairman of Schaefer Associates, an investment firm in River Edge, N.J.
        He was chairman of the Stevens board in 1996 when it voted to name the college's new school of engineering in his honor. The announcement came at the end of Stevens's four-year $102 million capital campaign, of which he had been a co-chairman.
        His support for Stevens also included founding the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. Fund for Excellence and the Stevens Parent Association,  and paying for the building of the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. Athletic and Recreation Center.
        Stevens's president, Hal Raveche, recalled that Mr. Schaefer used to telephone him to ask whether he was sleeping and exercising enough and taking vitamins.
        He was a member of the Boca Raton Hotel and Club in Florida.
        He married Lillian A. Meyer in 1938. She died in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Stephanie Tactikos; a son, Charles Schaefer III of Franklin Lakes, N.J.; a daughter, Lynn Schaefer Bovenizer of Pennington, N.J.; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
