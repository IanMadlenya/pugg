        Marie-Claude Lalique, keeper of the Lalique family tradition in glass and crystal artistry until her retirement in 1994, died on April 14 on Captiva Island, Fla. She was 67 and lived on Captiva and in Provence.
        The cause was complications of pneumonia, her family said.
        Ms. Lalique was the last in the family line of renowned crystal artisans that began with her grandfather René Lalique, who designed perfume bottles for François Coty and opened a little retail shop in Paris in 1905. His work and business was carried on by his son, Marc, her father.
        Ms. Lalique became both the president and creative mind of Lalique S.A., headquartered in Paris. She continued to work with the contrasts and figures in frosted and translucent crystal that characterize the Lalique look. Working from plasticine models, she updated the designs, notably by adding a range of brighter colorings. She also added elaborate jewelry designs with precious stones and enamels. In 1993, she designed her own fragrance, called Lalique.
        Ms. Lalique was born in Paris and graduated from the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs. She originally planned a career in theater decoration but in the 1960's her overworked father asked her to help out in his studio. For her first project she bought a live dove to be the model for a set made out of crystal.
        She stayed on as a partner and took over the business upon her father's death, in 1977. In 1994 she sold it to the French company Pochet.
        Ms. Lalique is survived by her husband, Jean Dedouvre.
