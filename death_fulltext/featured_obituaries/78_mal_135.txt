        Morris T. Weeks Jr., a magazine editor who became an author and freelance writer, died on Thursday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. He was 80 and lived in Sea Cliff.
        The cause was complications after heart surgery, said Stret Whitting of the Whitting Funeral Home in Glen Head.
        Mr. Weeks was an editor of Look and Parade magazines in the 1940's and 1950's. He later compiled "The Complete Boating Encylopedia" and wrote a series of educational books, called the "Hello" series, about countries in the Western Hemisphere. He wrote articles on travel and other subjects for The New York Times and other publications.
        He also served on the board of directors of the South Oaks Psychiatric Hospital in Amityville, L.I.
        Mr. Weeks, who graduated from Princeton in 1934, is survived by his wife of 54 years, the former Antoinette Sartori; three daughters, Frances McConkey of San Miguel, Mexico; Anne Tomlinson of Richford, Vt.; and Victoria Weeks of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
