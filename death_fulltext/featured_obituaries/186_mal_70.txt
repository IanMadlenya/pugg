        Henry Thornberry, a former executive editor of The New York Times News Service, died Sunday in Coxsackie, N.Y. He was 76.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his daughter Susan Maraglio.
        Mr. Thornberry joined The New York Times in 1974 as syndication editor. A year later he moved to the news service as associate editor, becoming executive editor in 1984. He held the post until his retirement in 1988, when he returned to his native Ireland. He was visiting Ms. Maraglio in Coxsackie when he died.
        The news service, which edits and distributes Times news and feature articles from The New York Times for use in other publications, currently has about 550 domestic and international subscribers.
        Mr. Thornberry was sent to the United States in 1968 by The United Press, later part of United Press International, which he had joined in London in 1947.
        He worked as an assistant editor on the international desk in New York for six years, then moved to The Times.
        Henry William Thornberry was born in Dublin on Jan. 16, 1926. He studied at the London School of Economics and served in the British Army as a paratrooper from 1944 to 1947.
        He is survived by his wife, Gertrude, of Bray, Ireland; and his daughters: Susan, of Coxsackie, and Carol Thornberry, also of Bray.
