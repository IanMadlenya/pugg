        Alfred I. Schlossberg, a longtime New York textile manufacturer who was Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg's father-in-law, died on Monday at a hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 87 and had lived in Palm Beach since his retirement.
        Mr. Schlossberg, whose son, Edwin, married Miss Kennedy, the daughter of the  late President John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in 1986, was born in Lynchburg, Va.
