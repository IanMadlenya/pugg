        Esther Marie Fleming Cloward, a longtime advocate of women's rights, died Tuesday at the White Plains Hospital after a brief illness. She was 91 years old and lived in White Plains.
        Mrs. Cloward, a graduate of Bucknell University in 1923, refused surgery or other support systems to prolong her life.
        She was active in the fight for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and was supported in this by her late husband, the Rev. Donald Cloward, executive secretary of the Council on Christian Social Progress of the Northern Baptist Convention. In 1975, she received an award from the Westchester Coalition for the E.R.A. for her ''life-long commitment to and service for the cause of equal rights for women.''
        She is survived by two sons, Richard A., of Manhattan, and Robert D., of Orlando, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
