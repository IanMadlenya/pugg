        Jack E. Brown, a lawyer prominent in several early cases concerning the computer industry and intellectual property, died on Jan. 6 at his home in Paradise Valley, Ariz. He was 72.
        The cause was a heart attack, said Paul F. Eckstein, an attorney at Brown & Bain, the Phoenix law firm that Mr. Brown founded 40 years ago.
        Mr. Brown's specialty was high-technology litigation, particularly copyright violations. Most notably, he represented Apple Computer in its unsuccessful ''look and feel'' case in 1989 against Microsoft's Windows operating system. A United States District Court judge ruled against Apple, holding that an element of an interface, like the recycle bin on the Windows screen, infringed on a copyright only if it looked exactly the same as another interface, in this example, Apple's trash basket.
        Mr. Brown was more successful keeping the Franklin Computer Corporation from cloning the Apple II personal computer in 1983.
        He also represented I.B.M., Intel, Unisys and United Technologies, among other companies.
        He was listed recently in the National Law Journal as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in the United States.
        Jack Edward Brown was born on March 15, 1927, in Omaha. He received a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University and a law degree from Harvard.
        He ran unsuccessfully for the United States House of Representatives in 1972 as the Democratic Party candidate in the Fourth Congressional District of Arizona.
        Mr. Brown is survived by his wife, Suzanne; two sons, Charles, of Mesquite, Nev., and James, of Phoenix; two daughters, Abigail Brown, of Phoenix, and Amanda Chang, of San Francisco; a brother, Milton Brown, of Des Moines, and five grandchildren.
