        Gerry Cosby, who founded the sporting goods and athletic equipment company that bears his name, died on Tuesday in Stockbridge, Mass., where he had lived for the last 50 years. He was 87.
        Finton Gerard David Cosby's links to athletics went back to the 1920's and 30's, when he was a goaltender for the United States national hockey team, including the squad that won a world championship in Prague in 1933 by allowing only one goal in five games.
        In the late 1930's, he played for the New York Rovers of the Eastern League. He later served as a practice goaltender for the New York Rangers, New York Americans and Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League.
        In 1938, he founded Gerry Cosby & Co., which has its headquarters at Madison Square Garden and outlets in Westbury, L.I., Princeton, N.J., and Sheffield, Mass. Besides its retail business, the company supplies hockey equipment to amateur and professional teams throughout North America.
        Mr. Cosby is survived by two daughters, Margaret of Sun Valley, Idaho, and Sarah Yoh of Sag Harbor, L.I.; a son, Michael, of Locust Valley, L.I.; two brothers, a sister and three grandchildren.
