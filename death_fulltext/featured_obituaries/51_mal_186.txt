        Dr. Choh-Ming Li, an economist who taught at the University of California at Berkeley and who in 1963 founded the Chinese University of Hong Kong, died on Sunday at his home in Berkeley. He was 79 years old.
        He died of cancer, the university said.
        Dr. Li was a professor in the Haas School of Business at Berkeley from 1951 to 1963 and was the first director of the university's Center for Chinese Studies. In 1963, asked to lead a merger of three Chinese colleges in Hong Kong, he took leave from Berkeley to form the Chinese University.
        Dr. Li was born in Canton and earned bachelor's and doctoral degrees from Berkeley before returning to China to teach in Kunming. In 1945 he was named deputy director general of the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1949, when the Communists took control, he was China's permanent delegate to the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.
        Surviving Dr. Li are his wife, Sylvia; two sons, Winston of Cincinnati and Tony of Berkeley; a daughter, Jean Rogers of Washington; two brothers, Choh-Hsien Li of Los Angeles and Check-Lap Li of Berkeley, and four sisters living in China.
