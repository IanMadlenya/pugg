        Herman Christian Nolen, chairman emeritus of the McKesson Corporation, the San Francisco-based manufacturer and distributor of drugs and health and beauty care products, died on Sunday at Bethesda Memorial Hospital in Delray Beach, Fla. He was 92 and lived in Delray Beach.
        He suffered a brief illness after a stroke, his family said.
        Mr. Nolen led the company, now 160 years old, during a period of strong growth and diversification. He raised eyebrows in the pharmaceutical industry when he took what was then McKesson & Robbins into the distribution of generic drugs manufactured under its control in Mexico, Colombia and the Sudan. McKesson's annual sales now top $10 billion.
        Mr. Nolen, who was born and reared in Muskegon, Mich., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin, a master's degree from the University of North Carolina and a Ph.D. from Ohio State University. Wrote Book on Chain Stores
        He began his career as a professor of marketing at Ohio State, where he wrote several books, including "The Chain Store Problem," an analysis of the comparative efficiency of independent stores and chains. The 1938 volume, written with Theodore N. Beckman, was reissued in 1976 by Ayer Company Publications and remains in print.
        In World War II he helped the War Production Board establish an economics section for the Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories, and served in the occupation of Sicily and Italy. In 1943, Mr. Nolen, by then a colonel, joined the Allied supreme command in England to plan the military government's program for the civilian economy of occupied Germany.
        He is survived by his wife, Julia Bird Nolen; two sons, Wilson Nolen of Manhattan and Chapin Nolen of Bedford, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Jane Stearns of West Springfield, Mass.; a sister, Helen Peterman of Muskegon, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.
