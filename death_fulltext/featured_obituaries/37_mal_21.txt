        Mr. Rock and a brother Allan, a press agent, were responsible for preserving the Pawnee Bill Archives, a collection of books, photographs, posters and other memorabilia of the Pawnee Indians and the Old West. The collection was assembled by Gordon W. Lillie, who became a scout for the Pawnee tribe in the Oklahoma Territory, adopted the nickname Pawnee Bill and later organized a Wild West show that toured around the world before his death in 1942.
        Mr. Rock is survived by another brother, Dr. Daniel Rock of Harpswell, Me.
