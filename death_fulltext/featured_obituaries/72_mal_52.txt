        Edmund F. Martin, a former chairman of the Bethlehem Steel Company, died Sunday at his home in Bethlehem, Pa. He was 90.
        Mr. Martin died of arteriosclerosis, said Wallace M. Long, director of the Long Funeral Home in Bethlehem.
        Mr. Martin, who joined Bethlehem Steel as a repairman's helper in 1922 at the age of 19, was the company's chairman from 1964 to 1970. It was a period of often bitter contention between the Federal Government and the steel industry.
        Both the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations repeatedly clashed with the major steel companies over the industry's price increases.
        Mr. Martin, as a senior executive and then the chief executive of the nation's second-largest steel company, was prominent in defending the industry against Federal antitrust charges.  But in 1965 eight steel companies, including United States Steel and Bethlehem Steel, were fined $50,000 each, the maximum fines permitted.  Early Start at Bethlehem
        As it turned out, the antitrust case coincided with the end of an era. The American steel industry soon entered a period of decline from which it has not recovered.
        Mr. Martin, a Chicago native, graduated from the Stevens Institute of Technology at 19 and immediately signed on with Bethlehem Steel. At 26 he was named superintendent of four company mills and began his climb through the ranks. He became a company vice president in 1958, president in 1960, vice chairman in 1963 and chairman in 1964.
        He was a director of the American Iron and Steel Institute and of J. P. Morgan & Company and a trustee of the Automotive Safety Foundation, Stevens Institute of Technology and the Bethlehem Area Foundation.
        Mr. Martin's wife, the former Frances Taylor, died in 1980. He is survived by two daughters, Barbara M. Stout and Bettie Martin, both of Bethlehem; two grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
