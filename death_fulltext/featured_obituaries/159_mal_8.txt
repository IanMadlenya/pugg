        Charles Elson, a prolific designer who devised the sets and lighting for  scores of productions on Broadway and in London, died on Thursday at his home in Armonk, N.Y. He was 90.
        A graduate of the Yale School of Drama, Mr. Elson received his first Broadway credit in July 1945 with a modern version of Shakespeare's ''As You Like It,'' imported to the President Theater on West 48th Street from a production at the University of Washington in Seattle.
        The production was not well liked by critics, but Mr. Elson's sleek and utilitarian designs were. The production was the first of a string of Broadway designs for Mr. Elson, including productions of ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' ''Henry IV'' and ''Private Lives,'' with Tallulah Bankhead.
        Mr. Elson traced his affinity for the theater to his childhood in Chicago, where he became involved in the theater program at the Hull House, a settlement home. The experience sparked a desire to teach, which took him to several universities, including Yale and the City University of New York, where he helped establish master's and doctoral programs in theater.
        Beyond Broadway, Mr. Elson was  active in dance and opera -- his set for ''Madame Butterfly'' at the Metropolitan Opera was used for more than 20 years -- and on the West End in London. He also served as a cultural attache for the State Department in Southeast Asia during the early 1970's, and edited two volumes of technical writing on stage design.
        He is survived by a daughter, Alexandra, of New York; a brother, Alex, of Chicago; and a sister, Elizabeth Cohen of Newtown, Pa.
