        Lord Gormley, who as Joe Gormley led the 240,000 members of Britain's National Union of Mineworkers in strikes that jolted the country in 1972 and 1974, died Thursday at his home in Wigan, 17 miles north of Liverpool. He was 75.
        He had been suffering from cancer, the British newspaper The Independent reported.
        Lord Gormley, a former miner who was made a life peer in 1982, was president of the union from 1971 to 1982 and a member of its executive committee from 1957 to 1982. He was a member of the Labor Party's national executive committee from 1961 to 1973.
        The 1974 strike, in the winter, put Britain on a three-day work week and has been widely credited with breaking the Conservative Government of that day, led by Prime Minister Edward Heath.
        Joseph Gormley was born in the Lancashire village of Ashton-in-Makerfield, one of seven children. He began working in the coal pits at 14 and spent almost 30 years working underground.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Sarah Ellen Mather, a son and a daughter.
