        Elaine P. Halperin, a translator and editor, died on Sunday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81 years old.
        She died of cancer, said her son, David.
        Mrs. Halperin's first major work of translation was Francis Ambriere's "Long Holiday," a World War II prison camp memoir published in 1948. She translated several other works of fiction and nonfiction from French into English, including Michael Bernanos's 1968 novel, "The Other Side of the Mountain," which won her the Scott Moncrieff Award for distinguished translation. She also translated "Jean Monnet and the United States of Europe" (1969) and "The Duel: De Gaulle and Pompidou" (1972).
        Mrs. Halperin's husband, S. William Halperin, died in 1979. In addition to her son David, a professor of literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she is survived by another son, John, Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.
