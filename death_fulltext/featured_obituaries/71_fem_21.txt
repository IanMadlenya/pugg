        She died of colon cancer, said her son David.
        Joining the Public Library as a clerk at the Aguilar Branch Library in Harlem in 1945, Mrs. Rollock rose to become coordinator of Children's Services in 1974, a post she held until retirement.
        For nearly a decade, she moderated the weekly show, "World of Children's Literature," on WNYC public radio, receiving the International Reading Association's media award for radio in 1982.
        Mrs. Rollock was former president of the New York Black Librarians Caucas and a past president of the children's divisions of the American Library Association and the New York Library Association.
        She was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree in Library Science from Columbia University.
        She is the author of two books, "Black Authors and Illustrators of Children's Books," published in 1992 by Garland Publishing, and "Public Library Services for Children," published in 1988 by Library Professional Publications. She also edited the 1974, 1979 and 1984 editions of "The Black Experience in Children's Literature," a bibliography, published by the New York Public Library.
        Besides her son David, of Zionsville, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Howard, and another son, Phillip Theodore, also of Brooklyn.
