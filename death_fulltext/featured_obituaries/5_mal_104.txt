        Richard Drayne, public affairs counsel for CBS News in Washington and a former press secretary and adviser to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, died of cancer yesterday at his home in Washington. He was 49 years old.
        Mr. Drayne served as press secretary to Senator Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, from 1965 to 1975 and again in 1979, when he joined the Kennedy Presidential campaign staff. He joined CBS News in 1980.
        ''It's a special tragedy when a man as fine as Dick Drayne dies so young,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a statement. ''No one gave greater loyalty or wiser advice to the Kennedy family.''
        In 1975, Mr. Drayne was an adviser in Sargent Shriver's Presidential campaign, and was a political and communications consultant in Washington from 1977 to 1979.
        Mr. Drayne, who was born in Pittsburgh and attended Georgetown University and Penn State University, began his newspaper career as a copy editor at The Washington Post in 1960. He became a television news editor in Boston in 1963 and joined Senator Kennedy's staff in 1965.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and four children: Michael, Elizabeth, Katherine and Susanna.
