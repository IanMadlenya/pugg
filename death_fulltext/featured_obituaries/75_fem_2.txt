        Rachel Davis DuBois, an educator who 60 years ago developed multicultural programs promoting respect for ethnic heritage and harmony between groups, died on Tuesday at a hospital near her home in Woodstown, N.J. She was 101.
        Counter to the philosophy of the time that promoted ethnic assimilation, Dr. Dubois was among the few educators preaching that differences should be celebrated. Her work drew on her own Quaker background and her discovery of children in southern New Jersey who felt inferior and ashamed of their Italian heritage.
        "With the diversity of religious and racial groups in this country, tolerance and understanding demand some appreciation of the group contributions in culture," she said in 1933.
        Dr. DuBois wrote books and founded several private groups: the Inter-Cultural Education Workshop, Fellowship Farm, Workshop for Cultural Democracy, Livingroom Gatherings and the Atlanta Dialogue Center.
        She developed a widely copied technique called group conversation that uses a common experience, like spring festivals, for people to learn about each other's customs, which often prove similar.
        At New York City schools, she organized festivals on the music, dance and food of different cultures and presented plays portraying friction and harmony.
        For the U.S. Education Department, she developed a radio series, "Americans All, Immigrants All," in 1940. In 1951 the State Department sent her to Germany to work with peoples resettled after World War II.
        She was involved in peace and civil rights efforts and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Margaret Mead, among others.
        A native of Clarksboro, N.J., she graduated from Bucknell University and received a doctorate at Columbia. She taught there and at New York University. Her husband, Nathan, died in 1915.
