        Dr. Erich Schatzki, an internationally known aeronautical engineer and aircraft designer, died Aug. 28 at a nursing home in Palo Alto, Calif. A resident of Palo Alto, he was 93 years old.
        A native of Germany, he became involved in the early development of the aircraft industry there after World War I, joining Junkers, the aircraft builder, and the budding Lufthansa airline as a test pilot and then commercial pilot.
        In the United States, he was engaged in the development of the P-47 Thunderbolt fighter. One of his other contributions in the early stages of jet aviation was a system of jet power "pods" that boosted propeller-driven cargo planes lifting off short runways with heavier loads.
        Dr. Schatzkiis survived by his wife, Hedda; a son, Thomas, of Berkeley, Calif.; a daughter, Karin Arlin, of Huntington, L.I.; and four grandchildren.
