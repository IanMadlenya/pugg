        After starting as a reporter for The Philadelphia Public Ledger in 1929, Mr. Miller entered book publishing with Charles E. Merrill Company. In 1953 he created the Weekly Readers Children's Book Club.
        His presidency of Bobbs Merrill was marked by the publication of ''The Joy of Cooking,'' a leading best seller. Bobbs Merrill was later sold and, in 1985, dissolved by another purchaser, Macmillan.
        Recently Mr. Miller was involved in Dial-a-Children's Story Service. His wife, the actress Mala Powers, narrated. He also recently published ''The New Lexicon Dictionary of Basic Words,'' a reference book for children.
        Mr. Miller is survived by his wife, two sons and six grandchildren.
