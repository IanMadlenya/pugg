        Ronald Wogaman, the former director of education at the South Street Seaport Museum, died on Saturday at the New York University Medical Center. He was 40 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of AIDS, his companion, David M. Kahn, said.
        Mr. Wogaman was born in West Alexandria, Ohio, and received master's degrees in anthropology and museum education. In 1980, he became the head of the history division at the Oakland Museum in California, and was responsible for creating a permanent gay and lesbian exhibition, the first in a major museum.
        He joined the South Street Seaport Museum in 1986 and worked there two years, until he became ill.
        He is survived by his mother, Bernice, and a sister, Joyce Utsinger, both of West Alexandria, and a brother, Robert, of Albuquerque.
