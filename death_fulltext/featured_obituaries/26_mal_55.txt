        Roger-Patrice Pelat, a longtime friend of President Francois Mitterrand, died today in a hospital three weeks after he was charged in an insider-trading scandal that had embarrassed France's Socialist Government. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Pelat, retired chairman of a military contracting concern, was admitted to the American Hospital in Neuilly on Feb. 27 suffering a pulmonary embolism and died of a heart attack today, a hospital spokeswoman said. Agence France-Presse reported that Mr. Mitterrand went to the hospital after hearing of Mr. Pelat's death.
        Mr. Pelat and Mr. Mitterrand met in a German prisoner-of-war camp and fought together in the French Resistance.
        Speaking on television on Feb. 12, Mr. Mitterrand defended Mr. Pelat as a man of courage and integrity, but said that if he were found guilty of an offense, ''then in my role as President I would not be able to maintain the same kind of friendship I have had with him for so long.''
        Four days later, Mr. Pelat was charged with receiving insider information that allowed him to buy shares of Triangle Industries, an American company, shortly before the French state-owned aluminum manufacturer Picheney offered a much higher price last year in a successful takeover.
        Mr. Pelat and his family sold their shares after the price soared, making a profit of about $350,000.
