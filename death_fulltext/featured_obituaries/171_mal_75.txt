        James Estes Baker, a former Foreign Service officer and the first black American diplomat posted to South Africa during apartheid, died on April 15 at Roosevelt Hospital in New York. He was 66 and lived in Sag Harbor, N.Y., and Greenwich Village.
        The cause was lung disease, said his companion, John R. Hawkins.
        Mr. Baker was born in Suffolk, Va. He graduated from Haverford College in 1956 and from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University the next year. He was an economics specialist at the United States Embassy in Pretoria from 1973 to 1975.
        After joining the diplomatic corps in 1960, Mr. Baker left in 1980 to direct economic and emergency relief programs at the United Nations, until 1995. He then taught courses on diplomacy and disaster relief as an adjunct professor at Long Island University.
        Besides Mr. Hawkins, survivors include a brother, Percy, of Santa Rosa, Calif.
