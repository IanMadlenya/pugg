        Merle Eugene Curti, a scholar of American history and a Pulitzer-Prize winning author, died March 9 at the Methodist Retirement Center in Madison, Wis. He was 98 and lived in Madison.
        Dr. Curti spent 26 years on the faculty of the University of Wisconsin. He retired in 1968 as Frederick Jackson Turner Professor emeritus.
        He won the 1944 Pulitzer Prize in history for "The Growth of American Thought," an intellectual history of the United States published by Harper & Brothers. The book has since gone into a third edition and remains in print, as  do a dozen other books he wrote, contributed to or edited.
        Topics he dealt with included the social ideas of American educators, American scholarship in the 20th century and American philanthropy at home and abroad. His "Roots of American Loyalty" (1946) provided the first historical overview of what patriotism meant to Americans throughout the country's existence.
        "The Making of an American Community; A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County" (1959) was received as a scholarly landmark in the field of social history. His writings in professional journals shed a liberal perspective on education, immigration, peace movements, intellectual movements and the wrongs of racism.
        Dr. Curti was born in 1897 in Papillion, Neb., and graduated from Harvard University in 1920. He also received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard.
        Before he joined the faculty in Madison in 1942, he taught at Beloit College, Smith College and Columbia University.
        He is survived by a daughter, Sister Felicitas Curti of Shaw Island, Wash.; three grandsons, and a great-granddaughter.
