        J. Bruno Benziger, co-founder of the Glen Ellen Winery in California, died of heart failure on Monday at his farmhouse in Glen Ellen, the Sonoma County town for which the winery is named. He was 64 years old.
        Until eight years ago Mr. Benziger, a native of the Bronx, was a principal in his family's import-export business, Park, Benziger & Company, based in White Plains.
        In 1981, two years after a son, Michael, had gone to California to learn winemaking, Mr. Benzinger sold his interest in Park, Benziger and moved to Glen Ellen to join Michael in building the wine business.
        The winery, which produces varietal wines like chardonnay and cabernet to sell at moderate prices, was an instant success. By 1983 Glen Ellen was shipping at a rate of 50,000 cases annually; this year the winery will sell 3.2 million cases for gross revenue of $90 million. All seven of Mr. Benziger's children, five sons and two daughters, are active in managing the winery.
        Mr. Benziger, a Marine Corps veteran of World War II, received a bachelor's degree at Fordham University.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Williamson; their sons, Michael, Robert, Joseph, Gerard and Christopher; their daughters, H. Patricia Wallace and Kathrine; a brother, Paul, and a sister, Nancy Connellan, both of Bronxville, N.Y., and 10 grandchildren.
