        The former New York State assemblyman Lucio F. Russo and his wife, Tina I. Russo, were killed on Tuesday in an automobile accident near their winter home in Boynton Beach, Fla. He was 91 and she 90.
        The couple, who were residents of Todt Hill, Staten Island, had been married for 65 years.
        Their deaths were announced in the Assembly in Albany by two fellow Staten Islanders, Assemblyman John W. Lavelle and Senator John J. Marchi.
        Mr. Russo, a Republican-Conservative, served in the Assembly from 1953 to 1974. He was considered an effective spokesman for his constituency and was active in the fight to close the Fresh Kills landfill. He left the Assembly after losing the Republican primary to Guy V. Molinari in 1974.
        Born in New Castle, Pa., Lucio Francis Russo graduated from Fordham Law School. He practiced law on Staten Island and was active in civic groups.
        Tina Iarossi Russo was born in the Bronx. She was the founder of the Staten Island chapter of the March of Dimes in 1953 and served as its general chairwoman. In 1972, she helped organize its first walk-a-thon on Staten Island.
        The couple are survived by two sons, Thomas A. and Anthony J., both of Manhattan; Mr. Russo's brother, Alfred, of Florida; and five grandchildren.
