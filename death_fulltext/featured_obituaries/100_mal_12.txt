        Howard Edmund Wooden, a museum director and art historian, died on Friday at the Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, Kan. He was 75 and lived in Wichita.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Virginia.
        Mr. Wooden was born in Baltimore and graduated from Johns Hopkins University with a bachelor's degree in physics. He stayed on to study art and archeology, and earned a master's degree. He went to Greece on a Fulbright scholarshipin the early 1950's and taught in Athens.
        He began his career in art in the 1960's, teaching art history at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He was the director of the Sheldon Swope Art Museum in Terre Haute, Ind., from 1967 to 1975, when he became the director of the Wichita Art Museum. He remained there until he retired in 1989.
        He was the author of "The Art of the Great Depression," a study of the paintings and sculpture of the 1930's, published by the Wichita Art Museum.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Lee Hyde, and a son, Howard Jr., both of Terre Haute; a sister, Maria Wooden of Temple Terrace, Fla.; three grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
