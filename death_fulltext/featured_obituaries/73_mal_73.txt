        Philip Lawrence Birrell Iglehart, an investor and an accomplished polo player, died on Tuesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. A resident of nearby Lakewood, he was 80.
        His family said he died after a brief illness.
        Born in Vina del Mar, Chile, Mr. Iglehart attended Yale University. As a vice president of the Grace Lines Shipping Company, he was recruited by the Department of Defense in World War II for a position in charge of American commercial shipping in the Atlantic.

        A former seven-goal polo player, he founded the Gulfstream Polo Club and Florida Polo in Lake Worth. He was also instrumental in establishing the National Museum of Polo and Hall of Fame. He was recently voted into the Hall of Fame and was to have been inducted next month.
        He is survived by his daughter, Anita Corning Iglehart Swatkovsky of Hubbardsville, N.Y.; two sons, David C., of Owings Mills, Md., and Philip C., of Glyndon, Md.; a brother, Stewart B., of Gulfstream, Fla.; seven grandchildren and a great-grandson.
