        Ralph E. Adams, a World War II submariner who helped rescue a downed flier who is now President of the United States, died of cancer at his home on April 21. He was 76 years old.  Mr. Adams, a career Navy sailor, was was part of a rescue party sent from the submarine Finback on Sept. 4, 1944, to pick up Lieut. (j.g.) George Bush, one of the lieutenant's crewmen, and three fliers from another plane shot down by the Japanese. They were found in a rubber raft about 70 miles off Osaka, Japan. Lieutenant Bush had been piloting a single-engine bomber.
        ''I was one of the four men in our 'man overboard party' that went for them,'' Mr. Adams said in a November 1988 interview. ''I was in the party because I was the best swimmer.
        ''I think that Bush and the others were suprised that they were going to have to stay with us so long. I think they thought we'd take them right back to their carrier or right to some American base. But our orders were to stay at sea, on lifeguard duty, for another 30 days.''
        Lieutenant Bush and the other Navy airmen stayed aboard the Finback until the boat reached Midway Island around Oct. 15, 1944, Mr. Adams said in the interview.
        Mr. Adams was born in Crete, Ill., and served in the Navy from 1929 until 1933, rejoined in 1940 and retired as a chief petty officer in 1970.
