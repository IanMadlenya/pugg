        Glenn Odekirk, the designer and builder of Howard Hughes's giant flying boat, the Spruce Goose, which flew only once, died of cancer Monday at Nathan Adelson Hospice. He was 81 years old.
        Mr. Odekirk was a former superintendent of the Hughes Aircraft Company who was a friend and co-pilot of the late billionaire.
        In a 1981 interview, Mr. Odekirk said he developed the idea of a flying boat while talking to Henry J. Kaiser, the shipbuilder, in 1942 about how fast his ships were being blown up by German submarines.
        ''Well, I guess I'll have to put wings on my boat,'' Mr. Odekirk recalled Mr. Kaiser as saying.
        Mr. Odekirk recalled working a deal with Hughes and Kaiser to design and build flying cargo boats that could pass over the German submarines.
        Only one was built. The plane, built of wood, weighed 200 tons and had a wingspan slightly longer than a football field. It was 218 feet long and 79 feet high.
        On Nov. 2, 1947, five years after design work began on the HK-1 Hercules, Mr. Hughes took the plane on a brief flight 70 feet above the water. The Spruce Goose now serves as a museum and sits next to the Queen Mary in Long Beach, Calif.
        Mr. Odekirk is survived by a daughter and a sister.
