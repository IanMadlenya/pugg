        E. Clark Stillman, a collector and dealer in rare books, died last Wednesday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, said Herman Liebaers, a friend of 50 years.
        Mr. Stillman, whose interest in rare books dated from his teen-age years, taught English at the University of Michigan for several years, after which he went to work full time for the Belgian American Educational Foundation. Over six decades he acquired thousands of titles on many subjects and periods, and in 1993 the Pierpont Morgan Library named him a fellow in perpetuity for his support.
        At the time, the library exhibited his 14th- and 16th-century books of hours, and a trove of his medieval manuscripts and early printed books have become part of the Morgan Library's permanent collection.
        In the mid-1970's, Mr. Stillman became a partner in Lathrop C. Harper Inc., a New York dealer in rare books. The company was sold 15 years ago, when Mr. Stillman retired.
        With his wife, he also collected Congolese art, which now forms the Clark and Frances Stillman Collection of Congo Sculpture at the Dallas Museum of Art.
        Mr. Stillman and his wife, Frances Jennings Stillman, also collaborated on many translations of Belgian poetry from the French and Flemish. She died in 1975 after 43 years of marriage.
        A native of Eureka, Utah, he graduated from Michigan, where he also received a master's degree in 1930.
        He is survived by two sisters, Huldah Cochran of Columbus, Ohio, and Florence Campbell of Cincinnati.
