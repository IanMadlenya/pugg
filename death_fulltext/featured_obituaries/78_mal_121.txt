        Frederick A. Sundermann, a former president and chairman of the National Bank of Westchester, died on Thursday at a hospice in Derwood, Md. He was 74. A Westchester resident for nearly all his life, he most recently lived in Kensington, Md.
        The cause was Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        After serving as chairman of National Bank in White Plains, he became executive vice president of its parent company, Lincoln First Banks of Rochester. He retired in 1978. He was a past chairman of the board of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y., and a member of the College Council of State University of New York College at Purchase.
        Mr. Sundermann's first wife, the former Ruth Boland, died. He is survived by his wife, Celeste Boland Sundermann, her sister; two sons and a daughter from his first marriage, Paul of Santa Ana, Calif., Mark of Marlborough, Conn., and Anne Diedrick of Rye, N.Y.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
