        Mr. Mitchell, of Lake Forest, Ill., founded Mitchell and Hutchins & Company, an investment and banking concern, in Chicago after World War I. He moved it away from banking and investment shortly before the stock market crash of 1929, allowing the company to survive the Depression. Mr. Mitchell was a director of Texaco Inc. and of the Continental Illinois National Bank of Chicago for more than 30 years.
        He was a life trustee of Northwestern University and Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
