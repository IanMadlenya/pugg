        Jerry Yulsman, a tail gunner on World War II bomber flights who later wrote a ''what if'' novel in which Hitler is killed in 1913, died on Friday at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 75 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Barbara Woike.
        Reviewing the book ''Elleander Morning'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1984, David Myers observed that in it, ''Nazi Germany, World War II, the death camps, Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima'' do not happen. But other terrible things are plotted.
        ''It isn't clear if Mr. Yulsman intended his first novel to be a cautionary tale,'' he added, but in it ''historical reality succeeds fantasy with a jarring return.''
        Mr. Yulsman's novel ''The Last Liberator'' (1992) was about American bombers attacking the Ploesti oil field in Romania in 1943.
        He also wrote a pseudonymous ''adult'' paperback trilogy, ''The Intimate Memoir of Dame Jenny Everleigh,'' published in the 1980's.
        For years Mr. Yulsman was a professional photographer, and his best-remembered pictures are portraits of Jack Kerouac in a bar. He also taught at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
        During World War II he rose to master sergeant, served in North Africa and Europe and won the Distinguished Flying Cross and other decorations.
        He was born in Philadelphia and attended high school there. His first marriage was annulled. His second and third marriages ended in divorce.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Tom, of Boulder, Colo.; two grandchildren, and a brother, Robert, of Blue Bell, Pa.
