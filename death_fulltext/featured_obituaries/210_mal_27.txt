        Walter Wager, a novelist whose crime and spy thrillers -- among them ''58 Minutes,'' which became the Bruce Willis film ''Die Hard 2'' -- amounted to a catalog of modern mayhem, nuclear and otherwise, died on Sunday at Amsterdam House, a home for the elderly in Manhattan. A resident of the Upper West Side, he was 79.
        The cause was complications of brain cancer, his family said.
        Starting in 1956 with ''Operation Intrigue,'' written under the name Walter Herman, he published more than 30 novels and books of nonfiction. Besides ''58 Minutes'' (mercenaries take over an airport control tower), two other novels became movies: ''Telefon'' (Macmillan, 1975), a spy movie with the same title with Charles Bronson in 1977, and ''Viper Three'' (Macmillan, 1971), which became ''Twilight's Last Gleaming'' (1977) with Burt Lancaster and Richard Widmark.
        Other novels currently in print include ''Designated Hitter'' (Arbor House, 1982); ''Otto's Boy'' (Macmillan, 1985), about nerve gas on a subway train; ''The Spirit Team'' (Forge, 1996); and ''Tunnel'' (Forge, 2000), about a fiendish plot involving the Lincoln Tunnel.
        He wrote a farce, ''My Side, by King Kong as Told to Walter Wager'' (Macmillan, 1976). Under the pseudonym John Tiger, he wrote action thrillers for original paperbacks that grew out of the television shows ''I Spy'' and ''Mission Impossible.''
        Walter Herman Wager was born on Sept. 4, 1924, in the Bronx and graduated from Columbia College in 1943 and Harvard Law School in 1946. He received a master's in aviation law at Northwestern University in 1949 and spent a year at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar.
        He started writing freelance in 1951 but was rarely without a job to fall back on. He wrote and produced for CBS radio and television and for NBC-TV, and was editor in chief at Playbill from 1963 to 1966.
        From then until 1978 he worked at the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers as editor of Ascap Today and later as public relations director. In the early 1990's he was director of public information for the University of Bridgeport.
        Mr. Wager is survived by his wife of 29 years, Winifred McIvor Wager; a daughter from a previous marriage, Lisa Wager of Manhattan; and two granddaughters. His first marriage, to Sylvia Leonard, ended in divorce; she died in 1998.
        Correction:  July 17, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on Wednesday about Walter Wager, a writer of crime and spy thrillers, misstated the year his first wife, Sylvia Leonard, died. It was 1989, not 1998.
