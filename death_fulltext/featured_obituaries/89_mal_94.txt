        Henry Marx, editor of the German-language newspaper Aufbau in New York City and a leading figure in German literature, theater and music in the city, died Wednesday while vacationing in Adelboden, Switzerland.
        He was 82 and lived in Manhattan. His family said he died of pneumonia.
        Mr. Marx had been editor of Aufbau, which means building up, since 1985. The newspaper publishes articles for German-speaking readers every other week. It initially catered to Jewish refugees from Germany and reached its largest circulation in the 1930's and 1940's.
        Mr. Marx also was vice president of the Kurt Weill Foundation for Music, which promotes and safeguards the composer's works, and vice president of the Erwin Piscator Memorial Foundation New York, which is preserving material related to the work of the theater director.
        After attending law, medical and drama schools in Germany, Mr. Marx was briefly confined in the Nazi concentration camp in Oranienburg in 1934 before he left Germany in 1937. He initially was music critic for New Yorker Staats-Zeitung & Herold.
        He was director of cultural programs for the United States and Canada at Goethe House New York-German Cultural Center at 1014 Fifth Avenue from 1969 to 1980. He also was a co-founder of German Theater New York.
        He held the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit, awarded by the Federal Republic of Germany in recognition of his German cultural efforts.
        Mr. Marx wrote about 20 books on German arts and music. He also lectured extensively in Germany and Austria.
        Mr. Marx is survived by his wife, Carin Drechsler-Marx, a photographer, and a daughter, Katrina, a teaching assistant at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu.
