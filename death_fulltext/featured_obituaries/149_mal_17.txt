        William Schuyler Pettit, president of Ursinus College until a dispute with the faculty led him to resign in 1976, died on May 25 at a nursing home in Naples, Fla. He was 90.
        In his six years as president of Ursinus, a liberal arts institution in Collegeville, Pa., Mr. Pettit dealt with student and faculty protests against the Vietnam War. But it was the faculty's anger over low pay and lack of participation in governance that drove Mr. Pettit from office.
        Matters culminated in 1975 when the college's board of directors received a letter from 38 faculty members who detailed their concerns. Mr. Pettit thought that the faculty members had gone behind his back by writing to the board, and he opposed their demands.
        Louis Decatur, an English professor who remembers the time of strife, said Mr. Pettit's troubles were inevitable because ''he was president at a time when colleges were becoming liberal and Ursinus was still very conservative.''
        Mr. Pettit, who was born in Burlington, N.J., received bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania.
        He joined the Ursinus faculty as a chemistry instructor in 1933 and was dean of the college for 15 years before becoming its president.
        Mr. Pettit's wife, Marion Burgstresser, died in 1979. He is survived by a daughter, Isabelle Pettit Seeman of Dallas.
