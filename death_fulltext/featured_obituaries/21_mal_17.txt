        Mr. Fried, who was born in New York City, began in the shoe business in 1905 as an errand boy with Joseph Siegal Shoes in Manhattan. He became a partner in the company, which in 1931 opened National Shoe Stores. By the late 1960's the company, of which he was president, had more than 200 shoe outlets. He retired in 1980.
        He was also president of the Fried Foundation and he served as a chairman of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, United Jewish Appeal.
        He is survived by two daughters, Cynthia Lewin of Manhattan and Lucille Graham of Boca Raton, Fla.; three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
