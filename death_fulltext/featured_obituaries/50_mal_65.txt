        Donald H. Klein, executive vice president of the American Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training Federation, died on Wednesday at Bellevue Hospital. He was 58 years old and lived in Stamford, Conn.
        He died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the family said.
        He joined the federation, known as ORT, in 1980. It is a Manhattan-based umbrella organization for groups around the country with a total of 140,000 members. A primarily Jewish volunteer group, ORT has concentrated its efforts on raising money for the 800 vocational schools and training centers it runs in 35 countries.
        Earlier he had been assistant executive vice chairman of the National United Jewish Appeal here, and chief executive officer of Jewish federations in Hollywood, Fla., and Stamford.
        He was born in the Bronx and graduated from City College. He had a Master of Arts from the Columbia University School of Social Work.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Thea Shapiro; three sons, David, of Stamford, Andrew and Gary, both of Boston, and a daughter, Alisa, also of Boston.
