        Isaac E. Molho, the co-founder of the Librairie de France in Rockefeller Center, died of heart failure Monday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 83 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Born in Salonika, Greece, Mr. Molho came to New York in 1924. Four years later he co-founded, with Vitalis Crespin, the Librairie de France, selling French-language books and periodicals. In 1932, the store was one of the first retail tenants in Rockefeller Center, where it remains in the promenade opposite the Channel Garden.
        During World War II, when some French writers sought refuge in New York, Mr. Molho established Les Editions de la Maison Francaise to publish their works. He published Antoine de St. Exupery's ''Pilote de Guerre,'' Andre Maurois's ''Histoire des Etats-Unis'' and Jules Romains's ''Les Hommes de Bonne Volonte.''
        In 1967, Spanish books were added at the Librairie, and Mr. Milho opened the French & Spanish Book Corporation, at 115 Fifth Avenue. Mr. Molho worked at the bookstores until his death.
        He was awarded the Palmes Academiques and the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government and earned the Orden de Merito Civil from the Spanish Government.
        He is survived by his wife, Alvira; two sons, Emanuel, of South Orange, N.J., and David, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; two sisters, Grace Rubin of Brooklyn and Rebecca Sedacca of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.
