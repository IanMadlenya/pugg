        His sister, Joan Vawter, said he died of cancer.
        Mr. Foster, who studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and with Nadia Boulanger in Paris while serving in the United States Army, taught singing and vocal technique in Manhattan for three decades. He also taught at the Hartt School of Music of the University of Hartford for about 10 years, and was the accompanist with the Ambassadors of Music, a State Department program that presented concerts throughout the world.
        In addition to Mrs. Vawter, Mr. Foster is survived by his mother, Doris, of Rochester, and another sister, Barbara Duplesea of Riverton, Wyo.
