        Avon N. Williams Jr., a civil rights lawyer and former State Senator in Tennessee, died on Monday at Meharry-Hubbard Hospital in Nashville. He was 72.
        The cause was complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, said his daughter, Wendy Williams.
        In 1950, four years before the Supreme Court outlawed school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education, Mr. Williams filed Tennessee's first such case when he sued to integrate the public schools in Anderson County. In 1951, he sued to win admission for blacks to the University of Tennessee graduate school.
        He went before the Supreme Court seven times to argue cases involving discrimination in public schools, public housing or other public accommodations. He was also involved in efforts to desegregate golf courses and lunch counters.
        He began his career in Knoxville but moved to Nashville in the 1950's and was soon a leader in the legal battle to desegregate the public schools there. The Nashville suit, which he filed in 1956, led to a busing plan that was adopted 15 years later.
        Elected to the State Senate in 1968, he was one of the first blacks to serve in that body since the Civil War. As a Senator, he pressed to put guidance counselors in elementary schools, to make kindergarten classes mandatory and to build a new football stadium for Tennessee State University. He retired from the Legislature in 1990 and was named legislator of the year by the Black Caucus in 1991.
        Mr. Williams was born on Dec. 22, 1921, in Knoxville. He graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, N.C., in 1940, and earned his law degree from Boston University in 1948.
        In addition to his daughter, who lives in Chicago, he is survived by his wife, Joan, and a son, Avon 3d, of Nashville.
