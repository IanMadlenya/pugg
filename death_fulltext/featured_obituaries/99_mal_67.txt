        Charles B. Lawrence, who was a justice of the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court, died on April 3 in the Brooklyn Hospital Center. He was 75 and lived in Brooklyn.
        He died after a brief illness, his family said.
        Justice Lawrence was appointed to the Appellate Division's Second Department, based in Brooklyn, by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1984. He was on judicial panels that made rulings in cases that stemmed from the political scandal surrounding Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide in spring 1986.
        In 1988, one panel threw out the conviction of a public relations consultant on charges that he had collaborated with Mr. Manes in soliciting a $250,000 bribe for awarding a cable television franchise. The court also dismissed the indictment on which the conviction had been based.
        Justice Lawrence's judicial career began in 1970 when he was elected a judge of the Civil Court of the City of New York. From 1972 to 1978, he was an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. He was elected to the Supreme Court in 1978 and appointed to the Appellate Division six years later.
        After receiving an undergraduate degree from City College in 1941, he was a staff sergeant in the Army during World War II. He graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1950.
        Justice Lawrence is survived by a son, Charles Mark Lawrence, a daughter, Paula E. White, and a brother, Walter, all of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.
