        Merle C. Worster, a former broadcasting executive and mayor of Upper Saddle River, N.J., died in his sleep on Saturday at his home in Upper Saddle River. He was 74 years old.
        He died of bone cancer, family members said.
        Mr. Worster spent more than four decades in broadcasting, starting as an engineer with NBC and retiring in 1980 as vice president in charge of broadcast operations and engineering for WABC-TV in New York City.
        A resident of Upper Saddle River for the last 36 years, Mr. Worster was president of the borough's council from 1981 to 1984, when he was elected mayor. He was re-elected in 1988 and served until he resigned two months ago because of illness.
        Mr. Worster was an amateur radio operator when he joined NBC in 1939. He was a shipboard radio operator before becoming a Navy lieutenant in the South Pacific in World War II.
        His first wife died in 1978. He is survived by his second wife, the former Jean Gould; a daughter, Jean Parker of Middletown, N.Y.; a son, Lawrence, of Wharton, N.J.; two sisters, Barbara Pell of Manasquan, N.J., and Petti Herndon of Albuquerque, N.M.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
