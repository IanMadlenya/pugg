        John J. Smith, a senior partner at the stock brokerage firm of Fahnestock & Company and a former professional squash racquets player, died yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 75 years old and had been suffering from liver cancer.
        Mr. Smith, who was born on May 31, 1913, in Philadelphia, attended the University of Pennsylvania briefly in the 1930's and then became a professional squash player, first at the Pennsylvania Athletic Club in Philadelphia and later at the Rockaway Hunting Club in Cedarhurst, L.I.
        In 1943, he joined Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, the liquor company, to help oversee accounts. He also regained his amateur standing as a squash player, and by the end of the 1943-44 season, was ranked as the No. 1 player in the New York region.
        That winter, he and M. Donald Grant won the Metropolitan Doubles and Canadian Doubles championships. Mr. Grant was later a colleague at Fahnestock and the chairman of the New York Mets.
        Mr. Smith won the Metropolitan Doubles title again in 1947, with Germain Glidden. In the 1948 United States Doubles Championship in Baltimore, Mr. Smith and Donald Strachan lost in the finals.
        He joined Fahnestock in 1946 and became a partner in 1957. He was widely quoted as a stock analyst and also wrote a market newsletter.
        He is survived by his wife, Nora O'Leary, a senior editor at Family Circle magazine; two sons, Stephen, of Manhattan, executive editor of Newsweek magazine, and Richard of Washington, a project officer at the United States Institute of Peace; two daughters, Wendy Born of Philadelphia, a restaurant manager, and Nancy Nebeker of Bangkok, Thailand, a homemaker, and nine grandchildren.
