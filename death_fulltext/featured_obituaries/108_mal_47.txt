        William Bloor, who arrived at Columbia University as a freshman in 1928 and retired in 1979 as its treasurer, overseeing a portfolio of $500 million in securities and real-estate investments, died on Monday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 86 and a longtime resident of the New York Athletic Club on Central Park South.
        Mr. Bloor, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from the college in 1932 and  joined the treasurer's office as a manager of buildings on Morningside Heights.  He advanced to assistant treasurer in 1948 and became treasurer seven years later.
        Mr. Bloor, who watched both investments and cash flow for Columbia, was in charge of the fifth largest university endowment portfolio in the country. In the 15 years since his retirement, the endowment has grown to $2.2 billion.
        During his tenure, Columbia's neighborhood was deteriorating, and the university came under attack for its handling of its real-estate holdings in the area. Some community groups accused Columbia of seeking to drive the poor and minority tenants from buildings it bought for faculty housing.
        One point of tension was the Bryn Mawr, a six-story single-room-occupancy building at the northeast corner of the campus that was a known haven for drug dealers and prostitutes. After quarreling in and out of the courts, Columbia and other neighborhood institutions took possession in 1965, and it was eventually torn down for a Barnard College dormitory.
        In the 1960's, with economic and social conditions on the Upper West Side in  decline, Mr. Bloor's office turned to investing outside New York City, including high-rise faculty housing just across the George Washington Bridge.
        Mr. Bloor, who never married, is survived by a brother, James, of Hilton Head Island, S.C.
