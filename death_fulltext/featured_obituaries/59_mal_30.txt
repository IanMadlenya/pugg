        Richard B. Strouse, a retired writer and public relations executive, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        He began his career writing for film studios in Los Angeles and doing short stories as a freelancer for magazines. He served from 1941 to 1946 in the Army, where he helped make military films and attained the rank of major. After World War II, he resumed writing short stories and also wrote a number of articles for The New York Times Magazine.
        In the early 1950's, he headed publicity for the United World Federalist, an organization advocating international cooperation. He then joined a corporate public relations agency, where his accounts included the builder William Levitt and Schenley Affiliated Brands. He later worked for Schenley until he retired in 1984.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Anne Macdonald Rosenbaum.
