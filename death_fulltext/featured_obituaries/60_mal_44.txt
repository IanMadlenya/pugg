        Andrew Marton, a film director who specialized in action scenes like the chariot race in the 1959 "Ben Hur," died on Tuesday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 83 years old and lived in Los Angeles.
        He died of pneumonia, said his sister, Elisabeth, of New York City.
        Mr. Marton, who was born in Hungary and grew up in the Tyrolean Alps, used to say that he became fond of spectacular scenery at an early age. His first film was about skiing.
        That led a Hollywood producer to bring him to the United States to direct ski sequences in "Two-Faced Woman" (1942), starring Greta Garbo. Then another studio invited him to shoot film in Greenland for the comedy "North Pole, Ahoy!"
        In 1950, M-G-M assigned him to replace Compton Bennett as director of the African epic "King Solomon's Mines" after Mr. Bennett became ill. Recycling a Film
        Mr. Marton's reputation for filming the unusual became secure in Hollywood after the 1951 release of "Storm Over Tibet," an adventure film. In 1936 Mr. Marton had shot about 50 minutes of the finished film during the first International Himalayan Expedition into unexplored territory of Tibet. On the Baltoro Glacier in the Karakorum range at an altitude of 26,000 feet, Mr. Marton later said, there was so little oxygen in the air that he had to blow on a match to light it.
        Released in prewar Germany under the title "Demon of the Himalayas," the film displeased Nazi censors, and few people saw it. After the war, Mr. Marton found a print of the film in Switzerland, secured the copyright and reused the Himalayan sequences in "Storm Over Tibet."
        In 1958, Mr. Marton took charge of filming the chariot race for William Wyler's "Ben Hur." He spent 4 months working on the 10-minute sequence.
        In addition to his sister, he is survived by his wife, Lacerta, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Tonda Marton-Beyer of New York City, and two stepdaughters.
