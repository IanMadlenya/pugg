        Dr. Martin H. Stein, a psychoanalyst who was president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society in the 1960's, died on April 19 at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 87 and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Dr. Stein retired about a year ago from his private psychoanalytic practice. He had practiced psychoanalysis for five decades.
        He also taught at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan and was chairman of its faculty in the 1970's. He headed the American Psychoanalytic Association's board on professional standards in the 1960's. And he was on the editorial boards of Psychoanalytic Quarterly and The Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association.
        Dr. Joan B. Erle, one of his colleagues, said in remarks before a professional gathering in 1986 that Dr. Stein wrote ''lucidly on complex and difficult analytic issues: acting out, masochism, states of consciousness, character theory, moral issues in psychoanalysis, mental health, the psychology of dreams.''
        Dr. Stein was born in Newark, N.Y., and grew up in Brooklyn. He received a bachelor's degree in 1932 from the College of the City of New York, earned his medical degree from Cornell in 1936 and was a New York University-Bellevue Hospital research fellow in neuropsychiatry in 1939 and 1940.
        Dr. Stein was an Army Medical Corps psychiatrist during World War II and after three years of training at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, he graduated in 1949.
        His first marriage, to Jane Knoob, ended in divorce.
        He is survived by his wife, Lucille Kuttner; two daughters, Maurine Stein of Chicago and Nora Stein of London, and three grandchildren.
