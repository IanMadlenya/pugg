        Paul W. Wright, a mathematics teacher and retired headmaster of the Groton School, died on Wednesday at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston. He was 87 and lived in Lexington, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, a Groton spokesman said.
        Mr. Wright began his 46-year career at Groton as a math teacher. He was appointed senior master in 1941, and he rose to become the headmaster in 1969, which he remained until his retirement in 1974. He was the fourth headmaster at the school, 30 miles northwest of Boston, since its founding in 1884.
        During his tenure, the Episcopal-oriented private preparatory institution underwent major changes. The student body became more diverse, reflecting varied geographic, economic and cultural backgrounds. An advocate of coeducation, Mr. Wright played an important role in preparing the all-boys school for the admission of girls, which occurred shortly after he retired.
        "This school never set out to train an elite class of leaders," Mr. Wright said in an interview in 1972 "We want to make our students useful citizens. If an opportunity presents itself to them to exercise leadership, we hope they would do it responsibly."
        After retiring from Groton, Mr. Wright began a new career in 1975 as a math teacher at the private Belmont Hill School in Belmont Hill, Mass., teaching there until 1987.
        He was born in Bellevue, Ohio, and graduated from high school there. He graduated from Williams College in 1927, magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.
        In 1987, the Paul W. Wright Chair in Mathematics was endowed at Groton by two graduates in his honor. Also that year, the Paul W. Wright Fund was established at Belmont Hill School by parents of students.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Margaret Ann Gainer; two sons, James of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and Paul of Princeton, N.J.; a daughter, Christina of Lexington, Mass., and two grandchildren.
