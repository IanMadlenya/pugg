        Gordon H. Cole, a longtime journalist who for three decades was editor of The Machinist, the newspaper of the International Association of Machinists and Aeropspace Workers, died last Friday at Fairfax Hospital in Virginia after a long battle with bone cancer. He was 76 years old and lived in Clifton, Va.
        Mr. Cole was editor of The Machinist from 1947 to 1976 and in the next 10 years was an adjunct professor of labor communications at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies in Silver Spring, Md.
        A native of Syracuse, Mr. Cole was a graduate of Syracuse University and began in journalism at The Syracuse Post-Standard. Later he covered Washington for The Wall Street Journal, The Labor Relations Reporter and PM.
        In his tenure at PM, Mr. Cole was involved in two noteworthy disputes.
        In 1942, he was the first male reporter to apply to cover a White House news conference by Eleanor Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt turned down the request, saying she considered ''this a woman's conference, dealing with questions of interest to women, from a woman's point of view.''
        In 1946, five of the six members of PM's Washington bureau staff resigned, accusing the paper's editor, Ralph Ingersoll, of yielding to Communist pressures in allowing ''the party line'' into the news columns. Mr. Cole was the lone staff member to remain.
        He is survived by his wife, Morag; two daughters, Susan Meyer of Waterbury, Conn., and Margaret Geiger of Everett, Wash., and three sons, Jeremy of Springfield, Mass., Gordon of Annandale, Va., and Stephen of Manhattan.
