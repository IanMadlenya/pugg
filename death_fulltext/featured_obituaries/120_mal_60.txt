        Edward M. Pflueger, who bridged the volatile realm of industrial chemicals and the delicate world of porcelain, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 91.
        In 1954, Mr. Pflueger established the United States operations of Bayer A.G., the German chemical corporation. He was chairman and president of the resulting company, ultimately called the Baychem Corporation, until his retirement in 1975.
        Mr. Pflueger (pronounced FLEW-ger), was born in Frankfurt and worked in the chemical business in London and later New York. In 1950, he formed a business to sell naphthenic acid and started doing business with Bayer.
        After the outbreak of World War I, Bayer's operations in the United States, including the rights to its brand of aspirin, were auctioned off. Mr. Pflueger was instrumental in re-establishing Bayer's presence in the United States.
        In the 1930's, Mr. Pflueger began to collect 17th-  and 18th-century porcelain figures. After his marriage to Kathleen Powers in 1943, she joined him in assembling what is now considered one of the largest private collections of porcelain dishes, tiles and animal and human figurines.
        He is survived by his wife. Besides a residence in Manhattan, Mr. Pflueger maintained a cattle farm in East Fishkill, N.Y.
