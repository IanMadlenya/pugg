        Raymond Bongiovanni, a film executive who acquired the novels "The Firm" and  "Nobody's Fool" for the screen, died on Wednesday at Christ Hospital in Jersey City. He was 41 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a blood infection, Michael Gabrieli, his brother, said.
        A native of Port Jefferson, L.I., Mr. Bongiovanni went to work for the Elaine Markson literary agency in the early 1980's and remained associated with  it until 1985. He later acquired literary properties for a company linked to Warner Bros.
        In 1992, Mr. Bongiovanni began running the New York office of Scott Rudin Productions. His acquisitions included John Grisham's "Firm" and Richard Russo's "Nobody's Fool." In January 1994, he was hired by 20th Century Fox.
        In addition to Mr. Gabrieli, of Phoenix, he is survived by his father, Joseph, of Hallandale, Fla., eight sisters and four brothers -- two of whom, like Mr. Gabrieli, have legally changed their last names: Joseph Jr., of Plainfield, Vt.; John, of Hamersley, Australia; Tony Roth of Venice Beach, Calif.; Victor Frost Bongiovanni of Manhattan; Mary Violette of Tampa, Fla.; Barbara, of Los Angeles; Joan Cararas of Bentonville, Ark.; Veer Tess Frost of Burlington, Vt.; Therese Berkoski of Miller Place, N.Y.; Josephine O'Prey of Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia; Gloria Reich of Manhattan, and Rose Cupo of Chandler, Ariz.
