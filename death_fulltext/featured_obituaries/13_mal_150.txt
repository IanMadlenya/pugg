        Mr. Iacucci, the owner of Goldstar Wines and Spirits in Forest Hills, Queens, was driving from Florence to Siena on one of his frequent visits to inspect vineyards.
        Mr. Iacucci, a native of Brooklyn, was a wholesale wine salesman before he entered the retail business in the 1960's. He had owned Goldstar, one of the largest retailers of Italian wines in the United States, for 12 years. He lectured frequently on wine and was widely consulted for his opinion of vintages.
        Surviving are his wife, the former Lucy Balsamo; and two daughters, Anna, of Manhattan, and Lisa, of Queens.
