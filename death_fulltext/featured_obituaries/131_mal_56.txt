        Charles E. Smith, a publisher of scholarly books and reference works, died on Dec. 7 at his home in Colt's Neck, N.J. He was 60.
        The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Denise, said.
        Mr. Smith began his career at the Macmillan publishing company, where he worked his way up from a college sales representative to editor in chief of the Free Press. In 1982, he became president and publisher of the Macmillan/Scribner Library Reference Division. He left Macmillan after 25 years and joined Simon & Schuster, where he started the academic reference division in 1989.
        Titles published under his aegis included Encyclopedia of the American Revolution and The D-Day Encyclopedia. He left Simon & Schuster to form his own company, Charles E. Smith Books, a packager of reference books.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Denise, of Aberdeen, N.J.; two sons, Chris, of Westfield, N.J., and Brian, of Colt's Neck, and four grandchildren.
