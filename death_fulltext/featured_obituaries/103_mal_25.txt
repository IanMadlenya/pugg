        Jack Neville Berkman, a communications executive and philanthropist, died on Thursday at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 90.
        At his death, Mr. Berkman was chairman of the Associated Group, a Pittsburgh-based enterprise involved in cable television, cellular telephones, radio paging and related businesses.
        Mr. Berkman was born in London, raised in Ohio and graduated from the University of Michigan. He went on to Harvard Law School and after graduating in 1929, established a law practice in Steubenville, Ohio.
        In 1940, he founded WSTV-AM in Steubenville, the first step toward his widening interests in communications. In 1963, his operations merged with the Rust Craft Greeting Card Company, becoming Rust-Craft Broadcasting.
        He moved to New York about 20 years ago and helped to turn Associated Communications into a catalyst of wireless communications.
        He was active on the Harvard College Board of Overseers and the Dean's Advisory Council at Harvard Law. He served as a member of the National Council of Rockefeller University, a director of the Mexican Cultural Institute and a founding member of the Japan Society.
        Mr. Berkman is survived by his wife, Lillian; three sons, Myles, of Pittsburgh, Stephen, of Cocoanut Grove, Fla, and Monroe, of Tampa, Fla; two brothers, Louis and Allen, both of Pittsburgh.
