        Rear Adm. Yohai Bin Nun, the commander of Israel's naval forces in the 1960's, died on Monday in the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 69 and lived in Kibbutz Maagan Michael in Israel.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, the Israeli consulate said.
        Born in Jerusalem in 1924, Admiral Bin Nun was a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He began his military career in 1944 in a naval unit of the Palmach, a Jewish military organization in Palestine.
        During Israel's war of independence in 1948, he helped organize a squadron of motor torpedo boats and was awarded the Medal of Heroism for commanding attacks on Egyptian warships. He commanded the Israeli naval forces from 1960 to 1966 and helped plan naval operations during the 1967 war in the Middle East.
        After his retirement, he helped found and became the director of the Institute for Research of Oceans and Lakes in Haifa.
        He is survived by his wife, Sayah; three daughters, and four grandchildren.
