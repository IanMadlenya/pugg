        The Rev. Charles E. F. Hoefner, a priest for 39 years at St. Ignatius Loyola Roman Catholic Church in Manhattan, died on Sunday at the Jesuit Infirmary at the Bronx campus of Fordham University. He was 88 years old.
        Father Hoefner died of cancer, said the Rev. Matthew Roche, director of communications for the Jesuits in the New York Province.
        Father Hoefner was a popular figure at St. Ignatius Loyola, at Park Avenue and 84th Street. He was also active in ecumenical work with Episcopal and Jewish organizations.
        He was born in Wellsville in upstate New York. After graduating from Canisius High School in Buffalo, he entered the Society of Jesus in 1932 and undertook his Jesuit studies at Shadowbrook Seminary in Lenox, Mass. He was ordained in 1935.
        He was a teacher at Canisius High School and Regis High School in Manhattan and was the dean of men at LeMoyne College in Syracuse. In 1953, he began working full time at St. Ignatius Loyola. He was appointed Prefect and Associate Pastor of the parish in 1964.
        He was a member of the Church Fellowship of Christians and Jews and the former honorary chaplain of the Venerable Order of St. John Hospitaller of Jerusalem. The order is a secular organization of the Episcopal Church that sponsors health and charitable works in Jerusalem.
