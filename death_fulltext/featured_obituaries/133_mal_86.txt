        Donald Flamm, a former New York broadcaster and theatrical producer who helped shape the notion of a Voice of America, died on Sunday at Good Samaritan Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. He was 98 and had homes in Palm Beach and Alpine, N.J.
        Mr. Flamm was a native of Pittsburgh and attended New York City public schools. He worked for the Shubert brothers and for such stars as Al Jolson and Milton Berle.
        He owned and operated WMCA radio from 1926 to 1941. His stewardship there included disagreements with Federal regulators, a Congressional investigation and his cancellation of broadcasts by the Rev. Charles E. Coughlin in 1939. Mr. Flamm objected to statements he considered anti-Semitic. Father Coughlin's followers retaliated by picketing outside his studios at what is now CBS's Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway. During World War II, Mr. Flamm worked for the Office of War Information and ran the American Broadcasting Station in Europe. The station was the seedling from which grew the Voice of America.
        Mr. Flamm is survived by his wife, Elayne Knee Flamm; a brother, Morris, of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and two stepsons, James Knee of New Hope, Pa., and Robert Knee of Closter, N.J.
        Correction:  February 24, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Saturday about Donald Flamm, a former New York broadcaster and theatrical producer, misstated the given name of a survivor. His brother is Milton Flamm of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., not Morris.
