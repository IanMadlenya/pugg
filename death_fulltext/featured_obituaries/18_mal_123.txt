        Dr. Bernard C. Meyer, a Manhattan psychiatrist and psychoanalyst whose affiliation with Mount Sinai Hospital spanned more than 40 years, died Friday night at his home after a lengthy illness. He was 78 years old and lived on the Upper East Side.
        Dr. Meyer, a graduate of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, became a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai Medical School. The school cited his contributions in awarding him its Jacobi Medallion last year, and he delivered the Freud Anniversary Lecture at the institute in 1986.
        Dr. Meyer's love of literature led him to write ''Joseph Conrad: A Psychoanalytic Biography,'' published in 1967, and many other studies of literary and musical figures. An accomplished pianist, he founded the orchestra of the Mount Sinai Music Society in 1970.
        Dr. Meyer is survived by his second wife, the former Leonore Rosenbaum; a son, Nicholas, of Hollywood, Calif.; three daughters, Constance Spottiswoode of Los Angeles, and Juliet and Deborah Abigail Meyer, both of Manhattan; three sisters, Marcelle Bier of San Franciso, Ruth Cherniss of Princeton, N.J., and Jeanne Hirning of Katonah, N.Y., and one granddaughter. His first wife, Elly Kassman, a concert pianist, died in 1960.
