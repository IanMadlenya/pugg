        Paul Chih Meng, former president of the China Institute in America, died of respiratory failure on Sunday at the Del E. Webb Hospital in Sun City West, Ariz. He was 90 years old and lived in Sun City West.
        Mr. Meng, who was born in Beijing, was a 72d-generation descendant of Mencius, the Chinese philosopher who founded neo-Confucianism in the third century B.C. A graduate of Qing Hua University in China, Mr. Meng was imprisoned for several days in 1919 for leading fellow students in a demonstration in Tiananman Square against the World War I Versailles Treaty, which the students contended would encourage Japan to invade Manchuria.
        That same year Mr. Meng came to the United States on a five-year grant to study at Columbia University. In 1930 he was appointed director of the China Institute in Manhattan and held that post until his retirement in 1967.
        In World War II Mr. Meng organized scholarship assistance for Chinese students stranded in this country. At the China Institute, for many years the largest school on Chinese studies in the United States, he offered courses, workshops and art exhibits to introduce Americans to Chinese culture.
        Mr. Meng is survived by his wife, Huan-Shou; a daughter, Mei-Mei Brassel of Manhattan; a son, James, of Albany, Calif., and a granddaughter.
