        Andres Townsend Ezcurra, a Peruvian who had been a legislator in his homeland and the first secretary general of the multinational Latin American Parliament, died on Sunday at his home in Lima. He was 79.
        He had cancer, Lima newspapers said.
        Mr. Townsend, a lawyer, became the secretary general of the Parliament, a group of leading legislators from Latin American nations, in the mid-1960's. He was an outspoken advocate of easier credit terms for third-world debtor nations.
        A member of the centrist American Popular Revolutionary Alliance for almost all of his political career, Mr. Townsend had a seat in Peru's Congress for a dozen years in the 1960's, 70's and 80's and went on to be a Senator for several years before retiring from politics.
