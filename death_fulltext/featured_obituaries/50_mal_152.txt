        David B. Parkinson, an engineer who in the 1940's invented an electromechanical device for directing antiaircraft guns that significantly increased the accuracy of weapons, died Sunday at his home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He was 79 years old.
        He died of osteoporosis, said his son, David Jr. of Manhattan.
        Mr. Parkinson, who was a member of the technical staff of Bell Laboratories in New York in 1940, had a dream that a device he designed to guide a marking stylus could be used to control antiaircraft guns. He developed a prototype, and the Western Electric Company began mass-producing it. His achievements won him a Presidential award and a Franklin Institute medal.
        A Ph.D. graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Mr. Parkinson joined the Brush Development Company, a Cleveland-based electronics company in 1948. He retired in 1976 as head of the advanced development group at the Gould Research Center.
        In addition to his son David, he is survived by his wife, Alberta; three other sons, Truman of Chardon, Ohio, John of Richmond Heights, Ohio, and Thomas of South Bend, Ind.; a sister, Ruth Marie Parkinson of Appleton, Wis.; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
