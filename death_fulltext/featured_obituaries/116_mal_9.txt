        Erskine Childers, a long-serving United Nations official who devoted the last years of his life to promoting reform of the organization, died in Luxembourg on Aug. 25 soon after delivering a speech to the World Federation of United Nations Organizations. He was 68.
        The cause was a heart attack, federation officials said.
        Mr. Childers had been secretary general for less than a year of the 50-year-old federation, which groups independent support and study associations around the world.
        Mr. Childers, a writer on the Middle East before joining the United Nations in 1967, was the co-author most recently with Sir Brian Urquhart of ''A World of Leadership: Tomorrow's United Nations.''
        Erskine Childers bore the same name as his father, who was President of Ireland in 1973-74, and of his grandfather, an Irish revolutionary killed in 1922 by Irish Free State forces. The third Erskine Childers turned from Irish politics to a broader stage and became a committed internationalist.
        After 22 years at the United Nations, he retired in 1989 as senior adviser to the Director General for Development and International Economic Cooperation.
        Mr. Childers is survived by his wife, Mallica Vajravthon Childers, also a United Nations official until her retirement in August, and their son, also named Erskine.
        Correction:  October 4, 1996, Friday
        An obituary on Sept. 4 about Erskine Childers, a longtime United Nations official who died on Aug. 25, omitted three survivors. In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by two daughters from his first marriage, Katrina Ann Selstad of Olympia, Wash., and Nicole Louise French of Concord, Calif., and a grandson, Joel Alexander French. His first wife was Sonia M. Childers. (This correction was delayed by attempts to reach survivors for verification.)
