        Max Petitpierre, a former Foreign Minister and President of Switzerland who helped amend his country's traditional policy of neutrality and did not hide his pro-Western leanings, died on March 25 at his home in Neuchatel. He was 95.
        In announcing his death, the Swiss Government did not disclose its cause.
        Mr. Petitpierre was Foreign Minister for an unusually long period, from 1945 to 1961. That post was the most important in the Swiss Federal Government, with the Presidency -- which he held for three one-year terms -- being largely honorary. He became a member of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1961 and went on to be its head.
        Stressing what he said was the continued importance of neutrality -- which had kept Switzerland out of both world wars -- Mr. Petitpierre summed up his country's stance as "neutrality and solidarity."
        But as Foreign Minister, he was largely responsible for an evolution in Swiss neutrality. By 1956, Swiss foreign policy still held to tradition in keeping Switzerland out of wars, politics and power blocs, but it allowed for much freer Swiss participation in international affairs than in the past.
        Mr. Petitpierre was one of the first leaders in Switzerland to understand that old-fashioned neutrality, conceived in terms of a balance of forces among larger nations bordering their country, had become unsound after World War II.
        He maintained that Switzerland should partake in European economic and cultural cooperation. In a speech in 1958, he declared: "Switzerland belongs to Western Europe, not only in a geographical sense, but also because of her democratic institutions, her cultural ties and her economic and social attitude."
        He was born in Neuchatel, studied law there and in Zurich and Munich and became a law professor in Neuchatel before becoming prominent in politics and government. He married Antoinette de Rougemont in 1928 and they had four children.
