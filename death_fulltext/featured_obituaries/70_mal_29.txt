        Thomas W. Phelps, a retired Manhattan investment counsel and economic specialist, died yesterday in Nantucket Cottage Hospital in Massachusetts. He was 90 years old. He had been a permanent resident of Nantucket since moving from Manhattan after he retired.
        His family said Mr. Phelps, who had been in failing health, had voted on Tuesday before he was taken to the hospital.
        He was born in Chester, Minn. Mr. Phelps graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota in 1923. He started a career in journalism in Rochester, Minn., and Minneapolis before joining The Wall Street Journal in 1927.
        At The Journal, he worked as a reporter, news editor and chief of its Washington bureau. In 1936, he moved to Barron's, where he edited its National Financial Weekly for two years.
        Mr. Phelps then became a general partner and research economist for Francis I. du Pont & Company, a brokerage concern. From 1949 to 1960 he was assistant to the chairman and manager of the economics department at the Socony Mobil Oil Company. For the next 10 years, until his retirement in 1970, he was a partner in the investment firm of Scudder Stevens & Clark.
        Mr. Phelps's first wife, the former Rosalie Greenleaf Bailey, died in 1965. He is survived by his wife, the former Christine Patten Reed Cameron; a son, Thomas W. Jr., of Bristol, Pa.; two daughters, Penny Thomas of Duxbury, Mass., and Lucinda Sullivan of Hyannis, Mass.; a stepdaughter, Lindsley Cameron of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
