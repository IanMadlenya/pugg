        Leib Lensky, an actor who appeared in plays, films and television programs and performed in English, Yiddish and Hebrew, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital at the age of 82.
        He died of liver cancer, a friend, Rabbi Mayer Moskowitz, said.
        Mr. Lensky, who was born in Poland, was a striking if diminutive figure who had roles in the films "The Pawnbroker" and "Hester Street," among others, and in the television series "The Naked City."
        During a 17-year residence in Paris that ended with his move to New York in the 1940's, Mr. Lensky, who was a leading actor in the Paris Yiddish Art Theater, also appeared in the Jean Renoir film "Grand Illusion." He was also seen onstage in Hebrew-language productions in Israel. In New York, he took the stage in various presentations of the Habimah Haktana in Manhattan.
        One of his longest-running performances was at the annual observance of Sholom Aleichem's death, attended by the author's family, friends and admirers. For dozens of years, Mr. Lensky opened the ceremonies by reading, in Yiddish, the writer's unusual will in which he gave guidelines for the relaxed gatherings at which he wanted to be remembered. Last month, Mr. Lensky was too ill to attend, but he sent a message of best wishes to those who did.
        There are no survivors.
