        Irving Kane, a businessman who was prominent in charity organizations, died on Saturday at St. Mary's Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. He was 89 and had homes in Palm Beach and Cleveland.
        Mr. Kane was born in Russia in a well-to-do family that fled to the United States in 1913, leaving everything behind, to avoid persecution. He grew up in Cleveland and received bachelor's and law degrees from Case Western Reserve University.
        He practiced law in Cleveland and was the president and a co-owner of the Hospital Specialty Company, a maker of sanitary napkins, in Cleveland for 20 years. He retired at 52.
        His volunteer posts included chairman of the executive committee of what is now the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, president of the Council of Jewish Federations and president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.
        His wife, the former Adeline Faller, died in 1988.
        Surviving are two daughters, Kathie Kraft of Palm Beach and Bonnie Raffel of Baltimore; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
