        Fred Nathan, a press agent who represented some of the most successful Broadway shows of the 1980's, died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center. He was 38 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was AIDS, said his press associate, Michael F. Borowski.
        Mr. Nathan was best known for his association with David Merrick's "42d Street" in 1980 and the Cameron Mackintosh production of "Miss Saigon" in 1991. He also represented six Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, including "Cats" and "The Phantom of the Opera," and shows for the Shubert Organization.
        He was born in Brooklyn and attended Boston University. He opened his first publicity office when he was 24, representing the 1979 Broadway revival of "Oklahoma!"
        He is survived by his mother, Gladys Nathan of Boca Raton, Fla.; a sister, Ronnie Greenstein of Dix Hills, L.I., and a brother, Robert Nathan of Manhattan.
