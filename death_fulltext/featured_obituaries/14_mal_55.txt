        Mr. Samkange was the first black college graduate in the province of Mashonaland in 1947, when Zimbabwe was the white-ruled British colony of Southern Rhodesia. He was graduated with honors in history and eventually wrote three books on politics in Africa.
        As a black nationalist, he held top posts during the next three decades in several political parties, including Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union and Bishop Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council.
