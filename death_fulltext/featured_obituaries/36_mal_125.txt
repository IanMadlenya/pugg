        Ihsan Abdel Kuddous, an Egyptian journalist, novelist and short-story writer, died last Thursday after suffering a stroke. He was 71 years old. Mr. Abdel Kuddous, whose works were translated into several languages, also wrote regular syndicated columns in Cairo's Government-owned newspapers and magazines. In his column, ''At a Cafe on Politics Street,'' he addressed current issues through the device of customers talking in a cafe.
        In the 1960's and 1970's he was the editor of the Cairo papers Akhbar el-Yom (later Al Akhbar) and Al Ahram.
        Mr. Abdel Kuddous, who began his career writing for a magazine founded by his mother, wrote at least 60 novels and collections of short stories, mostly psychological studies of political and social behavior. Many became movies.
        Among his works translated into English were ''I Am Free,'' ''The Bus Thief'' and ''A Boy's Best Friend.''
