        The Most Rev. Alfred J. Jolson, S.J., the Roman Catholic Bishop of Reykjavik, Iceland, died Monday at Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh while on a visit there. He was 65.
        The cause was complications after heart bypass surgery, his sister, Mary Kelly, said.
        A native of Bridgeport, Conn., Bishop Jolson was named to the post in Reykjavik by Pope John Paul II in 1987. He oversaw the religious needs of four parishes and 2,500 communicants. Previously he had spent 35 years teaching at colleges in the United States, Italy, Rhodesia and Iraq.
        Bishop Jolson was graduated from Boston College and Weston College, and received a master's in business administration from Harvard University and a doctorate in economics from the Gregorian University in Rome. He became a priest in 1958.
        He is survived by his sister of Fairfield, Conn.
