        Carol E. Rinzler, a lawyer and author, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 49 years old. She had suffered a neck injury recently, but the cause of her death was not immediately determined, her family said.
        Ms. Rinzler pursued a dual career as a specialist in publishing law and as a writer who dealt in lighthearted fashion with childhood and adolescence. She was the author of "Nobody Said You Had to Eat Off the Floor," published in 1971; "The Girl Who Got All the Breaks" (1980), and "Your Adolescent: An Owner's Manual" (1981).
        In the "owner's manual," addressed to people who find living with an adolescent more painful than adolescence itself, Ms. Rinzler offered advice like: "An adolescent who is cheerful at breakfast should be kept home from school that day."
        Ms. Rinzler was born in Newark and was a graduate of Goucher College. She received her law degree from Yale and was with the Manhattan law firms of Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Rembar & Curtis before establishing her own practice earlier this year.
        She was a contributing editor of Publishers Weekly, a book critic and columnist for Mademoiselle and Cosmopolitan magazines, and a writer of reviews and articles for The New York Times Book Review and other publications.
        Ms. Rinzler is survived by her father, Irving Eisen, of Mount Pleasant, S.C.; a son, Michael, and a daughter, Jane, both of Manhattan.
