        Horace G. Alexander, a teacher and writer who headed the British Quaker relief effort in India, died Saturday of a gastrointestinal illness at Crosslands, a Quaker retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. He was 100 years old.
        Mr. Alexander, a champion of Indian independence from Britain, was a friend of Gandhi and was Gandhi's host on a visit to England when negotiations began in the mid-1940's. He wrote several books on India, including ''Gandhi Through Western Eyes,'' published by New Society Publishers.
        Born in Croydon, England, Mr. Alexander graduated from King's College, Cambridge University, and taught at Woodbrooke, a Quaker school in Birmingham, England, from 1919 to 1955. In 1984, the Indian Government presented him the highest award the country gives to a noncitizen.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Rebecca Bradbeer; a stepdaughter, Cecilia Bradbeer Sibinga of Media, Pa.; a stepson, James Biddle Bradbeer of Wayne, Pa., and five grandchildren.
