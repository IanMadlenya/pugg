        Doris G. Ross, a volunteer worker for children's welfare for half a century and former national president of the Girls Clubs of America, died on Friday at White Plains Hospital. She was 74.
        A family member said the cause was heart disease.
        She was a former actress and member of Max Reinhardt's drama school. She also studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.
        Her interest in the arts and concern for children came together in the 1970's, when she helped establish the Children's Creative Theater of the Girls Clubs of America and the Theater Arts Players of Temple Emanu-El. She was the first president of the Theater Arts Players. She became president of the Girls Clubs in 1957, after serving as vice president.
        She is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Ross Schless of New York and Allyne Ross of Scarsdale; three sisters, Shirlee Land of Purchase, N.Y., Rhodina Schwartz and Paula Bogdan, both of Cincinnati, and a brother, Herbert Stark of Amherst, Mass.
