        Donald Hillsdon Ryan, an American entrepreneur with a Harvard M.B.A. degree who built an overseas network of quick-fix repair franchises in busy cities, died on May 9 at his home in London. He was 80 and also had a residence in the Bahamas.
        The death was announced by his family.
        Mr. Ryan was a founder and former chairman, chief executive and owner of Minit International, a chain of shops where people could get broken heels mended, keys duplicated and scissors honed. He started it with a partner in Belgium in 1957, seizing an opportunity that opened as the ranks of Europe's cobblers and itinerant cutlers thinned from legions to platoons.
        Mr. Ryan later bought out his partner. By the time he sold the corporation in 1997 to UBS Capital, the venture-capital arm of the Union Bank of Switzerland, the Mister Minit chain of franchises had grown to nearly 4,000 stores in 26 European and Asian countries, as well as in Canada. Born in Petersburg, Va., Mr. Ryan attended the Virginia Military Institute before serving as an Army officer in World War II. After the war he worked in the German transportation system for the United States Military Government, and then graduated from the College of William and Mary in 1950 and the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration in 1952.
        He was working for Procter & Gamble in Europe in 1957 when he and a fellow Harvard M.B.A. opened the first Mister Minit outlet, offering fast shoe repairs, in the Bon March√© department store in downtown Brussels.
        Mister Minit shops proceeded from shoes, keys and rubber stamps to watch repairs, engraving and photo developing.
        Mr. Ryan is survived by his wife, Gail von Bergen Ryan; four daughters, Kristina A. Ryan of Lincoln, Mass., Kim R. Hirschy of Geneva, Shelly R. Walsh of Potomac, Md., and Alexandra Ryan, also of Geneva; a brother, James H. of Petersburg, Va.; and seven grandchildren.
