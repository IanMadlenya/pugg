        Thomas P. Losee Jr., a longtime executive for several large national magazine publishing companies in New York, died on Feb. 2 at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. He was 62 and lived in Glen Cove, N.Y., and Gulfstream, Fla.
        The cause was kidney disease, his family said.
        Mr. Losee began his magazine industry career in 1964, a year after graduating from Duke University, as a trainee at Look, published by Cowles Communications. He spent seven years at Look, which was closed in 1971, and rose there to New York manager for advertising sales.
        Mr. Losee joined the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation in 1971 and worked at House Beautiful, as advertising manager and publisher; Harper's Bazaar, as publisher; and Science Digest, as publisher. He also served as vice president and assistant to the general manager of the division.
        Mr. Losee left Hearst in 1984 to join Knapp Communications as vice president and publisher of Architectural Digest. Knapp was acquired in 1993 by the Condé Nast division of Advance Publications, and Mr. Losee continued in his posts at Architectural Digest until retiring in 1997. His 13 years as publisher represented one of the longest such tenures recently at a major magazine.
        After leaving Condé Nast, Mr. Losee served as a publishing consultant to Florida International Magazine and House magazine.
        Mr. Losee is survived by his wife, Muriel, to whom he was married for 37 years; a son, Thomas Penny Losee III of Hattiesburg, Miss.; a daughter, Kendall Losee Graebner of Locust Valley, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.
