        Edvins Strautmanis, an abstract painter known for his slashing, oversized calligraphic imagery who worked as often with brooms as with paintbrushes, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 58 years old and also had a home in Isla de Vieques, P.R.
        He died of cancer, said his wife, Ijra.
        Mr. Strautmanis's art developed from the gestural, emotionally charged style of the Abstract Expressionists, and was especially influenced by the broad-stroked, beamlike compositions of Franz Kline. His skill with paint-laden brooms, applied to canvas on the floor, created brushwork of enormous, almost engulfing scale, whose intimations of violence were often softened by the artist's rich and complex sense of color.
        Mr. Strautmanis, born in Latvia on Oct. 27, 1933, emigrated to the United States in 1950, settling with his family in Chicago. He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and began exhibiting his work there in 1965. He moved to New York in 1970, and was represented over the years by LoGiudice Gallery, the Allan Stone Gallery and, most recently, the Stephen Rosenberg Gallery, where he had one-man exhibitions in 1990 and 1991.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Vincent, of Brampton, Ontario; a daughter, Lisa Schultz-Herda, and three grandchildren.
