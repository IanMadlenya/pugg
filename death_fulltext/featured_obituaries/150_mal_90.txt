        Sal G. Marzullo, a Mobil executive who helped put into effect a code of employment practices drawn up for American multinational companies working within the apartheid system in South Africa, died on July 13 at his home in Orlando, Fla. He was 72.
        The cause was heart failure, his son Philip said.
        Mr. Marzullo retired from the Mobil Corporation in 1990 after 11 years as vice president for international government relations in its international marketing and refining division. He joined the concern in 1971.
        From 1981 to 1990, he also served as chairman of Industry Support Unit Inc., a group established by companies supporting the employment-practices code.
        The code, expounded in 1977, was called the Sullivan Principles after its author, the Rev. Leon Sullivan, a Baptist minister from Philadelphia.
        The code focused on desegregating the South African workplace, improving training and promotion prospects for blacks and upgrading their health care, housing and education.
        By June 1987, 127 of the nearly 200 American companies doing business in South Africa, including Mobil, subscribed to the code.
        Mr. Marzullo was a native of Rochester, N.Y., and a graduate of Columbia University.
        Besides his son Philip, of Natick, Mass., his survivors include his wife, the former Linda Quintana, and two other sons, Bruce of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Jay of Boca Raton, Fla.
