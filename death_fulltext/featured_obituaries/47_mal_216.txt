        Irvin Stewart, a former president of West Virginia University who served in the 1940's as executive secretary of the Government agency that guided development of the atomic bomb, died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 91 years old.
        His death was the result of a series of strokes, his wife, Florence, said.
        Mr. Stewart was president of West Virginia University from 1946 to 1958. He then taught constitutional law at the university until 1967, when he retired.
        He was also director of telecommunications management in the Federal Office of Emergency Planning in the 1960's. In recent years he was a consultant to the National Academy of Public Administration, which advises the President and Congress on government effectiveness.
        In 1940 he became executive secretary of the National Defense Research Committee, later the Office of Scientific Research and Development, the agency involved with development of the atomic bomb.
        Earlier, he helped draft the Communications Act of 1934, legislation that established the Federal Communications Commission, which guides Federal telecommunications policy.
        A native of Fort Worth, he was a graduate of the University of Texas, where he received a master's degree in government and public administration and a law degree. He received a doctorate in constitutional law from Columbia University.
        Besides his wife he is survived by a son, Richard, of Chapel Hill, N.C.
