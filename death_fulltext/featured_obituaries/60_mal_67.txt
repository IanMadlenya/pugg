        Hugh Meade Alcorn Jr., the Republican national chairman from 1957 to 1959 during the Eisenhower Administration, died yesterday at his home in Suffield, Conn. He was 84 years old.
        The cause of his death was a stroke, his daughter said.
        Mr. Alcorn, who was known as Meade, had retired as a partner in the law firm of Tyler, Cooper & Alcorn, of Hartford, New Haven and Stamford. The firm was formed in 1983 through the merger of his firm of Alcorn, Bakewell & Smith -- which was founded in 1897 by his father, H. Meade Alcorn Sr. -- with the firm of Tyler, Cooper, Grant, Bowerman & Keefe.
        In the 1930's and 1940's, Mr. Alcorn was a Connecticut state representative, rising to Republican floor leader and then Speaker. He was also Hartford's State Attorney from 1942 to 1949, succeeding his father, who had held that post for one-third of a century.
        He was a member of the Republican National Committee from 1953 to 1961, its vice chairman in 1956 and 1957, and chairman from 1957 to 1959.
        Mr. Alcorn graduated from Dartmouth College and Yale Law School.
        His first wife, the former Janet Hoffer, died. He is survived by his wife, Marcia Powell Alcorn, to whom he was married in 1955; a brother, Howard W., of Suffield, who is a former chief justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court; a daughter, Eileen A. Van Law of West Barnstable, Mass.; three grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.
