        Howard B. Gill, an authority on prisons, died of cancer of the colon last Thursday at his home in Chestnut Hill, Mass. He was 99 years old.
        Mr. Gill, a native of Lockport, N.Y., was named the first superintendent of the Norfolk Prison Colony in Massachusetts in 1927.
        His work there was described by a criminologist, Edwin Sutherland, as ''the most noteworthy achievement in the field of penology in the United States in the last generation.''
        After leaving Norfolk in 1934, Mr. Gill went to Washington, where he worked for the Prison Labor Authority and the Federal Bureau of Prisons and was named general superintendent of prisons for the District of Columbia.
        Later he taught penology at the University of Wisconsin, George Washington University and American University.
        In 1984 the American Correctional Association established the Howard B. Gill Award for people who make outstanding contributions to the field.
        He is survived by four sons, Dr. Benjamin Gill of Newton Centre, Mass.; Jonathan of Hardwick, Mass., Peter of Chestnut Hill and Jeffrey of San Francisco; two daughters, Joan Speck of Mount Joy, Pa., and Deborah Allerhand of St. Paul, Minn., 12 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.
