        Eugene P. Schonfeld, who founded the National Kidney Cancer Association in 1989 after learning that he had the disease, died on Sept. 25 at his  home in Highland Park, Ill., the association said. He was 54.
        After receiving the diagnosis, with  no hope of a cure and no information available through existing agencies, Mr. Schonfeld started the National Kidney Cancer Association with the aid of several other patients.
        He was often credited with building the nonprofit organization, which is based in Evanston, Ill., into a widely recognized and highly regarded association. The group provides information to patients and medical professionals, advocacy for patients and research grants.
        ''Gene was a remarkable advocate for cancer patients and demonstrated that patient activism is essential in cancer drug development,'' said Patty Delaney, associate director of the Cancer Liaison Program of the Food and Drug Administration.
        Mr. Schonfeld got a B.A. in communications arts in 1967 from the University of Notre Dame, and an M.S.J. in journalism in 1968 and a Ph.D. in management in 1975 from Northwestern University. For several years, he taught advertising at Northwestern and marketing at the College of Business Administration at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle. He formed a consulting company in Evanston called Schonfeld Associates.
        He is survived by his wife, Faith; a brother, Judge Schonfeld of Portland, Ore., and two sisters, Leona Schonfeld of Arcadia, Calif., and Grace S. Witting of Howell, N.J.
