        LeRoy C. Breunig, an authority on modern French poetry and art criticism who  served as interim president of Barnard College at Columbia University in 1975, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. He was 80 and lived in Manhattan.
        Dr. Breunig was an assistant professor of Romance languages at Harvard University when Barnard appointed him an associate professor and executive officer of the French department in 1953. He was also the chairman of the department and became the dean of faculty.
        He became chief administrator in 1975, when Barnard was between presidents.  The appointment was considered unusual because the "seven sister" schools had traditionally been led by presidents who were women.
        He returned to teaching at Barnard and also taught graduate courses on contemporary French poetry at Columbia. He retired in 1981.
