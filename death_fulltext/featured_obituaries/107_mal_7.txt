        Jeffrey Lynn, who played the handsome leading man in a string of Warner Brothers films in the 1930's and 40's, died on Nov. 24 at St. Joseph's Hospital  in Burbank, Calif., his daughter, Letitia Lynn, said on Thursday. He was 89.
        Mr. Lynn made his debut in the 1938 film "Four Daughters," with John Garfield and Claude Rains, and went on to appear in such films as "Yes, My Darling Daughter" and "The Roaring Twenties," a 1939 hit that starred Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney.
        Mr. Lynn, Kirk Douglas and Paul Douglas played the husbands in "Letter to Three Wives." In a change of pace, he was cast as a bookkeeper framed for murder in "Strange Bargain." Both films were released in 1949.
        His other screen credits included "The Fighting 69th" (1940), with Cagney and Pat O'Brien; "Underground" and "Million Dollar Baby" (both 1941), and "Whiplash" (1948).
        Mr. Lynn, whose original name was Ragnar Godfrey Lind, was born in Auburn, Mass. He became interested in theater while a student at Bates College in Maine, but worked at a variety of jobs before landing a role in a touring production of "Brother Rat." A screen test followed and he signed with Warner Brothers in 1937.
        He earned a bronze star in World War II as a combat intelligence captain in Italy and Austria.
        Mr. Lynn's Hollywood career languished after he returned from the war, but he continued to act on stage and television.
        On Broadway, he appeared in "Lo and Behold!" (1951), "A Call on Kuprin" (1961) and a 1966 revival of the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Dinner at Eight." His television roles included the soap opera "Secret Storm" and such series as "Remington Steele" and "Barnaby Jones."
        In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his third wife, Helen; seven stepchildren; three sisters, two brothers and 17 grandchildren.
