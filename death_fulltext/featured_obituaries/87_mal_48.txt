        George S. Zacharkow, a leader in the maritime insurance industry, died on Tuesday at his home in Bridgton, Me. He was 67 and had lived in Laurel Hollow, L.I., until his retirement three years ago.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to Continental Insurance, his employer for 40 years.
        A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Zacharkow entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, L.I. at the age of 18. He served on an Army transport in World War II and earned a degree in nautical science in 1947.
        Two years later he became an insurance adjuster for the Boston Old Colony Insurance Company, which has since become part of Continental.
        He held many positions, finally becoming chairman and chief executive of the Marine Office of America Corporation, another Continental Insurance unit. At the time he also was president of Continental's Marine and International Group, president of Boston Old Colony, and a senior vice president of the parent Continental Corporation, with an office in lower Manhattan.
        He was a longtime board member of the Seaman's Church Institute in New York and remained active as a consultant on marine insurance matters after his retirement.
        Mr. Zacharkow is survived by his wife, Marge; a son, George R., of Flourtown, Pa., and a daughter, Nancy Glidden of Sidney, Ill.
