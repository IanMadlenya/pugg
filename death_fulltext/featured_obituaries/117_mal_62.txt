        Joseph Solomon, a lawyer and philanthropist who supported various educational and medical institutions, died on Oct. 8 at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. He was 92.
        A recipient of the Horatio Alger Award, honoring individuals who have risen to success from humble beginnings, Mr. Solomon was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, one of eight children of poor Russian immigrants.
        He left school at 14 to help support his family and took a job as a messenger at a law firm.
        Encouraged to attend school at nights, he graduated from New York Law School in 1927 without the benefit of a college degree or a high school diploma.
        After being admitted to the bar, Mr. Solomon joined the firm for which he had served as messenger, Leventritt, Cool, Nathan & Lehman, becoming a partner in 1948 and a senior partner in 1966.
        A specialist in estate law, he later joined the firm of Gallet, Dreyer & Berkey, with which he was associated until his death.
        Among the recipients of his financial support were New York Law School, Columbia Law School and Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where he endowed faculty chairs.
        He was knighted by the Italian Government in 1980 for his law scholarship grants in Italy.
        He was interested in helping young artists, and established the Joseph Solomon Fellowship at Columbia, in which law students worked with curators to understand the law and art. Mr. Solomon was also a supporter of  Public School 101 in East Harlem and the Surprise Lake Camp for underprivileged children in upstate New York.
        He attended the camp as a boy under a program sponsored by Mount Sinai Hospital.
        He was married in 1929 to Rita Schwartz, who predeceased him. He is survived by a son, Alan, of Knoxville, Tenn.; a daughter, Diane Solomon Kempler of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
