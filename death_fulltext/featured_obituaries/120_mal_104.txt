        Joe Dominguez, a pioneering author and speaker in the Voluntary Simplicity movement, who urged Americans to relearn the lost art of saving money and to cut their profligate consumption, died of cancer on Jan. 11. He was 58.
        Mr. Dominguez and his partner, Vicki Robin, wrote ''Your Money or Your Life'' (Viking, 1992), a blueprint for personal finances that has touted frugality to more than 600,000 readers.
        If people paid more attention to how they spent money, they could spend less, it contended; if they spent less they could work less; and if they worked less they could focus on things that meant more to them than accumulating possessions. The authors spoke at hundreds of ''Financial Independence'' workshops and founded the New Road Map Foundation in Seattle to spread their ideas.
        A warm, comical man, Mr. Dominguez acted as a living example of the frugality he espoused. After growing up in Harlem, he went on to earn a plump salary as a stock analyst on Wall Street, but retired at age 31 with a nest egg of about $100,000. For the rest of his life, he lived on the interest, about $6,000 a year. He avoided buying on credit, he bargain-hunted and he bought only what he truly needed. He devoted his time to the foundation and public service.
        In recent years, Mr. Dominguez had been encouraged by statistics indicating that more and more Americans were choosing thrift and deciding to trade in earnings for more time, Ms. Robin said. Practical to the end, he made cards for friends and loved ones two days before he died that read: ''Joe Dominguez has been given a clean bill of death. Please direct your attention to the living and to the things that need to be done.''
        Officials said he was survived by no close relatives.
