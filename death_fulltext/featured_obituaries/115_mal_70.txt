        Toyce Anderson, an artist and costume designer, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 46 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Anderson had three solo exhibitions at the June Kelly Gallery. His art was primarily assemblages from found objects, which often included pieces of musical instruments.
        He created the costumes for the Alvin Ailey Dance Company's performance of ''Hymn'' in 1993 and for the company's ''Tilt'' and ''Guerrilla Love Song Dances.'' He also created costumes for singers, including Diana Ross, Elton John, Tina Turner and Aretha Franklin.
        A native of Ohio, he studied at Ohio University, Pratt Institute and the School of Visual Arts.
        He is survived by his mother, Martha, of Cleveland, and two sisters, Harriet Long of West Covina, Calif., and Loretta Anderson-Slaughter of Los Angeles.
