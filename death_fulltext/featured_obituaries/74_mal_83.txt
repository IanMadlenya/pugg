        John Horn, a former journalist and public relations officer for broadcast networks, died on March 2 at Copper Queens Hospital in Bisbee, Ariz., where he was living in retirement. He was 76 and a former resident of Brooklyn and Stony Brook, L.I.
        The cause was heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Horn worked on the production staff for Edward R. Murrow's "Person to Person" program and did public relations for CBS-TV. Over the years he wrote for Newsweek and Variety magazines and had a daily broadcast column at The New York Herald Tribune before joining the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company as national press editor in 1968.
        He is survived by his wife Audienza, known as Nan, and a son, Jon, also of Bisbee.
