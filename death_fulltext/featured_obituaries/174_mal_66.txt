        Dr. Joseph J. Marbach, an expert in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic jaw and facial pain, died on July 22 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, his family said.
        Dr. Marbach, who was a professor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and had a private practice in Manhattan, did much of his work on temporomandibular joint disorder. T.M.J., as it is called, brings on chronic pain in the muscles of the jaw, head and neck and affects an estimated 10 million Americans.
        Sufferers of the disorder, he believed, have a lower threshold for pain than the average person -- a result of a problem in the T.M.J. sufferer's nervous system -- and feel it in many places at once.
        Because Dr. Marbach's focus was the reduction of pain, he advocated physical therapy and medications that slow down pain signals.
        Dr. Marbach completed his undergraduate studies at Drew University and received his doctorate in dental science from the University of Pennsylvania in 1960. After dental school, he received training in psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith; two sisters, Lee Smith of West Caldwell, N.J., and Paula Nathan of Morgan Hill, Calif.; one son, Ezra, of Manhattan; three daughters, Claudia Marbach of Newton, Mass., Emily Marbach of London, and Cecily Marbach of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
