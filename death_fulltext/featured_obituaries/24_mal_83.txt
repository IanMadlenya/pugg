        Gordon Wright, a noted horseman and riding instructor who helped establish the United States Equestrian Team after World War II, died Jan. 5 at a nursing home in Tryon, N.C. He was 85 years old and had lived at Wright Way Farm outside nearby Landrum, S.C.
        Mr. Wright, who grew up on a ranch in Utah, once recalled that he got his equestrian start riding anything he could get a leg over, including goats, calves and bulls. An early specialty was riding two horses at a time, standing up, Roman style, which got him work with rodeos and carnivals until he joined the cavalry in the early 1920's.
        While on a leave from the Army, he came to New York with Fred Bebee's World Series Rodeo in 1927 and won $600, just enough, he later pointed out, to finance the purchase of a $500 riding stable in Bronxville, N.Y., and to buy his way out of the Army for $100.
        After the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Wright returned to the cavalry and served as an enlisted man at Fort Riley, Kan., until the post commandant got a letter from one of his old polo-playing pals, Gen. George Patton. ''Next time I hear from you,'' Patton wrote, ''Wright better be an officer.''
        Mr. Wright became a second lieutenant almost overnight and was soon representing the United States in international riding competitions, the last cavalry officer to do so. He also trained a number of United States Olympic competitors.
        He is survived by a son, Gordon Jr., of Schenectady, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
