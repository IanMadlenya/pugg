        Msgr. Richard B. Curtin, who conducted choirs for two papal visits to Yankee Stadium and produced several records of religious choral music, died on Sunday in Riverdale, the Bronx. He was 86.
        In 1965, as Pope Paul VI entered Yankee Stadium for a Mass during the first papal visit to the United States, a chorus of 225 men from seminaries in the New York area rose up in song, and Monsignor Curtin was on the podium. He repeated his conducting duties when John Paul II celebrated Mass at the stadium 14 years later.
        Monsignor Curtin was professor of church music at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, N.Y., from 1946 to 1966, and also taught at the Pius X School of Liturgical Music at Manhattanville College in Purchase N.Y., and at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
        At St. Joseph's, the seminary for the New York Archdiocese, Monsignor Curtin led the 24-member Seminary Choir.
        In the 1960's, he made recordings of the choir's liturgical music, and in 1995, the stereo master tapes were used to produce a two-CD set, ''A Treasury of Sacred Music.'' He is survived by two brothers, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Thomas, of Bronxville, N.Y.
