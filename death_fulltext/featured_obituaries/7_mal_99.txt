        George Lindsay, who for many years published a weekly newsletter that analyzed the stock market, died of a heart attack in his Greenwich Village apartment on Aug. 6. He was 79 years old.
        Born in Portsmouth, Va., he moved to New York with his family when he was 15 years old. He graduated from the Pennington School in New Jersey and returned to New York, where he worked as a freelance letterer of signs.
        Although Mr. Lindsay had no formal training in statistics or the workings of the stock market, his interest in the market led him to examine its price movements. In 1950 he began publishing a weekly newsletter, George Lindsay's Opinion.
        In 1979 he became a consultant with Ernst & Company, which took over the production of the newsletter, still based on Mr. Lindsay's analyses. He stopped publishing the newsletter in 1984 but continued writing articles and preparing a book about his theories.
        Mr. Lindsay is survived by his brother, Frank, of San Jose, Calif.
