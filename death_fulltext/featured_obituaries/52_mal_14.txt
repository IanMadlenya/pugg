        Tommy Paul, a former world featherweight boxing champion, died Sunday after a long illness. He was 82 years old.
        He started boxing as an amateur in Buffalo in 1926, turned pro in 1929 and won the world featherweight championship in May 1932, outpointing Johnny Pena in 15 rounds. He lost the title to Freddie Miller on a decision seven months later and retired from the ring in 1935 with a record of 77-24-9 with 28 knockouts.
        Mr. Paul is survived by his wife, Edith, three daughters, 12 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.
