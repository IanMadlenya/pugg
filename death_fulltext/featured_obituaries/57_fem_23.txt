        Dorothy Weed, a piano teacher and former director of the Diller-Quaile Music School on the Upper East Side, died on Tuesday at Doctor's Hospital. She was 92 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        She died after a long illness, said Marjory Duncalfe, the director of the school.
        Miss Weed joined the faculty at Diller-Quaile in 1922, a year after she graduated from Smith College and two years after the school opened. She became a co-director of the school in 1941, and in 1957 she assumed full directorship, a position she held until 1972. Hundreds of children studied piano with her before she retired in 1988. She also specialized in training teachers in music theory, harmony and piano pedagogy.
        She is survived by a niece, Nancy Weed Guilman of Lanexa, Va., and two great-nephews.
