        His wife, Marilyn, said the cause of death was lymphoma.

He was also a founding physician at the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children, which is on the grounds of Massachusetts General complex and specializes in the treatment of burned children.
        Dr. Bernstein was the author of several books, including "Diminished People" (Little, Brown, 1970).
        A native of the Bronx, he earned a bachelor's degree at Cornell University in 1949 and, through an accelerated program, his medical degree from New York Medical College in 1951.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Michael Bernstein of San Ramon, Calif., and a daughter, Genya Bernstein of Manhattan.
