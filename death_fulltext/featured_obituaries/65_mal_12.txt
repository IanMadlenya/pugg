        Rear Adm. Raymond F. DuBois, retired, a highly decorated submarine officer in World War II, died last Thursday at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland. He was 76 years old and lived in McLean, Va.
        His family said he died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
        Admiral DuBois was born in Naugatuck, Conn., and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1938. He served on the battleship Tennessee before attending submarine school in New London, Conn.
        He saw service on several submarines during the war, including a tour as executive officer of the Flasher, which was credited with sinking more enemy tonnage than any other American submarine.
        He earned a Silver Star for "conspicuous gallantry" during the Flasher's first sortie against Japanese surface naval forces in the Pacific, and the Flasher received a Presidential Unit Citation commending the "personal valor and superb seamanship of her officers and men."
        Admiral DuBois is survived by his wife, the former Doris Helmkamp; a son, Raymond F. DuBois Jr. of Washington; two daughters, D'Anne DuB. Itzkowitz of Stevens Point, Wis., and Margalee DuB. Becker of Wheaton, Ill., and three grandsons.
