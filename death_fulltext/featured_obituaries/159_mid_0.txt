        Mary Fowler Brennan, the widow of Justice William H. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Arlington, Va. She was 83.
        Mrs. Brennan was born on Aug. 15, 1916, in Mechanicsville, Md., and moved to Washington when she was 15. In 1943, she was hired by the Supreme Court marshal's office, and was eventually promoted to the secretarial pool, filling in for justices' secretaries who were on vacation.
        She met Justice Brennan when she was his temporary assistant during his first weeks on the court. In 1957, Justice Brennan's secretary died and he asked Miss Fowler if she would work for him. Recalling her earlier, grueling stint in his hectic office, she said yes, reluctantly. But their professional and personal relationship blossomed, and she remained his secretary for 25 years.
        On March 9, 1983, after Justice Brennan's first wife had died, he and Miss Fowler were married.
        Justice Brennan died in 1997.
        Mrs. Brennan is survived by two sisters, Charlotte Harding of Lake Ridge, Va., and Mary Jane Herring of Dale City, Va.
