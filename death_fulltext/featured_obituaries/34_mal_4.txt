        Rabbi Israel Spira, who as the Grand Rabbi of Bluzhov was the spiritual leader of a Hasidic branch in Brooklyn and Israel, died yesterday at Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. He was 99 years old and lived in Brooklyn's Borough Park section, where his synagogue was situated.
        Rabbi Spira, who was descended from a line of rabbis, led congregations in several Polish towns and survived confinement in concentration camps during World War II, including Bergen-Belsen. He came to this country in 1946.
        He played an important role in the development of Agudath Israel of America, a broadly based Orthodox movement founded in 1922. Its chapters in the United States and Canada support child welfare and projects for the young here and overseas.
        At the time of his death, he was the senior member of the Council of Torah Sages of Agudath. Its spokesman, Rabbi Yitzchok Brandriss, said Rabbi Spira was the oldest living Hasidic rabbi.
        Rabbi Spira's first wife and other members of his family died in World War II. He is survived by his wife, Bronia, and a sister, Chaya Horowitz.
