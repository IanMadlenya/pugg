        David Ofner, former president of Foote, Cone & Belding Advertising who headed the company's main domestic operations, died Tuesday at his home in Highland Park, Ill. He was 63.
        The cause was a brain tumor, said Owen Dougherty, a vice president at the parent company, Foote, Cone & Belding Communications in Chicago.
        Mr. Ofner served for 30 years with Foote, Cone & Belding, the largest advertising agency in the United States and the seventh largest in the world. He managed some of the company's main accounts, including Dial Soap, Sara Lee, Sears, Roebuck, Ralston Purina and Warner-Lambert.
        He joined the agency's merchandising department in Chicago in 1957, and after a stint in the New York office was promoted to general manager of the Chicago office in 1972. In 1978, he was appointed president of Foote, Cone & Belding Advertising.
        He became president of FCB Midwest in 1981, which later included the Canadian operations, and in 1985, he was named executive vice president for corporate development at the parent company. He retired in 1987 and founded Redirections Inc., a Chicago company offering career counseling to senior executives.
        He was born in Chicago. After graduating from Roosevelt University in 1953, he attended the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
        Surviving are his wife, Sue, a daughter, Lauren, and a son, Tony, all of the Chicago area.
