        Samuel Weiss, a retired lawyer and certified public accountant, died on June 2 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. He was 85 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of congestive heart failure, his wife, Fran Lee, said.
        A native New Yorker, he practiced tax law for more than 50 years in Manhattan. Through the years, Mr. Weiss was active in his wife's campaign to get the city to pass a law to require people to clean up after their pets, which helped lead to the passage of the "pooper scooper" law in 1978.
        He is survived by his wife, who is a former television personality and consumer advocate; two sons, Barry, of Los Angeles, and Gene, of Potomac, Md.; a brother, Jesse, of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
