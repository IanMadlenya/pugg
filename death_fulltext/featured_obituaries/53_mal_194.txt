        JZames Walsh, an actor, producer and director, died on Thursday at the Westerly (R.I.) Hospital. He was 68 years old and lived in Stonington, Conn.
        He died of a heart attack, said his stepdaughter, Nicole Oliver-Plummer.
        Mr. Walsh began his theatrical career after World War II, when he appeared with Elaine Stritch in "Much Ado About Nothing" and in many Shakespearean productions on and off Broadway.
        In the mid-1950's, he was a producer for the "Omnibus" television series and directed "Super Circus," a children's program.
        Mr. Walsh then became executive vice president for television production of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency and later formed his own agencies, James Walsh Productions and Continuo Productions, which handled both commercials and documentaries. He was a member of the Directors Guild of America, and retired in 1985.
        In addition to his stepdaughter, who lives in Nobleboro, Me., Mr. Walsh is survived by his wife, the former Valerie J. Tite; three children from a previous marriage, a son, Richard, of Miami, and two daughters, Melanie, of Stonington, and Valerie A., of Ledyard, Conn., and two grandchildren.
