        George A. Stephen, who invented the Weber Kettle, a domed grill that came to be widely used by American barbecue-lovers, died Thursday at his home in Kildeer, Ill. He was 71.
        The cause of death was cancer, said Lori Sitta, an employee of the Weber-Stephen Product Company, which manufactures the grills.
        Mr. Stephen was the founder, owner and president of the company, which is based in Palatine, Ill., a Chicago suburb.
        In 1950 he was living in a house that had an open brick barbecue, which he disliked because, he felt, it produced uneven heat and too much smoke. He was working at the time for a Chicago company, Weber Brothers, that made metal parts, and by some accounts the inspiration for his invention came when he watched the making of two halves of a steel buoy.
        He is survived by his wife, Margaret; six sons, George Jr., James, Robert, William, Kenneth and Jeffrey; six daughters, Janet, Virginia, Deborah and Margaret Stephen, Maryl Weskamp and Barbara Rapp, and 15 grandchildren.
