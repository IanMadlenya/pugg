        Victor Van Bourg, who has been called the West Coast king of union-side labor law, died on Tuesday at San Francisco International Airport. He was 68 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.
        The cause was apparently a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. He had flown from Washington, D.C., to be with his daughter, Julie, who had cancer. She also died on Tuesday, and it is unclear whether her father knew.
        In a 1998 interview, Mr. Van Bourg contended that United States laws had always been stacked against organized labor. His law partner William Sokol said, ''He felt obliged to even the odds.''
        Ruling in August on a case in which Mr. Van Bourg represented organized labor, the California Supreme Court affirmed the validity of a labor accord that only union labor would be used in the San Francisco airport's expansion.
        Mr. Van Bourg practiced law for three decades with Van Bourg, Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld, a law firm he founded. The firm, which is in Oakland, Calif., has 35 lawyers and represents more than 400 unions, their members and their benefit plans.
        In 1997, the firm became involved in early litigation on behalf of health and welfare trust funds against tobacco companies.
        Earlier, Mr. Van Bourg represented the National Farm Workers Union, headed by Cesar Chavez, when it merged with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee in 1966. Over the years, Mr. Van Bourg  argued before the United States Supreme Court four times.
        He was born in New York City and  grew up in Los Angeles. His father was a painter and his mother a teacher. He received a bachelor's degree in 1953 and a law degree in 1956, both from the University of California at Berkeley.
        He survivors include his wife, Shirley; two sons, Andrew and Timothy; and three grandchildren.
