        Theodore A. Distler, president emeritus of Franklin and Marshall College, died Sunday at the Homestead Village health care center in Lancaster, Pa. He was 92 years old.
        Mr. Distler had been in poor health for some time, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        He was president of Franklin and Marshall, in Lancaster, from 1941 to 1954. Later he was executive director of the Association of American Colleges in Washington, which named him president emeritus in 1965. For two years he was president of the Commission for Independent Colleges and Universities in Harrisburg, Pa. He was interim president of Lancaster Theological Seminary in 1969-70.
        Mr. Distler, who was born in Brooklyn, attended Brown University. After service with the Naval Reserve, he graduated in 1922 from New York University, where he also received an M.A. and a Ph.D. He was a member of the N.Y.U. faculty until 1934, when he became dean of Lafayette College in Easton, Pa., a post he held until 1941.
        Mr. Distler is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Alice Boxold; a son, Paul Antonie of Blacksburg, Va.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.
