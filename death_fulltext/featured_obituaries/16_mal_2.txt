        Ben Lexcen, who designed the yacht that ended the 132-year reign of the United States in America's Cup racing, died Sunday night. He was 52 years old.
        Mr. Lexcen suffered a heart attack at his home in the Sydney suburb of Balgowlah, a hospital spokesman said today.
        He gained international prominence in 1983 when his unique winged-keel design enabled Australia II, skippered by John Bertrand, to defeat the New York Yacht Club defender Liberty, skippered by Dennis Conner, and win the America's Cup off Newport, R.I.
        The United States won the America's Cup in 1987 when Conner skippered Stars & Stripes past the defender, Kookaburra, a yacht that was not designed by Mr. Lexcen.
