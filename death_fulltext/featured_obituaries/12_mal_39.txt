        Between 1956, when he became managing director and chief executive officer of AB Volvo, and 1978, when he retired as chairman, annual production grew from 31,000 to 260,300 cars that were sold around the world.
        Corporate revenues, from the manufacture of marine and jet aircraft engines and buses and trucks as well as cars, rose from $140 million in 1956 to $1 billion in 1978.
        In the same period, Volvo, which established its own sales outlets in the United States for the first time in 1956, saw its annual American sales rise from 1,605 to 50,177 cars. In the first nine months of 1987, 105,087 Volvos were sold in this country and overall revenues in 1986 were $12.4 billion.
        Throughout his more than two decades of car making, Mr. Engellau, an engineer who had run Volvo's aircraft engine subsidiary before heading the parent, carefully nourished the company's reputation for quality and durability. The car buyers he targeted at home and abroad were those who were less impressed by styling and prestige than by peformance, longevity and operating economy.
        In the late 1950's, when car safety was a growing concern in the industry, Volvo was the first car maker to install seat belts as standard equipment, in 1959. Later, when the United States Congress held hearings on auto safety, Volvos already had such features as a collapsible steering column and interior crash padding.
        Survivors include a son, five daughters and several siblings.
