        Charles G. Stanton, an advertising salesman, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 35 years old and lived in Detroit.
        He died of complications from a brain injury incurred in a skiing accident in Las Lenas, Argentina, in 1988, said his father, Frank Stanton.
        Before his accident, Mr. Stanton was an account executive for Ski magazine, working out of the Detroit office. Until 1986, he worked in advertising and sales in Detroit for the Hearst Corporation's Popular Mechanics magazine.
        He was a 1981 graduate of Colgate University.
        In addition to his father, he is survived by his mother, Barbara Ann Stanton, of Greenwich, Conn., and four brothers, Dr. Francis X. Jr. of San Diego, Mark of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., Paul of Ridgefield, Conn., and Brian of Trumbull, Conn.
