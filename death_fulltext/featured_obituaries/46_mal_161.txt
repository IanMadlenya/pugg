        Dominick J. Sanchini, who managed the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant for the Rockwell International Corporation in the contractor's final four years there, died of cancer Sunday at his home in Thousand Oaks, Calif. He was 63 years old.
        The plant, which makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, has been criticized for improper disposal of hazardous wastes. Last year, the Department of Energy suspended plutonium operations there because of safety and management problems. Those operations remain shut down.
        Mr. Sanchini joined North American Aviation, a forerunner to Rockwell, in 1953. He helped Rockwell win the contract to build engines for the space shuttle and took over at Rocky Flats in 1986.
        When the Energy Department ended its contract with Rockwell last year, Mr. Sanchini returned to California as a corporate vice president. He retired earlier this year.
        He is survived by his wife, Claire; two daughters and three grandchildren.
