        Anthony D. Berns, a New York restaurateur and a member of the family that helped found the "21" Club, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 53.
        The cause was colon cancer, said his daughter Rachel Berns.
        Until recently Mr. Berns was vice president of Iron Gate Products, a wholesale food purveyor in Manhattan linked to the "21" Club.
        The restaurant was founded by his father, Charles Berns, and one of his father's cousins, Jack Kriendler, and had its origins in a speak-easy named the Red Head, begun in 1922.
        The younger Mr. Berns began work at "21" when he was 16. The elder Mr. Berns died in 1971.
        Anthony Berns had also owned and operated two New York restaurants, the Unicorn and Tony Berns. He was a graduate of New York University.
        He is survived by his wife, Judith Berns of Manhattan, and five daughters, Deborah McGovern, Alicia Berns, Charlie Berns and Antonia Berns, all of Manhattan, and Rachel of Pelham, N.Y.
