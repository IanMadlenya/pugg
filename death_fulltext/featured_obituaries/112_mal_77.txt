        Lieut. Gen. William W. Dick Jr., whose 37-year Army career ended in 1968 with his retirement as commander of allied land forces in southern Europe, died on May 8 at a retirement community in Fort Belvoir, Va. He was 86.
        The cause was pneumonia, his family said.

        After the war, he served in Washington and Japan, where he rejoined the 25th  Division. He accompanied it to Korea when the Korean War broke out in 1950, and  rose to division artillery commander.
        General Dick was born in Montgomery, Ala., and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1931. After serving in Hawaii, he was named an instructor at West Point.
        Besides his service in the Far East, West Germany and Washington, General Dick took part in the nuclear tests at Eniwetok Atoll in the western Pacific in  1958. Later, as special weapons chief and commanding officer of the Army Air Defense Command, he played a central role in the nation's anti-missile projects.
        He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Frances Lawson Dick; two sons, William W. 3d, of Vienna, Va., and Laurin L., of Springfield, Va.; a sister, Marguerite D. Stevens of Washington; a brother, Brig. Gen. John S. B. Dick, retired, of Weaverville, N.C.; six grandchildren, and a great-grandson.
