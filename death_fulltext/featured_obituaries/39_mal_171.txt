        Bob Davies, an all-America guard at Seton Hall a half-century ago and a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, died of cancer Sunday in a hospital at Hilton Head, S.C. He was 70 years old.
        Mr. Davies, a speedy, elusive 6-foot-1-inch backcourt star from Harrisburg, Pa., whose ball-handling and shot making helped to bring on a higher-scoring style of play, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., on April 11, 1970. While at Seton Hall, he led the Pirates to a 19-0 record in the 1939-40 season, when he was a sophomore, and then to records of 20-2 in 1940-41 and 16-3 in 1941-42.
        While in the Navy during World War II, Mr. Davies played with the Great Lakes Naval Station team and part time for Brooklyn of the American Basketball League in 1943-44 and New York of the A.B.L. in 1944-45.
        After the war, he joined the Rochester Royals and helped them win the National Basketball League championship in 1946 and 1947. In the 1946-47 season, Mr. Davies was the league's most valuable player and also found time to coach Seton Hall to a 24-3 record. ''I took a lot of overnight sleepers,'' he later explained.
        In the 1948-49 season, Rochester joined the National Basketball Association. Before he retired in 1955, Mr. Davies was selected to N.B.A. All-Star teams four times and was a first-team all-league selection three times. The Royals, who also included Bobby Wanzer, Red Holzman, Pep Saul, Arnie Risen and Jack Coleman, won the league title in 1951.
        After he retired as a player, Mr. Davies coached at Gettysburg College for two seasons and then worked in sales and promotion for the Converse Rubber Company.
        ''He was probably years ahead of his time,'' said Mr. Holzman, the former coach of the Knicks. ''He was one of the few guys that could have been playing today. He was a great player.''
        Mr. Davies is survived by his wife, Mary; three sons, one daughter and and four grandchildren.
