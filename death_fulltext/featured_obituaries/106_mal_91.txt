        William Boucher 3d, who helped turn this city's downtown from a shabby shopping area into a tourist center of restaurants and boutiques, died of a heart attack on Monday. He was 76.
        One day during the mid-1950's, Mr. Boucher, who had worked in his family's tobacco business and was vice president of a specialty grocery, took a walk around the city and found what he later described as conditions worse than the North African slums he had seen during World War II. He then helped form the Greater Baltimore Committee and was its executive director for most of the following three decades.
        As one of the city's biggest boosters, he was instrumental in the development of Inner Harbor, the Civic Center, the Jones Falls Expressway, mass transit and  the Maryland Port Authority.
        He is survived by a brother, Abbot, of Towson, Md.; four nephews, and a niece.
