        A. Arthur Gottlieb, a biologist and immunologist who formed his own biotechnology company, died on Sunday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was 60 and lived in New Orleans.
        The cause of death was a blood clot that lodged in his lung after surgery, his family said.
        At his death Dr. Gottlieb was chairman of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology as well as Professor of Medicine at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. He held the two posts for 23 years.
        He was also the founder and chief executive of Imreg Inc., a biotechnology concern he formed in 1985 to search for new substances that bolster the human immune system.
        His work, which focused on links between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system, tested investigatory therapies for diseases, like H.I.V. infection, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.
        The author of some 100 scientific papers, Dr. Gottlieb served as a consultant to various Government agencies and was a member of the Federal Government's Breast Cancer Task Force.
        Abraham Arthur Gottlieb was born in Haifa under the British Mandate over Palestine. He graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1954 and in chemistry from Columbia College in 1957.
        After medical training at New York University School of Medicine and Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, he became a tenured professor at the Institute of Microbiology of Rutgers University in Piscataway, N.J.
        Dr. Gottlieb is survived by his wife of 40 years, Marise Suss Gottlieb; two daughters, Mindy G. Davidson of Houston and Joanne M. Gottlieb of New York, and two granddaughters.
