        Daniel Parker, a leader in business and government and the former head of his family's Parker Pen Company, died Tuesday at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. He was 66 years old and lived in Wadmalaw Island, S.C.
        Mr. Parker died of complications during bone surgery, said Gaylan Crowell, a vice president and director of marketing for Omniflight Helicopters, a company founded by Mr. Parker. Omniflight, one of the largest helicopter maintenance companies in the country, is based in Charleston.
        Born in Chicago, Mr. Parker was the grandson of George S. Parker, who founded Parker Pen, in Janesville, Wis., in 1888. He joined the family business in 1949 after graduating from the Harvard Business School and serving as a lieutenant in the Marine Corps. At the age of 35 he became the youngest chief executive officer in the history of Parker Pen, now Parker Pen USA. He eventually became its chairman, and he remained honorary chairman through 1986.
        Mr. Parker, who piloted both airplanes and helicopters, started his first helicopter business in 1955. In 1962, he founded Omniflight Helicopters, with offices worldwide that provide helicopter maintenance for the medical profession, law-enforcement agencies and the utility industry.
        An active Republican, Mr. Parker served as the director of the Agency for International Development in the Nixon and Ford Administrations and as a member of the President's Public Advisory Commission on Trade Policy from 1968 to 1969.
        Mr. Parker is survived by his wife, JoAnn Slack Parker; two sons, Geoffrey S. Parker of Easton, Md., and Steven M. Parker of Mount Vernon, N.J.; two daughters, Jennifer Parker Coleon of Bedford, N.Y., and Sarah Parker Topping, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and eight grandchildren.
