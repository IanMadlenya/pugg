        Frank R. Gilchrist, who ran the Gilchrist Timber Company and its company town for more than 30 years, died Tuesday at St. Charles Medical Center in Bend. He was 66 years old.
        In 1938 Mr. Gilchrist's father, Frank W. Gilchrist, moved from the cut-over timber lands of Mississippi to the pine forests of Oregon.
        The family had bought 80,000 acres of virgin forest land, and planned a new town and sawmill 45 miles south of Bend. Their plans produced the town of Gilchrist, population 500, now one of the last timber company towns in Oregon, and the Gilchrist Timber Company, which still employs about 180 people.
        After Frank W. Gilchrist died in 1956 Frank R. Gilchrist became president of Gilchrist Timber. He retired in 1988.
        Survivors include three sons, a daughter and two granchildren.
