        Stanley S. Scott, who served as an aide to two Presidents and was a vice president of Philip Morris U.S.A., died Saturday night in New Orleans. He was 59 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Scott, a former New York journalist, was special assistant to Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, and was also assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development.
        As the first black reporter for United Press International, he was in the Audubon Ballroom in New York on Feb. 21, 1965, when Malcolm X was assassinated. Mr. Scott went on to become the first black full-time reporter for radio station WINS.
        In 1971, he became assistant communications director in the Nixon White House, and then special assistant.
        Mr. Scott joined Philip Morris Companies Inc., in 1977, eventually becoming vice president of corporate affairs. In 1988 he bought the Crescent Distributing Company in New Orleans, a distributor for the Miller Brewing Company, a Philip Morris subsidiary. He sold Crescent last August, when his cancer was diagnosed.
        Mr. Scott's uncle, William A. Scott, founded The Atlanta Daily World and built it into a network of nearly three dozen weekly newspapers in the South. The family still runs the Atlanta paper.
        Mr. Scott is survived by his wife, the former Bettye Lovejoy; a daughter, Susan, of New Orleans, and two sons, Kenneth Scott, of Atlanta, and Stanley Scott Jr., of New Orleans.
