        Stanley E. Shirk, a former executive at the accounting firm KPMG who was once nominated to be comptroller of the currency, died on Dec. 7 at a hospital in Manhattan. He was 83.
        Mr. Shirk, who lived in West Cornwall, Conn., was born on June 12, 1916, in Brooklyn and graduated from St. John's University.
        He began his career with Barrow Wade Guthrie & Company, which in 1950 merged with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Company. In 1953, Mr. Shirk took over the company's banking practice.
        After retiring from the firm in 1976, Mr. Shirk was nominated by President Gerald R. Ford to become comptroller of the currency. However, Congressional hearings were never held on the nomination.
        He is survived by his wife, Barbara; a daughter, Susan Shirk of San Diego; a son, Richard Shirk of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
