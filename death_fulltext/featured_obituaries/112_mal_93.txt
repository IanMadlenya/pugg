        Seymour H. Knox 3d, who along with his brother founded the Buffalo Sabres and served as principal owners of the National Hockey League team, died today. He was 70.
        Mr. Knox had been suffering from cancer for the last several years, said a team spokesman, Gil Chorbajian.
        It was Mr. Knox and his brother, Northrup, who were responsible for bringing the Sabres to Buffalo when the N.H.L. expanded in 1969. But Seymour will be the  Knox remembered for keeping the Sabres in small-market Buffalo when other teams  in larger cities moved. The team has lost millions of dollars over the last several years.
        Mr. Knox was credited for putting together the financing for Marine Midland Arena, a $127 million building that will replace Memorial Auditorium as home to  the Sabres in the fall. The arrangement guaranteed that the Sabres would remain  in Buffalo for at least 30 years.
        Mr. Knox was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1993 and stepped down as president of the Sabres a year later.
        In addition to his brother, Mr. Knox is survived by his wife, Jean, four children and five grandchildren.
