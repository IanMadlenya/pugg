        Michael A. Braun, a prominent lawyer who defended accused war criminals during the American military's postwar occupation of Japan, died on Thursday in Tokyo. He was 79 years old and lived in Tokyo.
        He died of cancer, said Hugh J. Freund, a family spokesman, adding that he had no further details on the cause of death.
        Mr. Braun was the founder of Braun Moriya Hoashi & Kubota, an international law firm based in Tokyo.
        A native of New York City, Mr. Braun earned a bachelor's degree at Columbia University and a law degree at the University of Michigan.
        He served as a captain in United States Army Intelligence during World War II. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Mr. Braun was assigned to the military occupation forces and served as a counsel for the accused in the Yokohama war crimes trials from 1947 to 1949.
        He was chief prosecutor at the Yokohama Military Court, an administrative tribunal, from 1950 to 1952. In 1952 he passed a Japanese examination and became one of the first foreign lawyers admitted to the Tokyo Bar Association, the city's premier lawyers group.
        He founded his own firm soon afterward, representing Japanese companies and individuals as well as foreign companies.
        He helped introduce the concept of business franchising to Japan and was a director of more than 10 companies there, including MJB Japan, Ltd. and General Mills Asia, Inc.
        He is survived by his wife, Reiko; two sons: Michael, and George, both of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.
