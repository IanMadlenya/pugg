        Vernon F. Snow, a foundation executive and retired professor of English history and Western civilization at Syracuse University, died June 24 at his home in Jamesville, N.Y. He was 73 and also had a home in Marco Island, Fla.
        The cause was cancer, Syracuse University officials said.
        Dr. Snow retired in 1994 after 20 years as president of the John Ben Snow Foundation of Syracuse. At his death he remained a trustee of the John Ben Snow Memorial Trust, founded in 1975 to support higher education, the humanities, cultural education and minority students.
        The Snow Foundation, established in 1948, also has provided millions of dollars for college scholarships and for cultural and community activities across the country. It was founded by Dr. Snow's cousin, who made his fortune operating hundreds of F. W. Woolworth stores in Britain.
        Vernon Snow was a native of Milwaukee and a 1948 graduate of Wheaton College. He also earned master's and doctorate degrees in history at the University of Chicago in 1949 and the University of Wisconsin in 1953.
        Before he joined the Syracuse faculty in 1974, he taught at the Universities of Oregon, Wisconsin, Montana and Nebraska. His work in philanthropy led him to start a course on the subject at Syracuse in 1988. He retired from teaching in 1992.
        He was the author or editor of several books and many articles on English history. He was a fellow of the Royal Historical Society, a consultant to the World Book Encyclopedia and past curator of the Yale Center for Parliamentary History.
        Dr. Snow is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; a son, Jonathan L., of Grand Blanc, Mich.; a brother, Howard, of Spooner, Wis., and two grandchildren.
