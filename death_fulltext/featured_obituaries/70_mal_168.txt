        Robert M. Doty, a museum director and former curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in the late 1960's and early 70's, died on Tuesday at Elliot Hospital in Manchester, N.H. He was 58 years old and lived in Manchester.
        Mr. Doty, who was hospitalized two weeks ago with an infection, died of respiratory problems, said his wife, Joan.
        Mr. Doty was born in Rochester on Dec. 23, 1933. He received a B.A. from Harvard University in 1956 and an M.A. from the University of Rochester in 1961, where he studied the history of photography. In Rochester, he also worked at George Eastman House, now known as the International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, organizing exhibitions of the work of Lewis Hine (1957), the Photo-Secession (1960) and Bill Brandt (1962).  Protest on an Exhibition
        Mr. Doty went to the Whitney as associate curator in 1966, becoming curator in 1970. While at the museum, he organized several highly debated exhibitions, including "Human Concern/Personal Torment: The Grotesque in American Art," a survey of often violent representational art, in 1968, and "Contemporary Black Artists in America," a 1971 exhibition from which 15 of its 75 artists withdrew to protest the fact that black specialists were not consulted in the show's selection.
        He also organized an impressive mid-career retrospective of the work of Lucas Samaras in 1972 and the Whitney's first historical survey of American photography in 1974.
        Mr. Doty left the Whitney in 1974 and served for three years as director of the Akron Art Institute before going to the Currier Gallery of Art in Manchester, where he was director from 1977 until he retired in 1987. Since 1988, he had worked part time as acting director of the New England College Gallery in Henniker, N.H. In addition to his exhibition catalogue essays, Mr. Doty wrote several magazine articles and books, including books on the Photo-Secession and the artists Will Barnet and Jane Freilicher.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Paul Andrew, of Salt Lake City, and David Timothy, of Manchester; a brother, John, of Newtown Square, Pa., and a grandson.
