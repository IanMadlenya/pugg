        The Rev. Francisco Oves Fernandez, the retired Roman Catholic Archbishop of Havana, died of a heart attack on Tuesday. He was 62 years old.
        Archbishop Oves was among hundreds of priests driven from Cuba in the early 1960's as Communists led by Fidel Castro consolidated power.
        He was allowed to return to Cuba in the late 1960's and in 1969 was ordained Auxiliary Bishop of Cienfuegos, Cuba.
        At his death, Archbishop Oves was pastor of Santo Nino de Atocha Catholic Church in El Paso.
