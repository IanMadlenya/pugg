        Msgr. Bela Varga, Hungary's first postwar Speaker of Parliament, died on Friday. He was 92.
        He helped Polish refugees flee the Nazis during World War II. In 1945 he was  arrested by advancing Soviet troops and sentenced to death but was later released when his captors learned that he had also helped Soviet Army prisoners  of war.
        He was elected to Parliament, where he became Speaker in 1946. But he left the country in 1947 as the Communists took over. He immigrated to the United States and worked in the church in New York before returning in 1991.
