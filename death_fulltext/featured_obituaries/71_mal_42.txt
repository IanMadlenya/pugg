        James Preston Layton, an aeronautics engineer who spent more than four decades working on rocket technologies, died Thursday at O'Connor Hospital in San Jose, Calif. He was 73 years old and lived in Santa Clara, Calif., where he had moved from Princeton, N.J., in May.
        The cause of death was cancer, his family said.
        A native of Penns Grove, N.J., Mr. Layton, who was known as Pres, received a degree in aeronautical engineering from New York University in 1941. That year he went on active duty as a naval officer for the duration of World War II, becoming involved with jet-assisted takeoff boosters.
        He tested solid-fuel units on naval aircraft in the Pacific. He also helped to develop liquid-fuel systems at the United States Naval Academy's laboratory under the direction of Robert H. Goddard, the father of American rocketry.
        As chief of propulsion for the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore in 1948, he was in charge of testing the first large American rocket, the Viking series. From 1951 to 1976 he was on the Princeton University research faculty. As chief engineer of the university's Guggenheim jet-propulsion laboratories, he set up a rocket research laboratory and made an experimental evaluation of liquid ozone as a rocket propellant.
        Mr. Layton was later involved with the design of the space shuttle and nuclear rockets and power plants in space.
        Mr. Layton is survived by his wife, the former Mary Early; three sons, J. Preston 2d of Burlington, Vt., Brendan of Secane, Pa., and Kieran of Santa Clara; two daughters, Katherine, also of Burlington, and Stacy DeMeo of Miami, and three grandchildren.
