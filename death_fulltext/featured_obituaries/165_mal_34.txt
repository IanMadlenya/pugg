        Emile Kuri, an Oscar-winning set decorator who also contributed designs to Disneyland and Walt Disney World, died on Tuesday at the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 93.
        Mr. Kuri won two Academy Awards for set decoration, the first for William Wyler's 1949 film, ''The Heiress,'' the second for Disney's ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'' in 1954. During his career he received a total of eight Oscar nominations.
        Born in Cuernavaca, Mexico, to Lebanese parents who eventually moved to Los Angeles, Mr. Kuri got his first film job from the director Hal Roach, whose home he was decorating and who liked his work so much that he asked him to help design the set for his 1937 comedy, ''Topper.''
        He went on to work with Alfred Hitchcock on the sets for ''Spellbound,'' ''Rope'' and ''The Trouble With Harry'' and on George Stevens's ''Shane'' and ''Place in the Sun.''
        His credits also included ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' directed by Frank Capra; he designed the Main Street setting of Jimmy Stewart's hometown.
        After he was hired by Walt Disney in 1952 as chief decorator for Disney Studios, Mr. Kuri designed Captain Nemo's submarine headquarters for ''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.''
        He received Oscar nominations for several other Disney films, including ''Bedknobs and Broomsticks,'' ''The Absent-Minded Professor'' and ''Mary Poppins.''
        Mr. Kuri also designed settings for Disney's first theme park, Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., and served as a consultant at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla.
        He won an Emmy for his designs for the television show ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color.''
        Mr. Kuri's wife, Carrie, died this year. He is survived by two sons, Frederick and John; a daughter, Elizabeth; six grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
