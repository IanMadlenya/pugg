        Abner J. Greshler, a talent agent and producer, died on Dec. 20 at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 83 and lived in Brentwood, Calif.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Violet.
        Mr. Greshler, whose clients included Tony Randall, Jack Klugman, David Janssen, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, was one of the first agents to create package deals, putting together stars, directors and other personnel and then selling the groupings to studios.
        Mr. Greshler, who used the nickname Abby, was born in Manhattan. He earned a bachelor's degree from Fordham University and a law degree from St. John's University. While still a teen-ager, he earned money booking dance bands, including Paul Whiteman's orchestra. After passing the law boards, he booked bands and comedians at resorts in the Catskills, where he paired Mr. Martin and Mr. Lewis for the first time.
        He created his own agency, Diamond Artists, in 1945; later that year, he moved to Los Angeles to produce the first Martin-and-Lewis films.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Stephen, of Palmdale, Calif.; a daughter, Francine Feldmann, of Santa Barbara, Calif., and a granddaughter.
