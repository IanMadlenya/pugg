        Thomas E. Moran, who led the Moran Towing Corporation of Greenwich, Conn., for more than three decades until its sale earlier this year, died on Monday at his home in Darien, Conn. He was 69.
        The cause was heart failure, said Malcolm W. MacLeod, president of Moran Towing.
        While at Moran Towing, Mr. Moran transformed the privately owned company, founded in 1860 by his great-grandfather, from a general harbor towing and ship docking business to a diversified marine transportation company. The company has offices and a fleet of tugboats from Portsmouth, N.H., to Port Arthur, Tex.
        At his death, Mr. Moran was chairman emeritus. He had relinquished the presidency in 1987 after serving in that job since 1964.
        Mr. Moran also served as a trustee of the New York Marine Towing and Transportation Industry Pension Fund and as a director of the American Steam Ship Owners Mutual Protection and Indemnity Association.
        He is survived by his wife, Miriam; a brother, Edmond J., of Baltimore; three sisters, Nancy Grinder of Aiken, S.C., Margot Danis of St. Louis and Sheila Reynolds of Manhattan; three sons, Peter M., of Westport, Conn., David E., of New Canaan, Conn., and James T., of Monroe, Conn.; two daughters, Cathleen Vermylen of Chatham, N.J., and Barbara Simson of Wilton, Conn.; two stepsons, Walter K. Schwind of Fairfield, Conn., and Scott A. Schwind of Darien; two stepdaughters, Suzanne K. Rodenbush of Cheshire, Conn., and Georgia M. Livsey of Greenfield, Mass.; and 15 grandchildren.
