        Lowell Broomall, a retired senior vice president of Western Union International who won accords with many countries to bridge the continents by undersea telecommunication cables, died on Friday at his home in Fairfield, N.J. He was 78 years old.
        He died of a glandular cancer, a family member said.
        Mr. Broomall worked for Western Union and its overseas company for 45 years until he retired in 1978, when he became a consultant with MCI International until his recent illness. He was a native of Hagerstown, Md., and a graduate of Temple University.
        His abiding avocation was music, which he studied in Paris with Marcel Dupre. He was for half a century an organist and choirmaster, serving for more than 25 years at Temple B'nai Abraham in Newark and Livingston, N.J.
        He was also a longtime board member of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra and its president from 1979 to 1981, helping to preserve it through a season-long musicians' strike. He helped to found the orchestra's Young Artists Auditions and was a longtime board member of the Whole Theater Company in Montclair, N.J.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary Jo; two sons, Robert, of West Orange, N.J., and Anthony Wayne of McKinleyville, Calif.; two daughters, Carole Thorn of Hilton Head, S.C., and Cheryl Shallish of Syracuse; two stepdaughters, Angela Whitney of Leicester, N.C., and Carole Whitney of Boulder, Colo.; a stepson, Courtney Whitney 3d of Washington; a brother, William of McKinney, Tex., and nine grandchildren.
