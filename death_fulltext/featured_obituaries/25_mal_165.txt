        Mr. Wiess was a founder in 1930 of the firm of Wiess & Costa in Monticello, N.Y. In 1929 Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him a special county judge and surrogate to complete an unexpired term. Later that year, he was elected to a second, two-year term.
        In 1979, he was given a New York State Bar Association award, an annual recognition of a New York State lawyer who has served ''with honor and distinction'' for 50 years or more.
        Mr. Wiess was born in Union City, N.J. He graduated from Yale College in 1924 and Yale Law School in 1926. He was the first chairman of the board of Sullivan County Community College when it opened in 1963 and was a board member at the time of his death.
        A widower, he is survived by a son, Myron J., and a daughter, Diana M. Weiner, both of Manhattan, and eight grandchildren.
