        Roman Kozak, a former rock editor at Billboard magazine and the author of a book about the New York rock club CBGB, died of cardiac arrest last Thursday in Las Vegas, Nev. He was 40 years old and lived in New York City.
        Mr. Kozak had been in Las Vegas covering a meeting of the Video Software Dealers Association for a trade publication last month when he suffered a stroke. He had been in a coma at the University Medical Center of Las Vegas until his death.
        Mr. Kozak, who was born of Ukrainian parents in a camp for displaced persons in Germany, began his journalistic career as sports editor for The Daily American newspaper in Rome. He became a correspondent for Billboard while living in Rome and was later transferred to New York as a reporter for the magazine.
        After a series of articles on rock-and-roll in the late 1970's, Mr. Kozak became Billboard's first rock editor. He left the magazine in 1984 to work on several projects and the first of those came to fruition earlier this year with the publication of ''This Ain't No Disco,'' a history of CBGB.
        Mr. Kozak is survived by his mother, Anna Kozak Wompel, a brother, Petro, and a sister, Alena, all of Philadelphia.
