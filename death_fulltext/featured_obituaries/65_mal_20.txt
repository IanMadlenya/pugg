        Gerhard Closs, a chemist and educator, died May 24 at his home in Palos Park, Ill. He was 64 years old.
        He died of heart failure, said a spokeswoman for the University of Chicago, where Dr. Closs was chairman of the chemistry department.
        Dr. Closs, who taught at the University of Chicago, specialized in physical organic chemistry, the study of molecular reactions, said Dr. James A. Marshall, chairman of the organic chemistry division of the American Chemical Society, which last year honored Dr. Closs for his achievements.
        He was a pioneer in studying the magnetic properties of the intermediate compounds formed in chemical reactions. He also found that certain reactions polarize atomic nuclei, a discovery that opened up a new way to study reactions.
        Dr. Closs was born in Wuppertal, Germany, and was educated at the University of Tubingen in Germany. He came to the United States in 1955 as a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University and joined the faculty of the University of Chicago in 1957.
        He is survived by his wife, Liselotte.
