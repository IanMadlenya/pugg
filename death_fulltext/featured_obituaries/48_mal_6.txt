        Arthur Lidov, a painter, illustrator and inventor, died Sunday at his home in Poughquag, N.Y. He was 73 years old.
        Mr. Lidov died in his sleep of natural causes, said his daughter, Mika Lidov of Manhattan.
        Largely self-taught, he specialized in popularizing scientific and technical material. Besides serving many national advertisers, he contributed to Life, Time, Fortune, The Saturday Evening Post, and other general and special-interest magazines. His paintings are included in several museums, among them the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago and the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
        In 1967, Mr. Lidov received a patent as the inventor of the Insertable Spokeless Wheel, a plastic bicycle without hubs or caps that ran on ball bearings and was, its inventor said, "impervious to flats."
        Mr. Lidov was born in Chicago. He earned a degree in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1936 and was a graduate fellow in art history.
        Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Alexandra Wool, a painter, and a son, Hart Lidov of Boston.
