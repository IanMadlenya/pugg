        Milton Perry, the former curator of the Harry Truman Library and Museum, died Tuesday at Washoe Medical Center in Reno. He was 65 years old and lived in Lake Tahoe, Nev.
        He died following a heart attack, said a son-in-law, Bill Sherriff of Kansas City, Mo.
        The Truman museum opened in 1958 in Independence, Mo., the birthplace of the 33d President of the United States, and Mr. Perry was its first curator. Mr. Perry researched and organized exhibits for the museum. He said one particularly popular exhibit was a piano that had been in the White House and Blair House and had been played by both Mr. Truman and Richard Nixon.
        In 1976, Mr. Perry left the Truman museum. He worked for the Historical Kansas City Foundation for two years, and in 1978 he began to restore the cabin at the Jesse James farm in Kearney, Mo. For 13 years, Mr. Perry dug into legends and lore of the famous outlaw. He arranged James family reunions and assisted writers and filmmakers. He retired in July and moved to Lake Tahoe. In 1965, Mr. Perry wrote, "Infernal Machines: The Story of the Confederate Submarine and Mine Warfare," published by Louisiana State University Press. He also wrote "Patton and His Pistols," published in 1955, and edited the James Farm Journal.
        Mr. Perry is survived by his wife, Janet, and three daughters, Carolyn Vellar and Julie Sherriff of Kansas City and Linda Smith of Visalia, Calif.
