        The Rev. K. Brent Woodruff, an Episcopal priest and a former college official, died Wednesday at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, Calif. He was 86 years old and lived in San Jose.
        He died of heart failure, his wife, Barbara, said.
        Mr. Woodruff, a 1925 graduate of Bard College, served briefly as acting president there in 1960 before being named a vice president at American University in Washington, where he served for 13 years before retiring.
        A graduate of the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Mass., he was ordained in 1928. After serving at several parishes, he left the priesthood in 1940 to pursue a career in social service and education.
        He later founded a public relations firm in Manhattan and was a past president of the National Society of Fund-Raisers. In 1985 he was restored to the priesthood.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Kelly Brent of Cincinnati, Daniel of Los Angeles and John of Tustin, Calif., a daughter, Margaret Furry of Cleveland; two stepsons, the Rev. Christopher Neeley of Cincinnati and T. G. Neely of Scottsdale, Ariz.; a sister, Eunice Cally of Huntington, W. Va., 15 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.
