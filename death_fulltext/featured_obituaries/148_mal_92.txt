        Sheldon Judson, an archeologist and a retired professor of geosciences at Princeton University, died yesterday in his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 80.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to a statement released by the university.
        Dr. Judson was born on Oct. 18, 1918, in Utica, N.Y. He earned a bachelor's degree from Princeton in 1940 and master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard University. After teaching for several years at the University of Wisconsin, he joined the Princeton faculty in 1955.
        Dr. Judson was the author of numerous geo-archeological reports, including several studies of paleo-Indian sites in North America and studies of late Paleolithic rock shelters in France. He also worked extensively in Etruscan, Roman and Greek sites in Italy.
        From 1970 to 1982, Dr. Judson was the chairman of the Department of Geosciences at Princeton. From 1972 to 1977, he served as chairman of the University Research Board with the rank of dean. In 1964, he was appointed the Knox Taylor professor of geology. He also held faculty fellowships from the Ford, Guggenheim and Fulbright Foundations.
        Dr. Judson wrote or co-wrote textbooks and workbooks used in introductory geology classes. His best-known book is perhaps ''Physical Geology'' (Prentice Hall, 1954) written with L. Don Leet and, in revised editions, with Marvin E. Kauffman. His most recent book was ''Earth: An Introduction to Geologic Change'' (Prentice Hall, 1995) written with S. M. Richardson.
        His first wife, Anne Perrin, died in 1990. He is survived by his second wife, Pamela Judson-Rhodes; three daughters, Stephanie Dean Judson of Riverton, N.J., Lucy Sheldon Judson of Boulder, Colo., and Anne Perrin Judson of Burlington, Vt.; six grandchildren; four stepchildren, and six stepgrandchildren.
