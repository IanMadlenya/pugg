       George O. Chambers, an Indiana Republican apparently elected to Congress by 12 votes in 1960 but rejected seven months later by the House of Representatives, died Friday at the Muncie-Ball Hospital in Muncie, Ind. He was 87 years old and had lived in Anderson, Ind., before moving to Muncie six years ago.
        George O. Chambers, an Indiana Republican apparently elected to Congress by 12 votes in 1960 but rejected seven months later by the House of Representatives, died Friday at the Muncie-Ball Hospital in Muncie, Ind. He was 87 years old and had lived in Anderson, Ind., before moving to Muncie six years ago. His family said he died of lupus.
        Mr. Chambers, who practiced law for half a century until his retirement in 1983, had sought to unseat J. Edward Roush, a one-term Democrat from Indiana's Fifth Congressional District, in the year in which John F. Kennedy narrowly defeated Richard M. Nixon for the Presidency.
        Indiana polling officials certified Mr. Chambers as the winner over Mr. Roush, who contended that he was the winner by two votes. The House ordered a recount and the dispute dragged on until the following June, when the Democratic-controlled body finally seated Mr. Roush.
        Mr. Chambers, who received a law degree from Indiana University, served in the Army in World War II. His first wife, the former Margaret Egbert, died in 1968.
        He is survived by his second wife, the former Viola Ferguson; a daughter, Cordelia Sylvester of Anderson, and a sister, Bertha Vermillion of Mulberry, Ind.
