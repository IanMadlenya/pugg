        Ira Wallach, who wrote the novel "Muscle Beach" and collaborated with Peter Ustinov on the screenplay for "Hot Millions," died on Saturday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his wife, Lillian.
        Mr. Wallach was born in New York City and grew up in New Rochelle. After briefly attending Cornell University, he went to Palestine and worked in the potash industry. During World War II he served with the United States Army in the Pacific theater, attaining the rank of sergeant.
        After writing "The Horn and the Rose" (1947), a fictional treatment of the life of the painter Peter Paul Rubens, he turned to satire in "How to Be Deliriously Happy" (1950), a sendup of the bootstrap philosophy, and several collections of literary parodies, "Hopalong-Freud" (1951), "Hopalong-Freud Rides Again" (1952) and "Gutenberg's Folly" (1954). His comic novel "Absence of a Cello" (1960) was adapted for the Broadway stage in 1964. His 1959 novel "Muscle Beach," a comedy about the body-building cult in Southern California, was made into a film, "Don't Make Waves" (1967), with Tony Curtis and Claudia Cardinale.
        Mr. Wallach contributed sketches to many stage revues, including "Phoenix '55" (1955), "Once Over Lightly" (1955), "Top Drawer" (1954) and "Dig We Must" (1959). With Abram S. Ginnes, he wrote the Broadway comedy "Drink to Me Only" (1958), which starred Tom Poston. He wrote the book for the musical "Smiling the Boy Fell Dead" (1961) and the book and lyrics for the musical "Kaboom!" (1974).
        Mr. Wallach wrote the screenplays for "Boys' Night Out" (1962) and, with George W. Goodman, "The Wheeler Dealers" (1963). The screenplay for "Hot Millions" was nominated for an Academy Award.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, Jesse, of Manhattan; a  daughter, Leah, of Brooklyn, and a stepson, Dan Opatoshu, of Los Angeles.
