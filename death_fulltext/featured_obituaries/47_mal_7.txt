        Lawrence H. Tiihonen, who coached football and rowing and was athletic director during a 43-year career at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, died of pneumonia yesterday at the Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. He was 89 years old and had been retired since 1971.
        A 1925 graduate of Columbia, where he played football and served as captain of the varsity crew, Mr. Tiihonen went to Lawrenceville in 1928 to teach English while coaching football and rowing in his spare time. Eight years later, he relinquished his teaching duties to become athletic director, while continuing as rowing coach until 1945 and as football coach until 1955. His football teams had a record of 94-57-17.
        Mr. Tiihonen is survived by his wife, Gladys.
