        Jeremiah O'Callaghan, a past president of the Ancient Order of Hibernians and a prominent Jersey City lawyer and political figure for four decades, died on Saturday at Bayonne Hospital in New Jersey. He was 80.
        Relatives said Mr. O'Callaghan died after a long illness.
        Mr. O'Callaghan was born in County Cork, Ireland, and had lived in Jersey City since coming to the United States in 1934. He was a Jersey City policeman while attending John Marshall College of Law, now part of Seton Hall University.
        During World War II, Mr. O'Callaghan joined the Army as a private and left as a captain after service in North Africa, Sicily and Italy. He began his law career in 1946. In the 1950's, Mr. O'Callaghan was a strong supporter of Mayor Frank Eggers of Jersey City.
        He served as Corporation Counsel, civil defense adviser and Municipal Court judge and was an unsuccessful independent candidate for the House of Representatives in 1954, when he ran as an outspoken anti-Communist.
        Mr. O'Callaghan was active in Roman Catholic organizations, including the Knights of Columbus and the Knights of St. Gregory. He headed the Ancient Order of Hibernians in the late 1950's.
        He is survived by his wife, Patricia.
