        Winn Newman, a labor and civil rights lawyer who fought salary discrimination based on sex or race, died on Friday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. He was 70 and lived in Washington.
        The cause was a stroke, said his daughter-in-law Jeanne Vonhof.
        At his death, Mr. Newman was the general counsel of the Americans for Democratic Action; of the Coalition of Labor Union Women, a national organization based in Washington, and of the Public Employee Department of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
        Leon Shull, a retired national director of Americans for Democratic Action, said yesterday that Mr. Newman's most important contribution in the legal field was his work, on behalf of unions of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., on "cases of discrimination against women and minorities, but primarily women, particularly in the area of equal pay for equal work."
        "He won several notable cases against major corporations, who finally came to accept the thesis that women should be paid equally, as compared to men," Mr. Shull said.
        In addition, Mr. Newman was prominent in litigation against employers who discriminated against pregnant workers. Over the years, he also did other legal work related to civil rights and practiced general labor law, on the union side.
        He was born in Queens and grew up in its Ozone Park section. He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Wisconsin.
        His survivors include his wife of 47 years, Elaine Lipkin Newman; three sons, Harry Joel, of Franklin, Mich., Michael, of Chicago, and Sanford, of Takoma Park, Md.; two brothers, Albert, of Glendale, Calif., and Bernard, of Lake Worth, Fla., and four grandchildren.
