        Harry Goz, an actor who was an understudy in ''Fiddler on the Roof'' and wound up playing the lead, died on Sept. 6 in a hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., where he lived. He was 71.
        The cause was cancer, said his wife, Margaret.
        Mr. Goz made his Broadway debut in a minor role in ''Bajour'' in 1964 but filled in for the lead when Herschel Bernardi caught the chicken pox. Two years later he was Bernardi's understudy again, as the lead role in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' Mr. Goz filled in for Bernardi 112 times before Bernardi left the production for good in late 1967, and played the role of Tevye for over a year on Broadway before the role was taken over by Jerry Jarrett. Mr. Goz also played the role on the road.
        After ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' he was in the Richard Rodgers musical ''Two by Two.'' He played the part of Shem, but filled in for the lead when Danny Kaye broke his ankle.
        He also acted in ''Prisoner of Second Avenue'' and ''Chess,'' worked in television and the movies, and had an extensive career as a voice-over actor in commercials. Most recently he worked in cartoons, playing the part of Captain Murphy on ''Sealab 2021,'' a comedy on the Cartoon Network that has become a cult hit.
        Besides his wife, he survived by three children, Michael, of East Northport, N.Y.; Geoffrey, of Nesconset, N.Y.; and Melissa Goz Tantillo, of Port Washington, N.Y.; a sister, Jane Goz Goodman, of St. Louis; and nine grandchildren.
