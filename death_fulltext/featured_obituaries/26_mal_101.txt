        Dr. W. Kenneth Riland, an osteopath whose patients included Richard M. Nixon and Nelson A. Rockefeller, died of complications from lymphoma Monday at New York Hospital. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        During the Nixon Administration, Dr. Riland traveled to Washington every fortnight to treat President Nixon. He was also a personal physician to Governor Rockefeller, who appointed him to the state's Public Health Council and Mental Hygiene Council.
        Born in Camden, N.J., he graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He joined the United States Steel Corporation and became its chief physician in 1958.
        He became President Nixon's osteopath and traveled with him to China and the Soviet Union. He also traveled with Governor Rockefeller. He was the osteopath of Henry A. Kissinger, while he was the Secretary of State.
        Dr. Riland co-founded the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1977, after Governor Rockefeller pushed for legislation establishing the school. At the time of his death, Dr. Riland was chairman of the board of the college, in Old Westbury, L.I.
        Surviving are his wife, Therese; two daughters, Gail Ferguson of Miami and Sallie Reed of Brandon, Vt., three grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.
        A memorial service is to be held Thursday at 11 A.M. at Trinity Church, 74 Trinity Place, Manhattan.
