        Mr. Gladwin, who was also the first black to become a Criminal Court judge and an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, served as a Democratic Assemblyman in the Seventh District in the Bronx from 1953 to 1957.
        Mr. Gladwin, who was born in Verbice, British Guiana, moved to the Bronx as a teen-ager and paid for his college and graduate education by working part time as a printer and elevator operator. He graduated from City College in 1936 and New York Law School in 1941.
        After being appointed to the bench in 1957 by Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Mr. Gladwin presided over a number of heralded cases, including one that involved the stabbing of Adele Morales Mailer, the second wife of Norman Mailer.
