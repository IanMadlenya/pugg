        Sydney S. Stern, designer of the original Ritz Crackers, Shredded Wheat and Animal Crackers boxes, died of heart failure June 5 at the Palms of Pasadena Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla. He was 99 years old and lived in St. Petersburg.
        Mr. Stern, who was trained as an artist, joined the National Biscuit Company in 1923 and spent much of his life designing its cartons and wrappers. His design for Nabisco's Animal Crackers, including caged lions, tigers and bears, replaced the original 1902 packaging and has changed only slightly over the years. His design for the Shredded Wheat box has had a similarly long life.
        In 1956, he retired and moved from Queens to St. Petersburg to devote himself to painting, teaching and travel.
        Mr. Stern, who began painting in water colors as a child, studied at the Art Students League, Columbia University and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. He won recognition for his work as a painter, a photographer and a set designer.
        He is survived by three sons, Robert, of St. Petersburg, Donald, of Kendall Park, N.J., and Henry, of Largo, Fla.; two brothers, George, of Hallandale, Fla., and Alfred, of New York City; four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.
