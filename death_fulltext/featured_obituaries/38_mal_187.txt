        Charles P. Smyth, a chemist on the Princeton University faculty for more than 40 years, died on March 18 at his home in Bozeman, Mont. He was 94 years old.
        As a chemist, Mr. Smyth worked in both academic and military research.
        In his university career, Mr. Smyth investigated the electrical properties of matter and their relation to the structure of molecules. He wrote two books and more than 300 scientific articles, and in 1954 was awarded the Nichols Medal of the American Chemical Society.
        Worked on Atomic Bomb
        During World War II, Mr. Smyth worked with a team of scientists to develop the atomic bomb under the Manhattan Project, and also served as a consultant to the War Department. In 1947, he received the Army Medal of Freedom for his scientific intelligence work in Europe in the last months of the war.
        He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1932 and to the National Academy of Sciences in 1955. He was also a fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of both the American Chemical Society and the Royal Society of Chemistry.
        After retiring in 1963, he worked as a consultant to the Office of Naval Research until 1978.
        Born in Clinton, N.Y., Mr. Smyth graduated from Princeton in 1916 with a bachelor's degree in chemistry and from Harvard University in 1921 with a Ph.D. A year before receiving his Ph.D., he joined the Princeton faculty, and was named a full professor in 1938. Mr. Smyth held the David B. Jones Professorship in Chemistry when he retired.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Emily Vezin. His father, the late Charles H. Smyth, and his brother, the late Henry DeWolf Smyth, also taught at Princeton.
