        Paul R. Smith, an art director whose range of other achievements included celestial navigation, the jazz guitar and watercolor painting, died in Bermuda on Oct. 3. He was 86 and had lived in retirement in Bermuda since 1970.
        He had had a series of strokes, his family said.
        Mr. Smith was an art director from 1928 to 1967 and a member of the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame. He was noted for his success in selling abstract ideas rather than products.
        He worked for many agencies over the years, among them Kenyon & Eckhardt, where he began in 1936. He formed his own concern in 1948 and then merged with Calkins & Holden in 1950.
        A poster campaign he created on behalf of The New York Times when he headed his own agency was described in 1952 by the Museum of Modern Art "as the most artistically significant institutional advertising being done in America today."
        Mr. Smith was also the country's youngest licensed radio operator at the age of 14; taught celestial navigation to pilots in World War II; developed an improved system of blind bombing that was used by British pilots before radar, and wrote and illustrated a technical manual for weight distribution that became standard for the United States and NATO warplanes.
        He was an accomplished jazz guitarist, credited with founding the Friday Club in 1937 that featured jazz concerts. He also was an expert in judo and a captain and navigator in numerous Newport-Bermuda sailing races.
        During his retirement in Bermuda, his watercolors were shown at local galleries and he taught art to the handicapped.
        He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, Paul, of Richmond; three daughters, Susan E. Smith of Del Mar, Calif., Phyllis Mustain of Los Angeles, and Cathy Olsen of Tallahassee, Fla.; two brothers, Sidney and Robert, both of Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.
