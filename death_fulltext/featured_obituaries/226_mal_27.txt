        Michael Mendelson, former president of the investment firm Oppenheimer & Company, died on Nov. 4 at his home in Manhattan. He was 63.
        The cause was stomach cancer, his family said.
        After working for nearly 20 years at E. F. Hutton & Company, which dissolved in the 1980's, Mr. Mendelson joined what was then a small company called Fahnestock & Company, which bought Oppenheimer & Company and took its name.
        He served as president from 1989 to 1992 before voluntarily stepping down to rejoin its Fahnestock Asset Management Group as chairman, a position he held at his death. He helped expand its investment advisory and brokerage divisions.
        Mr. Mendelson also supported charitable causes and the arts, most notably YAI/National Institute for People with Disabilities and the New Group, the theater company that produced the Tony-award winning musical ''Avenue Q''. He helped incorporate the New Group and establish its board, ultimately serving as its chairman.
        Mischa Mendelson was born in 1941 on a train en route to the town of Alma-Ata in eastern Russia as his parents fled their western Russian hometown, fearing that it would be a Nazi target. His parents were killed in the war. He moved with his grandparents to the United States in 1951 and later changed his first name. He received a bachelor's degree from New York University's School of Commerce, now the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, in 1964, and later served in the Army. He is survived by his wife, Mimi; two daughters, Shara and Lauren; and his son, Gideon, all of New York City.
