        Leighton Kerner, a longtime classical music critic for The Village Voice, died Saturday in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Dorita. He had a stroke earlier in the week.
        Mr. Kerner, who wrote music reviews for The Voice beginning in 1957 and worked at the newspaper until 1998, was a fixture at New York concert halls and opera houses, and few, if any, colleagues could match his attendance record for important musical events. He also traveled the country, exercising an unusual avidity for the new or the exceptional in classical music.
        Besides working for The Voice, Mr. Kerner wrote for several magazines and other publications, especially for Opera News, but also for Musical America and Travel & Leisure.
        Born in Somerville, Mass., in 1927, he earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Tufts University and then a master's in journalism from Boston College. He was a freelancer for The Voice from 1957 to 1961 and then joined the staff.
        Mr. Kerner is survived by his wife and by a sister, Atholie Rosett.
