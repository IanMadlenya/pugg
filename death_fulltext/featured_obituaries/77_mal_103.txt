        Jean Cau, a French author and journalist, died on Friday in Paris. He was 67.
        The cause was cancer, news agencies reported.
        Mr. Cau was an assistant to Jean-Paul Sartre from 1947 to 1956 and won praise for the novel "La Pitie de Dieu," about four murderers who share a prison cell. The book was awarded the Prix Goncourt in 1961 and was published here in 1963 under the title "The Mercy of God."
        Mr. Cau had a bitter, grating style and conservative views. The last of his numerous books was "L'Ivresse des Intellectuels" ("Intoxication of the Intellectuals"), published in 1992.
        He helped adapt the Zola novel "La Curee" for the 1966 film "The Game Is Over," which was produced and directed by Roger Vadim and which starred Jane Fonda.
        Mr. Cau was born in Bram in southern France. He studied philosophy in Paris, and went on to write for Paris-Match, L'Express and various other French publications.
