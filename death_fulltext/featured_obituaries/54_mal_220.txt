        Harrison Burns, a painter and teacher, died on July 14 at his summer home in Almunecar, Spain. He was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        Mr. Burns died of a heart attack, said a friend, Michael Walls.
        Mr. Burns recently completed his 20th year as an art teacher at the Rutgers Preparatory School in Somerset, N.J., where he had served as chairman of the art department for several years.
        His art was based on still photographs that he made from television broadcasts and altered with stencils, collage and paint to give an impression of how one sees in an age of television. A resident of New York City since 1972, he began exhibiting here in 1977 and had his most recent show at the E. M. Donahue Gallery in SoHo in June 1990.
        Mr. Burns is survived by his parents, Woodrow and Ethel Harrison Burns of Charlotte, N.C.; two brothers, Dr. Woodrow M. Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Joseph, of Greensboro, N.C., and two sisters, Harriet Burns of La Jolla, Calif., and Polly Burns of Saco, Maine.
