        Randy Allen, an actor and performance artist, died on Thursday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. He was 38 and lived in Philadelphia.
        The cause was AIDS, said Tony Origlio, his press representative.
        Mr. Allen was born in La Porte, Ind., and first studied acting in St. Louis. He also attended the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts and earned a master's degree in directing at the University of Southern California.
        He was best known for impersonating female entertainers, including Judy Garland, Liza Minnelli, Marilyn Monroe and Bette Davis. He toured the country in his one-man show, "P.S. Bette Davis" and performed in "Marilyn: Something's Got to Give," a re-creation of Marilyn Monroe. Last year he appeared at Town Hall with Milton Berle and Charles Busch in "Charles Busch's Dressing Up!"
        He is survived by his companion, Ron Hayes; his parents, Betty and Otto, of Hamlet, Ind.; a sister, Faye Mercer, and two brothers, Ray and Larry, all of La Porte.
