        Robert Deane Pharr, an author whose several novels included "The Book of Numbers," died last Wednesday at Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse. He was 75 years old and lived in Watertown, N.Y.
        He died during surgery for an aneurysm, his family said.
        "The Book of Numbers," about black numbers operators in a Southern city in the Depression, was Mr. Pharr's first novel. It was published by Doubleday in 1969 and later made into a movie starring Raymond St. Jacques. His other books include "S.R.O.," about alcoholics and drug addicts living in a Manhattan hotel, and "The Soul Murder Case." He is also represented in several anthologies of black writers.
        Mr. Pharr was born in Richmond and graduated from Virginia Union University there in 1939. He also did graduate work at Fisk, Columbia and New York Universities.
        He is survived by a son, a daughter and a grandson.
