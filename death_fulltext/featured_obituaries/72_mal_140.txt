        Dr. Robert S. Harrington, an astronomer with the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, died Saturday at George Washington University Hospital. He was 50 and lived in McLean, Va.
        The observatory said he had died of cancer.
        Known for his work in the field of positional astronomy, he developed innovative approaches to multiple-star dynamics and worked on precise stellar distances and solar-system dynamics. He also engaged in a search for a "Planet X," a hypothetical body beyond the orbit of Pluto, the ninth and outermost known planet in the Solar System.
        He received the observatory's Simon Newcomb award for his "significant contributions to the study of the dynamics of the Solar System" and had Minor Planet 3216 named after him.
        Dr. Harrington was an honors graduate in physics of Swarthmore College in 1964 and held a Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Texas. He joined the Naval Observatory in 1967 and was named chief of the equatorial division in the Department of Astronomy in 1982.
        Dr. Harrington is survived by his wife, Betty Jean Harrington; two daughters, Amy and Ann; a sister, Jeannette Mynett of Saskatchewan, and his parents, Gene and Virginia Harrington of Richmond.
