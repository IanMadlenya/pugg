        Edmund Mirassou, patriarch of one of the country's largest family-owned wine-making operations, died at his home here on Wednesday. He was 78.
        After his recent heart surgery, doctors discovered that Mr. Mirassou had acute leukemia, which because of his age could not be treated.
        The business that became Mirassou Vineyards, based here in San Jose, was founded in the 1850's by Mr. Mirassou's great-grandfather Pierre Pellier, who had brought grape cuttings from France.
        Mr. Mirassou took over the operation in 1937 and, along with his brother, Norbert, ran it for the next three decades before passing the management to his  sons: Daniel, Peter and James.
        Edmund and Norbert Mirassou worked as a team, Norbert overseeing the mechanical workings of the farm, Edmund taking care of administrative duties. Together they introduced several innovations, including an overhead sprinkling system that made it possible to grow vines in arid Monterey County, where the business now has most of its vineyards.
        Their success, along with that of the Wente Brothers and Paul Masson wineries, helped build the reputation of California's central coast as an important wine-making region.
        Norbert Mirassou died in 1992.
        Edmund Mirassou is survived not only by his sons, all of whom live in San Jose, but also by a daughter, Colleen Mirassou-Wells of Hayward, Calif.; a sister, Mary Bernise Piazza of Boulder Creek, Calif.; 12 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren. His wife of 56 years, Mildred, died in 1995.
