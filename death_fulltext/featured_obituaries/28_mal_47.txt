        Serge Hovey, a composer and musicologist, died Wednesday at his home in the Pacific Palisades area. He was 69 years old.
        Mr. Hovey had suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, according to his wife, Esther.
        He and Jean Redpath, the folk singer and guitarist, were in the process of recording all of the songs by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. They recently completed the sixth volume of the long-term project.
        Mr. Hovey's own compositions included two theatrical scores, ''Tevya and His Daughters'' and ''The World of Sholom Aleichem.''
        In addition to his wife, Mr. Hovey is survived by four sons, six grandchildren and a sister.
