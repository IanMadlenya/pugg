        Harry A. Gotimer 3d, a New York admiralty lawyer and teacher, died in Massachusetts on Saturday. He was 45 and lived in New Hyde Park, L.I.
        He died of a heart attack at a motel along the Cape Cod Canal where he was investigating a marine accident, said Frank Nolan, a friend and former partner in New York.
        Mr. Gotimer, a native of New York City and 1973 law graduate of Georgetown University, was a partner in Kirlin, Campbell & Keating, an admiralty law firm based in New York. He also was an adjunct professor at New York Law School, teaching courses in basic and advanced admiralty law.
        He graduated from the United States Merchant Marine Academy in 1969. At his death, he was a commander in the Naval Reserve.
        He began his legal career with the Maritime Administration in the Commerce Department. At Kirlin, Campbell, he handled maritime claims litigation and maritime environmental-pollution cases. Having been involved in a number of disasters, including the grounding of the Amoco Cadiz, he was most recently the lawyer for the Cunard Line in the grounding of the Queen Elizabeth 2 off Massachusetts this summer.
        Mr. Gotimer is survived by his children, Susan, Kevin and Matthew, all of Lake Hopatcong, N.J.; his mother, Catherine, of New Hyde Park; four brothers, John, of Fresh Meadows, Queens, Donald, of Katonah, N.Y., Michael, of Port Washington, L.I., and Thomas, of Ridgefield, Conn., and a sister, Maureen Gotimer-Strolla of Ridgewood, N.Y.
