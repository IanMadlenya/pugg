        Dr. Roland Reiman De Marco, a former president of Finch College, a women's liberal arts institution in Manhattan that closed in the mid-1970's, died on March 21 in Rochester. He was 92.
        A graduate of Columbia, he also studied at Munich University and Shrivenham American University in England before serving in administrative and counterintelligence posts overseas in World War II.
        He joined Finch, a small college on the Upper East Side, as dean and became administrative head of what was then Finch Junior College in 1949 upon the death of its founder and first president, Jessica Garretson Cosgrave.
        He became president in 1951 and served until 1970, overseeing an ambitious expansion program that turned Finch into a four-year college with its own art museum. The economic slump of the early 1970's forced Finch to close in 1975.
        Dr. De Marco is survived by his wife of 68 years, the former Lydia Hees; two sons, Richard H., of Leonia, N.J., and Ronald H., of Rome, N.Y.; a daughter, Lynn D., of Manhattan; and four grandchildren.
