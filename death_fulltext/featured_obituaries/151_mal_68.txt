        Mario Vespa, a cruise industry executive, died on Aug. 10 at New York Presbyterian Hospital after a lengthy illness, a business associate, Antonio Cosulich, said. He was 93.
        Mr. Vespa, who was born in Savona, Italy, was a captain in the Italian Navy during World War II, but during the war he joined the resistance. He was discovered by Nazi spies and spent a year in a concentration camp.
        After the war, he joined Fratelli Cosulich, an Italian shipping company, which sent him to the United States in 1961 to establish an American office of the Home Lines, a company that operated cruises to the Caribbean and Bermuda.
        In 1981, Mr. Vespa was appointed honorary chairman for life of the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group that he helped found.
        He is survived by a son, Piero; a daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, and a granddaughter, Chiara. They all live in Rome.
