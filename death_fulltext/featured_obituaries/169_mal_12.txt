        Tom Lea, a West Texas artist and writer whose work was called inspirational by President Bush, then governor of Texas, in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in August, died on Monday in El Paso. He was 93.
        In the 1930's, Mr. Lea, a landscape painter, produced murals for public buildings in Dallas and El Paso and for the Benjamin Franklin Post Office in Washington. During World War II he worked as an illustrator  for Life magazine. He illustrated ''The Longhorns,'' a book by J. Frank Dobie, and wrote several books, including ''The Brave Bulls'' and ''The Wonderful Country,'' both of which were made into movies in the 1950's, and ''A Picture Gallery.''
        It was from the last of these that Mr. Bush, who owns some of Mr. Lea's work, quoted at the end of his speech, saying that the artist ''captured the way I feel about our great land.''
        Mr. Lea's work is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.
        He is survived by his wife, Sarah Dighton Lea; a son, James; and a granddaughter.
