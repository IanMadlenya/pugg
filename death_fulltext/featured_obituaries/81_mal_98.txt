        Dr. Theodore Robertson, a pathologist and medical educator at Cornell Medical College for more than 30 years, died on Monday at a nursing home in Stamford, Conn. He was 75 and lived in Locust Valley, L.I., for most of his life.
        He had had a long illness, said his daughter, Victoria Benson.
        Dr. Robertson began his career in medicine as a resident in pathology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he came after serving as a field surgeon in the Pacific theater during World War II.
        From 1950 to 1974, he was chief of pathology at the Community Hospital at Glen Cove, L.I., and at the same time he began working as an associate professor of pathology at Cornell Medical College in New York, a position he held until 1985. Under his direction, a new pathology laboratory was built at Glen Cove. In 1974 Dr. Robertson was made emeritus chief of pathology at the hospital.
        For 10 years, until he retired and moved to Queenstown, Md., in 1985, he was medical director of the Long Island Blood Services of the Greater New York Blood Center.
        He was born in Brooklyn, the son of a doctor, and educated at Cornell University. He received his medical degree from Cornell Medical College.
        He is survived by his wife, Lorraine; a son, Clark D., of Stamford; a daughter, Victoria Benson of Glen Rock, N.J., and five grandchildren.
