        Dr. Lorie Tarshis, an economist who served as a department head at Stanford University and division chairman at the University of Toronto, died on Oct. 4 in a Toronto nursing home. He was 82.
        He died of Parkinson's disease, his family said.
        Dr. Tarshis headed the department of economics at Stanford intermittently from 1950 to 1970. He then joined the faculty of Scarborough College, part of the University of Toronto, and remained there until 1978 as a professor of economics.

        He was born in Toronto and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto and master's and Ph.D. degrees in economics from Trinity College, Cambridge University.
        He came to the United States in 1936 as an instructor at Tufts University near Boston. He worked for the War Production Board in World War II and then became an operations analyst for the Army Air Forces at bomber commands in Libya, Tunisia and Italy.
        He began teaching at Stanford in 1946, rising from assistant to associate to full professor.
