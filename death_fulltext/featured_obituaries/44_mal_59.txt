       Roger (Doc) Cramer, who had 2,705 hits over a 20-year major league baseball career, died Sunday at his home in Manahawkin, N.J. He was 85 years old.
        An outfielder who played from 1929 to 1948, Mr. Cramer had a .296 career batting average. He was a standout defensive player with the Philadelphia Athletics, the Boston Red Sox, the Washington Senators and the Detroit Tigers. In 1940, he led the American League in hits with 200 while playing for the Red Sox.
        Mr. Cramer tied a major league record by going 6 for 6 in a nine-inning game; he is the only American Leaguer to have done it twice. He was selected to five All-Star teams.
