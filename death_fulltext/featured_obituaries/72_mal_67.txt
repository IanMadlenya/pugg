        John Davenport, an Emmy Award-winning television journalist who originated the show "Washington Week in Review" for PBS and served as its moderator in 1966 and 1967, died on Saturday at his home in Houston. He was 62.
        His son, John Gordon Davenport, said Mr. Davenport had had diabetes.
        The elder Davenport worked in the 1960's for WRC, the NBC television station in Washington, and for KABC-TV in Los Angeles, where he covered the trials of Robert F. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, and the mass murderer Charles Manson.
        Mr. Davenport returned to Houston, his hometown, in 1970, to serve as radio news director for KPRC, news director of KHOU-TV, and later media relations director for the University of Texas Health Science Center and for the University of Houston.
        More recently, he returned to public television as a reporter and commentator for KTRK. He wrote and appeared in a show called "J.D.'s Journal," in which he did human-interest stories in Texas. For many years he reviewed books for The Houston Chronicle and lectured at the University of Houston and several other institutions.
        In addition to his son, of San Antonio, he is survived by a daughter, Marilyn Davenport-Moss of Houston; his mother, Mary E. Wademan, also of Houston, and a brother, Gordon, of Friendswood, Tex.
