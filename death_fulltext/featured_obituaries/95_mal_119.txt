        George Coleman, a vice president and executive editor at G. P. Putnam's Sons, died on Saturday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Mr. Coleman, who lived in Manhattan, was 35.
        The cause was progressive multifocal leukoencephylopathy, a rare neurological disorder associated with AIDS, said his companion, Mark T. Lameier.
        In Mr. Coleman's five years with Putnam's, he worked on such best sellers as "Ann-Margret: My Story"; "The Haldeman Diaries," by H. R. Haldeman; "In the Absence of Angels," the autobiography of the AIDS spokeswoman Elizabeth Glaser, and on the works of such popular novelists as Dale Brown, Jack Higgins and Steve Martini.
        Mr. Coleman also acquired biographies of the Lindberghs by A. Scott Berg, of Robert Kennedy by C. David Heymann and of Audrey Hepburn by Barry Paris. He also acquired a book to be written by the rock group Aerosmith.
        Before joining Putnam's, Mr. Coleman worked at Donald I. Fine and at Arbor House. At the latter, he acquired the best-selling "Mayflower Madam," by Sydney Biddle Barrows, and William Novak, "No More Vietnams," by Richard M. Nixon, and works by Anthony Burgess.
        In addition to Mr. Lameier, Mr. Coleman is survived by a brother, Chris Coleman of Jacksonville, Fla.; a sister, Linda Weimer of Tacoma, Wash., and his mother and stepfather, Carrie and Andy Wheatley of Austin, Tex.
