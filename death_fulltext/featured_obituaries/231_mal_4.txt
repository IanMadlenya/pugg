        Stephen Procuniar, a painter, photographer and master printmaker who became a familiar presence in SoHo after arriving there in 1970, died on March 16 in his Mercer Street apartment. He was 60. He died from complications of gallbladder surgery, said his son, David Procuniar.
        At his print shop, Procuniar Workshop, located in his loft, he collaborated with artists like Louise Bourgeois, Lester Johnson, Nancy Spero and Melvin Edwards. His work has appeared in several New York galleries, and his screen prints are in the permanent collection of the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University. Richard Hunt, a Chicago sculptor and print maker whose work appeared alongside Mr. Procuniar's in a 1997 show at the Skoto Gallery in New York, said Mr. Procuniar's paintings and prints were ''informed by Abstract Expressionism.'' He said he created ''visual equivalents to the music he loved,'' jazz.
        Among the trendy restaurants, nightclubs and boutiques that have swept SoHo, Mr. Procuniar, a native of Chicago, was a throwback to the area's untamed past. He was a regular at jazz clubs and saloons, wearing his trademark leather beret and leading his dog, a mix of pit bull and Ridgeback.
        Last year, he spent a month as a visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome, his son said. Shortly after his return to New York, his wife, Carolyn Procuniar, died of liver failure at age 57.
        Besides his son, he is survived by two sisters, Pamela Procuniar Goldberg of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Sharon Mayhew of Bethesda, Md.
