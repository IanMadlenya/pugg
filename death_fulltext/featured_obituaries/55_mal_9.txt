        Thomas J. Swales Jr., a horse breeder who was a former mayor of Edison, N.J., and a former racing commissioner in New Jersey, died on Sunday at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. He was 81 years old and lived in Edison.
        He died of a heart attack, his wife, Mary, said.
        Mr. Swales was Mayor of Edison from 1955 to 1958. He bred thoroughbred horses and raced them under the name of his Tee-N-Jay Farm. In 1974, he relinquished the presidency of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association when Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed him to the State Racing Commission, on which he served until 1980.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by a son, Thomas 3d of Edison, and a sister, Ruth Bernat, also of Edison.
