        Bertram W. Subin, a well-known personal-injury lawyer in Manhattan, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. He was 61 years old.
        Mr. Subin, who lived in Scarsdale, died of lymphoma, his family said.
        The New York Law Journal had rated him as a top lawyer for plaintiffs in personal-injury cases. He won a $1.9 million jury award in 1977 for the widow of a 35-year-old Westchester man who died because of an aortal aneurysm that Mr. Subin argued was caused by an undetected injury in a minor automobile accident five months earlier.
        He also won an $8.7 million award from a Manhattan jury in 1981 for a partly paralyzed driver hurt in a collision with two tow trucks.
        Mr. Subin, born in New York City, graduated from Brooklyn Law School and began a private practice that he later expanded to include a son and his daughter and son-in-law.
        He is survived by his wife, Florence; two sons, Glen, of Pinehurst, N.C., and Herbert, of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth, of New Canaan, Conn., and six grandchildren.
