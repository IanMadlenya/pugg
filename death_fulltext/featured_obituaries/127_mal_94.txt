        Frank A. Bartimo, a retired senior legal official at the Pentagon who helped shape its health care policies, died on Aug. 13 at his home in Spencer, Mass. He was 82 and had lived in Falls Church, Va., until three years ago.
        A native of Leominster, Mass., he graduated from Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and earned a master's and a doctorate in law from George Washington University. He served as a lieutenant in the Navy in World War II.
        For many years, Mr. Bartimo was the Assistant General Counsel for Manpower and Reserve Affairs at the Department of Defense. He also filled in as its general counsel at various times and represented the Defense Department at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He retired from the Government in 1977.
        He was one of the legal architects of the Pentagon's Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Uniformed Services, known as Champus. Designed to benefit military dependents, it became a forerunner and model for Medicare, the national health insurance program for people 65 and over, enacted with the Social Security Amendments of 1965.
        He also helped the so-called Berry Plan, which raised standards for medical care in the Armed Forces. And he played an important role in writing legislation to curb drug abuse in the military.
        He assisted the United Nations Security Council in drafting several resolutions dealing with narcotics that were later adopted by the General Assembly.
        Mr. Bartimo's wife, Kathryn Toomey Bartimo, died in 1995 after 53 years of marriage. He is survived by two brothers, Alexander V., of Morton, Ill., and Vincent J., of Gulfport, Fla., and a sister, Christina C. McRell of Leominster.
