        John A. Puelicher, retired chairman of the board of the Marshall & Ilsley Corporation, a bank holding company, died on Oct. 30 at his home in Milwaukee. He was 78.
        The cause of death was liver cancer, said a company spokesman, M. A. Hatfield.
        Mr. Puelicher, who was known as Jack, led a venerable Milwaukee-based company that was previously headed by his father, Albert S. Puelicher, and grandfather, John H. Puelicher. He was also a prominent benefactor of civic, charitable and educational causes in Milwaukee and elsewhere in Wisconsin.
        During Mr. Puelicher's years as chairman, from 1963 to 1992, M & I, as it is often called, grew rapidly, making 44 acquisitions. In 1963, the bank had $420 million in assets; in 1992, it had $7.15 billion, including M & I Data Services, which provides computer services for banks.
        Today, the company has assets of $23.6 billion in its operations in Wisconsin, Arizona and Illinois. The Puelicher family has run the bank since 1920. Samuel Marshall founded the bank in 1847, and Charles F. Ilsley joined it two years later.
        John Albert Puelicher was born on Nov. 4, 1920, in Milwaukee. He attended Dartmouth College and graduated from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. He worked at the family bank for several years before serving as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War II.
        After the war, Mr. Puelicher rejoined the bank, working as a vice president and executive vice president prior to his election as president in 1958. Upon his father's death in 1963, he became chairman.
        Mr. Puelicher's first wife, Jimmie Ann, died in 1989. He is survived by his wife, Melissa; two daughters, Nancy Phipps of Tallahassee, Fla., and Mary Uihlein of Milwaukee; a sister, Dorothy Ann Van Housen of Milwaukee, and three grandchildren.
