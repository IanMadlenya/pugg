        Peter Shaw, an English professor who crossed academic disciplines to write a biography of John Adams in the 1970's and then became a leader of the neoconservative academic movement, died on Thursday at Roosevelt Hospital. He was 58 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was heart disease, his family said.
        Dr. Shaw taught at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, L.I., from 1965 until 1980, when he retired after suffering a heart attack. He later held teaching posts at several colleges and worked as a freelance writer and critic. At his death, he was chairman of the National Association of Scholars, a group he had helped found in 1982 to oppose what he saw as an oppressive trend toward political correctness on college campuses.
        A native of Brooklyn who graduated from Bard College and received his Ph.D. in English and comparative literature from Columbia, Dr. Shaw did not have to travel far from his chosen field when he wrote "The Character of John Adams," a psychological study of the second President, which was published in 1976. The subject of his doctoral thesis had been an Adams descendant, Henry Adams.
        Dr. Shaw reworked the same Revolution-era field in a 1981 book, "American Patriots and the Rituals of Revolution."
        His later books, "The War Against the Intellect: Episodes in the Decline of Discourse" (1989), and "Recovering American Literature" (Ivan Dee, 1994), reflected his belief that unfettered academic inquiry was being stifled by a new and rigid liberal orthodoxy.
        He is survived by his mother, Margaret Miller; his wife, Penny; two children, Jennifer and Steven, and two grandchildren, all of Manhattan; two brothers, David, of Everett, Wash., and Stuart, of Manhattan; a sister, Denise Schure of Albertson, L.I.; a half-brother, also Stuart, of Key West, Fla., and a half-sister, Elizabeth Franz of Manhattan.
