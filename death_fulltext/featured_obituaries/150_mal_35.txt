        Shafik al-Wazzan, Prime Minister of Lebanon during the tumultuous 1980's, died yesterday at his home in Beirut. He was 74.
        The cause was a heart attack, the Beirut radio reported.
        Mr. Wazzan was a lawyer, a moderate Sunni Muslim and a former Minister of Justice when he became a compromise choice as Prime Minister in 1980, while the country was racked by a civil war that had begun in 1975 between Muslims, Christians and Palestinians.
        He was plagued, as Prime Minister, by Lebanon's strife-embittered politics, but he managed to form two cabinets before being forced to step down in 1984.
        During those years, the civil war continued, and in 1982 his country was shaken further by an Israeli invasion and by the massacre of almost 900 civilians in two Palestinian refugee camps by Christian Phalangist forces.
        In 1983, as Thomas L. Friedman, now a columnist for The New York Times, wrote in his book ''From Beirut to Jerusalem'' (Farrar Straus Giroux, 1989), the United States brokered a peace treaty between the Lebanese Government, led by President Amin Gemayel, and Israel, which was ''a lopsided -- if impracticable -- agreement favoring Israel that deepened Lebanese Muslim resentment.''
        Mr. Wazzan warned that the resentment was rising, and in May 1983, when the pact was agreed upon, he is said to have told Secretary of State George P. Shultz: ''This is not an honorable agreement. I don't believe America has done its best'' in curbing Israel's demands.
        The accord was not put into effect. In October 1983 a truck filled with explosives killed 241 American  servicemen in their barracks in Beirut. Mr. Friedman wrote that Washington's ''not curtailing Israel's demands for a peace treaty with  Beirut'' had helped fuel the violence.
        Mr. Wazzan was born in Beirut and received his law degree from St. Joseph's University there.
        He is survived by his wife, Wajiha; a son, Wassim, and a daughter, Sawsan.
