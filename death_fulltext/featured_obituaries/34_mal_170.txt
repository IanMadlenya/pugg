        Mr. Diop won the French African Grand Prix in literature in 1964. By then his published works - written in French - included ''Contes d'Ahmadou Koumba'' (''Tales of Ahmadou Koumba,'' 1947), ''Les Nouveaux Contes d'Ahmadou Koumba'' (1958); a poetic work, ''Leurres et Lueurs'' (''Decoys and Lights''), and a children's book, ''Maman-Caiman'' (''Mother Crocodile'').
        He wrote ''Leuk the Hare'' with Leopold Sedar Senghor, who was President of Senegal from 1960 to 1981. In the 1930's the two men helped form the Negritude movement, which rejected assimilation in favor of African cultural values.
        Mr. Diop served as a veterinary surgeon in the Sudan, Ivory Coast and Mauritania, and was Senegal's ambassador to Tunisia from 1961 to 1965.
