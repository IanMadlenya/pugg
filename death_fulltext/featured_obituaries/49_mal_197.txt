        John Jerome (Pat) Rooney, coach of the women's tennis team at Fordham University since its inception as a varsity in 1973, was found dead yesterday, apparently from natural causes, at his home in the Bronx. He was 86 years old.
        Mr. Rooney, who served as a lieutenant commander in the Navy during World War II, became the boys' tennis coach at Fordham Prep and in 1973 the women's tennis coach at Fordham University. He held both posts until his death. He was also the supervisor of ballboys and ballgirls since the early 1950's at national championship tournaments of the United States Lawn Tennis Association and the United States Open.
        In 1986, Mr. Rooney was honored as the Eastern Tennis Association coach of the year for long service to the game. He was inducted into the association's Hall of Fame in 1989, and last month he was elected to the Fordham Hall of Fame.
