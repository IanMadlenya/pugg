        Curt Muser, a board member of the Museum of the American Indian and the Museum of the Hudson Highlands, died on Saturday at his home in New York City. He was 83 years old and also had a home in Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        He died of prostate cancer, said his wife, Frani Blough Muser.
        Mr. Muser worked for the U.S. Rubber Company, later named Uniroyal Inc., until his retirement in 1966. At that time, he returned to a longtime interest, mesoamerican art and archeology, and in 1970 helped organize the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition "Before Cortes: Sculpture of Middle America."
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by two daughters, Cynthia Krupat of New York City and Ann Gebel of Cambridge, Mass., and a son, George, of Cornwall-on-Hudson.
