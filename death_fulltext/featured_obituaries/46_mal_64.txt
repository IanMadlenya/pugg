        Sol Chalek, a former chairman of Associated Food Stores, a buying cooperative of grocery owners, died on Tuesday in Hollywood Memorial Hospital in Florida. He was 93 years old and had lived in Rego Park, Queens, and Danbury, Conn., before retiring to Florida in 1971.
        He died of heart failure, his family said.
        Mr. Chalek was born in Proskurov, in the Ukraine, and came to the United States at 5 years old with his family, which ran a grocery store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
        He worked in the family store when he finished grammar school and held a variety of jobs before becoming a salesman in the garment district. In 1929 he opened his own grocery in Astoria, Queens, and four years later started a cooperative among small grocers to help them compete against the large chains.
        He began Associated in 1942 with 18 individually owned stores, and by the mid-1950's the buying group had grown to more than 250 groceries in the New York metropolitan area.
        Mr. Chalek is survived by two sons, Alvern, of Boca Raton, Fla., and Morton, of New Rochelle, N.Y.; two sisters, Fanny Blafer of Sunrise, Fla., and Bessie Gulfman of North Miami Beach, Fla.; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.
