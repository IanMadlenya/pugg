        Dr. Arthur Hecht, an internist and endocrinologist, died on Wednesday at the Beth Israel Medical Center. He was 67 and lived in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan.
        The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said his wife, Dr. Pauline G. Hecht, who is a general surgeon.
        At the time of his death, Dr. Hecht was on the medical staffs of the Beth Israel Medical Center and of the Cabrini Medical Center and was an instructor in the department of medicine at the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. Earlier he was on the faculty of the New York University School of Medicine.
        Over the years he wrote scores of articles for medical journals on diabetes, endocrinologic and intestinal disorders, diseases of the joints associated with lung disorders, and other topics.
        He was born in Vienna, escaped Nazi rule there, came to New York in 1939 and lived briefly with relatives until his parents were able to join him in 1940. His father, who was active in Jewish affairs in Vienna, had been imprisoned there.
        Arthur Hecht grew up in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn, graduated from Stuyvesant High School and served in the Army in World War II. He received a B.A. from the University of Michigan in 1950 and a medical degree from New York University in 1954.
        After an internship at Lenox Hill Hospital and medical residency at Kings County Hospital, he completed a fellowship in endocrinology at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. He was a member of the American Diabetes Association and the Endocrinology Society.
        Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Stuart A. of Manhattan, and two daughters, Michelle R. and Dr. Amy C., both of San Francisco.
