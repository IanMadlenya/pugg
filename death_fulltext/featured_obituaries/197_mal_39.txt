        Donald Arthur MacDonald, a vice chairman emeritus of Dow Jones & Company, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, Barron's and other financial publications, died last Friday at a hospital in Red Bank, N.J. He was 83 and lived in Rumson, N.J..
        The cause was lung cancer, the company said.
        Mr. MacDonald, who moved up from salesman and sales director of The Wall Street Journal, was credited with expanding the overseas reach of Dow Jones. He was president and publisher of its international and magazine groups, overseeing publications that included The Asian Wall Street Journal, The Wall Street Journal Europe and Barron's.
        A native of Union City, N.J., he served as an Army officer in Europe in World War II before graduating cum laude from New York University in 1948. He received an M.B.A. from its business school two years later.
        He started at Dow Jones as an advertising sales representative in New York in 1953 and rose through advertising management and executive positions until he became a director in 1977 and vice chairman in 1979. He was the founding chairman of the American Advertising Federation and in 1985 was elected to the Advertising Hall of Fame.
        He led The Journal's expansion in Asia in 1976 and Europe in 1983. He retired as vice chairman of Dow Jones in 1986 and from the board in 1987.
        Mr. MacDonald is survived by his wife of 60 years, Ruth Moran MacDonald; three sons, Ronald A., of New York City and Monmouth Beach, N.J.; Dr. Donald A., of Rumson, and Charles A., of Princeton, N.J.; two daughters, Dr. Martha Re, of New Orleans, and Kelley Marie Martell, of San Francisco; and 12 grandchildren.
