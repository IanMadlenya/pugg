        Frank P. Schuld 2d of Glen Head, L.I., a leading bridge player and club proprietor, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, L.I. He was 66 years old.
        The cause of death was a heart attack, said his wife, Diana.
        Mr. Schuld was best known as the owner and manager of the Vanderbilt Bridge Club, which he acquired in 1975 and built into one of the largest in the country. It began in Great Neck, L.I., moved a year later to Manhasset, L.I., and moved again last year to Lake Success, L.I.
        In 1967, Mr. Schuld, playing with his wife, placed second in the National Life Master Pairs, one of the country's premier events. They won many regional titles together, including two at national championships. He was a popular lecturer on the game and the author of a book, "The Simple Squeeze at Bridge" (Drake, 1974).
        He was educated at the Maritime Colege at Fort Schuyler and at Rutgers University. For 17 years he was the sales manager in an auto dealership.
        In addition to his wife, he is survived by five children -- Aimee, of Middletown, Pa.; Frank P. 3d, of Glen Cove, L.I.; Terry, of Sound Beach, L.I.; Marianne, of Gayville, S.D., and Glenn, of Manhattan -- and three grandchildren.
