        Mahler Ryder, a professor of illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design, died on Thursday at Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence. He was 54 years old.
        He died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the school said.
        Mr. Ryder, a faculty member at the School of Design since 1969, was also a painter, sculptor and jazz pianist. A self-taught musician, he organized an exhibition of jazz-related art for an international tour last year under the auspices of the United States Information Agency. He also did a series of paintings based on jazz themes.
        He was born in Columbus, Ohio. He attended the Columbus College of Art and Design and Ohio State University, and studied at the Art Students League and the School of Visual Arts in New York City.
        He was a founder of the Studio Museum in Harlem and served as the museum's executive secretary in 1966-67. His work was exhibited in a one-man show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City in 1973 and in other shows in the United States, Canada and Europe.
        Mr. Ryder's companion was Susan Bellaire.
        He is survived by a daughter, Ulli Ryder of Cumberland, R.I.; his mother, Virginia Ryder, and a sister, Patricia Stull, both of Columbus.
