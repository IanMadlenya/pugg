        Israel Galeano, a former leader of the Nicaraguan contras who was known as Comandante Franklin, died Monday in a car crash in the northern city of Matagalpa, the Interior Ministry said. He was 38 years old.
        Mr. Galeano's wife, Sandra Mendoza, and the vehicle's driver, Ricardo Ordonez, were being treated at a hospital in Matagalpa, which is situated 65 miles north of Managua, the ministry said.
        For a while, Mr. Galeano served as chief of staff for the rebels, who battled the leftist Sandinista Government through most of the 1980's with aid from the United States. He succeeded Col. Enrique Bermudez, who was ousted from the post early in 1990. Colonel Bermudez was shot to death in a hotel parking lot here in February 1991.
        The war between the Marxist Sandinistas and the contras ended with the election victory in 1990 of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro over President Daniel Ortega Saavedra.
        Mr. Galeano, after demobilizing his forces, was named to a post on the new Government's Agrarian Commission, but he resigned in January, complaining of official corruption.
