        Harry A. Scarr, a sociologist who served as the deputy director of the Bureau of the Census in Washington for the past three years, died on Nov. 12 at his home in Leesburg, Va. He was 61.
        The cause was pancreatic cancer, the bureau said.
        Dr. Scarr held a number of high positions in the Departments of Justice and  Commerce before he took the census position in 1992. In 1993 and part of 1994, he was the acting director of the Census Bureau, a branch of the United States Department of Commerce.
        In perhaps his most notable contribution to the Census Bureau, he led a broad-based evaluation of the 1990 census and reorganized the bureau for the 2000 census, said the agency's current director, Martha Farnsworth Riche.
        A native of Massillon, Ohio, Dr. Scarr graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and earned a doctorate in sociology at Harvard University in 1963. He published numerous articles in the fields of criminology, sociology, social values and social psychology.
        Before joining the Justice Department in 1973, he taught sociology at the Wharton School and worked as a research scientist for Human Sciences Research Inc. in McLean, Va. His positions at the Justice Department included Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. At the Commerce Department he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Statistical Affairs before being appointed to his current post at the Census Bureau.
        Dr. Scarr is survived by his wife, Cecilia von Schantz Scarr, and their two daughters, Rachel and Sarah, all of Leesburg. Also surviving are a son from a previous marriage, Phillip, of Charlottesville, Va., and two other daughters, Karen Scarr of San Francisco and Rebecca Scarr of Charlottesville.
