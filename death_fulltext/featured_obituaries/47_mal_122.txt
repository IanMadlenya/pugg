        John M. Exton, a developer of industrial processes in the decorative arts, furnishings and textiles, died on Friday at Cabrini Medical Center. He was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan, Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and St. Thomas, V.I.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Exton was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Brown. He developed processes for glass carving and etching, making furniture from corrugated cardboard and producing synthetic fabrics. Before becoming an independent entrepreneur in 1960 he held executive posts in the textile industry.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Edith Chilewich; a stepdaughter, Claudia Grose of Manhattan; a stepson, Brooks Kerr of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.
