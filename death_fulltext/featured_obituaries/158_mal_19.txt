        Edmond Kaiser, founder of Terre des Hommes and other children's organizations, died on Saturday on a visit to India, a spokesman for one of the charities said. He was 86.
        Mr. Kaiser organized Terre des Hommes in 1959, after having learned of the condition of children in Algeria. It is now one of Switzerland's best-known charities, with worldwide operations to aid suffering from poverty, illness and war.
        Born to a Jewish family in Paris, Mr. Kaiser lived in Switzerland in his childhood. He returned to France to work with the French resistance in  World War II and had been condemned to death by the Nazis.
        In 1947, Mr. returned to Lausanne, Switzerland, and later started his charitable work there. Describing his work in a newspaper interview in 1994, Mr. Kaiser said, ''If someone is crying on the ground, we try to pick them up, just like we would care for an injured bird, love it and then help it fly again.''
        In 1990, France offered Mr. Kaiser the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. He turned it down. ''Sitting in the middle of dead or suffering Biafran children, out with the children of Vietnam whose skin has been peeled away by napalm, it would be as if I found it normal to be honored for their martyrdom,'' he wrote in a letter to the French government.
        He left Terre des Hommes in 1979 to work with Sentinelles, a charity devoted to combating the prostitution, mutilation and slavery of children in developing countries. He founded another group, Families Without Borders, in 1992.
