        Carl H. Horowitz, a retired manufacturer of children's wear, died on Saturday evening at Pompano Beach Medical Center in Pompano Beach, Fla. He was 58.
        The cause was cancer, said Dominick Sicolo, his companion and business partner.
        Mr. Horowitz was the owner and chief operating officer of Cardinal Knitting Mills in Manhattan, which manufactured children's knitwear, before the company was dissolved in 1990.
        He was born in Brooklyn and graduated from New York University's School of Business. He had homes in Manhattan, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and East Hampton, L.I.
        He is survived by Mr. Sicolo.
