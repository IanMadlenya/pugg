        William Barnett Owen, director of the Perls Gallery on Madison Avenue for the last 25 years, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center of New York in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was complications following open-heart surgery, a spokeswoman for the family said.
        Mr. Owen, a native of Louisville, Ky., graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1944 and served as an Army officer in the Pacific. He worked as a stage manager and theatrical producer before joining Perls, which deals in the generation of artists surrounding Picasso, from 1910 to 1960, and the work of Alexander Calder.
        Mr. Owen is survived by two sisters, Emily Newman and Kitty Harrison, both of Louisville, and five nephews and nieces.
