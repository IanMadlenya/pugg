        Robert Phillips, a pianist and composer, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital. He was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.
        He died of complications from AIDS, said his sister, Mary Lou Phillips of New Haven.
        Mr. Phillips was a partner in the piano duo Phillips and Renzulli, which was formed in 1964 and performed and recorded throughout the United States. In a review for The New York Times, Donal Henahan called the pianists "a pair of superior performers and tasteful musicians."
        Franco Renzulli died last April.
        Mr. Phillips, who was born in Tacoma, Wash., studied piano and composition at the University of Washington and at the Manhattan School of Music. He composed works for solo and dual piano and for chamber and choral groups.
        He was also the organist and choir director of St. Charles Borromeo Roman Catholic Church in Brooklyn Heights, and taught piano privately.
        In addition to his sister, Mr. Phillips is survived by a brother, Harry L. Phillips Jr. of Kirkland, Wash.
