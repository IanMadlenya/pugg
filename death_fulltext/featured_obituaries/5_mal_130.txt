        Althea Flynt, co-publisher of Hustler magazine and the wife of the magazine's founder, Larry Flynt, was found dead in a bathtub at the couple's mansion Saturday evening. The cause of her death was under investigation, coroner's officials said today.
        Mrs. Flynt was 33 years old, coroner's officials said.
        An autopsy was scheduled for Monday, Bill Gold, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner, said.
        ''We're going to have to investigate,'' said Juan Jimenez, a coroner's supervisor. ''We'll have to await the pathologist's report.''
        Alan Isaacman, a lawyer for the Flynts, said he understood that ''it was an accidental death that occurred while she was in the bathtub.''
        ''She's been ill for quite a long time,'' he added, but declined to elaborate.
        The former Althea Leasure was married for 11 years to Mr. Flynt. He was at the home when his wife died, a coroner's official said.
        Ten years ago, after a would-be assassin's bullets left him paralyzed and impotent, Mr. Flynt began using Dilaudid, a morphine-like painkiller. His wife joined him and together they became addicted.
