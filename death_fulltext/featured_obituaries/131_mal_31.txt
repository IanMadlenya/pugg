        Leon Poliakov, a historian of anti-Semitism who testified at major war crimes trials, died Monday in France, where he lived, leaders of Jewish groups said. He was 87.
        Mr. Poliakov wrote the five-volume ''History of Anti-Semitism,'' as well as ''20th Century Totalitarianism,'' ''Jewish Bankers and the Holy See'' and ''From the Mongolian Yoke to Lenin.'' Together with Joseph Wulf, he also wrote ''The Third Reich and the Jews,'' a book of official German records documenting Nazi crimes against Jews.
        In 1987 in Paris, Mr. Poliakov appeared as a witness against Klaus Barbie, the former Gestapo chief in Lyons, France, testifying that the killing of Jews was the cornerstone of Hitler's plot to conquer the world, was described as such by the SS leader Heinrich Himmler in 1943 and was known to Nazi officers like Barbie. He also testified in the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders after World War II.
        Books by Mr. Poliakov were on the prison reading list of Adolf Eichmann as he awaited trial in Jerusalem in 1961 for arranging the transport of millions of Jews to Nazi death camps. In 1966 Mr. Poliakov was also appointed to a panel of psychologists, sociologists and historians to study the causes of genocide.
        Mr. Poliakov was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, and fled with his family to Paris shortly after the Bolshevik revolution of 1917. Later he studied law in Paris and served in France's national research institute.
