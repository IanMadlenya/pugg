        Carey Erickson, a dancer and choreographer, died on Thursday at the Chris Brownless Annex, a hospice in Los Angeles. He was 40 years old.
        He died of AIDS, his brother, Richard, said.
        Mr. Erickson, who was born in Richmond, Ind., received a master's degree in dance from the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles. In New York he trained with Beverly Blossom at the Nikolais-Louis Dance Theater Lab, and with Hanya Holm, Viola Farber and Maggie Black. Mr. Erickson performed with and created dances for a number of New York-based dance companies. In 1983 he broke his neck in a diving accident and was paralyzed for a time, but created dances for wheelchair-bound performers for the Manhattan Performance Ensemble's "Spinal Series."
        In addition to his brother, Mr. Erickson is survived by his father, Vedick, and his sisters Lynn St. John, Loren Ballard and Leslie Johnson, all of the Chicago area.
