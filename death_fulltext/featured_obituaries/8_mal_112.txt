        Sven Andersson, a former Swedish Defense Minister and Foreign Minister who was a dominant force in politics after World War II, died today. He was 77. Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson announced Mr. Andersson's death at the congress of the Social Democratic Party, and said Mr. Andersson had been ill since last winter. The cause of death was not given.
        Mr. Andersson, a onetime construction worker, served in various Cabinet posts for 28 consecutive years before his Social Democratic Party was ousted in an election in 1976. He became secretary of the party in 1945.
        He was Defense Minister for 16 years until 1973, and served as Foreign Minister for three more years. Before that he had been a Minister Without Portfolio and Minister of Communication.
        In his last Government position, he headed a commission that investigated the violation of Swedish territorial waters by foreign submarines. The commission concluded that the vessels were Russian. The Government's consequent diplomatic protest led to a chill in Soviet-Swedish relations.
