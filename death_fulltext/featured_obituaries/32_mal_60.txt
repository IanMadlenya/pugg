        Sir Christopher Chancellor, who spent 29 years with Reuters and was general manager of the news agency from 1944 to 1959, died at Wincanton in southwest England on Saturday, Reuters reported. He was 85 years old.
        The agency said he had been hospitalized but it did not give the cause of death.
        The Daily Telegraph today called Sir Christopher the greatest single influence on the development of Reuters after World War II.
        ''It was largely thanks to Chancellor that Reuters had survived the war intact, despite the loss for several years of the greatest part of its world market,'' The Telegraph said.
        Sir Christopher, born March 29, 1904, was the son of Sir John Chancellor, a colonial administrator, and was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He joined Reuters in 1930 and 18 months later was sent to the Far East as general manager and chief correspondent.
        Based in Shanghai from 1931 to 1939, he kept the agency's China service operating after the Japanese invasion in 1932.
        In London during World War II he worked with William Moloney and William Haley in reorganizing Reuters' news and business operations. He took sole charge after Mr. Haley left to run the British Broadasting Corporation in 1943 and Mr. Moloney retired in 1944.
        ''Chancellor gave Reuters a position as a world news agency which Britain's diminished role after the end of the Second World War did not make it easy to sustain,'' The Times of London said in an obituary today.
        Sir Christopher, who was knighted in 1951, left Reuters for the Odhams publishing group and was chairman of the now defunct Daily Herald.
        From 1962 until his retirement in 1969 he was chairman of the Bowater Paper Corporation and its associated companies.
        Survivors include his wife, two sons and two daughters. Funeral arrangements have not been announced.
