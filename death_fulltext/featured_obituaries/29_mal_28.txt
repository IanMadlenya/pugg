        Dik Browne, the cartoonist whose ''Hagar the Horrible'' strip about a bumbling Viking chieftain is published by more than 1,800 newspapers in 58 countries, including 100 papers in Scandinavia, died of cancer yesterday in Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla., where he lived. He was 71 years old.
        Mr. Browne was showered with awards for ''Hagar'' and also for the comic strip ''Hi and Lois,'' on which he collaborated with Mort Walker. ''Hi and Lois'' is distributed by the King Features Syndicate to more than 1,100 newspapers around the world.
        Richard Arthur Allan Browne, a native of Manhattan, became an aspiring reporter for The New York Journal at the age of 16. But its city editor assailed his writing and pushed him into the art department, where he quickly found his niche.
        In World War II, he was assigned to draw maps and charts for an Army engineering unit, eventually rising to staff sergeant. In his spare time, he created ''Ginny Jeep,'' a comic featuring a WAC, which appeared in Army and Air Force newspapers.
        After the war, he specialized for several years in advertising illustration, creating the Bird's Eye bird and Chiquita Banana and revitalizing the Campbell Soup kids.
        Mr. Browne's wife, Joan, died in 1986. Surviving are two sons, Robert and Christopher, who collaborated with him on ''Hagar'' and will continue the comic strip, and a daughter, Sally. The children, together with four grandchildren and a step-granddaugher, live in Sarasota.
