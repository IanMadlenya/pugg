        Seymour Krim, an author and critic, was found dead, apparently of a drug overdose, in his Manhattan apartment Wednesday night, the police said. He was 67 years old.
        Mr. Krim was found in a chair in his apartment at 120 East 10th Street. A bottle of pills and notes explaining his suicide were found nearby, said Officer Edward Fenney, a police spokesman.
        His body was discovered by his nephew, Donald Krim, and his lawyer, Bruce Ricker, at 6:30 P.M. Mr. Ricker said Mr. Krim had been suffering from heart disease for some time. The police said the exact cause of death would be determined by the Medical Examiner's office at a later date.
        Born in New York, Mr. Krim graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School and attended the University of North Carolina.
        Mr. Krim edited ''Manhattan: Stories of a Great City'' (1954) and ''The Beats'' (1960), an anthology of the Beat Generation. He wrote an introduction to Jack Kerouac's ''Desolation Angels,'' a novel published in 1965.
        He also published three collections of essays, ''Views of a Nearsighted Cannoneer'' (1961), ''Shake It for the World, Smartass'' (1970) and ''You & Me'' (1974).
        Mr. Krim, a reporter for The New York Tribune from 1965 to 1966, contributed reviews and articles to many magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times Book Review. He won a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in 1976 and a Fulbright grant for 1985-86 for travel to Israel, where he taught creative writing at the University of Haifa.
        He is survived by a sister, Blanche Levie of Newport, R.I., and a brother, Norman, of Boston.
