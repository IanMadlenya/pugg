        Walter Perkins, a jazz drummer who played with major artists including Ahmad Jamal and Carmen McRae, and was part of a band in the early 1960's called the MJT +3, died on Feb. 14. He was 72.
        The cause was lung cancer, said his wife, Barbara Perkins.
        A busy sideman with a strong and light sense of swing, he left Chicago, his hometown, for New York in 1965. He is probably best known for a hard-bop record on which he was one of the leaders, ''Walter Perkins' MJT +III,'' released on the Vee-Jay label in 1959. The group's name stood for Modern Jazz Two; Mr. Perkins and the bassist Bob Cranshaw were the two, and the three others were the trumpeter Willie Thomas, the alto saxophonist Frank Strozier and the pianist Harold Mabern.
        After moving to New York, Mr. Perkins played and recorded with Gene Ammons, Charles Mingus, Sonny Rollins and George Shearing, among many others. In 2002 he made a comeback on a William Parker record, ''Bob's Pink Cadillac'' (Eremite).
        From the 1970's to the late 1980's he taught drum-corps classes at Girls and Boys High School in Brooklyn. He later conducted classes and workshops in many New York City public schools, performing for young people through the arts-education group Young Audiences New York. In recent years he often played in Queens, where he lived, at clubs like Carmichael's, Brandy's and the Skylark Lounge, and he started his own drum corps at the Merrick Park Baptist Church in Jamaica.
        In addition to his wife he is survived by his daughters Rochelle Mask of Baldwin, N.Y.; Denise Perkins of Brooklyn; and Marilyn Turns of Queens; 13 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
