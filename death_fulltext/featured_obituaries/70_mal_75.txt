        Robert S. Lagattolla, a New York insurance executive specializing in marine-insurance issues, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 61 years old and lived in Staten Island.
        He died of a heart attack while attending the annual dinner of the Maritime Law Association at the Marriott Marquis, said Marilyn Lytle. She is general counsel for the Water Quality Insurance Syndicate, of which Mr. Lagattolla was president.
        The syndicate is a group of companies that provide pollution-liability insurance for vessels. It was formed in the early 1970's.
        Mr. Lagattolla, a native of New York City, was a frequent expert witness before Congressional committees concerning pollution liability.
        He is survived by his wife, Frances; four daughters, Dena, Donna, Carla and Deborah; a son, Joseph, and nine grandchildren.
