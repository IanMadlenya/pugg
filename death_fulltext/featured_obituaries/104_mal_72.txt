        Solomon Litt, who was active in Jewish philanthropic causes in New York, died on Monday in Vassar Brothers Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. He was 92.
        Mr. Litt was a retired senior partner of the Asiel & Company brokerage, where he worked for more than 70 years.
        He served as president of the Jewish Welfare Board and the Jewish Board of Guardians and as vice president of the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. He was also chairman of the United Jewish Appeal of New York.
        In addition, Mr. Litt was a former governor of both the New York and American stock exchanges.
        In 1967, he was chairman of a special committee that the New York Stock Exchange's board of governors formed to deal with a crush of paperwork that was threatening the operations of the exchange. The committee recommended curtailing trading hours until the backlog could be eliminated and more efficient order-processing methods put in place.
        Mr. Litt is survived by his wife, the former Mary Schweitzer; a son, Mark D., of Larchmont, N.Y.; a daughter, Susan L. McLeod of Toronto, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
