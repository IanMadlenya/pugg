        Dwain Tedford, a booker for jazz clubs, died on Sunday in Lubbock, Tex. He was 54 years old.
        Mr. Tedford died of a brain tumor, his business partner, John Condon, said.
        Mr. Tedford grew up in Texas, where his interest in jazz was awakened by hearing radio broadcasts from Chicago as a boy. He moved to New York in 1957.
        In the early 1960's he began booking various clubs, starting with the Cafe au Go Go, where he hired Muddy Waters, the Blues Project and others. He then moved on to Joyous Lake, a club in Woodstock, N.Y., that featured some of the more adventurous jazz musicians of the time. Mr. Tedford helped open Sweet Basil, and was involved with Lush Life, Fat Tuesday's and other clubs in Manhattan. Through the years he booked a wide variety of jazz musicians, from Ahmad Jamal to David Murray, Arthur Blythe and others. He also put together some of New York's more distinctive groups. Helped Open Condon's
        Most recently, Mr. Tedford's booked musicians into Condon's, an important Manhattan club that he helped open in 1989. Condon's, on East 15th Street near Union Square, has featured Lou Donaldson, David Murray, Cecil Taylor, Tommy Flanagan and Ray Bryant, among others. It was Mr. Tedford who brought Clifford Jordan's big band to Condon's, where it quickly went on to become one of the city's premier jazz orchestras. And he reorganized a group that he put together earlier in his career, featuring Harry (Sweets) Edison on trumpet, Mr. Jordon on saxophone, Walter Davis on piano, George Mraz on bass and Connie Kay on drums.
        Mr. Tedford is survived by his wife, Marie, of Manhattan; a daughter, Susannah McGivney of Manhattan; his mother, Nell Tedford of Lubbock, and two sisters: Caroline Dehn of Amarillo, Tex., and Jan Johnson of San Antonio.
