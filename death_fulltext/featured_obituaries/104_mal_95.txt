        James Grottola, the president of New York Typographical Union No. 6, died on Tuesday at his home in Commack, L.I. He was 57.
        The cause of death was apparently a heart attack, his family said.
        Mr. Grottola became union president in 1990, succeeding Bertram A. Powers, who had led the typographers since the early 1960's. In Mr. Powers's heyday as head of Local 6 of the old International Typographical Union, before computers made the hot-metal printing of linotype machines obsolete, several thousand union members worked at newspapers in New York City.
        Now, the old I.T.U. is part of the Communications Workers of America. Its New York local -- long known as Big Six -- is also Local 14156 of the C.W.A., and has 500 working members at the three major New York dailies and commercial printing plants, its officials said.
        Arthur DeIanni, the local vice president, becomes president until an election can be held this fall, officials of the local said.
        Mr. Grottola was born in Brooklyn. He gained his union card just after becoming a linotype operator at The New York Post in 1957. He was the local's benefit clerk and vice president before becoming president.
        He is survived by his wife, Sonia; four sons, Joseph, of East Northport, L.I.; Vincent, of Port Jefferson, L.I., and Michael and James, both of Ronkonkoma, L.I.; a stepson, Paul Palacio of Commack; a stepdaughter, Sabrina, of East Northport, and three grandchildren.
