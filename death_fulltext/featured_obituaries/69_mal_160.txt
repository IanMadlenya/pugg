        Charles J. Cole, the founder of a shoe manufacturing company on Long Island, died yesterday at his home in Manhasset, L.I. He was 69 years old.
        He died of cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Cole went into the footwear business in 1962. His company, El Greco, of Port Washington, L.I., made shoes for women that were sold under the name Candie's, among others. He sold the company in 1987, and a son, Neil, bought it back last year.
        His son Kenneth, the shoe designer and retailer, is married to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's daughter Maria.
        Besides his sons Neil and Kenneth, Mr. Cole's survivors include his wife, the former Gladys Douglas; another son, Evan; a daughter, Abbie Cole, and seven grandchildren.
