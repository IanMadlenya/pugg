        Dr. John Nevil Insall, a pioneer of knee replacement surgery whose prostheses helped restore mobility to thousands of people, died Dec. 30 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 70 and lived on the Upper East Side and in Westport, Conn.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Dr. W. Norman Scott, an associate.
        Dr. Insall was a founder and co-director of the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine, established in 1991 at Beth Israel. From 1965 until the institute's founding, he directed the knee clinic at the Hospital for Special Surgery.
        Dr. Insall, an orthopedic surgeon, was the principal designer of four models of widely used knee replacements. The first one, known as the Total Condor, was introduced in 1974, and the last one, NexGen Legacy, in 1995.
        Knee replacement was almost unheard of in the 1960's, but now nearly 300,000 people worldwide undergo the operation each year, about half of them in the United States. Dr. Insall's designs are implanted in about a fifth of all cases, Dr. Scott said.
        Dr. Insall wrote and edited about 150 articles, 41 book chapters and 5 textbooks. The third edition of his standard reference, Surgery of the Knee, jointly edited with Dr. Scott, was published last year.
        John Insall was born in Bournemouth, England, graduated from Cambridge University in 1953 and received his M.D. at the London Hospital Medical School three years later. He worked as a physician and orthopedic surgeon in England and Canada before he joined the staff of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.
        He was a founding member and past president of the Knee Society, a professional association of surgeons.
        Dr. Insall is survived by his wife, Mary V. Insall; a son and daughter from a previous marriage, John, of Killingworth, Conn., and Amanda Insall of Manhattan; and one grandson. His earlier marriage, to Susan M. Insall of Manhattan, ended in divorce.
