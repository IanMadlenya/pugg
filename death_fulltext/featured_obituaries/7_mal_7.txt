        Judge Edward D. Cowart of Dade County Circuit Court, whose regretful postsentencing remarks to the serial slayer Theodore R. Bundy were widely noted, died of a heart attack at Coral Reef Hospital early today. He was 62 years old and lived in South Miami.
        Judge Cowart, who combined homespun wit, biblical quotations and carefully measured jurisprudence to become one of the most respected members of the Florida bench, presided in 1979 over the first murder trial of Mr. Bundy, a law school dropout linked to the slaying of dozens of women.
        After monthlong proceedings, Mr. Bundy was found guilty of murdering two female students at Florida State University. Judge Cowart sentenced him to death for ''vile and heinous'' crimes, then told him quietly: ''You'd have made a good lawyer. I'd have loved to have you practice in front of me. But you went the wrong way, partner.''
        Mr. Bundy is now on death row in Starke, Fla., appealing that conviction and one involving the slaying of a 12-year-old girl.
