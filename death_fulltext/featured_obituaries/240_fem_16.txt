        Lisa E. Goldberg, president of the Charles H. Revson Foundation, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 54.
        The cause was a brain aneurysm, said a spokesman for New York University, of which her husband, John Sexton, is president.
        In 1982, Ms. Goldberg started as a program officer at the foundation, which has an endowment of $180 million and makes grants in fields including urban affairs and education. Under her leadership, the foundation financed two Public Broadcasting System series, ''Genesis: A Living Conversation,'' with Bill Moyers, and ''Eyes on the Prize.''
        Lisa Ellen Goldberg was born in Brookline, Mass., on May 1, 1952, and graduated from Radcliffe and Harvard Law School. Past jobs included being a senior staff member and legal counsel of the President's Commission for a National Agenda for the '80s in the Carter administration.
        In addition to her husband, Ms. Goldberg is survived by their daughter, Katherine Lodgen Sexton, and their son, Jed Sexton, both of Manhattan; three granddaughters; her sister, Donna Eskind of Nashville; and her brother, Philip S. Goldberg, the United States ambassador to Bolivia.
