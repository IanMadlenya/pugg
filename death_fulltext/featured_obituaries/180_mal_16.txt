        Dr. Roger L. Shapiro, a research psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who provided fresh insights into how the complex dynamics of family interactions might contribute to psychological illness, died in Washington on Dec. 3. He was 75.
        The cause was complications of hip surgery, said a colleague, Dr. Justin Frank.
        Dr. Shapiro was a former director of clinical services at George Washington University Medical Center. Before that, he was on the staff of the National Institutes of Health, directing the section on personality development in its adult psychiatry branch. At his death he was a supervising psychoanalyst at the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute. He had also maintained a private practice in Washington since moving there in 1957.
        Dr. Shapiro was known for his contributions to the psychoanalytic understanding of troubled families. A family, he contended, often subconsciously conspired to single out one of its members as ''sick.'' That person, usually one of the children, then bore the burden of illness, relieving other family members from having to take responsibility for their contributions to the family's difficulties.
        One task of family therapy, Dr. Shapiro contended, was to bring such collusion into the open so that the members could face and deal with it.
        Dr. Shapiro also developed methods of observing family interactions during therapy sessions. Those methods came to be used widely in training family therapists.
        Roger Lee Shapiro was born in Chicago, graduated from the University of Chicago and received his medical degree there.
        Before joining the staff of the National Institutes of Heath, he worked at the Tavistock Clinic in London, where he helped to develop psychological methods to study how groups function.
        He is survived by his wife, Dina Koston, a musician.
