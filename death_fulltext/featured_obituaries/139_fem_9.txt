        Aline Mosby, a former correspondent for United Press International who reported from Hollywood, Paris, Beijing and points between for more than 50 years, died on Aug. 7 at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido, Calif. She was 76 and had moved from Europe to the Silvergate retirement community in San Marcos, Calif., this year.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, the Associated Press reported from San Diego.
        Ms. Mosby, a native of Missoula, Mont., and a graduate of the University of Montana, joined United Press,  which later became U.P.I., in Seattle in 1943. She retired from the agency in 1984, but her freelance articles continued to appear in various publications, including the Travel section of The New York Times.
        She was one of the first women assigned to cover the Kremlin and, later, Beijing. While stationed in Moscow in 1959 she interviewed a self-exiled Lee Harvey Oswald, who described his upbringing and his embrace of Marx's socialism. She also interviewed Gary Powers, the downed U-2 pilot.
        Earlier in her career she reported Hollywood gossip, among other things. Her Hollywood column was credited with helping to propel Marilyn Monroe to stardom.
        Ms. Mosby is survived by a sister, Mary Jane Bader of Escondido.
