        Lester R. Tuchman, a New York internist, medical researcher and emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, died on Wednesday at his home in Cos Cob, Conn. He was 93.
        Dr. Tuchman retired in 1979 from private practice on the East Side.
        During his career, he published some two dozen academic papers on his research that, among other things, focused on Gaucher's disease, a rare metabolic disorder for which he devised a simple diagnostic test.
        Dr. Tuchman was born in the Bronx, and graduated from Columbia College and the College of Physicians and Surgeons. As an attending physician and clinical professor at Mount Sinai he taught, researched and, from 1954 to 1974, edited The Mount Sinai Journal of Medicine.
        He was married to Barbara Wertheim Tuchman, the historian, for nearly 50 years. She died in 1989.
        Dr. Tuchman is survived by their three daughters, Lucy T. Eisenberg of Los Angeles, Jessica T. Mathews of Washington and Alma H. Tuchman of Cos Cob; two sisters, Martha Froelich of Manhattan and Lucille Jaffe of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.
