        Duncan Pirnie, former chief announcer of WQXR, died on Sunday at Bergen Pines Hospital in Paramus, N.J. He was 70 and lived in Haworth, N.J.
        He had had a long illness, said Warren Bodow, president and general manager of WQXR-FM.
        After more than four decades with WQXR, the classical music station of The New York Times, Mr. Pirnie retired in 1987.
        He had one of the more distinctive voices on New York radio. And he had a wide following for his daily features, including "Montage" with its "Cocktail Time," and one of the station's longest-running programs, "Symphony Hall."
        He was born in Hanover, N.H. His family tree depicts him as a Mayflower descendant of William Brewster.
        He spent a year at Harvard University, where he received voice training and started his career on the Harvard Crimson Network. He arrived in New York in mid-1942 to become, at age 19, the youngest announcer on WQXR.
        The same year, he joined what now is the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He served on the board of its New York chapter from 1974 through 1988.
        Mr. Pirnie's survivors include his wife, Gertrude Meltz Pirnie; two daughters, Abby Pirnie of McLean, Va., and Judith Pirnie Smith of Dallas, and four granddaughters.
