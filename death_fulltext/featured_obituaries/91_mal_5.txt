        Francisco Bastar, a percussionist and band leader who performed under the name Kako and was best known for his advocacy of Puerto Rican rhythms and song forms, died on Saturday in Fort Worth. He was 58.
        The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Al Santiago.
        Mr. Bastar was born in San Juan, P.R. In the 1950's he performed with Arsenio Rodriguez and Alfarona X before forming his own band. He was a disciple of the great Puerto Rican band leader Cortijo and often toured with him. He also recorded with the singer and band leader Ismael Rivera and the trombonist and band leader Mon Rivera. Mr. Bastar was a major reason for the success of the Alegre All Stars, and he recorded or performed with the Puerto Rican All Stars, the Cesta All Stars and the Salsa All Stars.
        He occasionally fronted Tito Puente's band and worked with the master percussionist Machito in the late 1970's. But it was with his own bands that he made the biggest impression. He regularly used the bomba and plena rhythms in his music, rhythms that were specific to the black communities in Puerto Rico and as such often overlooked. Along with Cortijo and Ismael Rivera, he helped keep the rhythms in currency.
        Mr. Bastar recorded several Afro-Caribbean classics, including "Tribute to Noro Morales" (Alegre) and "Ritmos y Cantos Callejeros" (Ansonia).
        He is survived by a wife, Yolanda, and three sons, Paqui, Richie and David.
