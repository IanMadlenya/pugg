        Albert Gallatin Lanier, a retired editor and lawyer, died yesterday at New York University Hospital in Manhattan. He was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Wilton, Conn.
        He died after a lengthy illness, his family said.
        In 1946 Mr. Lanier became a partner in the law firm of Livermore & Lanier in Manhattan, where he specialized in trusts, estates and family law.
        In the 1930's, he worked in publishing for the Century Company in Manhattan and was the editor in chief of the St. Nicholas magazine for young people.
        His first wife, the former Margaret Paine Conant, died in 1962. His twin brother, Henry, a retired banker from New Haven, Conn., died about two weeks ago after a similar long illness.
        Mr. Lanier is survived by his wife of 25 years, the former Alison Raymond.
