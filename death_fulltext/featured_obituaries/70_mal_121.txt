        Dr. Giles Ternan MacIntyre, a high-school dropout with a Phi Beta Kappa key who was an expert on the evolution of mammals, died on Nov. 8 at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh. He was 66 years old and lived in Great Neck, L.I.
        He had gone to Pittsburgh for a liver transplant and died of liver failure, reported Queens College of the City University of New York, where he had first gone as an evening lecturer in 1959. The college announced the death yesterday.
        Dr. MacIntyre, a member of the biology department, specialized in mammalian paleontology, tracking the origin and development of major carnivores, including dogs.
        He was born in New Jersey. He dropped out of William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx to support his widowed mother. He then served in the Army, the Air Force and the Air Force Reserve, got a high-school equivalency certificate and graduated cum laude from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He joined the Queens College faculty full time in 1962.
        He was an associate professor, teaching both undergraduate and graduate courses, since 1969.
        Dr. MacIntyre's survivors include his wife, Dorothea; two daughters and a son from a previous marriage: Irene Winkler of Jericho, L.I., Alice MacIntyre of Seattle; Robert MacIntyre of Philadelphia, and two stepsons, Mark O'Connor and Robert Fuld, both of Manhattan.
