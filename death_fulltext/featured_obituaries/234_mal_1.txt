        Randy Walker, the only coach to lead Northwestern's football team to three bowl games, died Thursday night at his suburban Chicago home. He was 52.
        Walker died apparently of a heart attack after feeling chest pains around 10 p.m., said Mike Wolf, Northwestern's assistant athletic director.
        Walker took over the Northwestern football program in 1999 after going 59-35-5 in nine seasons at Miami University in Ohio. The Big Ten Conference's coach of the year in 2000, he was an assistant at North Carolina from 1978 to 1987 and was then the running backs coach at Northwestern in 1988 and 1989 before he became the coach at Miami of Ohio, his alma mater.
        A native of Troy, Ohio, Walker graduated from Miami in 1976 with a degree in social studies education. In 1981, he received a master's degree in education administration.
        As a fullback at Miami, he helped lead the team to records of 11-0, 10-0-1 and 11-1 in 1973, 1974 and 1975. He was named the team's most valuable player his senior season and was inducted into the Miami Hall of Fame in 1992.
        Walker was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League in 1976, but was released in training camp. He then returned to Oxford, Ohio, to help Miami as a graduate assistant.
        In August 2001, Northwestern defensive back Rashidi Wheeler collapsed and died at practice. His parents sued Northwestern, and after years of legal wrangling, the family was awarded a $16 million settlement in August.
        ''That was a very difficult time for Randy -- first of all having a player die, the media attacks,'' Northwestern's athletic director, Mark Murphy, said. ''As it dragged on, it became more and more difficult. To me, it really shows his resiliency, the strength of his character to make it through a situation like that.''
        Nick Roach, a senior linebacker, added at a news conference yesterday: ''For me, personally, he maybe saw stuff in me that I didn't see in myself. When I had my individual meetings with him, he wouldn't even talk a lot of football. It was more about me, and, 'How are you doing?' ''
        In October 2004, Walker was found to have myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle.
        ''I've really taken my doctor's orders to heart because, frankly, I want to see my grandkids someday,'' he told reporters at the time.
        Walker is survived by his wife, Tamara, and two children, Abbey, and Jamie, who is an assistant with the Northwestern football team.
