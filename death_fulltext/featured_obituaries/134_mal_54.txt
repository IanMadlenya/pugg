        William W. Goodrich, a lawyer and pioneering advocate of food and pharmaceutical safety procedures died Tuesday at Arlington Hospital in Arlington, Va., of complications from lymphoma. He was 82 and lived in Arlington.
        When Mr. Goodrich joined the forerunner of the Food and Drug Administration in 1938, then part of the Department of Agriculture, food had to be safe, pure and unadulterated. Drugs, too, had to be safe. His legacy at the agency is that they now have to be effective.
        He became chief counsel of the F.D.A. in 1952 under the Eisenhower Administration. In 1958 he argued Flemming v. Florida Citrus Exchange, which led to a unanimous Supreme Court decision that allowed the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare to ban coal tar color in oranges, after tests showed toxic effects on animals.
        In 1962 he wrote amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act of 1938, compelling companies that wanted to market prescription drugs to demonstrate that the drugs did what the companies claimed.
        Sanford A. Miller, director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition from 1979 to 1987, said Mr. Goodrich's influence loomed large even in the years after Mr. Goodrich's retirement from public service in 1971.
        He had a strong distaste for unnecessary fortifications in an era when potato chip makers added vitamins to chips as a marketing tool so they could be sold as nutritious.
        Mr. Goodrich was born in Marlin, Tex. He received his law degree from the University of Texas at Austin and moved to Washington in 1938. He married Mary Maud Moss in 1941. She died in 1991.
        He is survived by a son, William W. Goodrich Jr. of Falls Church, Va.; a daughter, Cynthia Kuhn of Falls Church, and five grandchildren.
