        Dr. Steer developed the electrohysterograph, which measures electrical activity in the uterus as a pregnant woman approaches labor. The device helps determine when a woman is in false labor and whether labor will be normal.
        Dr. Steer was born in Midvale, N.J. He graduated from Columbia College and received doctorates in medicine and medical science from the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Steer taught at the school for 36 years, working as acting chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology from 1968 to 1971 and retiring in 1982.
        In the Army in World War II he was a battalion surgeon and chief surgeon of a general hospital, rising to the rank of major.
        Survivors include his wife, the former Catherine Quinn; two daughters, Ann, of Weston, Mass., and Betsy Miller of Port Washington, L.I., and a brother, Robert, of Pompton Lakes, N.J.
