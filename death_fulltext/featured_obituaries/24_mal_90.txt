        At the time of his death, Mr. Michelson was chairman of the trustees of the security and pension plans of the Storeworkers Union. He had served as a health consultant to various unions, including District 65 of the United Automobile Workers.
        For many years, Mr. Michelson was a director of New York City's Health and Hospital Corporation. In the 1940's, as president of the Storeworkers Union Local 2 at Gimbel's and Sak's, he led strikes against the major New York City department stores that won a five-day work week for his members. He retired in 1985 as a vice president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, A.F.L.-C.I.O.
        He is survived by two daughters, Elana of Manhattan, and Pnina of Forest Hills, Queens; a brother, Burl, of Wyckoff, N.J.; a sister, Doris Loewi of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.
