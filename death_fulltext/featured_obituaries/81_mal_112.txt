        Scott Heiser, a photographer for Interview magazine and Paper magazine who was known for his surrealistic runway fashion shots in the late 1970's, died on Thursday at St. Luke's Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 44.
        The cause was pneumonia, said his mother, Mary G. Heiser.
        Mr. Heiser graduated in 1971 from the Rhode Island School of Design. At the school he met Marc Balet, who later became creative director of Interview magazine. In 1976 Mr. Heiser was hired to be a fashion photographer for the magazine.
        His runway photos were minimalistic, often blurry and wildly cropped, sometimes showing very little of the clothing on display. "The moment wasn't captured by Scott Heiser so much as fashioned by him," Mr. Balet said. Images of Staged Spectacles
        In 1984 he began working for Paper magazine, a new monthly, taking photographs for articles and starting his own photo page, called "Another Clue," which he continued until his death. The photographs were usually grainy, abstract images of such staged spectacles as circuses, parades, beauty pageants or military drill teams. He often photographed dogs and horses.
        His work was most recently in an exhibition at the Helander Gallery in SoHo called "Pet Show" and at the New York Public Library in a show called "New Acquisitions." From 1985 to 1988, he had exhibits sponsored by French Cultural Services.
        His photographs are included in the permanent collections at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of Fashion, the Museum of the City of New York, the Fashion Institute of Technology, the Brooklyn Museum and the New York Public Library.
        He is survived by his mother, of Wilmington, Del.
