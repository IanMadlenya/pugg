        Beryl Harold Levy, a retired lawyer, author and teacher of law and philosophy, died on Nov. 17 at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, L.I. He was 87 and lived in Babylon, L.I., said his family, who reported his death this  week.
        Professor Levy was a scholar in the works of the Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Nathan Cardozo and made the philosophy of law his special field. He retired as professor emeritus of philosophy from Hofstra University in 1976 but  continued to lecture in the department of philosophy at the New School for Social Research until 1984.
        He also taught at Columbia University and Western Reserve University.
        He was born in Brooklyn, and graduated from Columbia in 1929. He received a Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia in 1933 and a Columbia law degree in 1936.
        A member of the New York bar, he made his mark as an author in 1938 with "Cardozo and Frontiers of Legal Thinking" (Oxford University Press), a compendium of Justice Cardozo's ideas and opinions. "Our Constitution: Tool or Testament" (Knopf, 1941) was a collection of his essays on the country's basic law and its evolution through judicial interpretation.
        His most recent work was "Anglo-American Philosophy of Law: An Introduction to Its Development and Outcome" (Transaction Publications, 1990).
        Professor Levy is survived by his wife of 36 years, Phyllis Iorio Levy, and a daughter, Thea Levy of Babylon.
