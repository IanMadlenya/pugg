        James Kee, who served eight years in the House of Representatives from a district that had been represented by both his parents, died of lung disease Saturday at Montgomery General Hospital. He was 71 years old.
        His father, John, served from 1933 until his death in 1951. Then his mother, Elizabeth, served six terms. James was elected in 1964 after she stepped down. All were Democrats.
        The family's string of victories in the old Fifth Congressional District in southern West Virginia, heart of the state's coal industry, ended in 1972. Mr. Kee was defeated in the Democratic primary that year by another incumbent, Ken Hechler, after redistricting reduced the number of Congressional districts in the state from five to four and the two were forced to run against each other.
        Mr. Hechler accused Mr. Kee of not doing enough for miners in the district.
        James Kee is survived by his wife, Clara, and three daughters.
