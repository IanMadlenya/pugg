        Tadeusz Pankiewicz, a Polish pharmacist who was widely credited with helping Jews escape from Krakow in World War II, died there last Friday. He was 85.
        The cause was kidney failure, said his wife, Selena Pankiewicz.
        In 1941, Mr. Pankiewicz and other non-Jewish inhabitants of the ghetto in Krakow were ordered to leave, but he persuaded the Nazi administators to allow him to stay there so that he could continue selling medicine. His pharmacy evolved into a hiding place and a clearing house for escape information.
        Mr. Pankiewicz also created a secret vault under his pharmacy that was used to store Torahs and other religious artifacts. He is believed to have been the only Polish non-Jew to survive the destruction of the ghetto by the Germans in 1943. Wrote of Experiences
        His account of that time, "The Krakow Ghetto Pharmacy," which chronicled the two-and-a-half years the shop was open, was published in 1947, and reprinted in Israel and the United States. After the war, Mr. Pankiewicz was a prosecution witness at the Nuremberg trials.
        "Amongst all the survivors I interviewed, the name of Pankiewicz shone," Thomas Keneally said in a foreword to the English-language edition published in 1985 while he was doing research for "Schindler's List," his book about Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist who saved more than a thousand Jews in his factory in World War II.
        Mr. Pankiewicz was honored by Jewish organizations in Israel and the United States as among the quiet heroes of the era. After the war he returned to his work as a pharmacist, retiring about a decade ago.
        He is survived by his wife.
