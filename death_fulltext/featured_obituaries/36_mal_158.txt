        Ruskin Spear, who painted realistic and often satirical portraits of famous Britons, died on Tuesday at his home in the Hammersmith section of London after a short illness. He was 78 years old.
        Mr. Spear taught at the Royal College of Art from 1952 to 1977.
        Groups would gather round his works at the Royal Academy of Arts' annual summer exhibition, where Mr. Spear could be relied upon to produce an amusing portrait, sometimes uncommissioned and often controversial.
        Margaret Thatcher exclaimed: ''It's terrible! Let's get away from it as fast as we can,'' when she saw Mr. Spear's portrait of her, titled ''True Blue,'' before she became Prime Minister in 1979.
        Sir Winston Churchill said to him, ''Go away, you horrible man,'' after seeing his portrait by Mr. Spear.
        His commissioned work included portraits of the actor Laurence Olivier as Macbeth; Arthur Michael Ramsey, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, and the Conservative politician R. A. Butler.
        He is survived by a son, Roger.
