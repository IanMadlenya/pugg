        Cameron Mackenzie Jr., a retired writer and editor who helped to establish what is now the Discovery Museum in Bridgeport, Conn., died on Sunday at the Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. A former resident of Westport, he was 83 and lived in Brooklyn.
        The cause was emphysema complicated by pneumonia, his family said. He was in Iowa for the wedding reception of his son Angus.
        A native of Manhattan, Mr. Mackenzie graduated from Yale University in 1932, and was a staff writer for Architectural Forum and Time magazines.
        In World War II he spent three years in the Army and Army Air Force in Europe. Starting in 1951, Mr. Mackenzie worked for radio station WICC in Bridgeport and later as public-relations director for the Bridgeport Hydraulic Company. In the 1960's he directed the World Affairs Center in Westport.
        He was a founder and former director of the Museum of Arts, Science and Industry, chartered in 1958. Now known as the Discovery Museum, it ranks itself as the largest interactive arts-and-science museum between New York and Boston.
        In addition to his son Angus, of San Francisco, Mr. Mackenzie is survived by his wife, Anna DeCormis; another son, Jim, of Placitas, N.M.; two grandsons and a granddaughter.
