        Howard G. Sloane, a New York real estate executive who advised four administrations on trade issues, died Monday at New York Hospital after a brief illness, according to his son, Peter Sloane. He was 76.
        Mr. Sloane, who lived in Larchmont, N.Y., was an advocate of increasing exports. His pursuit of strategies that would improve the balance of trade brought him appointments from the Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Reagan administrations. He served on the executive committee of the President's Export Council during the first term of the Reagan Administration, and he traveled to Moscow in 1985 with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige for a meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, on trade issues.
        From 1949 until his death, Mr. Sloane was a trustee of the Heckscher Foundation for Children, where his wife, Virginia, is president.
        He was director of the International Management and Development Institute in Washington until his death. Mr. Sloane was also chairman of the board of Old Sturbridge Village, the American history museum in Sturbridge, Mass., from 1980 to 1984, and continued as a director until his death.
        In 1975, Mr. Sloane, as director of the New York Coliseum at Columbus Circle, unsuccessfully fought plans to build a new convention center on the West Side, predicting that it would take away so much trade-show business that the Coliseum would not remain viable.
        In addition to his wife and son, Mr. Sloane is survived by a daughter, Gail Meyers Hall of Miami, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
