        Evarts A. Graham, a former managing editor of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, died last Thursday at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis. He was 75 and lived in St. Louis.
        The cause was cancer, said his daughter Sarah Fuhrmann.
        Mr. Graham joined the Post-Dispatch as a reporter after graduating from Harvard University in 1941, but left to serve as an Army intelligence officer in World War II. He returned to the paper in 1946. He was the managing editor from mid-1968 to January 1979, when he became a contributing editor and columnist, first in St. Louis and then in Washington. He retired in 1985.
        His wife, Perugina (Peri) Adler, died in 1987.
        In addition to his daughter Sarah, of St. Louis, he is survived by another daughter, Helen, of Toronto; a brother, David, of Newark, Del., three grandchildren, and his companion, Martha Rudner.
