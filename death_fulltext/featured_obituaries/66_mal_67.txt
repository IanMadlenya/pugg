        Anthony Hass, a retired vice president for external development at the General Foods Corporation, died Monday at his home in Washington. He was 68 years old. Mr. Hass also had a home in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
        A native of Vienna, Mr. Hass was educated in England and in this country and graduated from Princeton University in 1944. He held a number of executive positions elsewhere before he joined General Foods in White Plains in 1969 to oversee its worldwide merger, acquisition and joint-venture activities. He left the company in 1988 to work in Manhattan as an adviser for the London-based Midland Bank's international clients in the food industry.
        Mr. Hass is survived by his wife of 35 years, the former Patricia Cary Cecil; two sons, Anthony, of Los Angeles, and John, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Elizabeth Hass of New York, and one granddaughter.
