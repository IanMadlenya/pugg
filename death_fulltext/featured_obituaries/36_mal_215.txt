        Leland Moss, a theater director known for ''The AIDS Show,'' died of AIDS on Wednesday at his home in San Francisco. He was 41 years old.
        With a group of writers, Mr. Moss helped conceive ''The AIDS Show,'' an acclaimed series of songs, monologues and short scenes that he directed in San Francisco in 1984. The production, which was updated with the new title, ''Unfinished Business,'' was also presented in other cities. A documentary about the play was made for public television and shown in November 1986.
        During his nine years in the Bay Area, Mr. Moss worked principally with the Theater Rhinocerous, a gay and lesbian theater, and was active in the city's gay movement. His own play, ''Quisbies,'' as well as other works that he directed, explored the effects of AIDS on the gay community.
        After studying at Harvard University and the London Academy of Music and the Dramatic Arts, Mr. Moss directed and acted in New York. He was a resident director at LaMama and Playwrights Horizons, and was an adviser to the New York Shakespeare Festival. Mr. Moss was also an assistant director to Andrei Serban in New York, and directed at a LaMama-sponsored theater extension in Cambridge, Mass., in the mid-1970's. His acting credits included playing five characters in the Broadway production of ''Yentl.''
        Mr. Moss is survived by his mother, Thelma Moss, and his sister, Pauli Moss, both of Los Angeles.
