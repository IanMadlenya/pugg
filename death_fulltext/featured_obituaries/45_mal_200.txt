        Robin Chu, a sociologist and a member of Parliament in Taiwan, died on Wednesday at the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan and in Taipei, customarily spending six months of the year in each city.
        He died of stomach cancer, his son, Franklin, said.
        Dr. Chu, who was born in Guangdong Province in China, was a graduate of Sun Yat-sen University. He came to the United States in 1956 to study and received a master's degree from Columbia and a doctorate from Cornell.
        He became a United States citizen in the 1960's and taught at Manhattan Community College. In the last two decades he devoted most of his academic work to sociological studies of Chinese communities in North America, publishing three books on the subject in Taiwan.
        Dr. Chu was elected to Parliament in 1988 and became chairman of its committee on overseas Chinese affairs. In New York he was a former chairman of the Chu Family Association, an influential group in the Chinese community.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Helen Mok; his son, who lives in Rye, N.Y.; three daughters, Nancy Chang of Brooklyn, Anna, of Montclair, N.J., and Mable, of Falls Church, Va.; a sister, Mary Lau of the Bronx; a brother, Chieh, of Brooklyn, and seven grandchildren.
