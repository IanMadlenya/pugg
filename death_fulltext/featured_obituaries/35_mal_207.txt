        Mr. Brown was the author of ''My Father's Business and Other Poems,'' published in 1956, which earned critical praise.
        Mr. Brown was born in Hartford and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard. He taught at the Loomis School in Windsor, Conn., where he had prepared for college, and at the Taft School in Watertown, Conn., before joining the faculty of Fieldston, in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, in 1938. He was later named dean of boys and, in 1966, Fieldston's principal.
        After his retirement in 1971 Mr. Brown continued to write poems and critical articles.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Boyle; a son, Tom, of Houston; a daughter, Margaret, of Manhattan; a sister, Frances Ellis of Brewster, Mass., and two grandchildren.
