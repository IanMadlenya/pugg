        Mr. Bennett had been president of Frank P. Bennett & Company, founded by his grandfather in 1887. During his tenure the magazine U.S. Investor merged with The Eastern Banker to become United States Banker. The company and the publication were later bought by Kalo Communications Inc., where Mr. Bennett worked until shortly before his death.
        He is survived by his wife, the former Betsy Tower; two sons, C. Randolph 3d, of Chicago, and Benjamin Tower of Irvington, N.Y.; and a sister, Sylvia Winton of Needham, Mass.
