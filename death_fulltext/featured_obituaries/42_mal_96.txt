        Jacob J. Alpern, an owner of the Grand Iron Works, once the largest fabricator and erector of structural steel in New York State, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86 years old. His family said he died of lung cancer.
        Grand Iron Works was founded on Manhattan's Lower East Side in 1904 by Mr. Alpern's father, Emil, an emigrant from Kiev, Russia. The family lived above the first shop on Grand Street, from which the company's name derived.
        The company later moved to the Bronx. Mr. Alpern and his brother, Bernard, ran the business from the mid-1930's until it closed in 1984.
        Mr. Alpern was a founder of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and a donor of the Mary Alpern and Nettie Halpern Pavilion at Mount Sinai Medical Center, named for his first wife, who died in 1969.
        Mr. Alpern is survived by his second wife, the former Gertrude Silverman; a daughter, Laura Pinzur of White Plains; a son, Edward, of Eugene, Ore.; his brother, who lives in Manhattan, and four grandchildren.
