        Dr. Arthur H. Gladstein, an authority on the use of radiation in dermatology, died on Monday at New York University Medical Center. He was 72 and had homes in Searingtown, L.I., and on the Upper East Side.
        The cause was cancer, said his son, Dr. Michael J. Gladstein, a dermatologist who shared an office with his father in Astoria, Queens.
        The elder Dr. Gladstein was the inventor of the Gladstein eye shield, used in treating cancer of the eyelids.
        He was born in Brooklyn, received B.A. and M.D. degrees from N.Y.U. and served for a time as an Army doctor in Korea. At his death he had been a professor of clinical dermatology for 20 years at the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine.
        In addition to his son Michael, of Muttontown, L.I., he is survived by his wife of 43 years, the former Roslyn Guttenberg; a daughter, Dr. Deborah Ancona of Boston, whose Ph.D. is in organizational behavior; a brother, Jerome Gladstein of Maitland, Fla., and three grandchildren.
