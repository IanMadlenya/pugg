        Joseph Mirachi, a cartoonist and illustrator whose work appeared in The New Yorker, Playboy and other publications, died on Sunday at Dover (N.J.) General Hospital. He was 71 years old and lived in Sparta, N.J.
        He died of prostate cancer, his family said.
        Mr. Mirachi, a native of Manhattan, began drawing for The New Yorker in 1954. The magazine printed 574 of his cartoons, many of them on battling husbands and wives, the revelations of barroom regulars and the unwitting confessions of avaricious businessmen.
        After military service in World War II, he attended the Art Students League, of which he was a trustee from 1951 to 1953.
        He is survived by a daughter, Mary McMillan, of Henderson, Nev.; three sons, Jon, of Newton, N.J., Joseph Jr., of Teaneck, N.J., and Robert, of Henderson, and four grandchildren.
