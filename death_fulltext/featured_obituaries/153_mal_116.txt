        Dr. George Edward Valley Jr., an emeritus professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped build the country's radar defenses and was Chief Scientist of the Air Force, died on Oct. 16 at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He was 86 and lived in Concord, Mass.
        In World War II, while he was at the M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory, Dr. Valley developed an aspect of radar that allowed the Allies to bomb their targets in all weather conditions. He was a member of the Air Force's  Scientific Advisory Board from 1946 to 1964, and that involvement led to the creation in 1949 of M.I.T.'s Lincoln Laboratory, of which he was a founder and an associate director.
        Dr. Valley helped design equipment for the Distant Early Warning  radar line across the Arctic. He was Chief Scientist of the Air Force in 1957-58.
        At the Lincoln Laboratory, in Lexington, Mass., he was involved in advanced computer technology, including the magnetic core memory and the transmission of digital data by telephone.
        Born in New York, he graduated from M.I.T. in 1935 and earned a Ph.D. at the University of Rochester in 1939. He started as an optical engineer at Bausch & Lomb, taught briefly at Rochester and Harvard and joined the staff at the M.I.T. radiation laboratory in 1941 as a project supervisor. He attained emeritus status in 1978.
        Dr. Valley is survived by his wife of 39 years, Shea Alice LaBonte Valley; two sons and a daughter from an earlier marriage, Dr. George C., of Los Angeles, Dr. John W., of Madison, Wis., and Katharine V. Nakamoto of Winchester, Mass., and four grandchildren. His previous marriage, to Louisa King Williams, ended in divorce.
