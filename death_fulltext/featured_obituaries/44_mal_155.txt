        Harry Palevsky, one of the early researchers in nuclear physics who helped to develop the atomic bomb, died Monday at Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, Calif. He was 71 years old and lived in Ojai, Calif.
        Mr. Palevsky died of cardiovascular disease, said a daughter, Catherine Longley.
        A native of Chicago, Mr. Palevsky was a graduate of Northwestern University, with a master's degree in physics from the University of Illinois. From 1942 to 1945, he was an engineer at Los Alamos, N.M., working on the the development of the first atomic bomb.
        In 1950, he joined Brookhaven National Laboratory, from which he retired as a senior scientist in 1982. During his early career, his research in low-energy physics illuminated the ultimate nature of matter by showing the behavior of a rare type of helium at a temperature close to the absolute zero (minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit).
        He was an editor of Nuclear Physics Journal and was active in the Federation of American Scientists. He was a delegate to the Geneva Atoms for Peace Conferences in 1955 and 1957.
        A widower, he is survived by three daughters, Ann Miles of Manhattan, Ms. Longley of Brunswick, Me., and Mary Grandados of Oak View, Calif.; two sons, Alan of Wayland, Mass., and Nicholas of Richfield Springs, N.Y.; a sister, Helen Futterman of Tarzana, Calif.; a brother, Max of Beverly Hills, Calif., and three grandchildren.
