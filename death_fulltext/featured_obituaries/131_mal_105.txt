        Denver Pyle, a television and film actor known for his roles as a wise Southern uncle on ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' and a melodic mountain man on ''The Andy Griffith Show,'' died Thursday in Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, Calif. He was 77.
        Mr. Pyle was suffering from lung cancer. Born in a Colorado ranch town of 40 people, Mr. Pyle enjoyed an acting career that spanned four decades by playing character roles in film and television programs primarily set in the South or old West. In the latter stage of his career, Mr. Pyle was best known for his portrayal of Uncle Jesse on the CBS television show ''The Dukes of Hazzard'' from 1979 to 1985. His trademark was his white hair and a scraggly beard.
        After growing up in Bethune, Colo., Mr. Pyle briefly attended Colorado State University. In 1940, he moved to Los Angeles and joined the Navy. He was wounded off Guadalcanal in World War II and received a medical discharge in 1942.
        While working at an aircraft plant in Los Angeles, Mr. Pyle had his first role in a play. He went on to study acting and made his film debut in ''The Guilt of Janet Ames'' in 1947. In television, he appeared in Western series like ''The Roy Rogers Show'' from 1951 to 1964, ''Bonanza'' in 1964, and ''Gunsmoke'' from 1956 to 1964.
        From 1960 to 1968, Mr. Pyle played Briscoe Darling, a singing mountain man on ''The Andy Griffith Show.'' He also appeared on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show'' in 1963 and played Doris Day's father on ''The Doris Day Show'' from 1968 to 1970. Mr. Pyle, who also directed television programs, played Mad Jack in the the NBC series ''The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams'' in 1977 and 1978. Mr. Pyle appeared in a ''Dukes of Hazzard'' reunion movie last April.
        He also appeared in numerous films, including ''The Alamo'' in 1960, ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance'' in 1962, ''Shenandoah'' in 1965, ''Bonnie and Clyde'' in 1967, and ''Bandolero'' and ''Five Card Stud'' in 1968.
        He is survived by his wife, Tippy, whom he married in 1983 and two sons, David of Newport Beach, Calif., and Tony of San Clemente, Calif.
        Mr. Pyle was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame only two weeks ago and attended the ceremony despite his illness. According to The Los Angeles Daily News, he reminisced about his first visit to Hollywood with his brother Willie.
        ''Willie pointed out the stars to me and said, 'Someday you'll be part of this street,' '' Mr. Pyle said. ''I didn't know it then, but I guess I am now. I'll see you down the road.''
